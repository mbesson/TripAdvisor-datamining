The bridge is also conveniently located on the side of Terminal 1 where the airport train goes to Terminal 2, so it's convenient for that terminal also. Friendly staff, efficient service, good food, reasonable price. But the public areas, carpets, furniture are looking in need of renovation. It was clean and quiet, bedding was comfortable. Several English t.v. channels including CNN. The wifi in the room was not free, but was fast. Nice shampoos and amenities in the bathroom. Convenience store shops nearby inside the airport terminal, I believe some are open 24 hours. You have to ask for a minibar key at check in. I arrived as a distressed passenger due to Avianca flights being typically late, and at 10 pm, there was quite a long line for checkin, and I expect they are full many nights. There is a Hilton Hotel directly inside Terminal 1, which looked more modern but I didn't get to see the inside. It looked like there was also a hotel inside Terminal 2 (Aeromexico, Delta, Lan), but I also didn't go inside that. Even at the last minute, the price I paid was reasonable for the convenience and overall quality. There is also a bus shuttle which is free, that goes to Terminal 2, which is a bit more convenient with luggage than taking the free Airport train. If you're between flights for a day, it's not a bad place to stay, as you can go into Mexico City by taxi, not too far away, but you probably won't want to make the trek more than the one day in one day. No frequent flyer mileage credit with any program other than Aeromexico.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFar better than I expected....\u201d", "Author": "KenRichMun", "ReviewID": "UR125624030", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Camino Real in the Mexico City airport on 2 separate nights - once on the way to Costa Rica, and once on the way back (layovers). Because I have seen way too many movies I had a very strange idea of what to expect with this hotel and the airport itself. I am glad to report that I was very wrong in both aspects. First off - the hotel is located just off of Terminal 1 at Gate (Sala) B which is pretty much near the end of the airport. As soon as you get through customs just go out into the main area (and behold the huge amount of airport police with bright orange hats and not a single person hassling you) and hang a left. Eventually make your way to the upper level and just keep on walking. Through the windows you will eventually see the huge Camino Real looming just across the street. Take the bright covered walkway over to the hotel and there you are. I had our confirmation #'s handy but giving my last name was good enough. Signing in took less than a minute and we were on our way. The lobby of the hotel is pretty nice and the hotel has a comforting feel to it. The carpets and the elevators and the hallways could use a bit of sprucing up but the rooms themselves were perfect - very clean, super soft beds, large pristine bathrooms - I was nicely surprised considering how some the reviews weren't all that positive. Mind you, on one of the TV channels in the hotel rooms there is this non-stop loop of various Camino Real hotels - and a bunch of them look amazing......quite luxurious in fact so if someone frequented these 5-star Camino Reals and then stayed at this airport one I could see them being a little bummed - but I never have so I wasn't! Anyways, my wife and I ate at one of their restaurants - I don't recall the name of it but it was a little bit of a walk away from the lobby/bar area and resembled a cafeteria - food was pricey and gross. Follow other reviewers advice and just eat at places in the terminal (they have 2 'wings' restaurants 50 feet apart which I found kind of funny). There are a bunch of choices. So other than the worn carpets/walls and the unsavoury restaurant book your overnight at the Camino Real rather than the Hilton, it's totally worth it. Also note that there are a ton of other hotels just a few minutes outside of the airport grounds (Camino Real and Hilton are essentially part of the airport). I believe a few of the nearby hotels offer free shuttle service. If I ever pass through Mexico City airport again and have to stay overnight this will be the place - $130 well spent.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "susanned", "ReviewID": "UR125569766", "Content": "Huge elegant lobby, beautiful rooms, very comfortable beds, great bathroom, good price.

We have never experienced this before in any restaurant unless there was entertainment, but there was none. We signed the check to our hotel room and were walking out when just outside the door, in front of several people, the waiter stopped us and said something about not paying the bill. We showed him our room key which matched the bill we signed and he seemed satisfied. However, when we were passing the front desk, a restaurant hostess stopped us, waving the bill and saying that we had no credit at the hotel. Apparently the hotel had forgotten to ask us for a credit card on registering and did not okay the charge, a mistake on the part of the hotel. A very heated and very public conversation then occured after which the restaurant agreed to cancel the cover charge and the hotel agreed to accept the charge. Later the hotel apologized but the resuarant did not. We were very embarassed by being stopped twice, publicly as though we were common thieves. We are experienced travellers and have stayed at this hotel at least 10 times before during trips between Mexicoa and Canada. I don't think we will again. In addition to the embarrasing restaurant experience, we noted that the maintenance has gone down.

The hotel is very convenient to the airport - a short shuttle ride from Terminal 2 or a bridge that connects to Terminal 1. When you walk into the hotel though, you are overwhelmed by a smell of mold and chemicals. The rooms are very dated and the smell is worse - damp, moldy, with a chemical cleaning smell on top of it. I switched rooms 3 times - the first room I tried to live with, but after being in there for 30 minutes, my throat hurt from the chemical smell. The 2nd room was just as bad. Finally the 3rd room was bearable, but still noticeable. The furnishings are horribly dated - feels very 1970s. Pillows are flat, sheets worn, old tube style TV, etc. The bathroom of the first room was very small, and the faucets turned on easily but were then hard to turn off. 3rd room bathroom was bigger and faucet functioned. Unlike the previous reviewer, I had hot water, but little water pressure. My alarm clock was broken - the numbers displayed in nonsense form and you couldn't shut it off, nor could you unplug it b/c it was wired to the wall. So I had to turn the volume down low and put a pillow on top to block the static noise. I asked for it to be replaced but it never was. Luckily the wakeup calls were reliable, and even came twice- once from a computer and once from a human. The internet system is EXTREMELY frustrating and expensive. ($20 US for 24 hrs) They have no wireless in the rooms - so you have to call downstairs to the business center. They will bring you a cable and a login/password for the internet. Even once you have the cord, you still have to call down for the code once your time expires. The code has to be brought to you on a card that you sign for. Very frustrating to have to wait 15-20 minutes for the card to arrive when you just want to hop on line to check email. For a business hotel, this is nothing but silly. When I pushed them to give me the code on the phone, the staff member put me on hold and never came back (TWICE this happened!). The rooms either overlook the airport or slums in the back. Breakfast buffet was ok but expensive ($25 US) for what it was. Business colleague had her car in valet and when we needed to get it out, it was a huge process that took 45 minutes. I will say that the staff (other than the internet guy who put me on hold and never came back), was very polite and friendly, and were very accomodating at switching my room, etc. That's really the only positive thing I can say about this place.

They never tell you that. 2) Hotel taxis are a ripoff charging four times that of conventional fares; get your taxi just behind the hotel by walking through the bus depot via a right turn at the sky bridge and follow to the rear of the hotel. 3) Hotel food is very expensive. Great taco stand also located behind the hotel with cheap food; Mexicana stewardesses routinely eat here, so I figured it had to be healthy and good. It was. 4) Sky bridge allows easy access to the airport shops and eateries; suggest you avoid eating at the hotel and if you want a burger at Burger King for the kids, go to the airport.

After 30 minutes of virtually no advancement in the line up, I decided to go to the front and request to talk to the manager, I told her that this was non acceptable and that this has been the worst checkin experience of my whole life and I travel quite a lot through Europe, Asia, and North America. She was nice enough to say that they were doing all they could to expedite the process and that the reason that the line up was so long was that an unexpected flight was arriving, however I looked back on the line and there were well above 50 people waiting.

The fitness center is big, but the pool is really too shallow like a Jacuzzi. The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide bottled water because they claim their water is safe from the tap. The only major problem I had is the remote control and TV. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to connect too well. The foreign (satellite) channels suffer frequently reception problem. Seems like the airplane landing and take off affect the reception. I requested for a room facing the airport since I enjoy plane spotting.

The alarm clock was missing in the second room, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to ask for one. The biggest advantage for staying at the airport hotel was that you could drop by the 7-11, food court, or internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 at the terminal when you have nothing to do at night.

I have no doubt that part of this is because their 15% gratuity is automatically added to all tickets... but that's still no excuse. We arrived exhausted and hungry from Cuernavaca and this was the only place still open where we could grab a quick bite of food... it took forever and we practically had to chase down our waitress to get anything.

It connected to the domestic terminal by a \"sky bridge\" that leads directly into the hotel lobby. There is a bellman in the airport to help with luggage. It is also right on Circuito Interior (Rio Consulado) which makes getting to just about anywhere in or around Mexico City pretty easy. And, this is about all of the good that I can say about this hotel. Camino Real took over this hotel early in 2004 from Marriott. I had stayed once here when it was a Marriott and wrote a comment into Marriott that it was the worst Marriott that I had ever stayed at. My guess is that they received other many similar comments and that's why it is no longer a Marriott. Quite honestly, the service at this hotel is pretty good. I ate in one of the restaurants, ordered room service, and used the front desk several times. All of the staff was helpful and friendly. Everyone spoke English well enough. What is bad about this hotel is that it appears...shabby and not very well kept up. Sitting in my room (312) writing this, I think I have had better \"looking\" rooms at most motels that I have stayed at. It just looks dull and drab and I think that makes it easy for me to give this property a poor review. The carpet looks like it is in dire need of steam cleaning. The view from my room is onto the cooling system for the hotel. Besides the decor of the room, it lacks the one thing that is now essential in any hotel room, a high speed internet connection. Not only is there not one in the room, there is not one in the hotel, if you need to connect your laptop. There are a few computers in the business center that have broadband access, but that's it. In late 2004, this is just not reasonable for a business traveler. What else good can I say about this hotel? The beds were pretty comfortable. My room was cleaned and serviced well, which only shows up in the bathroom. I wish I had brought a level with me because I swear that this hotel is tilting. I could be wrong, but it is especially noticeable in the halls to me. The walls, floor, and ceiling just seem to be \"out of kilter.\" The lobby area is not something that I typically care about, but the lobby at this hotel is dark, and the carpet is badily worn. The \"sky bridge\" connecting the hotel to the airport is both better decorated and in better condition. There are four (or five) restaurants at the hotel, but two of them don't seem to be operated by the hotel. I had dinner La Huerta Cafe one evening and while the food was good, the ambiance offset the good food. It is just a dull, unimaginative restaurant. The two not run by the hotel seem to be much \"nicer.\" I would have had diner at one of them, but I did not see them until I had already had dinner. I have stayed at other Camino Real hotels and they are have been beautiful properties. I hope they will either completely renovate this one or take their name off of it.
