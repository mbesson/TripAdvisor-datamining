{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved this hptel We stayed at the Hotel Royal in 2007 and I was just reading the reviews out of curiosity and am amazed that the hotel has received such poor reviews. We went out of season so the cost was reasonable - \u62e260 per night for a double including breakfast. We thought the hotel was lovely andthe staff very friendly. The town centre was walking distance. I used to live in Florence and now work in tourism and for \u62e260 per night I thought this was excellent value for money. Spotlessly clean, ok so the bar wasn't brilliant, but we had a drink, breakfast wasn't brilliant but we ate and we didn't have a car so didn't need to pay for parking. I would definitely stay there again - the hotel is beautiful and old and Florentine and typical.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR617286835", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "diggydoo"}, {"Content": "Do not stay in Hotel Royal, Florence I booked a single room for 5 days at the Hotel Royal in Florence. The price of the single room was 200$. I was staying to Florence for a conference. I did not have much time available.Disappointment no1: I arrived at the hotel late in the evening. When I saw the room, I was so surprised! The room was literally 2x2 square meters. It was like a wardrobe. It was extremely small and the window was like a small hole in the wall. I could not believe my eyes! So, I went to the reception and asked them if they had a double room available.Disappointment no2: The reception was very rude. He gave me the key of the room and he commanded me: \u9225\u6965heck the room and bring the key back to me immediately!\u9225?br/>Disappointment no3: This double room was bigger and its price was 270$. I decided to stay. I thought of working on my computer for a while before going to sleep. At my surprise, I noticed that there was no socket to charge my computer!Disappointment no4: I thought then, that I could read instead. I took my book but.... there was no bed-sit lamp next to the bed.Disappointment no5: I said to myself that everything was fine. I needed to call my partner to inform that I had arrived safely in Florence and to tell him how horrible Hotel Royal was. I tried to call but there was no signal. I called the reception to ask what is digit for calling numbers abroad and he did not know. I tried every possible combination and I did not finally manage, leaving my partner worrying.Disappointment no6: I decided to go to sleep. I could not sleep because the light of the street was getting into the room.Disappointment no7: Also, there was a lot of noise from the street, even though I requested a quite room.Disappointment no8: After several hours, I managed to get some sleep. In the morning, I went downstairs to get my breakfast. It was horrible. They did not even have fresh coffee! It was all a joke.Disappointment no9: I decided to stay as I did not have the courage and time to start looking for another hotel. My only concern was my mother who was going to stay with me 2 days in that terrible place. I informed the reception about her arrival.My mother came and she stayed 1 night in my room. When I was about to leave the hotel the next morning, the reception tells me that the charges are higher now that my mother came and she randomly quoted the room for 310$.It was then that I flipped! They wanted more money but they did not even bother to bring a second towel for my mother! (They only provide 1 towel).I expressed my disagreement to the reception who instead of listening to what I had to say, she was replying back to me. After staying 3 nights, I packed my suitcase and I went to another hotel!So, in summary, do not stay in Hotel Royal in Florence!1. The staff is very rude2. The rooms do not have sockets to charge your phone/computer3. The rooms do not have a set of towels4. The rooms do not have bed-sit lamps5. The rooms are very noisy especially those looking at the parking of the hotel.6. The rooms do not always have telephone that works7. The breakfast is ridiculous8.

We stayed in Florence for 2 nights and decided to book the Hotel Royal because of the private parking and the good location to the historical city. The hotel looks like a little palace with a big garden, swimmingpool an private parking. The rooms are very clean, beautiful and quiet. Everything seems to be perfect except the staff and the breakfast! The whole staff was very unfriendly! The breakfast was an ordinary breakfast and not a buffet. You could not take seat in summer at the beautiful terrace in the inside garden to eat your breakfast. But if you would prefer to sit outside in the sun you had to pay Euro 5!!!! Also you had to pay Euro 15 to use the swimmingpool! The fee for the parkingspace was about Euro 20 per day and - you had to pay it on arrival not together with the hotel bill.

A taxi must drive you up in front, ours left us in the middle of the road? Plus you should not give any tip to the taxi driver since the price was included. We had to take a cab lots of time because it is FAR from the main tourist attraction (Ponte Vechio ect). People are not to smilly at the front desk. The breakfast stop being served at 9:30 so we mist it then we ask where we should go close arround...well they didn't know???The room is small and the beds are awful. Both our twin beds were tipping on one side, not very comfortable to sleep on it because you think you are going to fall off the bed during your sleep.The inside is very very dark and quite old with antiques every where you look.But Florence is just so beautiful to visit, but 2 days would be enough. Then we took the train for Venice because the train station is not a walking distance from this Hotel believe me. So we took a Taxi 14 euros worth every penny.

Hotel fails to indicate a hefty charge of 12 euros per person, per visit to pool for swimming or sunbathing. Having already paid City prices for our booking we did not feel inclined to pay more for a facility which is usually included - unless it is part of a hotels fitness centre. This meant that the pool was only used by two children in the two days we were there.

Let me try to explain exactly what happened to make it so bad1. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that we hadn\u9225\u6a9b booked! The manager seemed very put out that he had to check his emails for our Internet booking.2. We were sent to our room, which was, when we got there full of people, plumbers and housemaids. The toilet was dissembled and the door was off its hinges!3. We booked a double room but we received a twin room and no apology or explanation!4. After about ten minutes in the room the manager came to our door and told us we had to go to a different room. He did not apologise just told us where the new room was!5. After about five minutes in this new room he came to the door again and told us we had to go back to the original room, again no apology.6. 20 minutes later he told us that there was something wrong with the plumbing and we were not allowed to use the shower! And if we really had to we should be really quick! And not make a mess (they had also taken our shower curtains)7. The following day we went out for lunch and when we got back we met the manager who greeted us with \u9225\u6e2ce two are in big trouble\u9225?he told us that somebody had stuffed nappies down the toilet and we couldn\u9225\u6a9b use our bathroom! So he was moving us to another new room, again he didn\u9225\u6a9b think of saying sorry!8. When we got to the new room we discovered it was a small single room, with one pillow and one towel. So we rang down to reception asking for extras, only to be told he will give us them the next time we go down! Madness. 9. When it came to checking out we asked for a reduction due to all the problems, he explained to us that Florenceby prices were old and out of date (\u9227?30), and we actually got a very good deal \u9227?0 cheaper than it should be.

The room has a safe - which we did not use btw -, minibar, tv and a bathtub with a shower in it. It is possible to take a shower standing in the bathtub. The bed (matras) was comfortable. We slept very well and same for my parents. It was unusuably cold in florence (snow!), but the heating in the hotel and rooms worked fine.The hotel is located in the less touristic northern part of the center. It is in walking distance from the center. Even my parents (72+73 years old) could walk to San Marco, San Lorenzo, the Duomo and the ponte Vecchio which is one straight line following the Via San Gallo straight into the center), athough not as fast as we did. I think we walked in 8-10 minutes to San Lorenzo and Duomo. The advantage of the hotel location is that the prices are lower than in the heart of the touristic center. When comparing hotel prices and their location you could consider taking a daily taxi to the center (10 euro to the ponte Vecchio) and still save money compared to a more expensive hotel in the heart of the center. Also the restaurants are less expensive here. We especially liked the Trattoria da Tito on the Via San Gallo 112 (a short walk in Northen direction). The owners are very very hospitable, the food is excellent and very affordable (I saw a picture of Pavarotti dining here and a famous Italian actor whose name I forgot). You are really between the Italians here! We had 3 times diner and without asking were offered a free digestive. On our last night we received a free bottle of wine. I wish I was back here! The hotel Royal staff is very friendly. When we arrived in the hotel we immediately received a detailed map of Florence with explanation where to find the most important sites. The hotel reserved tickets for us for both Academia and Uffizi so that we did not have to wait in the long queue and could get into both museums almost directly.To our regret my mother had a flu and was ill for 3 days. The staff was very concerned about her well being, cleaned the room at her convenience and also offered to call a doctor at night. We were also offered a thermometer without asking.Breakfast was relatively simple but ok. The only point for improvement for me was that the breakfast servant could be a little bit more hospitable, but the work was well done.Particular nice for us in this family hotel was that the owners had lived in Holland for some years and spoke Dutch very well. This was especially nice for my parents who do not speak foreign languages that well. I hope this helps. Next time I will take this hotel again. Also by car is convenient as there is lot of space for car parking, which is unusual in the city center.I definitely enjoyed my stay here and hope/wish you will do as well.Kind regards,Fam.
