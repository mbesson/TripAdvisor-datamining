You could walk the short distance to \"The Strip\" but Wyndham provides a shuttle bus that runs continually until 10 p.m.They have arrangemnets with another shuttle if youu should choose to stay later. You can purchase an all day bus ticket by the bus stops for $7 and ride for 24 hours. We rented a car for 2 days. The rental company came to the resort to pick us up.

As has been stated in previous reviews, this is a timeshare property and while you do not have daily housekeeping (personally, I don't mind not being awakened each morning by the sound of housekeeping knocks and carts creaking down the hall -- especially if staying just a few days), but there are washer/dryer in each unit and I loved being able to have clean clothes to unpack when I returned home. Speaking of the washer and dryer, they are LOUD, as are the dishwasher and the heating/cooling unit. The issue of sound proofing would be my only negative comments, which would also include one's neighbors, especially if you are in a unit that has a connecting apartment. We (party of 2) were in the smallest unit (1 bedroom suite) and it was perfectly suited for us. Although the cooking area is noted as a \"kitchenette\", it does have all the conveniences of the larger units: stove/oven, microwave, blender, etc., just in a smaller space. Also, if you have an early flight, plan on a lengthy wait to check into your unit (unless it's during low occupancy). We arrived at 11am, and were not able to check in until 2 pm, which was still 2 hours before official, so we weren't complaining. We knew ahead of time and brought something to keep us occupied. They also stored our luggage, so not a big hassle. Although there are a few bellmen, don't expect the prompt service you'd get at a conventional hotel; there are three separate \"towers\", and if not in the main one (tower II), it can be a bit of a hassle getting your baggage to your unit. The property is located a few blocks from The Strip, and though there were some that walked the distance (approximately 15 - 20 minutes), Wyndham offers a complimentary shuttle until 10pm that takes you to Harrah's (neighbors to Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Venetian, the Wynn) and back. The Rio shuttle is also available for transportation back to Wyndham until midnight, but there are specific details you'll need to get from the front desk. This service allows for enjoying the hustle and bustle of the casinos, shopping, shows, people watching, etc. that exists on the main drag, and then returning to the tranquility of a virtually smoke-free (inside areas), family friendly environment. Which brings me to why I'd recommend this location, whether travelling with children or not. The activities center contains a video game area with multiple stations including a Wii setup, foosball, pingpong, pool table and multiple board games and DVDs for complimentary check out to your unit. Across the hall is also a computer room (ages 16 & up) with complimentary internet and printing services. Outdoor recreation includes three pools (one adults only) & hot tubs that are well proportioned and situated for single or family relaxation. Although the resort was at full capacity (spring break), neither the pools nor the indoor areas were overly crowded, and elevator wait times were reasonable. Others have noted the lack of suitable restaurant facilities, which is true. I didn't try anything from the cafe, so I can't comment on what they do offer; there is also a Starbucks cart in the mornings, and a bar off the lobby. We prepared breakfasts and snacks in our unit (shuttle bus - $4- to the grocery store a few times a week; show your Wyndham key for the advertised specials), and ate in a couple restaurants (excellent surf & turf at Embers in the Imperial Palace) on the strip. After getting the bill at the end of each meal, we welcomed the option of cooking, especially if we had traveled with kids. One thing I think the Wyndham should consider to make the most of their location and appeal to families is to offer a childcare service - in particular at night when parents might want to take in a late show or night entertainment. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay because we had the best of both worlds -- as much action & entertainment as we wanted close by, and the comforts/convenience of home at Grand Desert.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable service, comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Saabi13", "ReviewID": "UR127631911", "Content": "My husband along with our 9 month old daughter and another couple stayed in a 2 bedroom suite in Tower 3 of the Wyndham Grand Desert. Our view was very nice, facing Planet Hollywood and Paris on the Strip. The room was very clean, nicely decorated and quite comfortable. We did have an issue with the fuse constantly burning out in the Master Bedroom but the staff was very quick to respond. This resort is about a 7-8 minute walk from the strip but they offer shuttle services to Harrahs which was very convenient. Only one complaint I would have is the on premise deli/coffee shop could stand to stay open longer. There's one particular incident which occurred at the resort and the way it was handled is what makes me want to recommend this resort as a must stay for everyone.... We had just come to the lobby to take the shuttle and as we were heading towards the shuttle to board, the driver drove away. We called out after it, and luckily for us the security guard, a limo driver and the Manager of the resort itself happened to be there to witness what had just happened. They too tried chasing down the shuttle but to no avail. Needless to say they were very upset, especially the Manager considering we had a baby with us....right away the limo driver and manager offered the limo service to us for the remainder of our trip and we actually did not end up using the shuttle after that! The service at this resort is something I have never experienced. I have stayed at other places where the service has been good and staff friendly but NOTHING compares to our experience at the Wyndham Grand Desert.

It is a lovely place, and if it fits your needs I highly recommend it. We don't come to Vegas often, nor do we stay very long - so I prefer a more Strip centered property, where I can pop out and grab a Starbucks in the AM, an ice cream in the PM, and more easily get a break from the crowds mid day. I don't use the pool or other family facilities (and sure don't come here to cook!) so the very nicest aspects of this property are wasted on me.

There is a tour desk there that is specifically designated for this and can save you more money than booking at the casino or general box office. Additionally if you book a dinner and show through them they provide limo service. This is a time share resort.

Unlike when you stay in a hotel, you always have to put up with the crowd. Best attractions or restaurants nearby: I found the food in the strips and hotel pricey. I guess you can't expect nothing else from a tourist spot. The seafood buffet at the RIO is pretty good, for $40.00 per head and a lot of selection, you cannot go wrong. The buffet at MGM Grand is pretty good as well. Here is the thing that I found out about the buffet at MGM, you can pay once and you can come back again for the rest of the day.

After doing my usual internet research, I came across the Wyndham Grand Dessert due to it's proximity to the Convention Center and The Strip. After a few email exchanges with the Rental Consultant ( who I can recommend privately), we decided to book a 2 Bedroom Deluxe unit. It was a long haul trip for us and we were all looking forward to a cozy place to acclimatize before we get down to business. And I can say is that the 12 hour flight was all worth it when we arrived at Wyndham Grand Dessert. From the appearance of the building, the ease at registration and most of all the room itself. We were amazed at how it made us feel so much at home and more! And to think that I was a bit apprehensive when we were told that our unit is at Tower 3. Every question regarding the place that I had earlier were answered upon seeing the place up close. The unit had everything that made our 7 day stay very comfortable. I'd say the only thing missing was the guard dog. But I think the facility's security was able to handle that when the younger guests across our unit were making a ruckus probably from a late night trip down the Strip. The proximity of the place was also a big plus. Less than 10 minutes away from the Convention Center, the Strip and the airport. Parking was free and ample. Free wi-fi kept us in touch with work and family. Although I must admit the connection was a lot faster in the ground floor Business Center of the building. I don't gamble and I don't drink.

Perhaps it was because it was in the oldest tower so maybe the 2 newer towers have nicer presidential units? We even asked at the front desk to verify we were in a \"presidential\" unit. Perhaps compared to a stay in a 2 bedroom in Sedona or to a recent stay in a 2 bedroom in a Marriott at Hilton Head, it just didn't come close. We were kind of bummed. The ac wasn't working well in the master bedroom so was always 3-4 degrees warmer than in the spare bedroom. Some might like this - but we like it very cool in order to sleep. They had a \"governor\" on the thermostat so we had it as low as could get it - which was fine in the spare bedroom! The furiture in the presidential unit was purchased for \"looks\" - not for comfort. Dining room table was a true \"knee-banger\" from every seat!! Wish I'd taken pictures - no thought put into people actually sitting at it with the decorative iron all around the base so you couldn't slide chair in to sit. Little things indicated no attention to detail - basket for silverware was missing from dishwasher - not a big deal to us but could be to a family. Very decorative frame on mirror in bathroom which must have been hard to clean cracks and crevices - looked dirty. Can't imagine the bacteria there since right in front of the sink where people wash, brush teeth, etc. Common sense would say - make sure install things that can be cleaned! Lobby and pools, sitting areas, etc., truly are beautiful and staff around them was helpful and friendly. Must be because it is in Vegas but my biggest complaint was that the lobby was way overscented!! So many people are sensitized to these fragrances but Wyndham definitely wasn't afraid to use the fragrances there! We stayed 4 nights in the 2 bedroom then moved, per our reservation, to 1 bedroom deluxe for 2 nights. The downgrade had more comfortable furniture - not fancy trimmings ... but we liked it. Biggest problem was HUGE amount of fragrance in hall and in unit in the 1 bedroom. condos and hotels really need to figure this out - I ended up pretty sick from it. Great concierge who was very helpful with anything we asked him. We did pitty the poor people who actually wanted to use the fitness room in the mornings!!! You had to run a gauntlet of people to get there because everyone had to go through the hall where salespeople were trying to sell timeshares to new customers. Those salespeople clearly didn't give a darn about customers already staying there and trying to get access to the fitness room. They made no attempt to keep hall clear or even to stay to one side or to even just step out of the way when we'd go down hall. They were on a mission to sell and you trying to go through them to get to use the facilities was not on their agenda.

The hotel does not provide daily maid service. It will clean your room at a cost of $70 for surface cleaning or $100 for a more detail clean. 2. The shuttle which begin at 9:30 a.m. has a last shuttle at 10:00 p.m. and only leaves you at the Harrah's casino. 3.

The staff is friendly as they are checking you in or greeting you on the property but call enough times to get clean towels, additional soap or toliet paper and their tone changes. It is so unfortunate that as El Cid Vacation Club owners we were not given the same type of service that we are accustom to at an El Cid Resort.

Our family needed 2 beds in the second bedroom which was impossible to find with this proximity to the strip at $139/ night. We were upgraded to the 2-bedroom Presidential Suite on the 12th floor. The benefits definately outweighed the flaws for our group = thus 4-stars. BENEFITS: Our unit was on the pool side and very quiet. The full kitchen allowed us to make our own breakfast -we prefer this over complimentary breakfasts at other hotels which are pretty generic and often stop by 9 AM. How many times can you eat out and not get tired of it? The kitchen permitted us to keep snacks, beer which was so convenient. The unit had a washer/ dryer and laundry soap, dishwasher soap, salt and pepper, popcorn, lots of glasses and stem ware - I appreciate having these items. A flatscreen TV in each BR and LR. Supermarkets within a short drive, drugstore a short walk, strip was certainly walkable. We had a problem with the oven not turning off, and maintenance replaced the range by the time we returned to our room. The pool / hot tub areas outside are very nice, serene; our sons used the hot tub at about 3 AM too. We arrived very late (2 AM) and no sales pitch occured. Our sons used the shuttle to Harrahs once without problem. There was always parking and the area felt very safe. The shop on the 3rd floor had basic food items (bread, tortillas) and pharmacy type items - inflated prices though. CRITICISMS: Overall the criticisms are 'small' stuff in my evaluation. The morning after arriving, we received a 'welcome' call at 9 AM - acknowledging our 2 AM arrival - to ask us to pick up our 'welcome package' at the front desk. The call was too early, given our arrival time! We sent our young cocky adult sons to get their 'welcome package' which disappointed their sales rep, who wanted the parents! Thus, no sales pitch. The welcome package is a joke: a single toothpaste sample and shampoo sample (which the unit already had). The game room is not for adults really; it is small, a single pool table, single air hockey table, single Wei, nothing was 'complimentary'. The master bathroom's shower and single sink are open to the bedroom, so no privacy there. The only cleanliness flaw I noticed (I'm picky) was finding a clump of long dark hairs on the shower's drain - we are all blond so they weren't ours! That told me the shower floor wasn't cleaned between guests! Carts were not available for guests in Tower 2, so we had to huff our groceries from parking lot to the 12th floor ourselves and we saw others doing the same. A hotel bellboy even had an empty cart in the parking lot but wouldn't allow us to use it - he said it wasn't 'permitted' - that was annoying. SUMMARY: Despite these criticisms, we would definately stay there again. It was a great value, very nice and quiet unit and it more than met our needs.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key Biscayne, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAppreciation But Not Love\u201d", "Author": "LLFauntleroy", "ReviewID": "UR124640281", "Content": "It was kind of like a date arranged on online by a service that leaves you thinking it was OK, not quite sure if you want to repeat it, but realizing all the good qualities you saw.

All in all, we like the location since it isn't far from the strip and you can walk through the MGM conference center into MGM to get right out on the strip if you don't want to walk the street.

It was cold so did not use the pool but it looked great. Especially the one for those over 18. But there was an over powering smell (aroma?) in the halls we could not identify. It was clearly put there-not something from guest cooking. After the second day we decided it was a cheap vanilla icing smell-like from a grocery store cake.

The unit was fabulous for 2 couples. We each had our own living space with connecting door. Both bedrooms had king sized beds. The larger unit had a full sized kitchen and jacuzzi tub. We were in Tower 3 which has its own pool and hot tub. No bar service but also didn't have any issues with taking our own beverages to the hot tub (in plastic containers though). As others said, the shuttle takes you to Harrahs and you can pick up other shuttles from there, but rental cars are not that expensive and there was lots of parking at the casinos on the strip so we pretty much drove where ever we went. Don't be afraid to use the valet parking at the casinos. There is no charge, just whatever you want to tip the valet. Only downside was the wait for the car, but you would otherwise be walking to the parking garage or waiting for a taxi. They do provide you with lotion, shampoo and conditioner which is not always a given in timeshare units. Also there are no robes in the rooms, another item that is not consistent with timeshare units. The units come equipped with a coffee sample for 1 pot of coffee, paper towels and small salt and peppers. We never had any problems parking our car at the resort. Even late at night there were stil spots available. We arrived quite early and the check in girls were able to give us our room which was greatly appreciated after our early morning flight from Calgary. We settled into our room and then hit the strip. The girls did some shopping at the Forum Shops while the boys spent the better part of the day at the Sports Book at Ceasar's. Found some pretty good sales at the Forum Shops which made it an affordable shopping experience. We returned to our rooms for a hot tub and to pick up our parking pass. (if you like betting on horse races the best sports book we found was off the strip at Sam's Town) At no time did we get approached for a time share presentation which we really appreciated. We never had cause to use the Concierge services so cannot comment on that. The resort is very clean and there is almost always someone busy cleaning something. If you have a chance you have to check out City Centre. The complex is very interesting and well worth a walk through and drink at the Chandelier Bar.

For the 45 minute owner's update we received free premium tickets to Jersey Boys (at least a $200 savings) at the Venetian that evening. We were off to a great start on our first day in Vegas. We have always enjoyed the Grand Desert, especially the deluxe units. The king bed was luxurious and so comfortable. The bathrooms were very nice with amenities and with soft towels and the kitchen with granite counter tops fully stocked with kitchen ware. With the car we went to the local Vons and bought some wine, cheese, fruit for our romantic evenings. The heater was a little loud when it came on but it was brief.

We both had to work on Monday, but decided to get a jump on the week by hopping on a 6pm flight out of PHL after putting-in a full day's work. The five-and-a-half hour flight was like a root canal. In fact, I would have preferred the root-canal (which usually last no more than an hour) to this skull-busting ordeal. We survived the flight, and the marathon which followed, as we trod from one end of LAS to the other retrieving our bags and then back to pick up our rent-a-car, arriving at Wyndham at about 11pm (2am our time) We were in our 24th waking hour when we walked up to the concierge desk. I mentioned earlier that visiting the concierge desk seemed urgent because we had to mark our rental car so that it wouldn't be towed. Otherwize we would have gone right up to our rooms. It seems that the parking authorization is merely a \"red herring\" used by the high-pressure sales-people, to get you signed-up for a meeting with other high-pressure sales types the next day.

They insist on both husband and wife being present or they won't give you the time of day! That's because if they convince one member of a legal couple to buy their wares, it's worthless.

She said they were going to \"give\" us a $150 American Express just for having lunch with them. In my case, they'll be trying to get me to become a full-fledged owner. But it doesn't stop there.

Overall our experience was okay. Nothing too bad, but I do have some comments to share that may or may not go along with others that have commented. Check in was easy, but you just have to so NO to the sales pitch you have to listen to in order to obtain your parking pass. If you're interested in being trapped for \"30 minutes\" for a dinner or show, then it's up to you. Once we said no, (and never answered the phone) we had no problems with sales people. One down side about this resort (and most likely others) is the number of prospective buyers they parade around the campus and through the pool area. There was always a flow of traffic through this area. As for the pools (3 of them), they are limited to the amount of sun they receive. I only experienced the two main pools between building 1 and 2. The \"family\" pool receives sun around 10am to 2pm and the adult pool from 2-4pm (at least in Oct). So, depending on your plans, you're very limited to the sun exposure, or have to relocate in the afternoon which can become very crowed and a struggle for the sunny areas. Pools were nice, music okay. Just too many folks walk through on the tours. One nice amenity we used was the parking garage (not originally told about when we ck'd in). It was convenient, but very tight parking. The downside is the sales folks park in the \"no Parking / tow-away\" zones which can block cars in and make it very difficult to get out. We didn't use the spa facilities or any of the restaurants. We did use the fitness facility in our building and it was well equipped and very nice. We also didn't use the shuttle service, sorry no help. I guess the biggest compliant overall would be the noise from the airport. No matter which direction flights are taking off, it's very noise (inside and outside) Loud enough to drown out the music at the pool. So, keep this in mind. If you're looking for long, quiet days by the pool, forget it. Overall, the rooms were big, kitchen was \"okay\" (lots of drawers sticking due to poor design), but manageable. I would recommend during the busy time as there's just not enough room at the pools to manage the crowds because people relocate from one to the other so it's really like having one pool in use at a time. The 3rd pool was small and appeared crowded, but we never visited it's location.

I decided to stay off the strip in order to take advantage of renting condo type accomodations for the space. It was an excellent decision. Loved the Wyndham Grand Desert. I rented from someone via vrbo. Two bdrm deluxe - 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths, full kitchen, dining area and living area. This was perfect for our Girls Getaway for 4 adults. It was important to us for everyone to have their own bed as well as stay in one room. There was a king bed, 2 full/queen size beds and the pullout couch. The condo was clean and spacious. We were able to go to our own spaces and have girl time in the living and dining room. The space was fresh and clean. We didn't care about having every day maid service. We're neat and tidy folks so it didn't make as any difference. We called for more towels, coffee and new iron. It was brought to us w/in 20-30 minutes. They always called back to make sure we received the items we requested which was a great touch of customer service. The service at this location was spot on. We didn't have any problems. The security was great as well. You had to use your room key at all times to get to your floor. In the evenings you could see security walking the grounds to make sure everything was in order. Since we were 4 females traveling this gave us great sense of security. By choice I attended a timeshare. I never attend these but I thought what the heck. I'm seriously considering purchasing DVC thru Disney World and I wanted something to compare it to and this gave me a solid comparison. It's also a nice product if you're looking to purchase a timeshare. I was there approximately 2 1/2 hours. I had a talker and I seriously was interested in finding out the facts and number crunching. The guy I had talked loud and a mile a minute. That drove me crazy but I did get the information I needed. Had it been a normal sales person the experience would have been more pleasant and it probaly would have only taken 2 hours. Absolutely no pressure when I told him I was not interested. He asked why and I told him i was still leaning towards Disney and we were finished. O and there was not any pressure for me to sign up for the timeshare either. It was my own freewill choice. The first time on the strip we walked from the resort. That was the 1st and last time we walked. Yes, it's only about a 10 minute walk to the strip but the street, Harmon is a major street and I don't care to walk down major streets - it just doesn't seem safe to me. Walking there was cool but it's the walk back that changed our minds to drive. After a long day of walking on the strip the last thing we wanted to do was walk back to the resort. We soon realized that valet parking at any resort on the strip was free. All you have to do is tip them. After learning this we drove everywhere. We rented a car because we were going to Hoover Dam. So it wasn't any extra expense to use the car. We enjoyed staying here because it felt like we got away from it all at the end of the day to our quiet little condo. Loved it!!! They do offer a shuttle service. We did not use it. We do not like to wait for shuttles so we opted out of this service. They give you a slip of paper to use to get on and off the shuttle. The shuttle picks you up at the hotel and delivers you to the Harrah casino. It's located more on the north side of the strip. The shuttle to Harrah's stops at 10pm. At the that time you can catch Rio's shuttle and they will take you back to the strip up until 12:30AM believe. We decided next time we would stay on the strip, rent two connecting rooms and not rent a car. Grand Desert was fabulous and met our needs but because we understand actually staying on the strip would be more convenient for us we would opt for the strip next time. Things to consider if you stay at Grand Desert It is not on the strip. It is not a hop, skip and jump to the strip. It is a solid 10 minute walk, down a busy street to the strip. If you do not like walking, do not like to be shuttled to and fro and do not rent a car you will more than likely not want to stay at this resor.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Hookem", "ReviewID": "UR118084926", "Content": "I was very impressed with my stay at the Wyndham.

No restaurant on site but a cafe for snacks and breakfast. The check in process was really smooth but you have to collect your car park pass from the timeshare staff on another desk across the lobby. I then had to endure the timeshare hard sell which after a 10 hour flight with 3 children, was no joke. The hard sell included telling the children about the great 'free' show tickets we could all have if we attended the timeshare breakfast or lunch. I gave in and agreed to attend the meeting the following day but it turned out not to be convenient and we didn't go. I was then subject to several follow up calls and in the end we stopped answering the phone. We booked this accomodation as an exchange with our Disney timeshare, I would not do this again due the timeshare issues.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "Riviera_10", "ReviewID": "UR117137648", "Content": "We stayed at the Wyndham for one week.

The other reviews were spot on. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The three pools are very nice. The rooms were well kept and spacious. From what I understand, all the rooms have been updated with granite countertops in the kitchen and baths. My kids ages 6,4,and 2 loved the place. The game room was more than enough to keep them busy. My only major concern about this place was the exaggerated prices in the market and sandwich place. One hotdog was $5.99/tax. A small box of cereal was $5.99/tax. A dozen of eggs was $3.99/tax. One quarter of butter was $1.99/tax. You get my point. They do have a shuttle that takes you to the supermarket every morning for a $4/pp fee. The only problem is that it fills up rather quickly and you might not have a spot on shuttle. One of the bell hops was kind enough to ask the limo driver if he would take us. He did and we gave him a $20 tip for doing so. A taxi ride would have cost about $24/rt if they don't wait for you. Overall, the staff was very accommodating. They did try to pressured us to attend an owner's update breakfast, but we just wanted to relax with our friends and enjoy the resort. The shuttle to the was a nice touch do to the hot weather, but on a good day you should be able to walk to the middle of strip and buy a $7 24 hour pass on the bus. It will take you up and down the strip all day long. We don't gamble so we come to Vegas to visit family, take in a show, and eat. If you are a couple, splurge a litte and stay at the Venetian and be spoiled for a price you can't even get a 2 star hotel in downtown Chicago or NYC. If you have kids and not interested in the gaming, stay at this beautiful 3star resort.

Also being a family resort, they should add something to the pool (slide or something) to make it more fun. Also to get from one building to the next you have to walk outside thru the parking lot which was alittle odd. Location was a couple of blocks from strip behind and in between MGM grand and planet Hollywood. About 10-15 walk to the strip.

Spent three days here with a 12 year old in tow. Loved the location because it gets you a bit beyond the madness of the Las Vegas strip but is close enough to walk or cab to there when it's time to really experience Vegas. The unit was perfectly cleaned and maintained. The kitchen was well-equipped for basic cooking needs. There were two flat-screen televisions...one in the living room, one in the bedroom. Bathroom was large. Master bedroom had a jacuzzi tub and its own vanity with sink. Bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows and a nice comforter. Pull out sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable. The bathroom towels could've been nicer. Towels provided at the pool were nicer than the room towels. Speaking of the pool...lounge chairs were super comfy. Pool was monitored by a security guard which was nice. Internet was totally unreliable. It was very difficult to connect and to maintain a connection. Once connected, the connection was annoyingly slow. Unacceptable to have weak internet in this day and age. As for the A/C...we were there three nights. The first night it didn't work. Room was over 80 degrees. Outside temps in Vegas were over 100 degrees each day. Maintenance was called a total of five times during our stay. They were in the room every day maintaining the A/C unit...once they were there twice in one day. Rooms are equipped with sensors that shut off the A/C when you're not in the room. The first day the staff tried to convince me that it was hot because we'd just gotten there and the room needed time to cool down. That just resulted in a very warm night for us since the A/C wasn' t working properly. We were not offered a room switch until well into day two of our three day stay. At that point the air was working and it would've been a hassle to move. Bottom line, the staff was nice about it and as responsive as possible, but after the third or fourth call they should've just moved us. Although I spent much of this review complaining about the A/C...the staff was genuinely kind and attentive about it and we weren't in the room that much during the day so it wasn't fatal. One other complaint, and I know it can't be avoided in a timeshare scenario, but I could've done without the sales pitch after fiver hours on the road and with a kid standing there wanting to get to the room!

I've stayed here multiple times, without any complaints and usually enjoy my stay. The Grand Desert Resort is a nice place for families to stay in Vegas, away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip, but just a 10 minute walk or 5 min shuttle to the main attractions. Check-in was no problem, it was quick and easy and our guests who arrived before us were able to check in without the vacation owner being present. That being said, the last time we stayed here there was a little mix up with our room...our guests who checked in before us went up to our assigned room to find a room that was a sweltering 80 degrees. This is at 9pm. When our party arrived later around 11pm, the thermostat still read 80 degrees, so we called a technician to come and take a look. Within 15 minutes or so, two men came to look at what was wrong, and promptly told us that the A/C would need to be serviced and we would be moving to another room shortly. After thanking them, we proceeded to wait for a bellhop to come with new keys and a luggage cart to escort us to a new room. There we waited for over an hour in the hot room, until finally we heard a knock which was the bellhop. We were then escorted to our room, and after a little complaining from my mother the vacation owner, the bellhop promised to return to our room with complimentary champagne and chocolate as a means of apologizing for the inconvenience. My girlfriend and I had gone down to the pool for a bit and decided to go back to the room to shower and freshen up. Since we had our do not disturb sign on the door, we got skipped when housekeeping came along in the morning, so I made a call down to front desk to have someone come and replenish our shampoo/conditioner/lotion etc., supply. There we sat, in our wet bikinis, thinking that there would be someone knocking on the door any minute with our requested items...this also took over an hour. We called down to front desk to make sure that they didn't forget about us, and were assured that someone would be there soon. Finally someone came with a timid knock and brought handfuls of wonderful soap and cleaning things. For them taking so long in the actual delivery of the goods, they are certainly quick in customer service response because not 5 minutes after we got our toiletries, we got a call from front desk confirming that we had received our requested items. Other than those two incidents, our stay here was great and we enjoyed the quiet facilities. Rooms are clean and very spacious compared to what you'd get on the strip for the same price, if not more. What I love about it is that each room has a fully equipped kitchen and a full size refrigerator, so if you want to bring your own food and cook you can without having to bring all your pots and pans and plates and such. Its nice because you don't walk into the hotel or any of the rooms with that stale old smoke smell, since it is a smoke free resort. The furnishings are a little outdated, but everything is still very nice and clean and well-kept. They even have True Blue Spa toiletries in all the bathrooms which is definitely a plus. The resort did have a full gym, which I will probably try to take advantage of next time I stay.

The shuttles were nice to Harrah's, but I'm still puzzled by the times & late night pick-ups only at Rio, which is not by Harrah's & not convenient at all if you are on the strip til midnight, which we were most nights! (I had my pedometer & we walked an average of 6-7 miles each day, which included taking the shuttle to Harrah's each morning & doing shopping/casinos/shows each day until about midnight.

My recommendation is to add shuttles from Harrah's back to Wyndham until at least 12 or 1 a.m. We enjoyed the adult pool, as we went with another couple & left the kiddos at home, so it was nice not to have kids being loud in the pool!

Also, a couple observations/tips, skip the $4 charge pp for grocery shopping to Von Ric's & walk to CVS by Hard Rock Hotel (or there's a Walgreens on the strip or they have groceries in the main Tower, but probably $1 more on most things at CVS.) Groceries are not cheap, but is anything in Vegas?? (At CVS, eggs $3.89 dozen, cereal about $4 box, 1/2 gallon milk $3 something, bread $3.69.)

The hotel had no absolutely no problem with us having people coming and going into the hotel/room different days, which was nice. The woman helping us check-in was very helpful, and told us the different types of rooms we could choose from. She showed us on a map which rooms were available, what had the best view, what she thought was the nicest room, etc. I also asked the customer service desk a few questions, and they were all extremely helpful as well. I liked having the 24 hour pool and hot tub in Tower 3, it was really nice to go down there when we go home for the night and having it just outside the doors. There were always tons of seats around the pools available. The adults only pool was not in the sun until around noon most days we were there, so we would start at the family pool at move over in the afternoon. The group I was with went for my 21st birthday, which was mentioned at the front desk, and they delivered champagne and chocolates to the room, as well as a card, which I thought was very nice of them. There is a shuttle that leaves the hotel starting around 8am going to Harrah's on the strip. We used the shuttle a lot the week we were there. It usually came around the :15 and :45 parts of the hour, and left harrah's at the :00 and :30 parts of the hour. We would usually get on the shuttle infront of Tower 2, and get dropped off at Tower 3. It was nice to be off of the strip because it's not as loud, and so it was nice at night because it was peaceful when we ended the day in the hot tub. But our room also had a great view of the strip, which was amazing at night. For the room, the beds were comfortable, air conditioner works, had a jacuzzi tub, ice machine, etc. But because it was a time share room, we did not have a maid every day. If we wanted a maid, we had to pay extra. We could get towels and stuff anytime we wanted though. So we just cleaned up after ourselves. There is also a Starbucks cart in the Tower 2 lobby, which is great. And there is a cafe in Tower 1 that has amazing food, especially their cheese sticks, and they also deliver room service to your room if you want. There is no casino in the hotel, but there is a pretty small bar, and they have some slot machines to play. On a side note about Vegas in general, we went to see LOVE, the Beatles Cirque show, and it was absolutely amazing. I am not a big Beatles fan, but I thought the show was so great. And the gift shop there has pretty much everything you could want. Also, we got 2-for-1 coupons from the Vegas.com book (there are so many coupon books around the lobby in Tower 2, specially at the customer service booth) to go up the Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel.

The resort and the individual units are nice but the furniture is very uncomfortable. I would not stay here again because their customer service is terrible. Here is what we experienced: A week before arrival I requested both of our units on the same floor and was assured that this would be provided. I called again that morning to confirm this since we would be arriving late at night, and I was again assured that they were holding two units for us on the same floor. When we arrived we were told they didn't even have two units in the same builiding. Finally after speaking to the manager she said they were cleaning a unit in the same builiding as one of our units and if we were willing to wait 45 minutes they would bring the keys to us in our unit that was already available in that buillding. We agreed, although it was after midnight and we'd been traveling all day because even though it still wouldn't be on the same floor at least it would be in the same building. After waiting an hour and a half I called down to the desk inquiring about our second unit and was told the manager had gone home. The manager that had come on duty didn't know anything about the fact that we were still waiting for our second unit. By this time it was almost 2:00 in the morning. The bellman was very rude. When I reported this to the head bellman he did nothing. The concierge was rude and useless. When I said we were looking for a recommendation for a restaurant, his response was \"there's about 2000 of them\". When I pursued a recommendation, he just indicated all the restaurants in the immediate area around the hotel. We were on a limitied budget and some of our group were not 21 so we had planned to spend most of our days relaxing and reading at the pool. However, they played somewhat loud and extreming annoying 20 year old rock music at the pool all day and eventing. When I asked the lifeguard if they played this all the time, his response was \"yeah, why is there a problem?\". When I explained that it was annoying to have to listen to this music all day and evening long\". Instead of changing the music to something that would appeal to everyone, or turning it down a little, he said people requested music and left it at that. I noticed he was the only one bopping around to it. Everyone in our group was annoyed by it and we had people ranging in age from their teens, twenties and into the 50s. Finally after 4 days, that lifeguard went off duty and they changed the music to something that was palatable to everyone and turned the volume down. We were finally able to read by the pool and enjoy it in relative peace for our last two days. It's a shame that the preferences of one lifeguard robbed us of a peaceful, relaxing time at the pool for most of our stay. There was not one comfortable seat in the living area and the beds could be better.

This was our first visit to the Grand Desert with our two young sons (ages 10 and 6). We checked in late at night and check in was speedy. Our room was in Tower 3, a very short walk from the main lobby in Tower 2. Our room was very lovely and clean and a welcomed site after a long day of travelling. We did attend the \"owners' update\" breakfast one morning. Yes, they do try to sell you more points but the rep we met with was great. I learned more about my ownership with Wyndham in the 2 hours we were with him than I did over the years I've owned with Wyndham. At the end of 2 hours, I explained that we just could not financially swing the additional points purchase and Justin, our rep, was very understanding and very polite about turning down his offer. I was expecting an attitude from him but we never got it. He was extremely professional the whole time. We received our two $25 restaurant vouchers and were on our way. We used the vouchers at the buffet at Harras and only had to pay in $6 (family of 4 came to $56 for lunch). So I was glad I did get the vouchers. My only complaint about the resort had to do with the hot tubs by the pools. The pool by Tower 3 is 24 hours. The water was not warm and the resort seems to be quite windy (how weird is that). So it felt too cool to swim there. The hot tub by that pool was closed all week for maintenance but I never saw anyone working on it. There are two hot tubs by the main pool and one of them had a lot of dirt in it the whole week so I know nobody was cleaning it. Also the jets in that tub didn't seem to work. That means there was only 1 properly working and clean hot tub by the pools accessable to families. The pool water itself was cooler than I would have liked but I'm guessing as time goes by and the weather heats up, the pools will warm up. I did sleep pretty well at night. The beds are very comfy but I still woke up with a stiff back. I really like the fact that the resort is not on the strip. I don't really care for the party atmosphere at the strip hotels nor the crowds. Wyndham offers a free shuttle from the resort to Harrah's which we used several times. The full working kitchen in our unit (2 bedroom deluxe) makes it easy to prepare meals so it helped save us $$.

We were given a nice greeting gift and plently of 2 for 1 coupons and almost free show vouchers. Amber invited us to an \"owners revue\", which we were reluctant to attend based on other Timeshare presentations.

He left and returned, told us it was taken care of, but we had already started to panic, especially while waiting for him to return. We disliked that we were sent to another place to then receive our information about the hotel and then an attempt for a time share sales meeting was also pitched. We were already drained from the drive and upset about our reservation being canceled. We already own a time share, hence using the points to go there, and the invite for the time share meeting was interestingly unclear so that guests wouldn't realize what they were in for. I don't think that that's a good or right tactic. They tell you it's breakfast or lunch and that you'll get a package/gift, but don't tell you that it's about membership or how long it will take (plan on 4 hours for any timeshare pitch).

Not only did I pay $75 to transfer the points to stay there, but now we were being hit with another $65 fee that I was completely uninformed about when making the reservation.

Sometime the hotel management addressed right away. My only warning is this...Wyndham is VERY pushy with its sales I suggest you try to avoid it at all costs.

We stayed 12/4 - 12/7/2010 so we were there for the LV Marathon and NBR event so there were significantly more people on property than I remember from our vist 3 years ago, however, the crowds were really only prevelant in the lobby, in the evening. Check in was a breeze, but I was disappointed that I couldn't get a strip view room. We did have a nice view of the pool/courtyard area, which is lit up beautifully at night. As is usual after check in we were shuffled accross the lobby to pick up our parking pass - which is code for - try to con you into a sales pitch. I've been through this a million times before, and though I tried repeatedly to say no - it seems the least I could get away with was agreeing to a survey the next day in our room. They did stick to the survey agenda and she was out of our room in 20-30 minutes. We got our gift card, which we used in Vegas without issue. It was a little cold to use the pool, but we did walk around the pool deck, play with the large chess set and enjoy some time sitting by the fire pit. The location is great - within walking distance to HRH, two blocks off the strip with shuttle service to and from the strip. (We've walked it, it's doable - but the shuttle is much quicker.) We had a one bedroom unit - clean - everything was on site where it should've been, appliances worked well. Bed was not comfortable - which is abnormal for a Wyndham property - I could hardly sleep while I was there. Overall, the resort was in excellent condition - the same as if not better than it was on our previous trip. Staff is friendly and always provides service with a smile.

The hotel room is just a place to rest our heads and stop in to relax from time to time, not a place to hang out in for extended periods of time. Very good resort for a family, many kid friendly activities and clearly outside of the \"what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\" atmosphere. Has a decent pool scene with a segregated adult pool with a pool bar (you are also free to bring your own cooler full of adult beverages, just no glass containers poolside). The gym is okay with all the necessary equipment and cardio machines however it lacks the amenities of a health club that many of the other Vegas hotels have (such as steam baths, saunas etc). Some of the biggest drawbacks are there is no onsight or adjacent nightlife, casino or restaurant. The nearest casinos are Planet Hollywood, MGM and the Hard Rock which are all about a 10+ minute walk away. The walk is not necessarily bad during the day (although hot), but it does not appear to be the safest at night with a lot of dark desolate stretches of sidewalk. Wyndham does provide a shuttle that runs every half hour until around 10PM and a cab ride is relatively inexpensive depending how far down the strip you are. There also is a small lobby lounge/bar that has a handful of video poker and slot machines that stays open until 1 or 2am depending on how busy it is. I would definitely recommend this to families or people not looking to stay out late. Also, the kitchen is a good perk if you are looking to save by cooking in a lot. The unit is nice in roomy, but many hotels in Vegas offer larger rooms and suites if you need more space.

The city was working on water pipes or something so at times during the day constuction/city workers made entering and leaving hotel hard but since i was on the opposite end of this i did not hear any noise. I did not encounter any staff problems because i had no needs for their assistance. But will say if you do not own a timeshare they will call to have you attend a presentation for ownership. By the time they reached me it was at the end of my stay so i declined but usually you get cash, gift cards or free nights stay to attend the presentations so at times it is worth the couple of hours of your time it is your call. All in all i was happy with my stay if possible would stay again here again or away from the strip.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWyndham in the Desert\u201d", "Author": "MakeCandy", "ReviewID": "UR71484340", "Content": "Wyndham Grand Desert Resort in Las Vegas, NV The six of us arrived at the Las Vegas, NV airport and hired a Taxi/Van service to take us to the resort.

The unit was a 3-BR condo with two baths, a Jacuzzis, a full kitchen & dining area, a washer/dryer combo with a flat-screen TV in each room. There were a total of 4 beds with a sleeper/sofa in the living room. The unit would sleep 8-10 persons. The unit was lovely internally; however, the only negative of this unit was that the windows facing the Las Vegas strip had several pigeons that lived on the seals just outside the windows. The resort is located just less than 1 mile from the Las Vegas strip on Harmon Ave. Amenities included a free shuttle to and from Harrah's on the strip, computer rooms, activity rooms, work-out rooms, swimming pools, hot tubs, restaurants, grocery store, free DVD usage, etc. There are several shuttles, and tours that you can schedule from the lobby that have fees. There are also several activities that you can sign up for such as messages, arts & crafts, etc. The amenities are nice. What I liked the most about the resort was the convenience of everything, but what I liked the least was the hard-sell on the Timeshares.

They do not have the parking to accomodate the tenants staying here. The parking garages are a diaster.. as they fill up in the evening and there is no outside parking. It got very old quickly driving around like a clown looking for parking. The resort security is also a JOKE, as we notified the staff of people double parking and they seemed like that did not care or were too lazy to act on it. The pool is a no frill basic pool. It is vanilla in every way. One day we went swimming in the morning and a bunch of people like in they're 60-70s glared at us.

We had a room overlooking the pools which was great.

Other than that it was faultless - the staff went out of their way to help you and make your holiday special. The family pool was great and the two jaquzzis/spa. There was lots of entertainment along the pool side and the female singer was excellent - loved the music quiz. Never found a problem getting a lounger there always seemed to be plenty to go around.

Hopefully one-day they will upgrade the timeshare unit and join the cyber world and have in-room WiFi available to all their guests at no additional charge. If you are a first-timer to Las Vegas, here's the best advice I got from some friends who frequent vegas - RENT A CAR! That was the best thing we did. There is sooooo much walking in vegas. The hotels are massive and all you do is walk. It is so convenient to drive to a hotel and park in their self parking lots for FREE. Trust me, after you park... you will WALK!

I had high expectations for this resort for 2 reasons, first it was a gold crown resort and second because it's a Wyndham. I am a timeshare owner at Grandview Resort in Las Vegas but RCI gave me a choice between the Wyndham or Grandview. I chose the Wyndham because it seem a little bit closer to the strip then Grandview. The resort on the outside look great but after a long day of traveling, all we wanted to do was check into the resort and relax. On arrival I went to the front desk and I gave the clerk my name and my printed confirmation from RCI. The clerk told me the reservation was canceled. Now clearing since I took a 4 hour plane ride, I didn't cancel my reservation so I was clam and told the front desk clerk, I will wait until he figure something out. After about 10 minutes, he found me a room and then told me the cost for a cleaning fee was $65. I had to stop him for a minute because RCI told me the cost was $40. He told me $40 was the cost of a standard 1 bedroom, since I was getting the deluxe it was $65. I was so tired, so I agreed to pay the $65. We rented a car for 1 day so we had to go across the room to get the parking pass. The guys on the other end of the room was very nice and helpful. Little did I know it was a timeshare hustle. I told then I already had a timeshare and he said, this wasn't a presentation, this was a update for people who already own a timeshare because Wyndham bought RCI. \"It would only be about an hour\" he said. I believed him and signed up for the \"update\" which was for the next morning at 9am. Once in the room, I was excited because it was very nice and Gold star quality. We had a back view so no view of the strip. I was fine with that. Later that night we went to bed and it was a little hot, we set the AC down to about 60 and went to bed. The next morning was my so called \"update\". Needless to say this was a full on timeshare presentation. I was not happy being in that room for almost 2 1/2 hours. While, I was at the presentation, my guest told me the mircowave wasn't working so he requested for them to replace it, which they did. By the ending of the night we realized the room was still not getting cool enough, at this point we called the front desk and they had someone to come and check it out. Maybe because it was 10pm but the maintaince guy came upstairs and pretty much said it was broken, to call back in the morning to get a new room. My boyfriend and I was a little upset because after 2 days in the resort we made ourselves pretty comfy and really didn't feel like moving to a new room. The next morning, I called to front desk and requested to speak to a manager, he sent a AC repair man within 20 mintues he had the AC fixed. The rest of our stay was pleasent until we had to check out. We requested a late check out but I guess no one made a note of it and we got lock out of our rooms at 10am. We had to go through security in get back into our rooms. After we finally checked out, I had to call RCI about the cleaning fee and they told me, they have no record of the $65 charge. It was suppose to be $40 no matter what size room we stayed in. Of course, I was not happy at all and RCI told me I should have called them when we had trouble checking in on day one. Needless to say, RCI gave me back my exchange charge for the incovience and promise to look into the room cleaning fee at the Wyndham. I really didn't know what to say at this point. The resort is very nice but we just had very bad luck at this location. Would I say again? No. It is very family friendly, the shuttle is very helpful, the walk to the strip is about 10 minutes but its not a bad walk. The staff is super nice and very helpful.

Without strain we could hear our neighbor's conversations and one of the mornings we could hear their breakfast frying in the pan!The quality of the furnature and cabinetry in the kitchen, dining area and living room was not the best quality. Nothing was broken but I could tell it would not take much to break it. The bed was very uncomfortable. The matress is one that I would expect in a lower end motel. All the pools are good in size but the decks seem small and difficult to accomdate any large activities. Overall, I would stay at the Wyndham Grand Desert again.

I was surprised that no one had mentioned this in any other reviews but I suppose the Las Vegas sunshine isn't what draws everyone here.

The resort does offer a free shuttle to Harras and back, very convenient. The shuttle ran from 10am to 9:30pm. The Rio shuttle runs a little later and will drop you off at the Wyndham. The shuttle drivers are very friendly and informative, gave us advice on anything we asked. The outdoor pools at resort are heated and hot tubs were a great treat in the mornings! There are 4 pools and hot tubs, some adult only. The restaurant is not really a restaurant but an order counter. The food is good and they have a good selection. They do have Starbucks coffee both at the counter and in the main lobby. They also have a bar on main lobby. Also on the second floor of main tower they have a game room and internet room.

Unfortunately, being in one of the lock-off units with a slim door separating two rooms, the insulation was poor. The next door guests were elderly with medical issues, It's not their fault but because of the husband's chronic coughing and spitting up sputum, we could hear everything and we slept on and off for the two nights. They were also hard of hearing and had to shout their conversations. We learned alot about them and their plans in the late evening and early morning. At 7am on the morning of our departure and hoping to sleep in late, the husband woke up, coughing and spitting and he turned the bedroom tv on full blast to CNN. I called the front desk to at least have the volume turned down. Security came and there was quietness. But it was shortlived. He then switched on the tv in the living room full blast and began making breakfast loudly. Then I heard their door open and then someone fiddling with our door knob. Before I could get out of bed to check out the clamor, the noise stopped. We discovered our newspaper, available for VIP gold and platinum members and usually hanging from the doorknob, missing. No problem. I later went down to the front desk to get another one. We never met the next door guests. We wish them well and to good health hopefully. We loved the opening of the Oasis for cocktails and the slot machines on the ground floor. Hurrah's operates it so you can't charge your drinks to your room. The timeshare survey presentation has been changed for owners. They now come to your room with a 20 question survey and upon completion you will receive a $25 dining voucher.

We decided to fly out the weekend before the training to spend some time together in Las Vegas. We contemplated staying at another hotel on the Strip for Friday and Saturday night but ultimately decided to stay in the GD for the duration. This was our first time to Vegas and our first time experiencing a time share property. The following are the list of reasons our stay was less than grand; 1. They had lost our reservation. This is usually something that can easily be fixed but not at this place. Furthermore, their attitude toward us was bad. After giving them our confirmation number, they were able to find the original reservation but said that it had been canceled. We would not have flow all the way from the east coast if we had canceled the reservation. They asked us who we booked the room with and we gave the name of the lady who books rooms for events such as training (she works in another state on the east coast). Since this is a time share property, they do not have a reservation desk like most hotels and told us quite bluntly that we have to resolve this problem ourselves - we were stunned. We didn\u2019t make the mistake but we had to somehow fix it. Fortunately, we were able to reach the lady on the east coast that originally booked our room (who apparently was the only person who could restore the original reservation) but it took awhile as she couldn\u2019t be reached promptly. We were a little concern that she may not be in the office since it was Friday and getting late in the day on the east coast. When we reached her, she said that it was a glitch in the system and rebooked the room. This was a convenient problem for them as my husband\u2019s credit card had already been billed for the entire stay the day that he made the reservation. So basically we had already paid for a room in its entirety for which we did not even have a reservation. Had we not been able to reach this one person, I don\u2019t think that we would have been able to get another room because they couldn\u2019t make a reservation for us there at the actual property. I call it a property because it really isn\u2019t a hotel \u2013 a fact that was made more apparent every day we stayed. By the way, there is a blackout on checking in on Friday which I guess only applies to non-timeshare owners. I think this is why they wouldn\u2019t help us, which leads me to my next complaint. 2. If you are not a time share owner, you are not fit to breath. We were surprised by this treatment. Since we were not time share owners, I would have thought they\u2019d be nice to us in the hopes of becoming time share owners. Every time we approached a staff person that worked at this place to ask them a simple question (like does the shuttle stop at this tower?), it was as if we were bothering them. I went to what is considered the concierge desk to pick up the \u2018welcome\u2019 package a couple of days after we checked-in, which was some info on Vegas and the shuttle pass. This is when they try to talk you into a time share presentation. When I indicated we were not interested, the little bit of hospitality that I got ended. The one nice person was Ms. Lynn - one of the shuttle bus drivers. Also, my husband witnessed a little 90 year old lady get kicked off the shuttle bus by another driver at the Harrah\u2019s pickup location since she could not produce a shuttle pass or a room key. Someone from her party was already back at the timeshare and she didn\u2019t have a room key or a shuttle pass on her. Watching their treatment of her was the last straw for him. 3. We keep smelling cigarette smoke. It may have been coming from the next room. I felt like I was back at the casinos when we got back to our room. 4. The location of the property wasn\u2019t that convenient to the strip, the shuttle bus didn\u2019t start until 8:30 am and could be a little slow. I am an early morning person and since I was still on east coast time, 8:30 was too late to wait for a bus to get my day started. Beside I didn\u2019t want to eat breakfast every morning at the GD. We took a taxi every morning and on Monday, I decided to walk \u2013 it is a good hike to the strip. Since Vegas requires a lot of walking (if you don\u2019t rent a car), I would recommend staying at a hotel on the strip (or rent a car). Bottom line . . . if you are not a time share owner for wyndham properties and you are just looking to book a hotel in Vegas, I would recommend an actual hotel on the strip. When I go on vacation one of the things that I like is a little bit of room service (i.e., lite clean up, bed service, etc.), which is not going to happen at a time share and particularly not at this place. On the positive side, we stayed in one of the small one bedroom suites, it was nice, but we didn\u2019t use or need the living room/kitchen. Each room does have a W/D which is nice for longer stays.

Best thing about the WGDR is the \"no smoking\" policy -- which brings me to the one exception.

Rooms were large and very clean and the staff treated us very well and were friendly. Only two down sides. One being that their shuttle is somewhat sporadic and you never know quite when it will arrive. Also, the return late night shuttle ends at 10:30 pm. Although they do have a \"sister\" shuttle from Harrahs that leaves at 11:30pm. If you miss that one then you have to take a taxi back to the hotel. The cost can be anywhere from $10-25 depending on where you get the cab. Although the brochures state that The Hard Rock Hotel is within walking distance....be prepared to walk about 30 minutes. Their \"blocks\" are about a mile long! The second downer was with room itself. We had a one-bedroom deluxe, sleep four room. With one bathroom that had two doors. That's NOT the problem. The problem was that over the whirlpool tub, there was an opening, the size of a large window, into the master bedroom. So...if you like privacy in your bath, this is not the place for it. Even though my husband and I have been married 30 years, we still enjoy our \"private\" time. If we had friends along with us, it would've been very awkward to say the least.

We were assigned to 14th floor in building 2 which is the main building. It was another wow when we walk into our condo-like room and look out of the window and see the beautiful swimming pool.

Although they only provide 2 bags of laundry detergent, we had no problem getting through the week. We enjoy the pool every afternoon since day 1. My wife and I enjoy afternoon nap beside pool. We also enjoy pizza and burger which were baked and cook fresh from our condo and brought down to the poolside. The time we spent at the pool was never enough. We rented a car to make it easier back and forth the strip. Parking was never a problem in any hotel in Las Vegas. We also took the free shuttle service by Wyndham to Harrah's which never kept us waiting for more than 10 min. During our stay, we visited Walmart-Supercenter a couple times which was only 3 mils away. We stock up drinks, snack and food in our fridge, and the pizza and burger I mentioned ealier all came from Walmart. We arranged a morning to take the '1.5 hour' sales presentation which later took '3 hours'..... We were ok about the time because we were not hurry to rush to next destination. We made it clear that we are not going to purchase the timeshare right in the beginning, so they didn't pressure us. We walked away with $125 of dining voucher and a 3-day-2-night mini vacation certificate. That voucher was later used in Paris for Village buffet (GREAT) and RIO for Seafood Buffet (soso). The mini vacation certificate was 'add-on' to our Mexico trip in September. Everything went perfect in our way.

The one-bedroom/full kitchen could easily handle 4 adults with one couple in the hideabed in the living room. The bathroom had a LARGE shower with a toilet, but then there was a separate bath area with another vanity/mirror and a jacuzzi tub. As with many timeshares, there are lots of annoying salespeople. I know they need to make money, too, but the way they do it is VERY tricky. First they convince you that you have to have a \"pass\" to use the van to go to the strip--so that's why they tell you you have to go over to the \"host\" desk which of course is really a salesperson. You don't need a pass at all, and if anyone asks, you can just tell them you lost it and show your room key instead. Luckily, we read a Trip Advisor review and avoided the whole thing. But we still got a call giving us a guilt trip that this poor woman had to \"meet\" with us for her \"job\" and she'd get in trouble. We still said no, lied and said we already met with someone, and she was obviously annoyed with us. But after that one call, we were never called again. Here's a tip: the pick ups are EITHER at the front, or the back, and as far as we could tell came about every 1/2 hour or 20 minutes. I'd advise taking a cab BACK from the strip when you come back in the evening---it's still really hot in the summer and it gets so busy you have to wait OR one night, it had to end its stop somewhere else, so we all had to take a cab back.

I surprised my husband on the way home from Grand Cayman we flew to Vegas. I had all of his friends waiting here at the resort. I never have stayed here, so I hoped it would be spectacular, and it was. I had a 3 bedroom presidential, and a couple of the two bedrooms booked. The 3 bedroom was up on the 14th floor, and was like a movies stars penthouse, was what our friends referred to it as. The two bedrooms were nicely appointed too. They have all the amenities with washers and dryers, kitchen, nice bedrooms, etc. The 3 bedroom had lavish decor, fireplace, and 3 bathrooms, and the whole package going on. The lobby personnel were very nice. The lobby was beautiful with piano, marble, and very professional staff. There is a bar, but I think it was a bit pricey. I didn't see anyone use it. There is a nice pool, but we were there when they had a huge snowstorm and were not really going to go out and use the pool, etc. They also offer a complimentary shuttle to Harrah's which ran quite frequently. I can't say enough about the pleasant surprise of how nice the place was. It is only like a block or two up from the main strip where the Bellagio, etc. is.We would really have liked to stay in our room and enjoy it, but felt inclined to go, go, go. Although one of our couples did stay in the room more often, because they said they never get to vacation like this. The only downside was the timeshare presentor. We are Wyndham owners in Hawaii, and it is very laid back. My husband just wanted to check things out here. And, here my husband walked right out on them. They are very nasty people. We have been to many presentations, and this pushed his buttons. It just is so deceiving when they work for the same company that we own with, and they are trying to talk you out of owning in Hawaii stating theirs is the best. However, truth be told, Hawaii is the best place to own with Wyndham. Hawaii owners get extra perks over any other owners, and they have the lowest maintenance fees of anywhere. Security was good on the property. I liked the fact that you need a room key in the elevator to go anywhere. This keeps people from coming in that don't belong. Upon checking out of the resort, we were offered the Wyndham limo to the airport. So we were like how much is this. They told us just to pay a taxi cab fare along with a tip. How cool is that. A nice little surprise. We are planning to go back in December and make it an annual trip with our friends. They still are talking about how great it was.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Burb", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite place to stay in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "pussandboots", "ReviewID": "UR25109893", "Content": "We just returned from our 3rd stay at the Wyndham Grand Desert. We are owners and love it. Check in was a breeze, no waiting in line and our room was ready. We had a choice of tower 2 or 3 and we choose tower 2 on the 11th floor. When we went to guest services to pick up our parking pass they tried to sign us up for the sales presentation. We had to decline three times. No one told us about using the room key for the elevator. So we were on the elevator talking and when the door opened we were still on the 1st floor. The person getting on told us how it worked. We just laughed about it wondering how long we would have been on the elevator before noticing that we hadn't moved. We did notice a slight sewer gas smell in certain parts of the hall. But it was not all the time and we never smelled it in the room. As soon as we reached our door the phone was ringing trying to get us to book the presentation. Again it was a No and we unplugged the phones. No more problems with that. We had the one bedroom deluxe. It's great having a kitchen and washer and dryer. We also like having the living area. We clean up after ourselves so not having housekeeping was not an issue. Clean towels were never an issue because we washed them. We also came home with clean clothes which to me was a good thing. We did get extra Purex from housekeeping whenever we saw her in the hall. We did not hear any noise from the hall or other rooms and that was fantastic. There was a little noise from the planes but it wasn't disturbing in any way from our room. Parking is free and there is a parking garage or outside parking. Never used the pool but we saw people swimming every day. We didn't use anything at the resort but our room. Check out was easy, we had no room charges so it was a quick call to the operator and out the door we went. There is no room service, real restaurant, housekeeping or bell service (that I know of).

My husband waited in the car while I checked in, and was rudely told to park elsewhere while I spent almost 15 minutes waiting for staff. There were only two of us in line, yet the wait went on far too long. The desk clerk was friendly and helpful once he was able to help me. From there, I went over to their guest services desk to get a parking pass and more information on the property. We were given complimentary tickets for two shows, but the catch was that you had to spend $10 on drinks per person for a $35 show and we had no interest in the shows offered. We signed up for the sales presentation solely to receive a gift of $125 in meal vouchers. The customer services rep was pleasant, so no complaints there. The first problem we encountered was the elevator in Tower One where we were staying. To access any floor above the first, you have to use your key. Unfortunately, none of the elevators in the building were recognizing keys, so the only way we were able to get to the 10th floor was to have an employee, who happened to be there, swipe his key. The problem persisted for a couple of hours that I am aware of. At least the problem was finally corrected by the time we returned with groceries, but it was extremely frustrating while we were checking in. We had a 1-BR unit, which was spacious but dated. Even worse, our room was on the side of the building just across from the airport, so you can imagine the air traffic we listened to during our stay. The unit was clean, but had definitely seen better days. Also, all week we could detect the smell of sewer gas in the hall. Note that Tower One is the oldest building on the property, so avoid it if possible. The morning after check-in we endured the sales presentation. We own two timeshares through different companies, so the sales pitch is very familiar to us. The rep was nice, but she was quite pushy and did not explain things as well as reps at other properties. When it became obvious we were not interested, she shut it down pretty quickly, but we still were tied up almost two hours. We did receive our food vouchers, which were good at several resorts owned by the company including the Rio, Bally's, Paris, Caeser's, and the Flamingo. Note that the property does not offer housekeeping services except for their VIP-Gold and Platinum guests. I was able to get extra towels and soap, but they never picked up the dirty ones even though I was told to set them inside the door. Parking was not a problem since there weren't many people at the property. The location is OK, but either use the shuttle (we didn't) or your own vehicle. At no time did I feel like a valued guest. Thankfully we were able to escape from the property mid-week for a run over to Death Valley. Sorry, but I can't recommend this property.

Good things about resort: No slot machines/smoke to pass through on the way to your room. Activities are great: daily grocery shopping (w/ fee and reservation required), tours to local attractions, Monday Aloha Breakfast, free DVD usage and an extensive collection to borrow from. Wonderful Christmas activities w/ santa claus. Includes cookies and milk for kids. Free internet and WiFi in the computer room (3rd fl tower 2 and 1st fl in tower 3) Family friendly w/ activities and game room Free shuttle to Harrah's on the strip (we did not try because we have a rental car) It is about a 3 minute car ride to the strip. All the amenities in the unit are working well. We had a 1 bedroom. Partial kitchen was ok. Sink was rather small but we did not cook anyway. Big fridge and a microvawe oven. It was great to have a washer and dryer in our unit. Although there is no restaurant on the premises, the partial kitchen definitely comes in handy for leftovers and/or preparing meals. Not so good things: Close to the \"strip\" but not at a walking distance. Not 2 blocks off the strip. Instead, they are several blocks off the strip and much too far for kids to walk. The resort is a few blocks off the strip, but, it is really quite a long walk. We had rented a car, and while we could have walked it was really just more convenient to drive and valet park. Like all wyndham timeshare resorts, there's no bellhop and maid service (you have to pay extra to have one). There is a trash chute on each floor- easy to empty the trash your own. Activities fill-up fast and please note that not all activities are free. The most expensive activity was $20 a person. All the common areas seem to be filled with sales people.

Our 8 day stay was part business and part personal and the Wyndham is great for both. A rental car is a must given it's location to the strip and the areas just off the strip aren't very comfortable to walk through late at night. There were taxi cabs always available as well. The unit we stayed in had a parking garage in the basement and that was super convienent. The unit was terrific, it was clean and very large. The bed and pillows in our two bedroom unit are so good we're trying to figure out how to take them home on the plane! We rented our unit from a Wyndham owner that we found on Craigslist and got a GREAT deal. Check in was smooth and they give out the best chocolate chip cookies - you have to have one. It's been around 65 degrees and sunny during our stay which is great for January but, not warm enough for us to use the pool area. Several others have been out there every day and we have a great view of the whole pool area. It looks beautiful and would be a great amount of fun in the summer. We enjoyed being able to get away from the strip and the smokey casinos and the traffic and the people to really relax at night. Little things that really added to the stay (1) We didn't get hassled by the sales people up and down the strip trying to get us to go to a time-share presentation. We just flashed them our Wyndham card and said that we're all set. (2) Internet access was $30 for the week instead of $20 PER DAY on the strip.

The \"resort\", (and I use that word loosely because it's just a motel) clearly exaggerates the quality and convenience of their amenities. The pictures and videos used to promote their \"resort\" are deceiving. And you know in the video when a guy comes and helps the guests with their luggage? Yeah well, that guy doesn't work here anymore. The \"convenience store\" consists of 6-8 shelves of the world's most expensive and almost outdated junk food. A little bottle of pop is $2.50 and a loaf of bread is $5- don't go there. The \"fun-filled\" activity center is nothing more than a tourist trap. The kids are required to buy tokens to use the games which will cost anywhere from $1-$5. I sent 2 kids the \"activities center\" with a $20 bill and they returned back to the room in less than a half-hour wanting more money. Wyndham failed to mention in their brochures that they intended to soak my kids for ever dime they had. So if you were hoping for a place with fun things for kids to do; a place like the one Wyndham claims to be, well unless you have about $100 a day to give your kids, forget it. And there's no place to get any real food within the resort. There is a stand that they call a \"deli\", which would remind you of a stand that sells hotdogs and nachos and a professional baseball game- oh, and it closes at 4pm. And every time you ride the elevator you have to activate it with your room key. Tonight I forgot, and a very loud alarm went off and within seconds a police officer appeared in the elevator and questioned me as though I was a bag lady. So if you are carrying any packages etc and carrying your key card in your purse, plan on having to set everything on the ground to dig through your purse to get your key if you want to use the elevator. Perhaps that sounds like a petty complaint, but I honestly found this to be an inconvenience. The rooms are clean but certainly not \"luxury\". Just picture a Holiday Inn room with a little kitchen and an extra bedroom and that's pretty much what they look like. The pictures of the rooms on their website are exaggerated. There is a small washer/dryer, which was nice for our large family, but no maid service offered whatsoever. With that said, my family of 8 was quite comfortable in our room, with the exception of no affordable food or activities in the \"resort\" as promised. Also, they are not \"2 blocks\" off the strip as advertised. Instead, they are several blocks off the strip and much too far for kids to walk. For what it's worth, their lobbies are gorgeous, and the woman who answers the phone at the front desk is quite pleasant, which is a big plus since we've had to frequently call her to ask where certain things in the motel are located simply because the brochure we were given at check-in just doesn't give that information. There is absolutely NO information or written material / resources in the room. I assume this is because most people rely on the Internet for all that information, but unfortunately the Wyndham charges $7 a day for internet- also never mentioned to us. They do have an area where a person can plug their computer in for free- good luck finding that \"area\". The outdoor courtyard with the pools and hot tubs is very pretty and very well kept, however it's pictures were also CLEARLY exaggerated in the pamphlets on and the website. Don't get me wrong- it's nice, but it's not as nice as the pictures make it look and I never saw any staff members open up the \u201cbar\u201d or food stands in the courtyard. Again, the videos exaggerated. I don't think our family will ever stay here again. I don't mind staying off the strip providing I can get breakfast in the motel or at least a bottle of soda that doesn't cost me nearly $3. Staying at the Wyndham requires leaving the facility for absolutely everything one needs. And they do offer a shuttle service to the strip, but only until 10:00. And they will allow you to ride on a shuttle to the grocery store, but it will cost you $3. My message is mostly for families with kids. This \u201cresort\u201d markets itself as \u201ckid friendly\u201d but I found it to be anything BUT that. It would cost hundreds of dollars per kid to participate in all the activities the resort boasts about.

This time we decided to stay in the Wyndham Grand and I am so glad we did. As one who has a Kool-Aid budget and champagne taste this place was great. Traveling with \"Mummy and Daddy\" helps too (-: This place is designed for those whose idea of a vacation is to take it easy; nothing planned nor expected but to inhale and exhale daily. I had been experiencing 17-18 hour days in the months prior to coming to this site. It proved to be a badly needed respite from the Rat Race, even in Sin City! Anyway here is what I found: 1. Stay in Tower Two, we were in Room 1271 a 2-bed/2 bath suite with a great view of the pool area, incoming and outgoing airplanes and a little bit of mountain! 2. This place is totally smoke-free, that means a lot to me coming from the smoke-free state of Ohio. 3. There is a free shuttle (tips appreciated) that takes you back and forth to Harrah's, givng you greater access to the action that's part of the Strip. 4. There are many activities planned by the activities staff for those who are not just in Vegas for the gambling, shows, and restauranting. This part of the Resort reminds me of cruiseship activities. I recommend the tour to the Ethel M Candy Factory, the four-hour gambling tutoring class, the Black-Jack tournament, and the Friday night Social (there was a Patti-Labelle-type singer who was entertaining and sounded pretty good too, plus there was a free Italian-food buffet). I would recommend you sign up for week's activities as soon as you get there. Activities fill-up fast and please note: Not all activities are free. The most expensive activity was $20 a person. 5. There is a DVD player in each room and a free DVD loaning library (based on the honor system) in the Activities Center. There were several releases I saw from 2008 that I missed in the theater including Atonement, The Bucket List ,and Michael Clayton. 6. There are daily activities for children. 7. It was too cold for me to get in any of the outdoor whirlpools and swimming pools, but there is a Jacuzzi-type bathtub in the Master bedroom that was good enough for me. I am not sure the in-room Jacuzzi is big enough for two however. 8. When you go to the grocery store you are given the store discount like Kroger's, Giant Eagle, etc., which results in you saving even more. As a result, we were able to get one-pound plus T-Bone steaks for between $4-$6 each!! 9. The clientele is ethnically diverse, this is always a plus for me. However, most of the people are 50-plus. 10. The kitchen is stocked as if Emeril, Paula, and Christina were called in to consult for this part of the Resort. There was Revere Wear, metal mixing bowls, an ice-bucket and corkscrew, there were wooden spoons, plastic spoons and metal spoons to be used for cooking. The only thing missing in my opinion was a steamer that could be set down in one of the pots for the steaming of fresh vegatables. There were even a set of steak knives, three other kind of knives for cutting and a cutting board!! A cooking spirit came over me and I broiled steaks, cooked fresh kale and made fried cabbage. The aroma from my food could be smelled in the hallway but in my opinion, it was not overwhelming. I loved the kitchen set-up complete with a microwave and diswasher. 11. BET was available on the cable tv. 12. The Computer Center has 8 computers and two laptop stations. The Center is opened nearly 14 hours a day. Internet access is free here, but you will pay for it in your room. There is also free-printing, up to 10 copies per person. 13. You can not hear any noise from neighboring rooms. . The down side of the experience. Now the following information is for those who might consider these as obstacles to their full enjoyment of the Resort. I did experience these things but I was able to withstand them: 1. This resort is very close to the airport, those not used to overhead plane noise may find this annoying. 2. The bath towels are rough and scratching. 3. I have a sensitive nose and there was an odor (in the hallway only) that I thought was natural gas (I inquired at the front desk; there is no gas on the property, the kitchens are all-electric). I found out it was some chemical used to maintain the sewage lines in the place. 4. The food served in the on-site restaurant is very basic; you may want to make that trip to the grocery store and get breakfast food, lunch food, and snack food. Plus the prices in the on-site place are high; breakfast for three was $30 and came in styrofoam carry-out containers. 5. Not everything takes place in Tower Two, you must go outside and walk about five minutes to get to Tower One and Tower Three; I didn't like this at all, mostly because it was cold and even snowed one day during our stay. 6. There is no daily maid service, please buy some Comet-type cleanser to clean the tub, bathroom sink, and kitchen sink. 7. There are no Gedeon Bibles in the nightstands as this is a private resort,; BYOB! 8. I can understand how check-in was a problem for those who have previously reviewed this property. I had to wait too, but only about 20 minutes. Additional Tips: Go to Ellis Island, it's a restaurant, casino,and brewery frequented by the locals. It's nothing fancy, but if you are willing to eat food that is better than McDonalds, but definitely not the Wynn, you will be pleased with the BBQ (after 4pm only) and the breakfast ( not served after 11am).

There is a coffee cart in the lobby that sells Starbucks, and a cafe on site for breakfast and lunch. They also have a great onsite convenience store if you need something. There is a shuttle bus trip daily to a local grocery store as well. One disappointment is that there is no maid service. Daily maid service is not typical of US timeshares, but, many times there is a midweek exchange of towels. This resort has a midweek \"trash and tidy\" that is priced by the type of unit you have. For the one bedroom it would have been $55! To take out the trash and give some new towels? If you actually wanted a \"clean\" it was $110. I personally thought this we crazy. There is a trash chute on each floor- easy to empty your own. The other dissapointment was the WiFi. $6.95 per day. In this day and age, at a Gold Crown resort, this should be included.

However, from then on the \"holiday experience\" improved by leaps and bounds! We were given free cookies by the check in guy, (probably as a result of the long queue) and he was most helpful in arranging a newly refurbished apartment with a firm bed for us as I told him that my husband had a bad back. We were not hassled to go on a time share presentation, but were given our free pack of goodies, deodrant, eye cream and mints etc. The luggage was whisked up to our apartment on the 8th floor, (not too high!!) and the apartment itself was spacious and very well decorated, probably one of the best apartments we have exchanged to over the last 12 years. We had a one bed apartment, the bed was so firm and it was a treat to have the jacuzzi bath in addtion to the large walk in shower. The free toiletries were a nice touch and I appreciated the washer dryer in the apartment. The whole apartment was decorated in gold and earth tones with lovely furnishings and fabrics. Whilst the pool area did not have sun all day, I was grateful for the shade as it was over 90 degrees most afternoons, and the pool was huge and pretty with the palm trees surrounding it. The free pool towels were a bonus and the security guys made sure the \"adult only\" pool was kept that way. I would certainly go back to the Wyndham if I was staying at Vegas again, if you don't mind driving to the casinos, as it's a fair walk to any of the big hotels in the heat, and with all the construction going on in Vegas at the moment, it's dusty and noisy if you are walking far.

The room was perfect for our needs and nice for the price (we paid 800$ net price for a week-long stay booked with an owner). Not as modern as the Signature (no plasma TV, just regular TVs), but it doesnt' matter much to us (at least) since we don't watch much TV when in Vegas (we save that for the rainy days elsewhere). Pools were moderatly crowded for a off-peak period (week after Labour day). Patrons were mostly retired couples and some families (probably much less than when school is off), so we had room to swim and sit by the pools. Nice jacuzzis, but downtime on those are a problem, as it is often in resorts - leaving at a certain day only one of the three open, and it was the smallest one (seats 3-4 persons max.). Another one remained on maintenance for a full week. On the other hand, the pool hours (6am-11pm) are a plus, since other hotels on the Strip often close their pool grounds soon after the sun goes down. And I've seen swimmers in the pools up to midnight - they are probably not too strict on the rules as long as you're not noisy. Nice gym too, and many other free activities (Wii and Nintendo console games, ping pong, computer use... all included) offered, some for a small fee (casino night, bingo & pizza, etc.). We didn't use the free shuttle to the Strip since we rented a car, but it's there. You can also walk to the Strip (10 minutes) - in our case, with a 100+F temperature all week, it was not an option. Also shuttle service (for a fee) is offered to Freemont Street, Red Canyon and other attractions, even grocery shopping, so you can go about without even driving and still see plenty. Very nice staff, everywhere and working hard (I've seen cleaning crews on duty all day long). The salespersons are not too bothering - a nice no is enough, no insisting. Don't expect much food outlet there, only a counter-service restaurant (no room service), which implies lesser \"star-rating\" than what other hotels would get with less to offer all in all. There is SO many options to eat in Vegas (and there is a in-room full kitchen) that this seems a relevant choice by this resort, at least in my opinion.

We had been camping for a week and were ready for civilization! Check-in was very fast, friendly and upbeat. We were in our room in about 15 minutes. Our 1 BR Deluxe unit was on a higher floor in the tower with the lobby. We did not have a balcony, but there were large windows in the bedroom and living room overlooking the courtyard and pool and we could see the top of distant mountains over the roof of the tower across the courtyard. Nice. The unit was clean, bright, nicely appointed and well maintained. The kitchen was fully equipped and everything worked; Living area included TV/DVD, comfortable seating, and good size dining table; Bedroom had king bed with a good mattress, whirlpool tub and vanity and the Bathroom had a walk-in shower; Washer/dryer set were in a closet off of the dining area. Our only problem was the door to the washer/dryer closet - it fell when we walked past it, shortly after checking in. We called maintenance and they were there within 30 minutes and replaced the door. GOOD SERVICE, CANNOT COMPLAIN! We were very comfortable at the Grand Desert. This resort is a large complex with several towers, underground parking as well as outdoor (got an underground spot first night and did not move until ck-out). The courtyards with pools & hot tubs have the feel of formal gardens with plants and statues. This is an oasis in the midst of nonstop activity! We did not spend much time in our unit - WE WERE IN VEGAS and Vegas kept us entertained - nonstop - for 3 days. We did not participate in any of the many resort activities, or actually use the pools (walked around the nicely decorated courtyards). We did use the computer room to catch up on our email (no WIFI in our room). We booked the shuttle to Fremont Street, and made reservations for a Vegas Show through the concierge. We always used the free shuttle to Harrah's (ran every 15-20 minutes from 9 a,m. 'til midnight and was punctual). This put us in the middle of all of the casinos. Sensory Overload & tired feet!! We went to the Member Services \"Update\" which was 'offered' at check-in. We scheduled for next morning (to get it out of the way). There was definitely an attempt to have us 'upgrade' our points, but the pressure was not too bad. We simply said that we had plenty of points. They were not as aggressive as some have been (about an hour). Of course Las Vegas is very entertaining. We spent most of our time walking around the casinos (gambling a little), admiring the posh shops, taking in the sights and eating lots of great food. It is true that you lose track of time inside the casinos. One evening we enjoyed the light show (awesome!) on Fremont Street - This is the original Las Vegas that we remember from 1969 (minus the light show). One evening we saw \"Jubilee\", a good Vegas Revue. The Grand Desert is a quiet retreat and a great place to relax between shows, gambling, eating, and walking around seeing the many Vegas attractions.

My wife and I went last minute for a weekend, so we booked only a 1BD Deluxe unit. The building and amenities are newer. This new tower has its own pool and jacuzzi, though much smaller than what is at the main tower. It is however, much more peaceful at this tower - so if you do not have kids, I would suggest staying at this tower. The unit was nice (though the AC was not working - but it was luckily not the middle of summer, and there was no need for it). Very typical of the newer Wyndham timeshare units being built. Nothing was too elaborate or over the top - just a bit above average. As always, the amenity of having your own kitchen, washer, dryer, dishwasher, dining room, and living area, make a \"timeshare\" unit incomparable to a \"hotel\" unit. If traveling in a group, or with children, having these simple amenities are very convenient. On a prior stay, we were in a regular 1BD unit, and we did not like the layout very much. We were also in the original tower, and it is much louder on that side. I would try to get a Deluxe unit when possible. There are many activities, and many families. The pool area is decent, and with all the kids and families, it is easy to make new friends. There is a shuttle that goes to Harrah's, so if you do not have a car, you can get to the major \"Strip\" area fairly easily. The Hard Rock is also within walking distance. The Presidential suites are noticeably nicer, so if you can get one of those, it is worth it (at least in my opinion). We are going for a few days in September, and have booked a 3BD - so I will report on how that went after that trip. Of course there is no casino here, and if you want to have a wave pool, or lazy river, and be in the midst of the grandeur and action that the casinos have to offer, this is not the place to be.

We were only approached once, at check in, to do the timeshare presentation. We gave a firm no and had no further problems. I think staying on the strip has its pros and cons. It is nice to be able to go right out the door and be on the strip, but off strip is quieter and less hectic. We did not use the shuttle or attend any of the planned activities at the Wyndham.

The property is beautiful, and our room was VERY nice. The staff were very nice, and made attempts at being helpful, but on a couple of occassions ended up not providing the help we asked for, which is why we're giving it 4 stars rather than 5. Overall property: Very beautiful place, with two outside swimming pools--one for adults only, which was nice to get some peace and quiet while the kids had fun in the other one. It took 15 minutes to walk from our room to the strip--another 5 minutes to the MGM or Monte Carlo. They provide a shuttle service every 30 minutes to Harrah's, but we had a car and drove most of the time. Room: We had a one bedroom suite, which was extremely nice. Full kitchen with cooking/eating utensils, place settings for 4, fridge, stove, microwave, dishwasher, coffee pot, toaster, blender. There was a washer/dryer in the room with two loads-worth of laundry detergent. The bathroom was very big with a large soaking tub, glass shower and separate vanities. Bedroom was good sized with TV, closet and a safe, and the bed was EXTREMELY firm, too much so. Living room had TV, DVD/VCR and stereo/CD changer. Amenities: Pools, hot tubs, workout center, gift shop, deli, computer room with several internet-connected PCs, WiFi,activity center with pool tables, ping pong, arcade games, XBox, Wii, Playstation. They have tons of daily activities including water aerobics, Bingo by the pool and a \"dive in\" movie by the pool. There were a few things that would have made this a hands-down 5-star resort. We called for extra towels, which were never delivered, even after 3 calls. We called maintenance because the stereo wasn't working, and they never showed up. I figured out that unplugging it and plugging it in again fixed the problem. In each of these cases, the staff did seem to care, the results just never came. WiFi: you can pay extra to access it in your room, or you can go to the computer room for free access. We never could get it to work even in the computer room, and neither could anyone else we talked to. At a place like this, I would expect free in-room WiFi or hard connection. As this is a timeshare resort, some may not like the push to get you to go to another presentation. We didn't mind, as we spent an hour eating breakfast while someone talked to us--we didn't receive a lot of high pressure, which may have been due to the fact that we're already with a travel club rather than Wyndham owners. For our time, we got $125 in dining certificates that are redeemable at several nice places on the strip. Overall, it was a fabulous experience, and we will absolutely be staying there again on our next trip to Vegas. We bought groceries at a nearby Vons, which saved us a lot of money on food.

The Wyndham is located about 5 to 10 minutes from the airport and is only a few blocks off the strip in the area of the MGM. Check in at the Wyndham went very rapidly. The condo itself was magnificient, and had all the luxuries you could ever want. My wife claims her bed was the best she ever slept on and I tend to agree with her. The jacuzzi tub was big enough for both of us and sat just off the bedroom and a bathroom. The tub was more like a regular jacuzzi than a bathtub. It had a nice romantic atmosphere to it. The bathroom had a super large shower area. The only negative thing about the shower was the water pressure could not be controlled, and the water pressure was so strong that it actually hurt when it hit you.

They were very eager to give us directions, call us a taxi, answer any questions we may have, and just real courteous, willing to go the extra mile to make our stay that much more special. I should also include in this review that I paid $360.00 dollars for the 3 nights we stayed there, and looking back on it, that was a steal of a price for the services that we received.

First, I am 29 y.o. attorney who was taking my girlfriend (also under 30) to vegas for the first time, a couples trip for Valentines day. A two night stay. Positives: -The one bedroom apt we had was roomy and full of everything needed for an extended stay (microwave, blender, fridge, oven, etc...). The room was very well done. - If you stay there, i recommend staying on the side so you can see the strip (one side of the hotel faces vacant lots) and on a higher floor. -The room is equipped with a nice stereo and tv - Generally nice staff, no complaints about that - No casino in the hotel -- good and bad i guess Negatives: -First, please note that this place is OFF THE STRIP. What does that mean to someone whose never been to vegas? It means that to get to the Strip, where most everything is, you are going to have to take the shuttle. Or take a nice walk, (which isn't too bad, just hope its not one of those days where the nevada winds reach over 50 mph which it was for us, or a day when it reaches 100 degress...forgettaboutit). The shuttle supposedly comes every 15 minutes, but we found ourselves waiting longer than that...and, they don't let u know when it comes either, it waits for under a minute then takes off, so if you miss...you'll have to wait another 15. The alternative is to walk and its a pretty long walk if you include the walking you're going to do on the strip and in the hotels...Note also, I'm from NYC where walking is never a problem and I'm saying the walks are pretty long. If you look at the map, it looks like its only a few blocks from stuff...just note that one vegas 'block' is like 5-10 NYC blocks if you can relate. - Also note, the shuttle only goes to Harrahs, not various stops up and down the strip; and the shuttle stops after a certain time so don't count on it if you plan to hit up one of the many clubs in vegas. - What happens next if you don't use the shuttle -- you have to take the local cabs which will run you on average of 10+ bucks to go less than a mile. We ended up taking cabs most of the time and it became a bit expensive. - Lastly, the 10am check out is NO JOKE. It doesnt seem bad while you're reading this review, because most places give you a bit of a grace period. Not here. They want your @$$ out, or a $100 fee if you stay til even 11am!!! So essentially, if you plan to go out the night before and enjoy the nightlife...know that you will be paying for it in the morning; literally and figuratively. This really hurt our trip because we enjoyed a nice night out on valentines day the night before but had to be rushed out the next morning. Our flight didnt leave till late that day so even a little extra time to get stuff together would have been great and left me with a better feeling about the place. Conclusion: If you're an older couple (my parents, lol), couple with kids or a business traveler who has to be in vegas for like at least a week, the wyndham might be better and some of my complaints may not apply. However, if you are a younger person looking to be submersed within everything vegas has to offer in a few days, this place might put a nice damper on that. Making a choice between staying out or making your 'curfew' to make the shuttle back is no decision that I would want to put on anyone looking to have a good time. Stay on the strip.

The sofa bed was not so comfortable but was ok to sleep on. All the bedlinen was clean. The apartment was fully kitted out with all the cutlery & pots & pans though we never used it. Its a pity that they never had compliplmentary tea bags though there was ample coffee for the coffee filter however we are tea drinkers!!! The bathroom was a decent size for all of us to leave our toiletries on the vantity unit. Shower was powerful which was great to have. There were plenty towels in the bathroom however I think Wyndham need to take note & replace them with a new set, the towels had there day & were fraying at the sides & looked pretty warn out. Buy some new towels for the resort!!!!! The bathroom had the standard toilet & bath soap, shampoo & conditioner. There isnt a daily cleaning service in the apartment but they do come midweek to clean up & give you fresh towels. The option is there for a daily clean for a fee. Check In & Check out was easy & quick. We only used the shuttle bus once as we had hired a car but it turns up on time and does run from Hurrahs until 11.30pm back to the resort. We never used the pool or hot tubs but my friend put her her hand in the pool one evening & the water was warm so even in the cold if you really fancied it, you could take a swim. I used the internet facilty in Tower 2 - 3rd floor often, which was super fast. There is free use for 30 minutes & you can print out upto 10 pages free. Thereafter 10cents per page. I have to say reading some of the previous reviews, I was concerned that i may get harrassed from the sales people, but not once was I approached, however did get a call from someone at reception for a chat but we never were in the apartment during the day much to return the call to ask what their call was about. All in all it was a comfortable place though the corrindor carpets do need a change.

We enjoyed taking the shuttle to Harrahs every day and going to the many casinos. You can also pick up other shuttles at the back of Harrahs were you are left off. This is a full service resort with concierge service and bellhops. Everyone was pleasant and helpful with all our questions. The shuttle to shop for groceries turned out to be a fun morning with everyone being in the vacation mode. They had some nights with complimentary snacks and drinks.

Apparently (and this was at 10pm) the room(s) were not ready and we had to wait while the desk clerk called up several times via walki-talki to whoever was fixing up the room. The condo itself was very nice, much much better than you would get in a motel from a typical strip hotel and, having purchased the week from eBay, we got a significant discount from what we expected to pay. We're not a big fan of the timeshare concept and this was the first time we were going to be staying in one so we were a bit apprehensive about pressure to buy from someone. We had no reason to be apprehensive. Every employee we met during the stay was friendly. We were asked once (and once only) about attending a sales presentation and when we refused, there was no negative attitude or pressure. The employees put on a halloween haunted house (GREAT job) for the guests. Travel to and from the Wyndham was easy and while it's not located actually on the strip, it's only a couple blocks off (use the shuttle if you can). At night, it's less than a $10 cab ride from the Bellagio (example) so even if you're out later than the shuttle ride itself, it's pretty cheap to get around. Parking is a bit of a problem if you get in late. We were in building 3 in the back and sometimes it was a hike to get from the car to the entrance to the building. Overall, the condo was clean though it is starting to show its age a bit with worn carpet and older tv's (cable service is not good - few clear channels). It was VERY quiet - while the hotel was absolutely packed - we never heard any guest noise whatsoever either through walls or from the hall. There were security people all over the parking lot every evening (fewer during the day) --- and you needed a room key in order to operate the elevator. The only negative I can really think of is the loudness of the washer / dryer (we decided to do a load of laundry one morning) but, on the other hand, where else do you get to use a washer / dryer in your room???

The room was super-clean with the kitchen extremely big and complete with anything you would need. The large jet tub was a treat and thewasher-dryer complete with detergent was used AND loved by all!!The location was also top-notch because u could walk ten minutes to the strip, which is about the same u would do thru a casino, or u could take the shuttle which runs every 30 mins. and never ONCE was too full to take us to the Harrah's casino, which is in the middle of everything. This hotel is so cool even the shuttle bus drivers were friendly!! There is not one single thing me or any of my travel companions could or would complain about.

The Wyndham, is more average than above average, it gets it above average only by being somewhat close to The Strip and other store and restaurants nearby. The Location, is like 2 1/2 long blocks east from The Strip. And halfway between the meat of the southern part of casinos on The Strip. Even though Harmon is a busy street, it can get a little lonely and unsafe at night. The Wyndham does provide a shuttle to the Harrah's Hotel and Casino every 20-30 minutes, from 8:30am to 10pm. Check-in was a snap. As for parking at the Wyndham, it's fairly vast and close. The way the building is situated and where the Elevators are located, it forces you to enter the Resort via the main lobby on either side of the Resort. The other two corners have no entry way. There ought to be an alternative way to get into the Resort other than through the main lobby. Getting to the room and finding the room impeccably clean and set for us was pleasing. The next order of business was getting the apparent Third Party Wi-Fi internet. The Resort doesn't offer any Wi-Fi themselves. The third party that they have you call is a company called Resort Wi-Fi, or Pronto Networks. It costs $29.95/week, or $39.95/month. Email receipt gives the name Pronoto Networks. The leaflet given by the Wyhndam gives the name Resort Wi-Fi. Anyhow, I took the plunge for one week. Despite my wireless reading the connection as (unsecured wireless connection), I still went ahead and used passwords and such over it. If I find any problem with this way, I will update this review ASAP. To add insult to injury, the speed is atrocious. According to BroadbandReports.com, I got an average of 42 Latency, 436 Kb/s download, and 476 Kb/s upload. And via Yahoo Internet Speed Test, I got an average of 416 Kb/s download, and 500 Kb/s upload, plus a throughput of 46 seconds. All in all, it's the only internet available other than dialup. For other negatives, the walls here at the resort are a little thin. If you are quiet on your side, you can hear all sides, not loudly, but you can hear them, if you really try. Last but not least, the couch/bed in the living room, like many a Hotel rooms, sucks big time. Why can't they work on this old pastime of an extra bed? I had to sleep on the floor a couple of night, or just on the couch. All in all, it was a great stay. Nothing to write home about. It did what it did.

The master bedroom was large with a king bed, and a good closet. The master bath was HUGE with separate shower, jacuzzi tub, double sinks, and a washer/dryer. The finishes were very nice in the unit. It also had a full kitchen with dishwasher and dining area. The grounds are well kept and pretty. The pool area is very nice with the adult pool being raised up from the family area. The pool was clean and well maintained. There were ample towels available and the pool chairs were AWESOME! Very plush cushions, really comfy! (But beware that the frames are wrought iron so they get VERY hot in the desert sun!) I think there were several umbrellas around, although we were there to get a tan so we didn't really look for one. There is a snack bar near the adult pool where you can get food and drinks, which was great. The only thing that would've made it a better pool experience would be a swim-up bar. The location of the resort is not bad. We were about 4 blocks from the strip. The only bummer is that not only are you off the strip, but when you get there you are almost at the end. It would've been nicer to be more in the middle of the strip. But it is nice that there is a free shuttle to Harrah's. Unfortunately, it doesn't run very late. But that was definitely nice to use during the day. Overall I had a very pleasant stay at this resort. There were a LOT of families there. This timeshare definitely caters to big families with lots of kids. But it's such a big place it didn't really bother me. Only one time there were some obnoxious kids playing in the elevator. Oh, my only other complaint is that the wi-fi access which we had to pay for did not work in our room. We had to go to the internet room to get online. But otherwise we had a great time.

I stayed in a 2 bed suite on floor 11, with a view over the pool area - the main bedroom had one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept in and a large whirlpool bath, as well as a walk-in shower. In common with most timeshare resorts, the apartment came with all the usual conveniences - second bathroom, washer/dryer, full kitchen - and there was plenty of room for 4 adults and two kids. The pool area is excellent, with an adults and kids pool, plenty of shade from the hot desert sun and the most comfortable sun beds that I have ever seen, without having to pay a premium for their use. The concierge was extremely helpful and efficient, booking all our trips and shows with minimal fuss - you can trust their advice. The only drawbacks - there is no bar and only a small snackbar on site (the food was good and well priced for Vegas), although the resort runs a wine and cheese party for free once a week. Some guests were hassled by timeshare salesman (and there is obviously a big sales drive going on), but we were not even approached - could be because we are UK visitors, or maybe we didn't fit their profile, but it was a relief that we weren't approached (you will be pounced on in just about every other resort hotel on the Strip). Would I stay there again? I think that I would - it suited us to be away from the 24x7 buzz that permeates every resort hotel on the strip, although I can see that others would visit Vegas specifically for that.

Well equipped kitchen had a full sized fridge, stove, microwave dishwasher, coffee maker, blender and plenty of cups, glasses, dishes and silverware. We never cooked in the room so I can't comment on the cookware, The lobby was large and there were plenty of places to sit. There is no valet parking, and at night spots can be hard to find without a good walk. Our bellman not only brought in the bags, but he turned on the ice maker in the freezer and went downstairs to get us some maps and coupons. There was good reception on the televisions with a nice selection on channels for kids. Air conditioning in the room was good but a little noisy. Also there were only two options, really cold or off.. Although there was a thermostat, it turned the air conditioning on when you set it at 68 and turned in off at 70 , so you if you liked to keep the room at 71, you couldn't. 68 was a little cool for our tastes. Rooms were quiet - you couldn't hear noise from adjoining rooms or hallways. We were told we'd have a view, and we did- of the parking lot. The pool area was extraordinary. Nice padded lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas gave you choice of shade or sun. The big issue was the pool water was cold - despite the 112 degree weather. There was one pool for families and one for adults only. A nice idea, but the staff did not enforce the \"over 18\" rule in the adult pool. There was a cute little cafe/deli by the adult pool where you could get breakfast or lunch and the food was pretty good. We ordered lunch there twice. Prices were reasonable and they had something for everyone from burgers to salads. We were never badgered to take the timeshare tour. We decided to have a look, and the salesperson was very nice and low pressure. We were never pressured to buy and were treated respectfully as were my in-laws. My father in law wanted time to think about upgrading his membership and he was allowed to meet with the sales person again the next day. Her name was Rita and she was great. If we weren't turned off by the maintenance issues we would have bought. For our time, we were given three free buffet coupons at the Rio and two half off coupons for Harrah's buffet. It was well worth the 45 minute investment to eat at the two best buffets in Vegas. The staff at the desk were helpful and offered us coupons for free buffets at Terrible's hotel and casino. It wasn't worth going there even for free. The name says it all. Now on to our complaints. The toilet in the guest bedroom ran and, despite their \"twenty minute guarantee\" it was never fixed in five days. No maid service unless you wanted to pay extra (but there was a washer and dryer in the master bath) so you could wash your towels yourself . On one evening, we were coming back from a casino and the place was overrun with teenagers. There was a whole Taco Bell \"chalupa\" thrown on the floor near the elevators. The next morning, my husband and son went to the pool for an early swim. There were no clean towels, all the dirty towels from the previous day were still in the bin and the pool was filthy. For my nine year old to call it disgusting says it all. When we mentioned the maintenance and cleanliness concerns to the staff they told us they were having housekeeping \"issues\" and gave us an apology. We probably would not stay there again if we had to pay the going rate of $180/night.

Then while doing laundry we noticed that the dryer was making a very loud noise when we were drying our clothes. There was also a mysterious puddle of water coming from under the washer. We had maintenance come a 2nd time to fix those problems. They only fixed the dryer and not the puddle. The puddle we dried up with towels but made a mess on the floor. We've only been there two days now. The closet doors for the laundry area and in the bedroom weren't on track. When we called for them to fix the water problem (for the 2nd time) they also fixed the closet door that contained the laundry. So it was nice to have everything fixed. Then we realized that there was no strainer. So we had to call down for that. Housekeeping brought that up. Next was the ice maker. It didn't work and made funky noises. They fixed that pretty fast. There are two TV's in the condo. One in the bedroom and one in the living room. The TV in the living room didn't have cable. Well it did but someone turned off that feature. I finally figured out how to turn it back on the day before we left. We paid for the \"wireless internet\" that was supposed to work in the room. It didn't. They only place it worked well was the pool and hotel lobby area. FYI, they provide 2 or 3 free computer rooms which is what I would've opted for if I knew the wifi wasn't going to work in our room. I talked with another guest who was facing the pool, and he said it wouldn't work for him either in his room. On the 3rd or 4th day, we attempted to do the dishes. Only to find out that the water supply had been turned off (probably when they were trying to fix the puddle under the washing machine). We had maintenance up for that. And to top it off, the last night of our stay, we really just wanted to be by ourselves and enjoy our dinner that we cooked when we realized the frig sure isn't very cold. Our food was going bad in there because it apparently hadn't been working all day. Once again we had the maintenance guys in our condo. They were in there for over an hour (both really nice guys but...). They had to bring us a new refrigerator! We had to throw away some food. All in all, we sure got to know the maintenance guys really well. It's just when you pay good money to go to a nice place, we just wanted some peace, quiet, and privacy. It's tough to feel at home when you have sweaty (but nice) maintenance guys in your room. Other than that stuff, we enjoyed our stay. The small deli is reasonably priced and has excellent food. It's nice that this place isn't a casino but one thing that grew to be annoying was all of the time share presentations. We're hanging out by the pool and every 30min - hour you'll see a salesman bringing a couple all around the pool area. I understand that they have to sell the units but it was a bit of an invasion of privacy when you're just trying to relax by the pool. When we checked out we expressed some of our disappointment but felt as if the check out lady didn't care. If I was the manager there, and I had some guests that needed maintenance in there 5 times (during a 7 day stay), I would've personally apologized. We got no kind of apology or recognition of our troubles, what so ever. We probably won't be staying here again.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cGreat with small kids\u201d", "Author": "sdlivin76", "ReviewID": "UR8191265", "Content": "My family stayed here for one week in April and loved every minute of our stay.

I am glad to share with you that this resort more than exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a family-friendly resort in Las Vegas and don't mind being a block behind the Strip, this resort is wonderful. Make sure to ask for a room in building 1 or 2 with a courtyard view. Building 3 is a little removed from the other buildings. Buildings 1 and 2 form a hexagon shape with the pools in the middle and building 3 has a parking lot between the other two. Also, odd number rooms in building 1 face the courtyard and the even #'s face out into the parking lot and an apartment complex. If you get a room in building 1, any rooms over #43 (ex. 445,545,645, the first number represents the floor level) will face the side wall of building 2. The grounds are kept immaculate. Daily Housekeeping is not included in your rental rate and does cost extra if you require it. The pools were very nice and furnished with iron lounges with extra thick pads, and patio sets (with umbrellas). I especially liked the 11:00 closing time, which my kids took advantage of several times. I had a room on the fourth floor facing the pool and never heard the pool noise. I rented a car so going back and forth to the Strip was never an issue. The resort does offer shuttle service to the Strip until 10:00. If you are wondering if the sofa couches are comfortable, they aren't. Bring an air mattress. I booked this resort through Orbitz which offered a lower rate then the resort's online reservation system.

Rooms at hilton were sold out for some of the nights so I got creative and found this timeshare. I knew that I was giving up excitement and glitter of the strip but I go to vegas all the time so getting off the beaten path was ok. I got a rental car and the hotel was easy to find and close to airport. In fact I could see the airport from my room. The first night I checked in I was in tower 3 which is newest tower--there were some \"stains\" on the sofa that really bothered me so I asked to move to another room. I was told that tower one had been renovated so I moved there. Big mistake--this area is heavily traveled and the lobby is worn and dated. The rooms had new linens and carpet but the decor was dated. I had to beg to go back to tower 3 and they charged me a 100 cleaning fee!! (although I did not use the room??) Not fair but what was I to do if I wanted to move back? I will say that tower one had a phenomenal work out center--large,clean and lots of nice equipment. The sauna was out of order though and the gift shop and cafe was closed at 8 pm--sign said they closed at 10 pm but doors were locked and lights were out. Back to tower 3--the master bedroom offered a glimpse of Mandalay bay and MGM hotels and overlooked apartments on Koval street. The bed was comfortable but the linens were just ok--nothing to write home about ;). There was a TV, large closet and safe in the master bedroom. The second bedroom, with two twin beds, gave a closer view of the apartment tops and the airport. The 2nd bath was just outside the door to the smaller bedroom and had a tub/shower combo. The master bath had a jacuzzi, toilet with a door for privacy and tiled shower. (The last day that I was there, I discovered a stack washer/ dryer and two packages of Tide detergent behind a door that I hadn't noticed). There were ample towels, toilet tissue and kleenex in both baths. I rented a 2 bedroom/2bath condo, btw. There were some hotel size amenities. I was also given a bag of samples when I went to concierge to pick up a parking pass---nice brands like olay, eucerin and dial soap. The full size kitchen was EXCELLENT. Fully stocked to cook full meals and very clean. Stove, oven, microwave, garbage disposal, etc. All utensils, glasses, bowls--I never looked for anything that I did not find. The living room had a large screen TV. Some of the lamps in the rooms did not work but I did not complain--just moved to lights that worked. There is internet but you have to pay for it. There is a business Center in Tower 3 but it does not open until 10 am. The business center in tower 2 opens earlier but I never visited it. I had a rental car so came and went as I pleased--sometimes the parking lot was full especially late at night. There was usually security present and you have to use a room key in tower 3 for elevator, pool, work-out, etc so I felt safe. It was easy, central location and I felt close to everything--(not for walking but for driving.) I really enjoyed my stay at the grand desert and after the initial \"bump\" when I checked in, do not have any complaints. Although I was close to the airport, I did not hear any noise from the planes. I was going to take pictures but my camara was confiscated at the Celine Dion show and I did not retrieve until I checked out. (don't take camaras to shows in vegas--they will be taken, tagged and returned after show). The line to retrieve after the show was unbelievably long so I went back later.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite that was on 14th floor that overlooked the strip. The good: The property was modern and was easy to get to by car from the airport. The hotel is located on Harmon Ave between the Planet Hollywood (formerly the Alladdin) and the HArd Rock. The property was modern and the amenties were new. The suite had one king sized bed and a pull out couch. There are two TVs, a DVD player, and stereo. The rooms have a refrigerator with ice maker, stove, oven, microwave, and utensils.

We could hear the crying baby next door, the maid vacuuming at 8am upstairs, conversations in the hallway and people walking upstairs. These rooms are worse than the apartment that I live in. The times I went to use the pools they were full of kids and even the adult pool was or they were full of trash. The computer were full or broken all the time due to the fact there were only four and one was broken. The times that I got the computers were slow and constantly had hardcore porn popups on the screen which were disturbing. Everyday the people were trying to sell us a timeshare at the property.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: staff are courteous but slow, concierge is staffed mainly by college-aged persons with little knowledge of customer service, the wi-fi is unpredictable at best and the common computing area is not staffed - kids tend to stay on computers too long/break them, lots of 18 - 25yr. olds loiter in the lobby between 10:00pm - 3:00am waiting for limos or heading out to the clubs meaning it is always congested and noisy at these times. OVERALL: We were seeking something through RCI and didn't care about our proximity to the strip. This is a great resort to meet those needs. We planned a full range of parks, museums, and strip activities to keep us busy so we did not take part in the resort-offered trips or the sales pitch session for timeshare owners, and they were cool with this. A family-friendly resort there is a pretty hotel-type attitude around the premises. The shuttle runs to and from Harrahs, which we took once.

W. Marriott, and Doubletree) over the years. If you are planning your first visit to Vegas...then by all means, stay on the Strip and experience all that Vegas has to offer. If, however, you have been there, done that, and are looking for superb accommodations, with less hustle and bustle, then consider the Fairfield Grand Desert Resort. We just got back from our 7-nite booked stay (July 27 through August 3, 2006) at the wonderful Fairfield Grand Desert Resort. We booked it through a owner, and got a wonderful rate of $469 for the week (taxes included) for a deluxe 2-bedroom lockout. The accommodations were fantastic! We got in late on Thursday nite, and had no problems with Check-in, or getting our parking pass from the members desk. We did NOT have to sit through a time-share presentation. We were asked once, and politely declined. No further discussion necessary. When we arrived in our room, we were shocked to discover that it was roomier than most apartments! We had a large living room, a dining table that sat 6, a full size kitchen with refrigerator, (and Icemaker!), dishwasher, and fully stocked cooking and eating utensils. They even provided kitchen towels, dish rag, and soap for the dishwasher and sink. The bedroom in the main unit had a king size bed, a bedstool, large closet, and TV armoire/dresser, and 2 nitestands. Just off the main bedroom was a large (2-3 person) Jacuzzi tub and sink. Then in a separate area, they had a huge shower (approximately 8 by 4 feet!), toilet and another sink. Our two-bedroom lockout was actually two separate but attached, one-bedroom units, with the second unit being slightly smaller, but fully equipped nonetheless. The second unit also had a kitchen, albeit, smaller, with a smaller stove and dishwasher, and full size refrigerator. The bathroom was smaller, but fully functional with a full size tub/shower combo and sink and stool. My son, who turned 21 on this visit, appreciated having the 2nd unit to himself. When he wanted his privacy, he just closed the door that was located between the two rooms. Each unit came equipped with a stacked washer/dryer, so we were able to do laundry during our one week stay, which made packing much easier, and less laundry to do once we got home! Because our condo had two fully working kitchens, we went grocery shopping early in our stay, and bought groceries to last us the week. We saved a lot of money by making our own breakfasts and having our own drinks, snacks and water on hand. There is no room-service or bar located on this property! Keep in mind, this is a timeshare property and not a hotel. There was no daily maid service. However, if you needed more towels, it was never a problem. We discovered that the pool towels are actually softer (and larger) then the bath towels provided. (Pool towels are located under the main sinks in the bathrooms or available at the front desk in Tower 2) With the washer and dryer in your unit, you could freshen up your own towels in a jiffy! The resort offers a free shuttle to Harrah's, where you can pick up another shuttle to the Rio. We utilized the shuttle to Harrah's and Rio when it was available, but ended up taking a cab back on most nights since we tended to stay out later than 12:30 a.m., which is the last run for the shuttle from Harrah's. (depending on where you coming from, cabs ran 9-15 dollars for the three of us back to the resort.) The activities at the resort were nice. I took advantage of the 8:30 a.m. water aerobics class on the first day, and got a good solid workout from that. I was not able to drag myself out of bed that early on the other mornings, however. The pools are nice, and refreshing, even with the outside temperature hitting over 102 degrees. The pools felt cool, but not too cold. They had two pools, one for adults, and one for families, and they did a decent job of keeping the kids out of the adult pool. I only noticed kids in there for a short time before they were asked to leave. We did not have any trouble finding shaded areas around the adult pool, and for those sun worshippers, there was plenty of room for them as well. The resort hosted several pool parties during the week we were there, offering wine, and beer (get there early, though.....on the weekends they tend to run out early!), frozen type margaritas, and snacks. They also had a live band on the weekend, and a D.J. playing music during the week. Since we did not have young children with us, I can't comment on the sponsored children's activities much, other than to say I saw a lot of kids staying at the resort, and they seemed to be enjoying themselves, especially those free snow cones during the pool party! (Some kids and adults were even enjoying the family pool at 2:30 a.m. when we returned to the resort a few times!) The only negative thing I would comment on was we had asked for a wi-fi enabled room. Evidently, not all rooms are wi-fi equipped. We pre-paid for a week of wi-fi service (29.95?) but had \"low to very low\" signal strength from our 4th Floor room for most of the week. Several times, we lost the signal completely, BUT if we went one floor below, to the \"main floor\" where the snack stand, store and pool area were located, we got an \"excellent\" signal. Since we were only one floor up from the \"main floor, this did not make sense to us. I contacted the front desk, and they suggested I call the wi-fi provider. The signal strength seemed to improve slightly after the call, and we were able to use it completely from the room after that. So, if you are PLANNING on using wi-fi from your room, you may not be able to do so, depending on room location, etc. For us, this was a leisure trip only, so the Internet requirement was not as crucial. Just something to keep in mind if you will be REQUIRING a stable Internet connection from the room. I understand they also have a \"business area\" with Internet access, but we never found the need to locate it. All in all, we had a great stay at the Fairfield, and I would definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "August 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keller, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHotel was great!\u201d", "Author": "Felicia184", "ReviewID": "UR5525680", "Content": "We arrived in the middle of the day and had to wait till 2pm to checkin but, it was only about 30 minutes and no line.

When we checked in, I noticed a big spinning wheel with prizes all around it. I asked if I got to win something but, only people going thru their \"update\" got to do it. I just had an update last month but, they let me do it, if I promised to listen to their \"45 minute thing\" which, always turns into 2 or more hours. So, I spun, said I got a free 5 X 7 pic and I decided my time wasn't worth wasting to get a stupid pic. Other than that, they were really nice. No one bothered us at all after that. The rooms were nice and clean but, mine was missing a baking sheet(which housekeeping brought to me within 20 minutes of my request).Everything we needed was in the room(dishes, towels, they give you beach towels if needed, too at the front desk, cooking utensils, appliances, dish powder and liquid, washer/dryer and detergent(2 packets, they will give you more if needed, papertowls, etc). They have a free shuttle to/from Harrah's about every 35 minutes. There's also a free shuttle to/from the Von's gracery store nearby every morning. There are 2 different times you can go. The bus was a bit crowded for the larger passengers but, everyone seemed to fit just fine. I think there's about room for 20 people on there, not sure. The concierge(don't remember his name, blondish haired 20 something guy) was helpful. The other ones probably were, too but, he's the one we talked to about dinner.

However, twice there were some rude and apparently illiterate people (there were a few signs stating the pool was for adults only) who brought from 1-8 children (we counted) that were loud, splashing, and quickly cleared the pool of adults wanting to enjoy some peace and quiet. THe first time we complained to management a security guard asked the family to leave, which they did. The second time, a security guard came, took a look at the pool, lingered for a while, talked into his walkie-talkie...and then walked away without talking to the offenders. I had to talk to the man myself to ask him to remove his splashing child. On Monday morning at 9 am (!!) we were woken up to the sounds of a DJ playing music in the family pool. It stopped at 10 am, but it were severely inappropriate in a hotel to wake everyone up at 9!! It didn't happen again (we checked out on Wed). The concierge is great. We enjoyed the pool for so long one day that we forgot about getting tickets to a show. The concierge made several suggestions and made some phone calls, getting us tickets to a show that night, including two free tickets.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, UT", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vegas Resort!\u201d", "Author": "DVC_Family", "ReviewID": "UR5432708", "Content": "We stayed at the Fairfield Grand Desert from July 1- 3 in a 2BR Deluxe in the new tower. We loved our room because it was right off the elevator on the 3rd floor, separated from all other rooms. It was perfect because we were there with another family (so 4 adults, 3 four year olds and 2 infants!) and we had two complete suites. The second suite had a smaller kitchen, but still had a living area with large tv and dining area, and a separate bedroom. We didn't have the greatest view (the building itself blocked our views) but it was so quiet and private - loved it! The suites were in great shape as I guess this is the new building. I did not see any maintenance issues at all, everything was in perfect working order and very clean. The staff was incredibly friendly as were the guests. We think the atmosphere here is conducive to that feeling. NO MORE casino resorts for us! We have stayed at the Luxor, TI, Monte Carlo, MGM, Circus Circus and probably a few I am forgetting, and they are so inconvenient, especially with children. This resort was great for families! We loved having the washer, dryer and refrigerator -- we own at Disney Vacation Club and are pretty spoiled by these types of accomodations now! The pool areas were very nice. Our building was separated from the main buildings and had it's own smaller pool. The big family pool was nice but difficult to find shade at during the day. We enjoyed it mostly at night, although I do agree with another reviewer here that the pool was filled with hair for some reason - more than I've ever seen anywhere else. But, the kids loved the zero entry pool and there were lots of resort pool toys floating around. We did not participate in any of the activities, but it did seem like the great ones were more during the week than on weekends. We also loved being able to park right outside of the hotel door as opposed to parking 10-15 minutes away from your room through a smoke-filled casino. This made everything very convenient for kids. I think this resort would also be excellent for those without kids and we did see people of all ages enjoying themselves. I would not suggest walking to the strip as everything is a lot further away than it seems. We would go back to the Fairfield in a hearbeat next time we are in Vegas.

You don't even need to hit the strip traffic at all. 3 swimming pools, two in the main court, one for family and the other one just for adult. Near the new building, they have one more family pool there. Kids love to soak in the water all day and you can stay with them during the day time next to the pool.

Love the Jacuzzi tub!! The resort offers a shuttle each morning to the local grocery store. This is a new feature!! You have to sign up for it the day before, but if you are looking for ways to avoid having to eat out all the time, this is the best way to go!! As well, they offer shuttle service over to Harrahs about every twenty minutes. This really helped us in not needing a rental car. We were able to navigate easily by using the shuttle to Harrahs, then to the monorail, or the Duece (the bus). As well, the resort offers some activities that we did particpate in. One was the Freemont Street Experience. For a small fee (i think $5 a person), they shuttled you to Freemont for about three hours of dinner and exploring. The shuttle would then return and take you back at a designated time. This is excellent so that you don't have to get a cab or rely on the bus. As well, they had another activity which was a Dinner and a Show. The show was the \"Rat Pack Tribute\". You pay the fee for dinner and a show, and they shuttle you over and back. The tribute was great.. the food at the \"hotel\" was not so great at all. But well worth the money. Only thing that we had to deal with was the Timeshare sale. They try to get you signed up to attend an \"update\" if you are a owner. The woman I dealt with was pushy about setting up a time when we checked it at the members' desk. Wouldn't take no for an answer. so I booked, but then did not show up. No phone call, no bother.. Yay!! The conceirge (sp) was great to have. if they can't get you good seats or they can't assign a specific seat,then they will tell you that it would be better to go directly to the box office to get them.

It easy to drive to any spot on the strip here and avoid major traffic. Harmon and Koval are much less traveled and parking is easy. You can walk to the strip from here, but it is a jaunt. This hotel is also very close to Hard Rock, Terribles, and Ellis Island Casinos. Pool and kids activities galore. My son (age 7) loved the junk food bingo, crafts, and balloon animal making activities. I also took the timeshare tour for extra cash.

That describes our stay here at the Grand Desert. It was an absolute joy staying here. The rooms were like an upscale apartment. We stayed in the 2 bdr. deluxe from Aug.28th. to Sept.1 and we had a strip view on the 13th floor. We were able to make our own meals which we figured saved us about 250.00 dollars for the 4 nights and 5 days that we were there, as opposed to eating on the strip and going to all the very expensive restaurants. We were able to do laundry and not have to pack so many clothes. We also brought our kids along with us and this place is excellent if you have kids. Even if you don't have kids there are two pools, one for adults and one for kids and they are seperated so if you don't wan't to be bothered by kids you won't be. They are also in the final stages of opening there third tower in October and that tower also has a pool and more privacy if that's what you want. The staff was tremendous, very helpful and the amount of activities they have there is just fantastic. There is so much to do there on a daily basis you don't even need to leave the place. If you bring your kids this is the place as they really have a lot to do for the kids and adults as well. It's only two short blocks to the strip, which takes you to the Aladdin, and if you go the other way you are a short walk from the Hard Rock Hotel. If you are lazy you will think it's a long walk to the strip but if you can walk a little it's not that far and they have shuttles runnning every half hour that takes you to Harrah's and the Rio. The do not have a restaurant but the do have a Cafe' for snacks and breakfast and lunch, but you do have a full kitchen in your room and isn't that why you came here to be able to cook your own meals. So don't be lazy, get out there go to the many grocery stores nearby, buy some groceries and cook your own meals, you will save hundred's of dollars and you can eat whenever you wan't!! The place is just gorgeous, the rooms are beauiful and spacious and this is coming from two people who are very paricular about there accomodations, as we have stayed in many timeshares across the U.S.A and this one is one of the best we have stayed at. Try it you won't be disappointed. We even took the timeshare presentation, all you have to do is say no, just smile and act interested and when it is time just say NO!! We recieved a lot of goodies for our time as we where only there for mayber 45 minutes and we got 50.00 cash, and show tickets for 4 to two different shows, and the show tickets were worth 30.00 each so we made out very well and the shows were great. Take it from us this review is worth noting as i read a lot of these reviews before we left on our trip and i could not believe that there would be any negative reviews for this place, granted this was our experience and others may have had some problems with staff, or were upset that there was no real fancy restaurant, or it was to far to walk to the strip, but ours was an experience of a life time!!", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dawsonville, GA", "Title": "\u201cNice, but would rather stay on the strip\u201d", "Author": "grjtoo", "ReviewID": "UR3807282", "Content": "I will start off my review by saying that, if you're coming to Vegas with kids, this would be the perfect place to stay.

We got in early (9am) and were told we'd have to come back at 2pm. Not a big deal, you're in Vegas with plenty to do so we went out. We came back at 2pm and were checked in only to find our room wasn't quite finished with the cleaning process. The pull out was out and unmade, towels in the middle of the floor and bottles of cleaner everywhere. We dealt with it and really did enjoy the room, especially the garden tub and seperate shower. Very nice. The computer says it has wireless internet, but only in certain rooms. Why in the world you wouldn't go the extra mile to make sure it's available in all is beyond me. They also talk about a \"kids\" and \"adult\" pool, but while we were there families were in both pools with kids of all ages. We were going to stay at MGM but chose Fairfield because we got a better price. That was a mistake. We ended up paying the difference first in cab fairs because we grew tired of waiting on shuttles just to go to Harrah's to then take the monorail and then in rental car costs as we got tired of taking cabs.

This was our first timeshare stay. We are not owners, but rented from an owner at the rate of $90 a night. We weren't required to attend a \"presentation,\" thank goodness. One of those in a lifetime is more than enough for anyone! We had a two bedroom deluxe room. It included a full kitchen with all (and I mean all) accoutrements, a dining area that could comfortably seat 6, and a living area with pull-out couch, 2 chairs, coffee table, side table, and entertainment armoire with tv, vcr and boombox. There was a full bath between the dining area and first bedroom. This bedroom had two full beds, nightstand, dresser, closet and tv. The master bedroom had a king bed, dresser, nightstand, tv, closet and safe. The master bath was just about the size of the bedroom, and had a jacuzzi tub, shower, and washer/dryer combo. The only thing I didn't like about the bathroom was that the doorway and open area above the jacuzzi opened into the bedroom, and there were no doors or ways to maintain privacy. The toilet area did have a door, but if you wanted to get up early and take a shower, there was no way to block the noise or the light from someone who wanted to sleep. Although our room was a \"deluxe,\" it was not as plush as the photos shown on the Fairfield website. The front desk was helpful at checkin. I talked to the concierges three times and they were only helpful once, when I asked them for specific directions on how to find a Target store. They were pretty useless when asked open-ended questions, which was rather surprising. This place is GREAT for kids. There are two large pools--one for 18 and over, which is really warm, and the family pool, which is cold. Go figure. Both pools are only 4-1/2\" feet at their deepest point, which is great for volleyball and water polo. The family pool is wonderful, because it's like being at the beach--it's at a very slight incline, so our three year old could wade about 15 feet out and still have her head above the water. There are plenty of noodles, rings and other pool toys. There's also a \"water activity area\" for kids, which is a gated area on a sport-court surface. It has several statues--frogs, fish, large balls--which squirt water. Press a button, and you get about 3 minutes of water play. The water here was freezing, but the kids loved it. There are activities all day long. Sign up early, because spaces were very limited. Our favorite was the Wednesday pool party--a DJ was out at the pool from 1-3, along with a clown making balloon animals for the kids, lots of games, and free snow cones and margaritas. The property has a free shuttle which goes to Harrah's. From there, you can then catch a shuttle to the Rio. We took the monorail and weren't impressed. It was a lot of walking to get to the monorail stations, which tend to be in the rear of these enormous casinos. The Fairfield is about 2 blocks from the Hard Rock, and about 4 long blocks from the MGM. I would walk to the MGM at night, although not in the day in the Vegas heat. I never saw taxis waiting at the Fairfield, so you would have to wait while the staff called one. The property advertises a restaurant--heh. Not quite. It's more like a snack bar at Target. Frozen pizza, wilted salads with iceberg lettuce, prepackaged breakfast rolls, and of course overpriced. The front desk advised that I could grocery shop at the onsite store, but the extent of the groceries seemed to be bread and strawberry jam. Never fear, there is a Von's a few miles away and the shuttle makes grocery store excursions in the morning. I would stay here again, but only with kids. I can't think of a better place to stay in Vegas if you're travelling with kids. There's lots for them to do, and you're less likely to empty your pockets entertaining the kids than if you're on the Strip.

Our first unit was on the 7th floor of the second building and while it did not smell like smoke it did have an awful \"someone left raw chicken in the disposal\" smell that was terrible. It also had a non-working dishwasher, missing drawers in the master bathroom, and missing throw pillows in the living room. The Fairfield maintenance staff came up to isolate the smell but could not.

The front desk was very accomodating and moved us to a 4th floor suite in the same building that afternoon. They claimed the could not smell anything but the maintenance guy the night before said he could smell it coming down the hall. (Helpful hint #3 - The hallways in these buildings are LONG.

It is a lie! They will try to get you to abandon RCI in favor of Fairfield points. The sales pitch is well rehearsed, but the buttom line is it will cost you more than $15,000 to do so. Of course you will be buying another timeshare in Vegas in the process, but getting a deed to \"a\" Las Vegas property, not necessarily the Grand Desert. When we said no, they asked us to wait while they got our free gift. That's when another agent stepped in and tried to sell us just points to use at Fairfields for more than $3300. When we again said no, the agent got so red faced in anger, we were concerned for his health. The unit was okay. There were some problems - the entry door was very difficult and noisy to open, the shower head in the guest bath malfunctioned, and the hot water ran out by 10:30 AM. I must give credit to the resort for sending a repairman to fix the shower and entry door the very day we brought these items to their attention. Also the mattress on the sofa bed is so thin, it is suitable for only a small child. One of our guests was injured by a piece of plastic with long staples within the sheets on a bed. Otherwise, the location is great.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loranger, LA", "Title": "\u201cTops\u201d", "Author": "SpunkyPony", "ReviewID": "UR3282025", "Content": "This is a Gold Crown (top-rated) timeshare resort that features luxury condos rather than simply hotel rooms.
