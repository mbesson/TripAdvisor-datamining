I cannot say enough how helpful and nice the staff were. I believe Turks (outside of the major tourist zones) are very nice and hospitable in general but the staff here went above and beyond. The hotel is small like many others in Sultanhamet so you really get a lot of personal attention. After we arrived the man at the check in desk invited us to come down and gave us loads of really good recommendations on where to go, what to see, where to eat, etc. and labeled them for us on our map. I admit, at first I was skeptical that he was just plugging the businesses of his buddies, but after we tried a few of his recommendations out we found that his info was actually really good and helpful. We stopped back by the desk several times during our stay to ask additional questions and received the same sort of helpful and informative responses each time. The rate included an airport pick up and breakfast. The breakfast was great, traditional Turkish foods and made to order omelets. It isn't served in a fancy setting on a terrace or anything but the food is good. Wireless internet is also included and was very reliable and fairly fast. We took a double room and it was everything we needed. Very clean with a nice shower. The location is convenient for sightseeing in Sultanhamet as it is walking distance to the Aya Sofia and Blue Mosque. I would say however that it is right on the edge of the major tourist area there which we liked. It allowed us to be able to go to a real local Turkish bath instead of one of the famous tourist ones (more pricey) but still be able to see the sights we wanted. Our return flight was overbooked so we actually ended up staying an extra night in a \"5 star hotel\" in Taksim paid for by the airline. The Basileus was better than the \"5 star\" in every way except the room was a little smaller. I strongly recommend the Basileus for anyone looking for a great hotel value in Sultanhamet.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Secluded and clean, good location\u201d", "Author": "NCWorldTraveler1963", "ReviewID": "UR127223543", "Content": "This hotel is staffed by three very nice guys who were more then helpful in showing off the Old Town of Istanbul.

Besides its history which have left its indelible mark of different cultures, the city is an intoxicating assault on the senses. From the calls to prayer from the minarets starting at early dawn to the taste of the food and visual aesthetics of its buildings and crafts, everything about this place will mesmerize the first time visitor. For this trip Instead of staying in a reliable hotel chain I decided to look for something with character in the old city. I used tripadvisor to search for the top properties in Istanbul and the Basileus was a perfect fit for my needs. I sent an email requesting the days that I needed and received a quick reply from Ekrem and Yusuf advising that there was availability except for the last day of my stay. However, I was told that if there was any cancellation, I would be assigned a room automatically, otherwise they would find me an alternate hotel nearby. I accepted the offer and decided to take a chance on my last night. The hotel is located in Sultanahmet and the location was really convenient to all the major sights in the area. One thing that you notice upon entering the hotel is the lack of a front desk, but instead you see a desk and with two chairs like a regular office setting. This layout provides a more intimate and personal contact between the staff and guests. Omar was the person in charge the night that I came in. He quickly assigned me a room and personally showed me to my room while carrying my heavy bag. The hotel does not have an elevator which might be a bit challenging for those who travel with a lot of baggage, but staff is always ready and willing to assist. My room was nicely appointed and roomy enough for a single. The bathroom was pretty spacious for a room of this size with hair dryer and a good supply of toiletries. Slippers are also provided in the closet along with a safe. The bed was a bit on the hard side (which I prefer) and I slept comfortably throughout my stay. The next morning I went downstairs for breakfast and upon entering the small room I was greeted with a nice buffet display. There was a wide assortment of choices ranging from hot items like sausages, potatoes and made to order omelettes that are brought to your table to fruits, cereal, cold cuts and cheeses along with plenty of breads, fruits, olives, tomatoes and cucumbers, not to mention some crepes and fruit preserves. Frankly you can make a meal out of this generous display that will fuel you for at least half a day. As someone with a degree in hotel and restaurant management, I know that this industry tends to be very competitive and that most properties can provide almost the same range of amenities and facilities. However, the truly differentiating factor between a good property and a truly exceptional one lies in its staff. It is in this area that the hotel truly made a lasting impression on me and that is why it is considered among the top properties in this site. Both Ekrem and Yusuf took the time to sit down with me and upon learning that this was my first visit to Istanbul, they offered me tips and advice about where to go, eat and shop. It was contagious to witness the enthusiasm that they displayed in taking pride of their city and how they wanted to share this knowledge with the guests, like a host entertaining friends on a visit. Needless to say, the information that I received from a local perspective proved to be invaluable and this was instrumental in my enjoyment of the city. On my last day, I was hoping that a cancellation would allow me to stay at the Basileus but unfortunately that did not materialize. However, Yusuf booked me at another property a few meters away at a \"special\" lower price and asked one of the staff members to accompany me there. He invited me to stop by later for some chat and tea which I appreciated. For those coming to Istanbul, if you need to make a call cheaply upon arrival, just go to the post office on the arrival level and use the private telephone there. They charge 0.50 turkish lira for the call which is quite cheap. If you are in the Sultanahmet area and need to go back to the airport, there is a shuttle service that charges 5 EUR per person and pick up you from certain hotels in the area. Inquire at your hotel to see if this service is provided. I found it quick and quite affordable. The Basileus is truly an exceptional hotel and I really enjoyed my stay there. During my travels I tend to stay at different properties and sometimes luxury ones, although pretty comfortable and efficient, sometimes lack a human touch that makes all the difference. The staff and the owner of the Basileus are in a 5 stars category in my book and I will choose them over all other hotels the next time that I go back to Istanbul.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in Sultanahmet!\u201d", "Author": "8achan", "ReviewID": "UR126609946", "Content": "We stayed here for a couple of nights, and we had a wonderful stay at this small hotel in Old Sultanahmet in Istanbul.

Our room was traditional, spotlessly clean and contained everything we needed including a free room safe. We could`nt wait to start to explore this amazing city and as soon as we could we were ready to go. The gentleman on reception was extremely helpful and give guidance on the best places to see day by day. He split the city up into zones and advised us on opening times for main sites, restaurants, and points of interest. Istanbul is not easy to navigate and this help and advice was invaluable. We stayed at this hoted for 4 nights, we received maid service everyday, the breakfast was very good and exceeded our expectations considering the price we paid for the hotel.

Initially we were four people but that increased to five and the staff was happy to accomodate us even though they were fully booked. We reached Istanbul very early in the morning so by the time we reached the hotel, it was only 7 30. Ekram greeted us and offered us breakfast and coffee. We were famished after a 6 hour flight from Karachi so breakfast and coffee was highly appreciated. After breakfast, Eko told us about the main sights of Istanbul and marked them all on a map. He also saw my things to do list of Istanbul and made me an itinerary. I have been to many hotels and never once has a member of staff helped us so much. Everyday, after we came back from out sightseeing, Yusuf and Muharrem would greet us and ask us how our day went. It was very cold so we would usually come back by 6 or 7 and we would just sit in the lobby and chat with the staff who were so friendly and amicable that we felt like we knew them for years. Yusuf and Mehmit recommended the restaurant Cesme which is right in front of the hotel and it was reasonable and had very good food. My friend (who was travelling with my family) and I used to sit in the lobby at night and talk to Omar who was usually on night duty (we miss you Omar and sorry for bugging you with questions all the time:)). Once, my iphone charger just stopped working and Muharrem gave me his for 2 nights in a row. The hotel is located a 5 minute was away from the main Sultanahmet district where you can find the Blue mosque and Ayasofya. The topkapi palace is a 5 to 10 minute walk away from the Ayasofya. The grand bazaar is also a 7 minute walk away from the hotel which makes it a prime location. Mind you, Istanbul is a slopey city so be prepared to walk uphill. A LOT. The street where the hotel is located has many shops and even a hammam for those interested. The rooms in the hotel are clean and cosy. The bathrooms are new with plenty of hot water which is a must for the cold nights of Istanbul. The internet in the hotel was very good and there is a computer in the lobby which everyone can use. We used to to upload pictures and also to stream a football match. The breakfast buffet is vast and delicious with an option of an omelette. Tea and coffee facilities are always available in the lobby. Overall, i would have to stay that my stay in Istanbul would never have been this much fun without the Basileus Hotel and its wonderful staff.

I did even need to edit my previous review as I thought I missed some points that I must add so everybody will get every information as detail as possible. Here we go: First, They respond to my email very prompt. Since i was taking my mother and parents in law (age range 60-70 and one with wheel chair) with me, I need to ensure everything are planned properly. Ekram and Yusuf always replied to my email right away. Though we are 5 hours different. At early time, they've already making feel at ease. Ive told them that I would bring 3 elderly and they were not able to use stair. And Yusuf and Ekram booked me 2 room in the first floor near the reception area. So this more than easy for my Mom. Second, I didnt need to pay any advance to secure my booking. What I need to do is to give my credit card number. But they didnt charge anything on my card. I think this is reasonable enough to ensure my booking is confirmed. At the end, when I pay cash, I've got 5% discount Third, cannot beat the location!!! especially for the first timer that needs to see the must have site such as blue mosque and hagia sophia. Its literally very close.. its probably only need 3-5 minutes walk depend on the pace. Just watch out that istanbul is an up and down steep hill city. So you need to bring your most comfortable shoes. Moreover, what I love about the location is that its not too loud and its not too quite. Its like living in a decent comfortable neighborhood. Around the hotel, i can find mini market, cake shop that sell turkish delight (so i dont have to go to spice market or grand bazaar), coffee shop, variety of restaurant, meat shop, fruit&vegetable shop, hamam (where you can take turkish bath) and even barber shop. Love love love that area so much Fourth, they serve a great breakfast. This is my favorite time of the day. They serve variety of foods from bread, cheese, eggs, sausages, pancake, french fries, variety of fruits, vegetables, olives, cereal, ham, some nuts, several option of topping sauce, juices, coffee, tea, some turkish delight such as halva (my fave) and cookies. And they will ask you every morning whether you need to have some omelette (it comes with tomato, ham or cheese. or you can mix it all). They will also ask if you want to have a turkish coffee. My mom and sister loves the foods so much they always take long relaxing time during breakfast. Five, facility is more than enough for the value you pay. - The room comes with AC, TV with cable that has more than 100 channels, shower (and bathtub in my room - 206), amenities such as shampoo, soap, shower cap, big and small towels for each person, etc., safety deposit, hanger, free mini bar, wifi with good connection even in the second floor, decent bed (i was actually anticipate a hard bed as I read in couple of review.. but turn out its not hard.. its decent enough for me and my family). - They also provide one computer in the reception area where you can use it any time. Also in the reception area, there is always available hot water along with tea, coffee and sugar. Omer, always guard in the night shift.. so we always felt secure anytime - In the reception area, they provided guide book , travel books, travel magazine that you can read at any time. My father in law loves the reception area, it felt like sitting in the living room at home he said.. Sometime my mom, mother in law and my sister chat in the sofa in the alley with our pijamas... !!! Sixth, they offer a free airport transfer when you arrive, no matter how many groups you are. And they provide 60TL for a big van that fit 7 people (i wrote it wrong in my previous review, its not 60 euro but its 60 turkish lira.. I just want other traveler to get the right info). Seventh, and this is the MOST IMPORTANT ONE.. their HOSPITALITY and SERVICE is superb and unbelievable... let me list it down one by one: - Once we arrived, we are greeted my Muharem.. and he right away explained us on how to get our bearing on the city. He showed us the city map and circled down every must have sites to go and explained us how to go there and the best time to go there. If you have specific interest you can tell them as they wont hesitate to give some advise. For example, my husband has an interest in military and war. Muharem advised us to go to military museum and watch some military concert that happened every day at 3pm. Things like this we would probably not get from regular tour agent - Every time we came back to the hotel.. each of them always ask how was our day.. and we ended up having a nice long chat. I really appreciate this very much, as I've got many information about many things such as life in instanbul in general or even about religion. For example, one day we came back from the whirling dervish dance in Hodja Pasha and I told them I would be more appreciative if I understand the meaning behind. And they right away explained me not only the meaning but also the history behind. I never forgot about this, as this is why I love traveling.. understand people's culture and custom.. thank you everyone to widen my horizon - Prompt assistance when you needed. One day the tour that I booked online (separately not from Basileus) was not as we expected. So I must stop the rest of it for the sake of my Mom's health. I turned to Omar and wonder if he can get me a van to rent for one day so we can relaxly go around the city by ourself. It was last minute request actually, requested a night before. Without any fuss, Omer booked us a car. And some other day, I did even worse.. I asked Omer to rent another car again.. I requested in the morning to be available 3 hours after. Amazingly, the car is available without a fuss. Thank you Omer for this (both my mothers were so in love with him btw=). We also asked them if they can help us to find a decent bosporus tour (also last minute request) that has a slow pace that will be managable for my mom (who has trouble walking). Muharem and Yusuf had a discussion with us about this and list down what sites that weve been to and what site that we havent been to. And they suggest me the most efficient tour that fit the time, money and my mom disability. They told me in detail which one is worth to go which one not - Every time we need information about eating they will always provide you with one. They can even help us deliver some food from the resto in front of the hotel. Its literally delivered to our room - The hotel has no stair.. so if you have many bags they will help you to take it to your room. - The room always spotlessly clean when we arrived.. I thank the cleaning ladies there.. they are literally cleaning every corner... !!! - As an indonesian, we always eat hot spicy food. So, whenever traveling, we always bring our own hot chilly sauce. Based on our past experience, we rarely found any chilly sauce provided in other B&B or hotel. Surprisingly, on the 3rd day, we found a big bottle of chilly sauce provided during breakfast. OMG!!! my husband was so happy as we almost ran out of chilly sauce. This little things such this is the reason why we fell in love with this hotel.. - The last one is for me an evidence where they want to do extra mile to have your stay comfortable. One day, my mom had an idea to cook Indonesian food. So we asked them to lend us their kitchen. And they had us using their kitchen helped by mr Asref. We ended up sharing the foods with them and had a conversation about how to cook it. So to sum up.. (since I can go on and on talking about the good things on Basileus), staying in Basileus is like staying in our home for me and my family. Its where we felt at welcomed after a tiring day, relax and at ease knowing that everything is at their service and the most importantly its where we felt the greatest turkish warmth that I've never experienced in other place before. Its a feeling that you're always being taken care, just like your own family or friends take care of you... Hence, if you want to get the depth of Istanbul.. its people, its custom and its culture... this is the place to stay... For everybody in Basileus: Yusuf, Muharem, Omer, Ekram, Fatih, Eko, Asref and the cleaning ladies... Marvelous job.. Best regards from my family... up till now, they are still talking about you...", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cThe friendliest and best located hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ChloeMichigan", "ReviewID": "UR124509832", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at the Basileus Hotel.

(With free breakfast and airport pick-up - three-night minimum - the rooms are definitely worth the money!) What sets apart this hotel from others, however, is the attitude of the staff. Each and every one of them was happy to help, and eager to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible - be it the guy who carried our four (rather heavy suitcases) to (and from) our room on the second floor multiple times, the chef who accommodated two requests to serve breakfast earlier than their normal time (a full hour early in one instance), or the gentlemen who staff the front desk. Everyone was warm, courteous, friendly, and above all, transparent and honest in their dealings. Another thing worth mentioning is that the airport transfer company they work with is super-punctual and has very reasonable rates. On arrival into the country, not only was our flight a couple of hours late, but it also took us inordinately long to clear immigration...but there they were with our name on a placard, and uttered not a single word of complaint about the wait they had to endure because of the delay.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwow! what a find!\u201d", "Author": "fionadenmead049", "ReviewID": "UR124113899", "Content": "I don't think we have ever had a nicer hotel experience than the one we have just had at the Basileus Hotel.

But as with smaller hotels, I would ask the hotel to forward either a detailed map or written instructions, in the native language, to hand the cab driver, if in doubt.

I had booked a single room with a double bed. The hotel arranged for a pickup from the hotel for a small fee. Upon check-in, I was immediately put at ease by Ekrem, who offered me coffee and tea. He then showed me to my room and asked me to swing by after I've had a chance to relax, and he would share information about exploring magnificent Istanbul. He shared all the restaurants, the ones the locals eat at. He also warned me of the local tourist scams to be wary of and more importantly he asked me to enjoy the local sights and sounds by keeping an open mind. I'm a seasoned traveler, and the most exciting aspect of travel is to taking on a local avatar and let the city be the guide. My four days in Istanbul went by too fast, and did not disappoint. Yusuf, the manager is a truly wonderful guy. He and I conversed about the local customs and the variety of people he's had a chance to meet and befriend over the years. He treated me to lunch at a local restaurant which served some of the best grilled anchovies I've had a chance to taste. After that we talked about the economic and political issues of today's world over piping hot cups of tea and strong Turkish coffee. Folks, if you want glitzy furnished rooms, there a many hotels in Istanbul that will gladly take your money. However, if you truly want a 5 Star experience, stay at the Basileus. The folks working here are the finest ambassadors of Turkish culture. They put your comfort and well being first. The rooms are fantastic, cozy and extremely comfortable. The breakfast (with omelettes on request) is quite a spread and will keep you fueled for the day out in Istanbul. Top that off with a staff that caters to your every wish and demand..after my first few hours in my room, I mentioned to them in passing that it was a bit small. Yusuf immediately offered to upgrade me to a larger suite at no cost. Now that is what I call service! After the first night I told him that my room grew on me and I'm fine where I was. That did not deter them from asking me for the next couple of days about shifting to the superior room. The Basileus has consistently high reviews for one thing, it's customer service, with a personal touch. You come away from this place wanting more.

In addition we found that the rates were cheaper than hotels that you would literally find a couple of streets further up the hill. But as mentioned in some of the other reviews it is on a relatively small but busy street, which even with the double glazing you can hear but soon get used to. Overall the hotel is really quite smart, but there are some temporary looking fire doors and partitions which don't look finished off in the public areas, almost as an afterthought or regulatory requirement. The room was great, it felt fairly luxourious with plenty of room and by far the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed at.... it was absolutely spotless, a real credit to the chamber maids, I even checked behind the TV but still no dust!

Read my review for really excellent tips/advice to maximize your Istanbul experience :)\u201d", "Author": "tigorbear", "ReviewID": "UR119783786", "Content": "Our travelling party consisted of 3 adults and two small children (4 and 5 years old). We stayed for 4 nights in early October and found the Basileus Hotel to be a very warm and inviting place! We booked from their website and took advantage of their complimentary airport pick up service which is only available if you book from their website. Reception upon arrival was very genuinely friendly - Yusuf and Eco were so nice! They sat us down and gave us lots of tips and advice about looking around Istanbul and were always ready to answer our questions if we had any :) We booked a family room which could accomodate all of us and it was clean, comfortable and pleasant. Pleant of hot water every day and comfy beds. Little to no street noise, and our room was located towards the front! Room is cleaned daily, and the traditional Turkish breakfast each morning was yum and pleasant :) I loved the ricotta filled spring rolls! The hotel location is excellent - about 8 minutes walk to the Blue Mosque and from there you're pretty much near lots of other places including the Haga Sofia, and this great strip lined with beaut cafes and restaurants. It rained on two days we were there, so we invested in a couple of good umbrellas (dont pay more than 10liras for one) but if you have a rain poncho, that will definitely help. ** GREAT TRAVELLING TIPS FOR ISTANBUL ** Who says you cant see a lot with small children in your travelling party? :) Did I also mention that I was 4.5 months pregnant when we went on our holiday? :) We planned our intinerary very very well and saw HEAPS even though we had kids with us AND it was raining on two days. Day 1: After checking in, we went to see the Blue Mosque. HAT TIP: they close up the mosque just before and just after each prayer time, so avoid going on those times (you'll know its the time to pray because the azhan (or call to prayer) will take place. You'll be approached by local people insisting on giving you tour guides, but avoid these people because they will hound you for money afterwards. We then had dinner at one of the restaurants on that strip I mentioned above. HAT TIP: dont go to the FIRST restaurant on the strip coz they tend to be the most expensive. Just walk up a little more, peer into some alleyways and you'll find some great places to eat with lots of choices and warm genuine hospitality. Day 2: We did Tokapi Palace first thing in the morning. Getting there bright and early before the gates open is essential because by the afternoon its soooo packed with tour groups you cant enjoy the grounds without being in crowds. Best tip to give you about Tokapi Palace: Do the Harem absolutely first thing! Get it out of the way. Its the most popular part of the Palace (kinda like the Mona Lisa at the Lourve). Once we were inside the grounds, we went straight to the Harem and was able to enjoy walking around it, taking photos, reading about it with just a handful of people around. You have to pay a little extra to enter this part, but I would recommend it. We found getting one audio guide for this part was helpful. Overall spent 4 hours there. Now the Archeology Museum is right next door, but its not open on Mondays so keep that in mind. After Tokapi Palace, we had lunch in a cute cafe, than it was straight to Basicilia Cistern. Absolutely amazing place, highly recommend. Be mindful tho coz it gets slippery when its raining! After that, we took a tram and spent some time at the Grand Bazaar where you can haggle people for prices and see lots of great things :) Do most of your souvenior shopping here. HAT TIP: Be prepared to walk away if the seller doesnt give you the price you want. Chances are they'll call u back and give you the price you want. My husband and I did the 'good cop, bad cop' routine - where he would be the eager buyer, and I would be the nagging wife who was \"positive we could get it cheaper else where\" - as soon as my husband would go \"my wife says no coz its too expensive\" we found sellers were quick to give the price the 'wife' wanted haha Mean but it works ;)) Day 3: Up and early to see the Haga Sofia. Again you'll be hounded by locals wanting to give you private tours, but we found it more cost effective and comfortable to hire those audio guides and take our time looking around. Dont forget to go upstairs! After that it was straight to the Archeology Museum. Then it was a tram to the Spice Bazaar. After a nice dinner, we went to Hodjapasha Culture Centre to watch a traditional Turkish culture dance. It wasnt the one with the men in dresses twirling around but very gyspy style with bright colours and festive music. BEST HAT TIP TO GIVE YOU: Reserve your seats well in advance!!!!!!!!!!! We emailed the centre a week before and asked for front row, centre seats and they were honestly the best freakin seats in the house. Felt sorry for the poor folks in the back row who had to stand many times. I would highly recommend this show, even the kids enjoyed it!! :) HAT TIP: Make sure you go to the toilet BEFORE you have the complimentary drinks and snacks during intermission. The line is MASSIVE just before the show starts again and you just may miss the first 5 minutes of the next part of the show! Day 4: Caught a tram to Taksim Square which is a lovely pleasant stroll thru the city. If you're into old maps, there is a map store we found there where we found some old maps of the old Constantinople which we had framed when we got home :) We headed towards Gataca Bridge (took a few hours to get there, but it was a pleasant day and we took our time) and had lunch at one of the cafes underneath Gataca Bridge. HAT TIP: Test the restaurant toilets BEFORE you dine in, coz we found one awesome looking restaurant we ALMOST ate in, but the toilets didnt flush and they had no running water at the taps! Dont be fooled that a great looking restaurant will have a nice toilet. Afterwards we did the Bosphorus ferry cruise that lasted about 90 minutes :) Get there early to score good upper deck seats but bring a jacket and scarves coz it gets chilly! Day 5 (last day): Check out isnt until 12pm so we looked around the area after breakfast and found a nice little mosque about 2 minutes walk from the hotel that has its own history. We walked down to the river and let the kids play in the playground. We paid a little extra to get the shuttle bus to return us to the airport because it was worth it than taking a taxi :) So overall an AWESOME experience in Istanbul. If we managed with two small children and me being pregnant, as an adults-only travelling party its definitely easy to do all the above in just a few days. Other hat tips include using the loo (and making the kids use the loo) every opportunity you can, because sometimes a place will only have squat toilets or the public toilets dont flush (or are filthy). Take small breaks every now and then, when the kids get tired. 15 minutes of rest time is worth it. When ordering food, try different things - dont always just stick to 'western' style food, be adventurous! Turkey is known for great food!! Have their traditional tea every now and then, and the baklava too! Yum yum :)) Oh there is a cute awesome little restaurant directly in front of the hotel - try it out once, it had great service and food. But dont come during 'peak' hours (7pm+) it gets so busy you wont find a table! We came early and scored a great table upstairs next to the fireplace :))", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "ricepudding7", "ReviewID": "UR119732481", "Content": "It took the taxi driver a while to find the hotel but once we were there, the location was great, it's within walking distance to all major attractions.

The staff was all exceptionally friendly and ready to recommend various sights, restaurants and where to go for an authentic turkish experience. On my many trips, this is probably the hotel with the warmest welcome that I have experienced! We arrived well after midnight and were sent straight to the room with check-in formalities postponed until the following morning. There is no elevator but our luggage was brought up to the room for us and down again for our departure. The hotel is an extremely good value for the price and the staff even encouraged us to change our booking after arrival when they found out that we would only be two in a triple room due to a fellow traveller having to drop out unexpectedly. We still had the same room but at a slightly lower price. I found this an exceptional guesture as hotels generally want to earn as much as possible. The room was big enough, clean and newly done up. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bathtub with a shower, the temperature of the water was a bit tricky to control but that was not a major issue. AC was very poweful. With the windows closed there is very little street noise, although the street has a busy traffic during the day and there are three mosques nearby that regularly call for prayer. The beds are very firm, which suited my sister but I personally prefer a not so firm mattress. Breakfast buffet had plenty of choices with both a turkish and an international twist. Every morning we were offered freshly made omelets. We enjoyed the local choices for bread, cheese, olives, tomatoes, fresh and dried fruit, nuts and different types of fruit juices. There is no restaurant at the Basileus Hotel but the Tarihi Cesme restaurant across the street is a great choice for a friendly local restaurant with good food and reasonable prices. The lobby has a computer with internet for guests to use and there is plenty of magazines to check out and tourist information brochures. WIFI in our room was very weak so we used the lobby computer instead. The hotel has a good location for the major sights in the old part of Istanbul. We experienced first hand the terrible traffic in Istanbul when going to the Hilton in Nisantasi quarter for work related events. I would recommend to anyone that mainly will be focusing on the old part of town to stay in a hotel there, as travelling relatively short distances by car in Istanbul can take a very long time, especially during rush hour. We asked the hotel to arrange transfer between Ataturk airport and the Basileus, mainly because of our late arrival. I would recommend this option. In Istanbul there can be streets with the same or similar name in more that one part of town, so keeping the street address and phone number of the hotel with you is essential. The taxi driver will then be able to phone the hotel asking for directions if he's unsure of the location. One final tip would be to print out a Google map of the areas that you will be spending time in as hotel maps aren't detailed enough. This will save you a lot of time trying to find your way through the small streets in the older parts of Istanbul.

Great for walkers! ~ 5-7 minutes walk to Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. ~ 7-9 minutes walk to Tram station. ~ 20 minutes walk to Grand Bazaar. Multiple restaurants within walking distance, many w/views of Blue Mosque. *Hotel Cleaniness* Well-maintained and comfortable lobby. Clean, simply decorated room. We had a double bed. Good AC, when needed. Shower water, a little weak. *Breakfast* Nice selection of breads, fruits, yogurts, juices, teas. Includes choice of omelette, turkish coffee. *Staff* Outstanding, one of the most hospitable people we've met. Very kind. Personable, sat down and spoke to us for a good 20 minutes when we first arrived to get to know us, talk to us about Istanbul, help us organize our days. Conversed with us everyday, w/sincere interest in what we did, what we enjoyed, how else they can help. Fun, showed us turkish coffee cup reading. Thank you again Basileus.

Even when I'm doing touristy things, I prefer to identify myself as a \"traveller.\" A petty and insignificant distinction, perhaps, but when I'm on the road I normally steer clear of the tourist havens and traps. Istanbul was a rare exception, however: it was my very first time to a city that I always had wanted to visit, and one cannot go to Istanbul and, well, be a tourist. There's just too much to see. So I embraced this identity and decided to look for a hotel in Sultanahmet, the old part of town where the major sites are (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Grand Bazaar, Roman Cistern, etc.). But I wanted to make sure that I wasn't choosing just any run-of-the-mill place. I used TripAdvisor as my trusty guide and discovered the Hotel Basileus. After reading the many positive reviews, I figured it would be a safe bet for two nights. The hotel itself is in a mostly residential part of Sultanahmet but is within a short walking distance (uphill but manageable) to the Hippodrome that runs along one side of the Blue Mosque leading to Hagia Sofia. The hotel appears to have three floors plus a basement where breakfast is served. My two friends and I spent the first night on the first floor in a triangular-shaped room with three twin beds. It wasn't the room that the hotel management originally had allocated to us - they apparently didn't realize we needed three separate beds. Anyway it was perfectly fine, and the following day the management offered to move us to another room upstairs - they even transferred all of the luggage for us. Both rooms were simply yet pleasantly decorated, and the bathrooms were ultra-clean and shiny. It was only the second week of June so we didn't find the room to be too hot at night. We thought the breakfast was very ample as other reviewers have stated. There are many options - both savory and sweet - and guests can sit in one of two rooms. On both occasions we chose the room where the food was not being served due to the reduced foot traffic. We didn't really spend that much time in the rooms since we were running around town trying to see as much as we could, but I wholeheartedly recommend the Basileus. What made the difference was the superb customer service we received from the second we arrived to even after our departure (one of my travel companions had left a pair of sunglasses in the room, and the hotel found them and kept them in a safe place). Yusuf and the other clerks sit at a desk right next to the front door, and they are always ready to offer tips and advice. Shortly before we left we asked for a recommendation for lunch at a restaurant not frequented solely by tourists, and Yusuf pointed us to a place just across the street where we sat at an outdoor table. Nothing mind-blowing but perfectly adequate food at decent prices especially for the neigborhood. I need to go back to Istanbul because we never made it to Hagia Sofia (!) or one of the Turkish baths, and I'll be sure to stay at the Basileus again. P.S. A piece of advice straight from the clerk with the light beard whose name I never got: there's a beautiful mosque just a couple of blocks from the hotel called the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque. It's much smaller than the Blue Mosque but has the same spectacular tiles and was virtually empty when we visited (aside from a tour group of older French people).", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat People, Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Hanshkin", "ReviewID": "UR116531951", "Content": "Yosef and Eko are wonderful hosts and are genuinely glad to assist you with daily excursions, the Turkish language, the culture and any other questions along the way.

We arrived early in the morning after a 10 hour flight and were quickly put at ease with a free pick up service arranged by The Basileus Hotel. Our room was not ready and while waiting we were treated to a very welcoming and hearty breakfast and we were checked in by 10am even though the official check in time was 12noon. We reserved a triple room for 3 nights and was given a room in the ground/semi basement floor for the first night and were moved to another triple room on the third floor for the remaining nights. We were told that The Basileus was 8 months old and both rooms were obviously new, very clean, sufficiently furnished with wifi, LCD TV, a well stocked mini fridge and the beds wrapped with high quality sheets. Yusuf and Ekhr ( I hope the spelling is right ) went way out of their ways to recommend and help us with our travel arrangements with a third party travel agent to the outer parts of Turkey - Cappadocia, Pamukale and Silcuk/Ephesus. We wanted to stay at the Basileus after our Turkey excursion but the hotel was fully booked and were arranged by Yusuf and Ekhr to stay in another hotel nearby. In fact it was an upgrade because we were given a room that was brand new ( 8 days old ), with a private terrace and a view of the Marmara Sea! Thank you guys! Yusuf and the team did a great job at making us feel very comfortable. We felt that we were like staying with friends or a close family. We had problem with our mobile phones so we went back to Basileus to ask Yusuf to help us out to call our contact for an apartment reservation at Taksim ( the last 3 nights in Istanbul ). He was more than willing to accommodate our request, managed to connect us with our contact and even checked the area on google earth to tell us about the area we were about to go and the exact building we were about to stay in. The Basileus is located in a good, safe area close to many hotels, restaurants and shops. It's in a neighbourhood where you would have a chance to see how the locals live or even sit down and chat with the locals at a sidewalk cafe while sipping a glass of Cay ( Turkish tea ). All the main attractions, the tram station are only a pleasant stroll away. We have been very fortunate to have The Basileus Hotel as our first stop of a fantastic vacation in Istanbul and the greater Turkey.

I also emailed again the day before I was to arrive to confirm my reservation and alert them that we would be arriving to the hotel late the next evening. I was then told that my reservation was not held because I never sent credit card information to hold the room. A review of my emails revealed that I was never asked to give my credit card information. The response was that they had a cancellation, so luckily, they would have a room for me the next night. Of course, when I arrived, there was no room available. In fact, there was no room for us as well as the party of four that also was waiting in the lobby. Like other stories in Istanbul, we were offered an \"upgrade\" to a sister hotel. Against my better feelings, we accepted the other room since it was past midnight and we had an early-morning flight. There was nothing wrong with the other hotel, but the principle and practice of overbooking rooms despite explict, written correspondence is poor business.

The overview was great (where to catch the metro, key things to see, etc.) they provided us with pamphlets and brochures for tours, but they were not pushy about it (we opted for a private tour that we got to pick the key sights we wanted to go to). On a side note about the private tour (we noticed that tour guides get to go to the front of the line to buy tickets for the major sights so it made our tour more efficient than doing it on our own - well worth the 60 euros!). The hotel made all reservations that we needed and arranged our transfer back to the airport (and carried our bags two blocks so that we would not get stuck in the traffic jam).

We often stay at 5 star hotels who have all the extra facilites such as gym, pool, restaurants etc. However, when you are in a Historical city such as Istanbul, you are more inclined to visit the sights and bazaars rather than use the hotel facilities. Hence Basileus is perfect as it is walking distance to all the historical sites. It does not have all the fancy facilities yet has all the \"right\" facilities that a Hotel room should have. Clean rooms with new furniture and a very comfy bed, clean bathrooms, minibar, TV and free wifi. What more can you ask for! Really enjoyed the breakfast, especially the breads.

Saying that, the street the hotel is on is quite rundown - it didn't feel unsafe even at night, but it's not exactly a glamorous street. But then you're not far from the nice area around the HIppodrome. It's a somewhat quiet street in terms of traffic so it's ok but not ideal if you're a light sleeper. The rooms are not very big and the furniture is basic but new, and therefore in good nick at the moment. Wifi signal was good and quite fast, at least while I was there. Bear in mind that the hotel has been open less than 6 months and has a few things to improve; I relayed my views back to the friendly owners/receptionists, who welcome constructive criticism at this early stage. There were small details e.g. hot food is available at breakfast but as this isn't advertised, you don't know about it until someone remembers to ask you if you want hot food. Just an unintentional oversight on their part, not a deal breaker.
