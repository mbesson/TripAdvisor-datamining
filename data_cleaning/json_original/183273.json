Went to Montreal for my birthday and found out \"non-smoking preference\" actually means you COULD get a non-smoking room, but if they're all out, you're getting smoking room which is incredibly dumb. In theory, the hotel could sell every single room as \"non-smoking preference\" even if only 75% of them are smoke-free! That said, there was a smoke-free room available on the first night, which we agreed to stay in until the second day when we would move to the smoking room. (We checked out the smoking floor/room to see how it'd be and asides from smoke, it's the smell of intense air fresheners.) Turns out, on the second day, a smoke-free room freed up, although we had to move rooms, it wasn't much trouble given we packed light for the weekend. Overall, the hotel isn't bad... it's nothing fancy but I feel it's a bit expensive for comparative hotels closer to the downtown core, that might have more amenities. This hotel's close to the highway, but nothing else...some box malls/plazas with food. Feels like industrial mixed with suburbia. It's not a terrible stay but it's boring. The rooms are really generic with no style but it's a decent level of \"clean\", so reflects a 3-star hotel for the most part. The parking IS a bit sketchy... apparently they said the back is \"safer\" but it doesn't really feel that way. It feels like if you get mugged there no one would even see. Apparently car thefts/break-ins are common in Montreal!? Anyway, we managed to get the spots in the front on both nights because people usually go in and out. It was good, no problems.

First the good: Staying on the south-west side, and on an upper (8th and 9th) floor provides a decent city-lights view and a cool breeze through the mini, drive through size, sliding window common to the Comfort/Quality chain. The sheets are clean and the beds are decently firm. The on-site 'Graffitis' restaurant offers some decent fare, Parking is abundant and free. Now the bad: Virtually the entire hotel reeks of stale cigarettes, especially the elevators. I would not be surprised to learn that the hotel has been declared a 'cancer hot-spot' by the UN. I always stay on the upper floors for the view, but if you should shut off the A/C the smell of french 90 proof cigarettes will permeate your jockeys if left hanging from your bedside lamp shade. Talk about a smokin' a$$! Luggage must be lugged up stairs and through narrow,non-automatic doors if you enter by any but the main entrance; so no handicap accessibility except through the front of the hotel, while most parking is located around back.

We were pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly/helpful. The rooms were adequate in size. We had no issues with the elevators (we made numerous trips daily, for 5 days). Although our room faced the highway, we couldn't hear it (we live in a quiet place and were worried about that). I guess if you opened the window, it would be a problem...but we had the A/C on and it was fine. The restaurant is not the finest in Montreal, but the staff was attentive and the food was fine. We even tried Room Service. It arrived in less than 20 minutes (did I say it was the busiest weekend of the year?) and it was hot. The only complaint is that it isn't close to a Metro stop, but the front desk attendant told me which Metro stop had free parking, and gave me clear directions how to get there. Clean, efficient, safe. We had a wonderful visit.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Englehart, Ontario", "Title": "\u201ca number of problems\u201d", "Author": "Northman11", "ReviewID": "UR4478253", "Content": "This hotel is very clean and staff friendly but don't believe their claim about rooms being spacious. believe me... they are not. Rooms are noisy because this hotel is located right beside Auotroute#40 - a major thoroughfare through Montreal. The traffic is going 24 hrs a day. Bring your ear plugs. Elevators are slow especially if you have a room on the 7th or 8th floor. The food in the dining room is very average and service is indifferent and slow.
