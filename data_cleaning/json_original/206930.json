I'd mark this one down as good, not great and if you're in town for a conference it's convenient to the subway line, and there was never a problem catching a cab. Dining in the area was a bit limited, you'll head out for a truly great experience.

The hotel is about 20 mins walk from the Fira, or 2 stops on the metro. The hotel was very good value and the rooms were a good size, modern and clean. The bed was comfortable and the room service menu and mini bar met my requirements and were very reasonably priced. The breakfast was excellent; there was lots of choice and plenty of food. Very impressed. The most frustrating thing about this hotel was that I had to get my key re-activated/changed every time I wanted to enter my room. Every day, the key would stop working (which the hotel staff said was because it was near my mobile phone in my handbag, although I had nowhere else to store it) so I had to constantly go to Reception to ask them to reactivate or replace my key card. This could be quite frustrating. On occasion the front desk was not manned and one evening I had to wait about 5 minutes and then ring the phone at the front desk to get someone to come out. I think the reception staff may have been sleeping in the back room! Not the best location if you are exploring Barcelona as a tourist and want to see the city centre, as it is at least a taxi ride away.

If you're flying into Barcelona the train station to the city is located within the airport, the station that is near the hotel is the \"Sants Estacio\" or 'Barcelona Sants\" I believe is the third of fourth stop from the airport. As soon as you walk out from the front of the station you straight and than walk slightly to the left and look for the Numancia Street or Carrer de Numancia keep walking up that street and in 7-10 minutes you should arrive at the NH Numancia. The hotel itself is really nice, very well kept, clean and the staff was helpful and very professional. The only problem that I found with this hotel or maybe just my room was that the walls are thin and you can hear the loud conversation and laughs from the people staying next door, I had to knock on the wall because the people that were staying next to us kept talking so loud.

We were here four a four night city break and found the location excellent for getting to the main attractions by the most efficient tube system we have ever come across. The breakfast was varied and very adequate with a nice variety of choice, includind a hot breakfast at no extra cost. We would certainly recommend this hotel not only for the quality of service but also for the excellent store across the road that provided for our needs whilst sightseeing the city.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cmodern design hotel services can improve\u201d", "Author": "Laphroaig47", "ReviewID": "UR17689792", "Content": "The hotel has been redesigned, and is looking a lot more modern. I had stayed here before. What was disappointing was the restaurant : quality and service are good, but I was all alone in the restaurant. Eating alone is one thing, eating alone in an empty restaurant is worse.

Great small bars throughout the neighborhood that were very friendly, helpful and hospitable. Breakfast was a little spendy but acceptable. Only thing that took away from an above average rating was someone (probably housekeeping) stole 3 shirts from my wife's open suitcase. Which we discovered as we were packing to leave at 4 am and we told mgmt about our missing shirts and they said MAYBE we missed them when packing (didn't because we went thru the room with a find-tooth comb) and then they said maybe we packed them and forgot about it or overlooked it (checked when we got home and NO they were missing). Mgmt did nothing about it after we returned to the States. Very disappointing BUT I loved the city and would tell everyone who has a chance, to please visit!!!", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Pimpalicious", "ReviewID": "UR15634738", "Content": "I have just come back from a 3 night stay at the NH Numancia, I found the hotel to be excellent, it was clean, modern and I found the location to be great. The hotel itself is a five minute walk from the Sants Estacio Metro station, the metrol station is on the \"green\" line and I found that most of the tourist attractions are on this line so you are pretty much central to everything. It is also only a 15 minute walk away from the Nou Camp. By staying at this hotel you are not in the hustle and bustle and for me personally I found this a good thing. The area surrounding the hotel is very nice and clean and quiet. There is also a supermarket just across the road which is always helpful. The room was very modern and clean and had everything that you needed. We did not have a view from our window however that did not bother me as you are only really there to sleep! My only concern about the hotel is the restaurant, my boyfriend and I chose to eat there one night as we were feeling pretty tired! Having looked at the menu we thought that due to the types of dishes that were availiable we felt that the food would be up to a high standard. The food was awful!!!! We both ordered the lamb, it was stone cold and when we did complain the waitress did not seem to care or be concerned, I think this was due to the language barrier. It was definitely not worth the 60 Euros that we spent on it! Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is very clean and modern and the location is ideal.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Staff..\u201d", "Author": "smonkey5b", "ReviewID": "UR13459631", "Content": "Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and could not have been happier with the service we received.
