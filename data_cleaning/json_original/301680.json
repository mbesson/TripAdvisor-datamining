Booking clearly indicated 2 adults and 1 child. To be fair to putting only negative comments, there were still some plus points for M hotel. Positive: 1. Room cleanliness was good 2. Staff was polite and try to be helpful 3. Complimentary parking Negative: 1. Check-in slow. Room booked for 2 adults 1 child, unfortunately upon check in, staff has told that there wasn't extra bed provided for the kid and usually what they have was giving a free baby cot for a kid ( wondering if primary school kids can sleep in a baby cot) however out of goodwill, the staff agreed to give a \"complimentary\" bed to the kid. Thought everything has settled and my parents can finally take a rest after a long journey drive. But an unexpected situation occurred whereby housekeeping informed that the superior room cant fitted extra bed (quite a shocked as i thought usually 2* or 3* hotels would have smaller space and the staff didn't even know superior room has insufficient space for extra bed) because of this, we had been dragging for another 15mins and finally have gotten upgrade to deluxe room to fit the extra bed. I appreacite the effort made by the staff that trying his best in helping to settle the issue but it would be great if he has basic understanding on the rooms before provide solution to the guest to avoid unneccesary waiting times. 2. Another unpleasant incident happened was the \"complimentary\" breakfast. I was booked for double room which inclusive of breakfast, however the \"complimentary\" only gather for 1 pax. Upon check in, the staff even told the room was inclusive of breakfast and also giving breakfast time without asking. This was good but he never said there was only 1 breakfast. I am doubt for his professionalism.\u00a0 Well, it's second time dissapointment from the hotel, it was a little pissed off with all the arrangements and its not worth to go for another round to check on the breakfast.

The check-in staff was quite nice and agreed to help and I was quite impressed with that. However, this turned into a nightmare later. There are few calls made to me , saying they cannot offer in-room dining, and I had to talk to several people so that they eventually agreed to offer me continental breakfast as take away.

Frankly, this is a very disappointing experience. I probably wouldn't feel as bad if my request was rejected from the beginning. I was actually quite impressed when they agreed to help initially.

I like the History Channel and the Discovery Channel, NatGeo etc. There was plenty of selection for me. I liked the breakfast. I thought it had a diverse menu of things Eastern and Western. The scrambled eggs are more runny than we like them in the West but they certainly weren't bad. If you wanted something light, they had fruit and cereal. There was an omelet station, crispy noodles, all sorts of local specialties, a coffee bar, assorted meats (bacon, sausage etc). They had pancakes and/or French toast depending on the day. I enjoyed it. I also had the time to relax because I was there over the weekend. The concierge staff was very friendly and gave good advice as far as where to go shopping, how to get there and what to see and do.

I actually tried to change my decision and book a Sheraton (which is further away) but I couldn't, because I was staying for three nights and the hotel charges cancellation on all three nights (unlike a lot of hotels that charge for cancellation only if you notify them less than 24 hours in advance). I was also planning on getting my wife along for the trip. I send multiple emails and reminders to the hotel and got a response only after about five days. I am not very happy about that. The response came about four days too late. I had requested for an early check-in but when I arrived at the hotel at about 5.30 AM; they refused to accommodate it on the grounds that I'd have to pay. Fair enough, check-in is at 12 and 5.30 was very early indeed - so I agreed, and was put up at a suite (luckily, I wasn't charged at 'suite' rates). I moved to a regular room the next day. The rooms are just okay; you can't complain really but they're nothing to write home about. I guess some of the rooms have a better view, mine didn't. I guess I had higher expectations, considering the price. On Day 1, I tried the breakfast at the M Lounge on the top floor - very avoidable. The choice is really poor and I had better luck with breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor on Days 2 and 3. The location of the hotel is great - it's just a 10 minute walk from Raffles Place, so it's kinda in the centre of the city and the action. Being Singapore, everything is reachable within 15 - 20 mins by cab, so that was never a worry. There are a couple of 7-11s and a McD close by if you need. The Tanjong Pagar metro (EW15) is hardly five minutes away. All this is the good stuff. So why am I giving this an 'Average' rating? Well, for one - for the kind of money you pay for the hotel, you just do NOT get bang for your buck. The staff is efficient, yes, but their attitude borders on being bored of you. There is not a single smile or a word of warmth and saying 'Thank You' to them doesn't even elicit a courteous 'You're Welcome' from them. They're multi-cultural, but uniformly (pun intended) in the same bracket in terms of attentiveness. The rooms, like I said, were just about okay. The suite is definitely usefully huge, but the overall finish just makes it look really old. I guess, the hotel IS old and could do with a makeover (just hope they don't double the rates after that!). The deluxe room is much smaller and featured an unkempt carpet with more than a few burn-holes. I guess these are small things which could be corrected. I am not a fan of 'light colored wooden paneling' and the rooms have exactly that - so I could be a tad biased. Overall, I think it's the location. The rest is just average - I wouldn't recommend you stay here unless you have to.

I stayed for 1 month Nov - Dec 2011. With long stays like this it is very easy to find things that begin to annoy you but they were few and far between. However I must mention the J Bar on the 9th floor. This is the only bar available to all guests in standard rooms. The bar is dark like a night club feel and has loud live music or DJ most of the time. Often the bar was booked out for private functions (perhaps this is just during the Christmas period?) and so unavailable to guests. When it was open to guests it was frequently full of very drunk young people, often seen vomiting into the planters on the terrace. Often I retuned to the hotel around middnight and would find incapacitated patrons of the J Bar on the steps of the hotel and the street unable to convince taxis to take them home. The hotel appear to turn a blind eye to this. My only other niggle was the restaurant on the ground floor, cafe 2000. Food and price was good and reasonable but although I was told several times that I could order up until 10:30 pm this was not true. Even at 9.50pm they would try to give me the supper menu which is poor unless you like more local food. I insisted on the full menu and was given it. Fine but then they want you to pay imideately so they can close the cash register: Odd! You can still further order after that for desert and drinks because the register is imediately re-opend for the supper (room service) menu. Ordering late does not get the same quality of cooking: I suspect dinner the chef had gone home. So apart from that a very good hotel, great staff, convinient for business being in that district. I would reccomend happily though not for families or tourists perhaps. I would not stay again myself purely because I like to chill out in a bar with colleagues after a long day and you certainly cannot do that at this hotel, but if that doesn't bother you,,,,go for it.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel - Strictly for business\u201d", "Author": "firmanhadi", "ReviewID": "UR122023939", "Content": "Everyone in the hotel is very corteous.

At SGD230++ I best describe this hotel, to be polite, as \"over-ambitious\" or \"having an unrealistic sense of self-worth\". To start off with, it is a refurbished, old, hotel. If you have a sea-view room, expect to see, and hear, the container-yard, which is great if you have a special interest in transportation. The room is decent sized but very basic with 2 very basic, non-supportive, pillows. Do not expect \"heavenly-beds\" here. There is no lamp on the writing table. You get an old 20-ish inch LCD screen TV. If you are 5 ft 10in or taller, you will have trouble with the shower enclosure...it is a small square area with one quadrant sliced off due to lack of space. You get 1 (small) bath-soap as well. The gym has 1 treadmill, 1 of each of a few other machines, including a 4 in 1 weights-machine. But all this pales, when you consider that the taxi waiting and drop off area does not have a doorman or bell-boys, or even ramps. You carry your suit-case over a couple of steps (if it is raining, in the rain) and push open a set of standard, glass, swing-doors. Do not expect automation. If you are old, weak, or otherwise challenged, leave your bags by the road-side, go into the hotel, and seek help. Luckily, this being \"safe\" Singapore, your bags are unlikely to be stolen from the curb. If they are, consider yourself particularly unlucky. And lastly, expect a queue when checking in or out. They have \"faux-fashionable\" seated check-in/out, but you get to stand in a queue long before you get to sit down (waiting makes you really appreciate the chair when you finally reach it). Non-peak (say, 2.30pm, 4pm), expect about 5 minutes. If you have to rush for a meeting in the morning, add 15 minutes to your routine. Expect check-in staff to struggle and seek their supervisor's help. Expect to sit down about 5 minutes to check in or out.

The main purpose of the trip was to visit Universal Studios with our 4 year old son. The booking at M Hotel was done through a friend and we were given a room on the 15th floor facing Anson Road. The Hotel was quite a basic 4 star business hotel, however, it suited our needs fine as the plan was to spend more of the time outside, visiting Universal Studios and exploring other parts of Singapore. THe rooms were quite basic to be honest but comfortable. The bathroom was very tiny and the shower seriously needs to be replaced into a rain shower or a more powerful shower. The sink did not have adequately hot water. We only had one meal at the hotel, a breakfast on Saturday morning. I found the breakfast selection to be quite adequate and the service at Cafe 2000 was very good. We drove down from Kuala Lumpur and parked the car at the hotel and used taxis and public transport during our stay. Taxis are always available in the Anson Road door to the hotel. Although Orchard/Raffle's area were a bit far, Sentosa was only a SGD 6.00 ride from the hotel. However, the hotel location does not really suite families and individuals visiting Singapore for a holiday. The front desk and Concierge were very friendly and provided a lot of helpful tips. My only gripe would be with Housekeeping. On both days, we had asked the housekeeping to kindly take away the used towels and put in fresh towels in the evening before we went out to dinner. Unfortunately, on both days, when we returned, we found the new towels, lying on the floor by the closet and the used ones till dumped in the bath-tub.

I was in Singapore on business and from a location standpoint, it worked well for my needs. I would definitely stay here again (on the club level). As usual, The Good, The OK, and the Bad The Good - Club level. I was booked into the club level and upon arrival (12 hour flight) I decided to head into the Club Lounge and prepare for my meetings and relax a bit. I was welcomed promptly and well looked upon the entire time. I stayed for a few hours - preparing my notes, surfing the web (free WiFi), grabbing some finger food and having a few beverages. For me, the Club Lounge made the trip. I used the room in the morning for breakfast as well which was great because of the relatively few people and quiet surroundings. Well done M. - The Service. See note above. And below. - Selection of pillows. All sorts - different types. Very nice. - Lobby employees (doormen, concierge, etc.) All nice - greeted me kindly while looking me in the eye. Helped me with an umbrella. - Lobby restaurant. The final night of this trip, I didn't go wheels up until late - so decided to pop back to the hotel for dinner. Always hesitant to eat dinner in a hotel - but was very satisfied with my meal (ordered off the menu versus the buffet). And like the rest of the property, the service was very good. The OK - Room. The room was fine - large comfortable bed, but nothing outstanding. Normal amenities. - The bathroom. Small, but separate tub and shower. I almost could put this into the \"bad\" category because the corners of the shower contained mold. Not nice, and very unappetizing.......get it sorted M! The Bad - Check-in. Let me explain. I was given a room that was already occupied. Luckily when I got to my room, I heard 2 people inside, so I simply turned around and headed back to the front desk. There is never an excuse for this - and the employees did not offer one. They handled it well - got me another room immediately - and escorted me to my room. So nice recovery and didn't bother me so much. I confronted the hotel with a problem and they sorted it professionally.

I travel to Singapore quite regularly and we have 2 hotels that our company has rates with and I have always stayed at the other hotel, but this time a colleague urged me to try M, so I did. Almost right away I knew I had found a hotel to switch to, from the moment I was greeted at the entrance. Some of the details include: Room: \u2022 I had opted for a Club King Room as I find while traveling in Asia in particular that the Club benefits are often quite substantial (free drinks, breakfast etc etc) The room was large, modern and well laid out with a large semi circular desk. I was up on the 24th floor and had a wonderful view over the bustling shipping port (which I find quite mesmerising!) The one thing that I'm still on the fence about is the bed which is ROCK HARD. I'm quite a sensitive sleeper and also have a bad back so I thought this might be great or terrible for my conditions. Turns out it wasn't as bad as expected but I'm not sure how I would fare with a longer stay. If you don't like hard mattresses I'd suggest you find a different place to stay. Bathroom: \u2022 The bathroom was quite standard and fairly small with a combined bathtub shower setup. Everything was clean and functional and the amenities were nice. Hotel Facilities: \u2022 All of the facilities I was able to use were top notch including the Club Lounge, the pool, the cafe's and restaurants and the lobby areas. Room service was also great and efficient. Again, the Club Lounge is large and well laid out with ample seating and plenty on offer for Happy Hour as well as breakfast. \u2022 Note: The gym was modern and convenient however it seems like they offer memberships to non-guests so it was often quite busy with non-guests while I was there. This is always a little frustrating, but somewhat of a minor inconvenience. Pro's: \u2022 Great location for the Tanjong Pagar business area. \u2022 Very friendly and efficient staff, especially in Club Lounge. \u2022 Modern, clean, and functional rooms and public areas. \u2022 Restaurants, Cafe's and Room Service were all top notch Con's: \u2022 Bed is quite hard, so if you don't like firm mattresses this might be a concern. TIPS: \u2022 Be sure to have lunch or dinner at the hotels Japanese restaurant, Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant. Out of this world sushi dishes (make sure you try the soft shell crab rolls) and teppanyaki. Quite pricey but worth it! \u2022 Summary: \u2022 The M Hotel is a great property thats well located in the Financial District and has great rooms and facilities to match the wonderfully pleasant and attentive staff.

Staff are always courteous, but when you need something, like an extra towel or a refill of the tissue box at night , it will take them 20 minutes to bring it to you. Broadband internet is always an issue, with the issue being that you need to pay extra for it. The rooms are spacious and makes good use of the space, and you also get separate shower areas and a bathtub. Some rooms are cleaner / newer than others. It won't be too hard to spot soap scum or blackened areas around the sink / shower area though. There was good water pressure but as in many hotels with a glass enclosed shower area, wataer inevitably seeps out via the not-so-fitted glass door, so you will get very wet floors after you shower. To be fair, I'm not one of those travellers that turn the room upside down and let housekeeping huff and puff during the day, so the water seepage issues would be a design flaw rather than me inadvertently splashing water around doing Britney Spears dance impersonations in the shower. Sleep quality is good, you won't get a whiff of cold air in your face all night as the air con vents are positioned well. Adjacent room doors close quite smoothly, so you won't be hearing jolting noises when your drunk neighbor returns from a night out. Bed is comfortable and with the hotel spanning 20-30 floors, you won't hear pip from the streets. Do note though, the morning call is always 10 minutes earlier than your schedule time.

We were pleasantly surprised, as we had not heard of the M Hotel prior to booking. When we arrived after 11pm for a 3 night stay, (following a 4 day cruise on the Superstar Virgo), we found that check-in was very efficient and our room was upgraded to a larger room on the M Club Floor with the offer of a discounted breakfast and other inclusions like the use of the business centre and laundry services, which was extremely handy. The bed was king size, firm but comfortable and had quality bed linen. The hotel is very clean and has a modern contemporary interior design. Whilst the hotel is located in the business district, close to the working port, we found that it was very quiet and did not hear any street noise and minimal noise from the port. It's close to access the Harbour Front (great if you are staying overnight before boarding on a cruise), Vivo City for shopping and access to Sentosa Island. It's also close to China Town, access to the MRT is within walking distance, bus stop is across the road and taxi stand outside the hotel. If you're looking for more nightlife or being in the heart of the shopping zone you'll need to travel up to Orchard Road - approx 10 minutes by Taxi ($8 - $10 Singapore taxi fare) or to Clarke Quay or the Marina Bay area for eating.

The hotel is located in the CBD, which is deader than a doornail during the weekends, thus the special rate of $200 SGD per night (inclusive of taxes). The rate also included an upgrade to a Superior room, 3 pm checkout and an offer to upgrade to the Executive Floor for an additional 70 SGD ++ per night (which we declined). Anyone wanting breakfast would do well to upgrade, as the hotel's breakfast runs $31 SGD++ per person, whereas it's included on the Executive Floor, along with free flow non-alcoholic drinks during the day and three hours of cocktails with canapes in the evenings. Location wasn't really a factor for us, as we visit Singapore often and can get just about anywhere via the MRT, which is a five minute walk from the M Hotel. Those wanting to be in the middle of things in Singapore will be disappointed in this hotel, as it's located in the CBD, with not much else around. We found one Starbuck's, one Gloria Jeans and one Coffee Bean near the hotel, but all three were closed by early evening on Saturday. Our \"Superior\" room was located on the 18th floor. We were in a non smoking room, but there were cigarette burns on the furniture and a faint smell of smoke. We were told the room had a queen sized bed, and perhaps it did, but it was the smallest queen I'd ever slept on. It was comfortable enough, but tiny and a bit low to the ground. This hotel bills itself as a moderate business hotel and the room was indeed set up more for business than leisure. Our room was clean, except for the drapes which someone (presumably a kid), had gone after with a ball point pen and grubby fingers. The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate. The sink area could have used more shelf space for storage of cosmetic items, but so it goes. Our room had a city view and was very quiet, but perhaps that was because the hotel was practically empty during our stay. We could hear a door slam once in awhile and I got the distinct impression that the hotel could be noisy during the week as the walls seemed a bit thin. The hotel served us well, but left the impression of a worn business hotel which had undergone a quick, cheap make-over. For instance, the closets, walls and desk top were a light, modern wood, yet the tops of the bedside tables were a mismatched dark, stain laminated surface. The door to the room was also dark ,and badly worn and chipped, yet the carpet appeared fairly new. It felt incongruous and a bit odd. The hotel service was a bit spotty. Very good at times, pretty awful at others. When we called for assistance our first night, we were told to first call Housekeeping, then Room Service, then Housekeeping again. We finally gave up and went down to the Concierge Desk where we were promptly assisted. All in all, this hotel worked well for us for a weekend getaway.

The check-in staff are robots. I asked for a quiet room but didn't get it. My room was facing towards the harbour and it was very noisy - there was like a very loud train shunting noise or a bit like a pile driver that used to go on all night till 3.30am every night I was there. I was with a group who were on a business conference and anyone on the harbour side got this noise but if you were on the other side it wasn't there. Some of the group I was with also complained but got various answers as to what it was. I was there only 3 days and I just put up with the noise to the point where I got used to it. The hotel wi-fi internet was included in my room rate but it had a very annoying habit of loggin me out every 10 to 15 minutes. This also happened to other people in my group and we were doing presentations in the hotel and it was very annoying doing an hour long presentation and having to re-login every 10 minutes in front of an audience. I complained to the front desk that there was a problem with the internet and they responded they couldn't do anything as it was an IT problem but they didn't even ask me what the problem was so I responded \"Are you going to ask me what the problem is?\" at which I got the standard answer that it was an IT matter and they couldn't do anything about it - they never asked me what the problem was. Just robots. The room rate they quote was S$310 then they put on a service charge of 10% which is something I only found out about at the checkout so the real room rate is $341 plus they add on 7%.GST so the total comes to S$365 per night. Why don't they just quote the true rate of $341 plus GST rather than add a 10% service charge/tip. They charge me including service chage and GST S$148 to launder 2 shirts, 3 T-shirts, 2 underpants and 3 pairs of socks. They chaged me including service charge and GST S$124 to print 116 pages in the Biz Centre. Room furniture is cheap but I found the bed hard but good. They have a kettle in the room which I like if you want to make a cup of tea. The shower is small but always had hot water. Everything worked well except the internet. Breakfast was good and we had lunch one day in the restaurant on the ground floor and it was very good. If they fixed the internet,got rid of the noise and put in real people at the check-in I would go back but as this is not likely I will not be returning.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cSingapore has some great hotels... this isnt one of them...\u201d", "Author": "rockres", "ReviewID": "UR8609141", "Content": "We arrived on a late flight with high hopes, its listed as five star so we were expecting good things.

There were only two downsides: the shower is very small (with a bit of mold in the caulking, which we found at all three hotels in Singapore,) and the location.

The Western food selection is limited to cold cereal, toast, and cold scrambled eggs.

If you are thinking of staying here, remember ...... THIS IS A BUSINESS HOTEL. It does not cater for leisure travellers that well .... no lobby lounge (just a small chinese tea bar) and no 'filipino band' playing in the evening. There is a pool but have never been there. The overall theme of the hotel is fairly sterile, but caters perfectly for the needs of the business traveller ... all of the rooms come with an ethernet cable, travel plug adapters, and cordless phone. All the staff know me here by name, and of course i have had a few hicupps - one in particular where i had to write a two page letter to the GM about one of his duty managers who was just plain rude to me. Other than that, this place is fine. Breakfast is ok (they do cram you in though if it is busy), club floor/lounge is good (ask when you check in for an upgrade and they will usually do it for SGD 60). Its often difficult to get a late check out without paying a half day room rate. Also, laundry is not that fast and the minibar is ludicrously expensive (go to the 7/11 a 30 second walk away) ..... SGD 5 for a 500ml bottle of water, and SGD 10 for a 330ml beer. The double rooms are queen size beds (smaller than normal), and if there are two of you i would strongly recommend a king size room otherwise you will be very uncomfortable.
