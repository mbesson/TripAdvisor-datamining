It was a last minute booking that my colleague & I made, & we stayed here for one night. It was the day of the general strike (29/March) & I must admit we went on price & the fact that it advertised as an \"airport hotel\" (we were flying out next morning). It wasn't far from the airport but I think that was stretching it a bit. Pulling up at the hotel, our first impressions were even more doubtful - it looked like a youth hostel! However, once we had got past the awful smell in the underground parking, due to it flooding a day or two earlier, the hotel turned out to be very good: Check-in was fine; the rooms were excellent; there was free (very high speed) wi-fi; & the breakfast next morning was good, too. There were a few bars & places to eat locally, not a great amount but fine for us. I would definitely saty here again when I am in the area on business, but I would not fancy it as a tourist so much.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mattoon, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClean, great staff, nice neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "eppshel", "ReviewID": "UR107019809", "Content": "My sister and I were a bit put off by the location of this hotel. Reading reviews on it before our trip also made us concerned. As our taxi dropped us off, the outside looked very bleak and stark.

It will take about 10-15 minutes depending in your pace, but you will walk thru a very nice residential area. It was peaceful and had a nice sense of community. There were cafes, small grocery stores, banks and a few shops along the way. It forced us to be part of the community instead of just tourists. Their mass transit system is to be admired!

It's very clean and adequate accommodations for tourists. The hotel desk clerks were very helpful with suggestions for tours etc. and the town was quiet, quaint and lovely to say the least. The but is......if you are under 60 and very fit it's a bargain. The walk to the train station was 10 minutes on the flat part of the walk and another 5-10 minutes up the steep hill and steps to climb to get to the station. It took away from the touring and walking that needed to be done in Barcelona center. A taxi ride isn't the answer unless you are made of millions because it possibly was 25-30 Euros each way. It's too bad it's not located nearer to the train station and of course, nearer to Barcelona Center because all in all it was a great place to stay.

The 2 receptionists were REALLY slow, I have no idea what was taking so long, there was only one guy in front of me, and it was PAINFUL to watch. I think my 8 year old neice could have done a better job. My room was large and clean, but pretty basic, no fridge or mini bar. This was more of a problem when the hotel bar was like going to a wake, REALLY miserable...and the only thing in town was a supermarket. This is NOT in the city of Barcelona, do NOT go here if you want to visit the city...you are a long way out. You would have thought the hotel would make sure that as a result of the very poor location, they would make the experience a better one...but no spa facilities, and no where nice to hang out...awful! One amasing story: As i hadent originally booked this hotel, i wanted to know where it was, and how to get around. I spoke to the receptionist about where on the tube it was, and where on a map. The maps they have and give to guests dont even have the hotel on the map! Its THAT far away...its not on thier own maps!! They didnt seem to see why this was so funny! Its also not on the tube, and I did not fancy the idea of trying to get from such a remote location into the city when my timings were so tight. After reading some bad stories on here, i opted for taxis.

Probably say that this hotel is not located in Barcelona city, that is very important. I am Spanish, I've lived in Barcelona city for many years, and my employers booked a room in this hotel for me to work during a weekend, my employers are American so they did not know. They did not know this hotel IS NOT in Barcelona, it's in a small city nearby (Sant Joan Despi). Taxi fare one way about 20 euros from Barcelona city downtowwn. Public transport about one hour and a half if lucky, having to change (train, bus, etc.) The hotel itself is a small two storey grey block, located in the middle of nowhere, literally. Actually, right beside a highway. If you venture to stroll around the area you will find a depressing, lonely working class residential area, empty of people and any shops. There is just a supermarket (thank god), and a couple of dull restaurants not recommended whatsoever, just for emergency hunger. The hotel could't be any worse located than this. I honestly do not see why anyone would want to stay in this hotel and place, unless you really must, for some reason. Tourists looking to visit Barcelona, avoid at all costs, do not let yourselves be fooled into this, as you will be disappointed since you are way out and away from Barcelona city. Also, the staff here DOES NOT speak English! The hotel inside is simple and functional. Reasonably clean. No amenities of any kind whatsoever. A small restaurant with only two nice but insufficient staff members, an incredibly limited offer of food, both for breakfast and/or dinner. No room service, unless you insist and order well in advance, and that is for dinner only!! And very expensive prices for food as well. The rooms are very small and also frankly depressing, because there is little natural light available, there is no mini bar, there are no amenities, there is just a tv that barely works (about 5 channels, just one in english), the bathroom though reasonably clean offers almost no toiletries, there is virtually nothing complimentary here. And I have been to other rooms because as soon as I arrived I demanded for a change of room, even paying more for it, and they are all the same. The worst may possibly be the small very uncomfortable beds. Terrible sleep. As soon as you get here you just want to leave, seriously. There is a free, slow and often not working wi-fi internet connection available. One member of the staff, a lady, is very rude and does not help at all with any of your queries (I think the reception staff consists at most two persons). I am in AWE that this hotel is rated as a four star hotel!!! How can this be possible??? This at best would get a two star!!! I am very disappointed and do not recommend this hotel at all to anyone. I will most definitely never come back!", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "ECCohen", "ReviewID": "UR23105688", "Content": "Let me preface this review by saying that I rarely write negative reviews of establishments, but I felt compelled to write one about Husa Via Barcelona after the very misleading descriptions they had written on lastminute.com and the absolutely awful customer service they provided once I got there. To start off, there is little reason I can think of why any traveler would want to stay in this hotel. It's located outside of Barcelona itself - about a 20 minute walk to the commuter rail which stops running at 11 and could be a 45 minute wait in the evening. The train takes 20-25 minutes to get to Placa Catalunya from which you need to either walk another 20 minutes or take a metro to get to La Rambla. The first night we were told by the person at the front desk to take the bus back if we were in Barcelona past 11. We wait half an hour for the bus, and the bus took 1 hour to reach the hotel! The next morning I had kindly asked the manager, Raul, to switch us to a Husa hotel closer to the city center and I would pay the difference. He responded by saying I would have to pay the full amount for all 3 nights and quoted a very expensive price (double what other hotels with higher star ratings and better locations) for those other locations. I decided to just leave and settle with lastminute.com, who refunded me for 1 night instead of 2. I ended up finding 2 hotels which were right near the city center at $15-20 a night lower than Via Barcelona. Those hotels were Hotel Atlas (a little noisy but about a 5 second walk from La Rambla), and Hesperia del Port - both quality hotels, much better than Husa Via Barcelona. Also, be weary of Husa Tres Torres, which is also pretty far away from the city center and they try to pass it off as 5 minutes away...complete lie.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "harrow, UK", "Title": "\u201cVery good quality, quite far\u201d", "Author": "kikeng", "ReviewID": "UR21841524", "Content": "The hotel is very nice, it deserved its 4 stars: clean, modern rooms, very helpful staff... We didn't have breakfast there as it was very expensive and you can have a continental breakfast pretty much everywhere for about 2 euros. As for the location: you can get there by train from Plaza Catalunya in 18 minutes, and then you need to walk for about 15 minutes to get to the hotel. The train comes every 20 minutes roughly speaking. The other option is taking the tramway, very useful if you are going to a football game, as it takes you directly to the Nou Camp. The hotel is 10 minutes from the tram station, and the ride to Barcelona is about 25 minutes (it only takes you to the upper part of the Diagonal, not into the centre). If you are driving it is easy to access and there is free off-street parking. To sum up, a cheap option compared to the extorsionate prices of central Barcelona. The only problem is that you have to add between 40 and 45 minutes to get into Barcelona.

Although all the bars were nice one in particular kept calling at us!!. Frankfurt bar was only a short walk from the hotel it was out of the hotel turn left, over the roundabout and turn right 4 turnings down walk to the end where you pick up the tram and its to the left of the tram stop. We were given free tapas and the burgers are so cheap and great taste. the couple who run the bar could not do enough for us and even made us toasties and coffee at 9am after a late night there the night before. ticket T10 is a good buy but in hinsight we should have brought the 2 or 3 day pass as we used the metro tram and overground train lots. its so easy getting about from the hotel. also the airport train from sants main train station is FREE you just ask the staff on the barrieres for airport and they give you a free ticket that works both ways.
