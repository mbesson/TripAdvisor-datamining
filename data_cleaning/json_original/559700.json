The Caballero Errante, while certainly not luxurious, is spotlessly clean, very good value for this part of town and is very close to the metro. It has the benefit of having one of the best restaurants in Madrid directly across the street as well as a very adequate family run restaurant almost next door. It's very rare for breakfast to be included in Spanish hotels, but I would almost never have breakfast in a hotel. There are loads of little cafes nearby where you can join the Spanish for a coffee with toast, olive oil and tomato for around \u20ac2", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cNice room\u201d", "Author": "jamsie65", "ReviewID": "UR38620885", "Content": "I just stayed here two nights on the tail end of a trip to Madrid and the surrounding region.

The station is at Murillo road. Just follow the street Via Pinos Alta to reach the hotel. We booked a double bedroom for 53 euros in this hotel (in July 2007). Breakfast was not included in this but was available for additional 7 euros. Our room was quite small though it was beautifully decorated with pink colour and floral prints. It had a tiny bath with very little scope for moving our hand around. The locker was not working in our room. The air conditioning was very good. The receptionists knew english but they could not help us with our queries about metro and tourist spots in madrid. They also donot keep a madrid map for their guests. There is a general store very close by with resonable prices - around half of what we are generally charged at tourist spots.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5231344", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights based on a review we read on this site. When we received the key to our room we were suprised to see 2 twin beds (attached to the wall), instead of the double bed we booked. Not very romantic, and the desk clerk didn't seem to care. Overall, the hotel is okay if you are looking for a cheap, clean bed, but don't expect more more than that. Here are our thoughts: PROS: -Very clean and newly renovated hotel -Large room by Euro-standards -Quick walk to the Metro to get downtown -Air Conditioning works well (It was HOT during our stay) CONS: - Out of the way of tourist attractions and good restaurants. The neighborhood had some good local places for Bocadillos and Churros con Chocolate, but not much else. -Very uninterested desk staff; not pleasant but not rude either - just there -Sub par breakfast (cold eggs / meats, juices and yogurts were warm, not much fruit)", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Caballero Errante Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d559700-Reviews-Caballero_Errante_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Pinos Alta 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28029</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "559700", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b8/c6/c0/caballero-errante-hotel.jpg"}}
