Very friendly and accomodating staff and our third-floor room featured a full-size refrigerator, microwave (that also serves as an oven), two electric stovetops, pots/pans/cooking utensils, dinnerware (plates, utensils, cups) to serve six, kitchen sink, coffee maker, toaster, flat screen HDTV, free in-room wi-fi, a large bathroom and additional wall mirror/sink/full-size bathroom counter adjacent to one of the two beds (queen size and twin). Room also contained a round table with four seats and large dresser. There was ample room for our large dog crate and luggage. Just outside the main entry was a small patio seating area with two chairs. There is an elevator, small outdoor pool, and ample parking (limited, tight parking beneath the motel and a larger, exterior lot adjacent to the hotel that requires passcard access--provided at no additional charge). There is a small area adjacent to the parking lots for pets to do their thing (waste bags and covered trash can are provided on site). The facility is about a three-minute walk to the beach (it's on the Atlantic side of the main thoroughfare so there's no street crossing required). The room could have been cleaner (e.g., uncarpeted white tiles leading to the bathroom and within the bathroom, plus the bathroom itself) and if you're seeking four- or five-star accomodations you will be highly disappointed; however, was merely a minor nuisance. Being able to keep the dog with us in a relatively clean room with the ability to prepare all our meals (saved big money eating in vs out) was a big plus. Only drawback was we could not take our dog on the OC Beach (prohibited from May to October) but found we could (and did) take our leashed dog onto the beach at Assateague National Seashore's beach (about a 15-minute drive from the Mailman--there is a modest fee to enter the site but it's worth it as the beach is huge and very clean).

Caveat emptor: if you are traveling with your dog, you will not receive room service unless you stand there, holding your pet, while staff cleans. I personally find this absurd - of course, I understand that it is for the safety of staff, but they will not even clean if you remove the dog. You may also want to think twice about bringing your dog to Ocean City: from May to October, the dog will not be permitted on the beach or the boardwalk (min. $25 fine). Our poor pup seemed miserable because he couldn't partake in many aspects of our vacation. There is a dog park on 94th Bayside, but you must purchase a pass at City Hall in advance.

My expectations can get disproportional to reality if I put too much weight on reviews from people with less travelling experience or those that posess more tolerance to conditions I may consider below standard or discomforting. I can only compare with other places I have visited and with each travel experience my perception of the perfect vacation destination is forever altered. For me, the fun of traveling lies in discovering the unknown and sharing these truths honestly with fellow travelers. From April 15 - 18, 2012, my wife and I along with our new dog stayed at The Barefoot Mailman Motel in Ocean City , Md. This was our dogs first trip to the beach and we were lucky to have found a place so welcoming of pets. We stayed in room 205, which is the first floor, elevated over the parking area on ground level, and overlooking the pool. Upon arrival our dog was given a bag of treats which was very nice of then to provide. Check-in was slowed down by some computer glitches but we were in our room within 10 minutes of arrival. The folks at the desk were very friendly and made us seem very welcome with our slightly nervous dog in the lobby area. Covered parking beneath the building provided easy access for unloading the luggage from the car. There is also an elevator, but we just used the steps for the extra exercise. They also provide poopy bags near the alley where dogs can walk and do their business. The room had 1 king bed and one double bed and was slightly more spacious than a standard motel room. The kitchenette area was well equipped with what appeared to be new appliances, large refrigerator, 2-burner cooktop, toaster, coffee pot, dishes, utensils, sink with soap and towels. There was an additional sink/mirror/vanity top next to the bed which functioned as an after-shower, get-ready to go out preparation area required by most women. Since the bathroom was too small and lacked any counter or storage space, this was a suitable alternative and allowed one person to get ready while the other showered. The new tv was small but did the job and the remote worked well. I liked the fact that they printed out station guides and had them laminated so you can figure out what station you want to watch without just searching until you find something. I wish all hotels did this because its really annoying trying to figure out a new cable system when your brain has been programmed to the one at your home. I was informed that since they allow pets, they have to wash the comforters each time an occupant leaves which is not customary in the hotel industry. My wife actually oberved a large pile of comforters in the laundry room awaiting washing which supported their claim. The hotel is the third building back from the beach, and its just a short 2-3 minutes from room to beach. ...... which now leads to the cons: The rooms actually face Coastal Hwy with nothing except a few pine trees to block all the noise from the traffic. If you are used to this it wont bother you at all. Since it is situated fronting the Hwy, it does not have an ocean view. At night with the doors closed and the a/c running it was relatively quiet with the exception of a few loud motorcycles, sirens from emergency vehicles, and the occassional thumping from room above. The a/c itself was another issue; every time the compressor cycled on or off it made a loud pop, which woke me and the dog up numerous times. Ou dog got so frightened by the sound that she crawled under the bed for safety. I eventually had to turn it off because the room got too cold if I tried to turn it all the way up to keep it from cycling on/off every five minutes. Advice:bring earplugs to sleep. The first night of \"sleep\" was very restless due to intermittent awakenings and the harder than usual mattresses that gave both my wife and I stiff backs in the morning. I really like firm mattresses and sleep on a firm Tempurpedic, but this was beyond firm without relieving any pressure points. We did not use the cook top so I cannot comment but I did notice that any counter space needed for any cooking must have been an afterthought. One little nook, with a toaster and coffee pot and a cutting board with maybe one square foot of space would challenge any Iron Chef. The dish rack that would be used to allow clean dishes to dry was stored under the sink, but if you wanted to put it somewhere to actually perform its intended purpose, you'd be out of luck. There was NO lighting in the kitchenette area aside from the small light on the microwave. The light fixture above the nook was missing, with just bare wires exposed. The light from the window with the blinds open helped during daylight or you could open the bathroom door and let the light shine into the kitchen area. Not very well thought out. Overall the place seemed dark and lacked sufficient, modern lighting. The only other issue worth mentioning has to do with other pet owners and not the hotel itself. Every morning around 6:30 am we were awoken by two yapping dogs which I assumed were the twin Dachsunds that let everyone know of their presence by yapping at everything. Lets face it, all dogs bark, thats what they do. But for an owner to let it go on and on and not provide any discipline is beyond inconsiderate when your sharing a living area with other pets and owners. This is not the hotels fault although they might step in and remind the early risers that some people like to sleep past 6:30 on their vacation and try to keep pets quiet until a more reasonable 8 am or so. Overall, the stay at The Barefoot Mailman with our dog was worth the price since a three night stay with the $10/nt dog fee and taxes came to just over $200. I've stayed at hotels in OC where that will barely get you one night. It was the off season, but the weather was decent and we enjoyed the time with our dog. PS, there is Bayside Park at 127th street that is a great place to walk dogs and walk out on the pier to catch sunsets and take pictures. Go in the evenings when fewer people are out. If we came back with our dog, I would probably stay here again. If we travel without the dog, I would look for an Oceanfront hotel like the Quality Inn at 54th St, only because I'm a beach person and like to be as close to the water as possible and away from the noise and traffic of the streets. Although the hotel is in the process of remodeling ( I was told the bathrooms come next year ) it still has the look and feel of an older hotel. Many of the hotels in OC are just run down by years of tourist traffic and some are just simply disgusting. This hotel would rank slightly above average. The owners/operators seem to have an honest desire and are making an effort to improve the quality of the rooms. In some ways they have made progress but they still have more work ahead. Take your dog and enjoy the trip, I'd love to hear from everyone who reads this and goes to stay here.

The best part: Very few hotels in OC are pet friendly. The few that do allow pets gouge the guest for $35 /night extra.

It's more of a clean, comfortable motel that allows you to bring man's best friend. (Kind of along the lines of Comfort Inn/Motel 6). The place is a little old (could use renovation), but it's not too expensive. What was a nice surprise to us was that, being pet friendly, it did NOT smell of dog at all!

When we walked into the room, it was clean and smelled wonderful. The room had a kitchen area that showed no sign of use or left over food and the carpet was cleaned and not sticky! One of my pet peeves are dirty top sheets. You know, the cover sheets that go on top of the bed, that is normally stained and fithy. Not here! They were clean and stain free. The beds are very comfortable. I normally don't sleep well in hotel rooms, but slept very well. The pillows are full and the mattress is not too firm. I loved the fact they situated the room with one king and one full size bed. Made the room bigger and better for a family of four to move around in. This hotel is also pet friendly. You never know it when you walk into the room. No sign of pet smell or hair anywhere! Maids are wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. Never saw one attitude. Always willing to have a friendly conversation. This hotel is also right off the beach and about fifteen blocks from the boardwalk. You can catch a bus right across the street. Close to the Dough Roller restaurant and market. I quess with the good there has to be some bad. A young man, who happened to be a guest staying next door to me, got drunk. Somehow my passing grin (disgusted really) in the hallway, gave him the impression I was interested. Don't asked me how. Anyway, as my daughter and I was enjoying the pool, he decided to come down and try to grab me in front of her. I handled the situation well and got him to leave. But, when he began shouting curses at me, I notified the front desk immediately. I would have liked him to be moved or kicked out of the hotel, but instead, they gave him a warning. Didn't like that. Never heard anything after, even when we checked out the next day. We are still going back in August. Also, the pool is very nice, but could stand a daily cleaning or check.

The staff is really personable and friendly, The rooms are clean, you wouldnt know that a pet had been there before you. Price is reasonable. It is an older establishment but kept up well. I have 3 children so it was a tight fit with a king and double bed, they provided a cot at the last minute and were happy to do so.

She knew exactly who i was, and i immediately felt at home....and thats where the good vibes went out the window. I paid 190.00 down as a deposit on my room, the balance was 696.00. We arrived Sunday night and left thursday morning. A little steep, but i wanted to take my dog. At the desk, I'm told by Stevie that my balance is 748.00 dollars. I said...NOOOOOO thats not what you said. Long story short we went back and forth and she even sugggested that i could stay at another hotel!!!! Where is a family of our with a dog going to go on a Sunday night, in OC???? She never said, we can handle this is the mrning, lets just get yu checked in. No!!!!! She then stated i could talk to a manager, or whoever, it wouldnt change anything!!!!!!! dont get me wrong, we had the balance, but it was just something about her attituse that made me feel very uncomfortable and helpless!!!!!!!! The hotel was great, but over 900 dollars dollars for 4 days, with one King and a doulble, dog or not was a little too much!!!!! Although i was given free breakfast buffet vouchers, first impression is definately a lasting impression, and i will plan better for any upcoming trips. For a few more hundred, i could have rented a condo for seven days...not worth it!!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat price\u201d", "Author": "Delmiss", "ReviewID": "UR71829073", "Content": "Stayed here with my family and me pet.

We had been planning this trip for several weeks and were searching for a pet-friendly hotel, as we wanted to take our dog with us. Seeing that the Barefoot Mailman allowed dogs, I called for the reservation. From that first phone call, through our entire stay, everything was wonderful. The hotel staff are extremely customer service minded and friendly to not only us, but our dog, too! We were traveling from PA and ended up getting there later than anticipated. During the off season, the office is only open until midnight. We were afraid we would get there after 12, but the woman at the front desk said she'd wait for us! Luckily, we did arrive before midnight! We rented an 'efficiency' room that had one king bed, plus a full size. There was a small dining set and a kitchenette equipped with everything you need (microwave, coffee pots, complimentary coffee, refrigerator, pots/pans, dishware and even dish liquid! The room also had ample closet space, a vanity and was super, super clean! Each room also had its only little 'porch' area with two patio chairs, table, etc. Lots of towels, toiletries and extra blankets. The motel is older construction, but everything was maintained beautifully. Plus, the maid service \"Gin\" was great! You couldn't ask for a better place for the price and the service! Oh, and the location is ideal! Just a few short steps to the beach, plus the boardwalk is only 10 blocks away. There are lots of restaurants and nightclubs all within walking distance, yet its far enough away from the boardwalk/lower part of town where there tends to be a lot of the younger crowd, noise, etc. All in all, I would highly recommend the Barefoot Mailman!
