They arrange the taxis and restaurant reservations for us. Outstanding. Breakfast: we told them to bring it to our room and it was delicious. Fast and quick. Bed: very comfortable. Bathroom: good enough for a couple of days. In our room, the toilet and shower were separated. It was fine, it isn't a hassle in my opinion. Shower worked well; products are standard. The room was really nicely decorated. We both like art, design and fashion and we were gladly surprised with the interiors. As for the location, it is unbeatable. Within walking distance to the metro station and Le Louvre. 5 min away from St Germain's main shops. We didn't spend much time in the room as Paris has enough things to keep you busy.

We were going to L'atelier Joel Rubuchon for dinner and that was a bonus as it is just around the corner. But problems started from the first minutes. I wasn't aware that there were no parking facilities or help and we struggled with several suitcases on a very crowded narrow street. Eventually, as we got inside, a staff person asked \"can I help\" - it was a bit too late then. We had driven a fair distance from the south of France and I asked where the bathroom was and they pointed downstairs. Unfortunately, they didn't say that the stairs and dining room were in darkness and i struggled through a large dark room tripping over chairs and tables attempting to find a door to the bathroom. Then as we headed to our room on the sixth floor, the person advised that the lift was out of action to the sixth and that we had to do the last bit walking up stairs. The biggest shockthough was the size of the room - the web sites did not prepare you for the size of the room. I was aware that boutique European hotels can be small but I was still surprised. It was certainly an incentive to leave the room and enjoy the streets of Paris.

In fact, this was probably friendliest hotel staff I have ever experienced. We were greeted enthusiastically when we checked in, and whenever we needed reservations or directions, they were too happy to oblige. My special thanks to Constance, Sheena and Vincent.

If you stay at Le Bellechasse, you know you will be well taken care of. These people are gems! 3) The location. Le Bellechasse is located in the Saint-Germain area, just steps from the Musee D'Orsay. I loved this neighborhood. It was quieter than the touristy areas around the Champs Elysees and the Louvre, yet within walking distance to the main attractions.

The location is fantastic. You are within walking distance of most major sites. The hotel is in a quiet location. 2.

It is clean and there is no noise from intrusive air-conditioning units. 5. The rooms are not as gaudy as the website could lead you to believe. Now the negatives:- 1. I don't have a problem with the size of the rooms but there is a distinct lack of wardrobe space. Our wardrobe was by the door and was in complete darkness. Seriously, we could have done with a torch to look for our belongings. I'm going to suggest to the hotel that they install lights in the wardrobe. 2. For a design hotel other features were unusual and distracting. I passed one (empty)room with its door open and I saw that it had its toilet was separate to the washing area and had no washbasin of its own! Our bathroom had an unusual design which wasn't entirely user friendly and would be too difficult to describe in this review. The tiling in the area of the washbasin was poorly finished and the outlet pipe leaked onto the clean towels beneath at some point. I got the impression that the interior design was done by someone more intent upon being interesting rather than having an eye on functionality. 3. We only had breakfast at the hotel on one day at \u20ac21 per head. For what it was, it was steep, but in view of the availability of produce and more than one hot drink it compared well to the cost of breakfasting elsewhere. More positively, the price of alcoholic drinks was not as eye watering as other hotels.

The rooms themselves were great - facilities were funky, with the individual room designs bordering on quirky.

The location is very ideal. It's very central to getting to all the main sites. I wanted to stay in the St. Germain area with my wife who had never been to Paris before. This Hotel is on a tiny side street off Rue de St. Germain (Cab drivers may not know where it is exactly) and has a few cafes and souvenir places right there. From this location you are 100 steps from the Museum Orsay, across the river from the Louvre, in the heart of St. Germain with it's great restaurants and cafes, Luxembourg Garden and healthy walks to the Eiffel Tower, Champ Elysee and Notre Dame. The RER C line is also right there which can take you to the airport (transfer to the B line) for about 9 Euros per person or down to a visit to Versailles for about the same price. You also are near the Metro line 12 near the Solferino stop which easily connects to various lines that will take you all over Paris. We found taking the trains very easy to use for the most part (except going to the airport on RER B, our tickets were not valid at the exit lane and we still don't know why even though we got them from a ticket agent and said we were going to CDG and paid 17 Euros for both of us). The trains look intimidating at first, but are really simple with a good map. On the hotel. We skipped the 21 Euros per person buffet although it looked nice. If you want a big breakfast with multiple items then this is probably a good deal. Otherwise, you can get a small breakfast with a pastry or crepes and beverage for about 10-12 Euros in most cafes or go down the street and buy it from the corner bakery which is what most of the locals seem to do. The room is small and I had no trouble connecting up to the Internet or having hot water during our stay so the one persons review (in September 09) here obviously had a bad bit of luck. As everyone else has stated the decorations are really unique and the bathtub in the room is certainly different but hey, this was a place to sleep and shower and get going each day. The bed was very comfortable, towels were fluffy, bath robes are provided and we heard no street noise in the evening. There is a mini bar in the room and the flat panel TV gets all sorts of channels but only a few in English (but we were not there to watch TV). If you want a full service hotel then this is not the place to be. But my wife and I spent so little time in our room that this was really perfect for us. A family may feel cramped in these rooms. But we are kind of easy going and I don't need the frills of an expensive hotel that will cost 3x as much or more. We were gone by 8:30 each day and returned around 11:00 for the most part each evening. My only minor comment was the front service which was okay. Not great, but not bad either. A friend left a phone message for me which never got delivered until a day later when I needed to get a new key card after we decided to stay 1 extra night instead of going to London. Even though the room has a phone with a message waiting light on it or they could have slipped it under my door. Luckily the friend reached me via cell phone. Also, when I asked to stay an extra night, they would not give me the same rate I had previously booked that week through an on-line service. It cost me about 100 euros more for the one extra night but we were having such a good time and I didn't want to start packing up to go to another place that I just accepted it reluctantly.

It was my husband's first trip to Paris so I wanted a hotel with a central location that wasn't too expensive (our rate was \u20ac250/nt) but had a fun Parisian feel and that is certainly what we got and in a good way! There are so many great things about the Bellchasse 1) the location is really great - a stone's throw away from the Musee d'Orsay (fyi, you can buy tickets from the hotel and then go to the advance reservation ticket door D and skip the long queues), right across the river from the Louvre (easy 10min walk) and right inbetween two metro stops for different lines. 2) the service was very helpful before and during our trip - the front desk helped with restaurant reservations, taxis, etc and happily so. 3) our room was beautiful (we were in one with a giant blue sun on the wall) and really very comfortable. The bed was heavenly - so much so that we had a hard time getting up some mornings! The only drawback to our stay was that like other reviewers say, the rooms are very small (bathrooms too - there's no door to the bathroom, fyi, so probably not a good place to stay unless it's with someone you're very close to and also just a handheld shower). This coming from someone who has lived in NYC and London for 10 years. But thankfully, after reading previous reviews, we were prepared for how small the room was going to be so we weren't surprised. So if you want a big room, don't stay here. But we didn't really mind as we didn't spend a whole lot of time in it! This aside, I'm pretty sure that we'd stay here again when we come back to Paris which we will hopefully be able to do soon!

The location of this hotel is not even half a block away from the Musee d'Orsay, very close to Blvd St Germain and the Seine. Good location for a first or second-time visitor. You're just a few minutes from all the major museums, attractions. Subway, RER, and bus connections are easy from the hotel. The location is very quiet, the 7th is a residential neighborhood, and it was nice to step away from the hordes of tourists (particularly the EU student groups) that take over some parts of the city. I don't recommend the 5th unless you want to be surrounded by 16-year olds with their school groups all the time. The downside to the quiet neighborhood is that the immediate vicinity is not exactly a nightlife hotspot and there aren't any great bistros within a 5-minute walk (although you'll find many great options if you're willing to walk 15 minutes). The people at the front desk were very nice, with no weird attitudes or vibes. Small requests were addressed with a smile (for example, asking if they could call a resturant on my behalf to make a reservation). Our room was very hip and stylishly decorated, with nice a combination of fabrics, textures, colors, and motifs. We were booked into the \"Discovery Room,\" probably named such because you will certainly discover very ,very well your travelling companion in the small space. There's only a couple of feet around the bed, and in that space they manage to squeeze a desk (with an ottoman - no real chair), another ottoman and a minibar. We placed one of our carry ons on top of the ottoman, and the other under the bed. Good thing we didn't bring a suitcase-not sure where we would have put that. To wash your hands after going to the potty required going around or going on top of the bed, because there isn't enough room to put a connection between the potty and the sink/bathtub. It sounds like I am complaining, but the small room size did not bother us. We slept great, thanks to a good bed, good sheets, and no noise (and our room faced the street!). Big windows and french balconies completed the room, which was indeed interesting and different. The free wifi was great for staying in touch with home and checking out resturants and shops. FYI, the breakfast (buffet) was 21 euros, but we opted for the cafe right outside the hotel in front of d'Orsay. There's a plasma and they must have the largest news channel package I have ever seen. Whether it was Albanian or Armenian or Aragonian news, they had it. They also had a couple of English-language channels (I think CNN and BBC). Not that you'll be watching any news while in Paris...

For the past several years I had stayed in a hotel I'd loved but the service started to go downhill (reviewed well on this site, but the review is no longer valid - so if you're looking for Paris hotels, avoid the Artus) - so I looked for somewhere new and found the Bellechasse. Had a pleasant stay with a couple of little hiccups, which were just about the room. The location is great -- touristy street, but a block from the Seine (not to mention the Musee d'Orsay) in central Paris is just about perfect. Service is marvelous - really terrific ... and the main reason I probably will go back. The downside is that the rooms are just okay. Decent bedding and towels, good size safe, very nice bath, and decent closet space (for one person, anyway). I love Lacroix and his design was one of the main reasons I chose this hotel - but the decor just felt off and not quite comfortable - (I liked the giant dragonflies and fashiony murals - but what was with the stuffy grandma draperies in the same room?) The oddest thing, though, is that for a hotel that calls itself a fashion hotel ... there is no full length mirror anywhere in the room and barely enough light in the bath (which has the best light in the room) to put on makeup (though, the bath lighting is something the hotel staff said is being worked on and should be improved soon.) Service is very important to me, and the truth is that TRULY gracious service is not easy to come by in the small 3 and 4 stars in Paris - and it's here in every last staff member (for both English and French speaking guests).

The ambient was very friendly , and very close to museum d\u2019Orsay in the heart of Saint Germain.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cWow Wow Wow\u201d", "Author": "SergeParis001", "ReviewID": "UR17053570", "Content": "i went to this hotel as I like a lot christian lacroix touch, and the hotel is pretty big for a parisian hotel, the recepetion, the breakfast rrom are pretty big and very well decorated. the rooms are a amazing, it is very mode. the room are not very big, but this usual in paris, and actually they are bigger to what im used to. the staff is pleasant and very helpfull and the location is the best, 10 meters aay from the musee d orsay in teh heat of st geermain. the price is high, but worth it !", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel le Bellechasse", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d285271-Reviews-Hotel_le_Bellechasse-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$299 - $537*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8 rue de Bellechasse</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">7th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "285271", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a3/ca/62/hotel-le-bellechasse.jpg"}}
