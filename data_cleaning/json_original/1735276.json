The location is pretty much perfect and everything is brand new if perhaps not so functional (the \"hangers\" are pieces of wood in the right shape - but completely useless) and a little Ikea chic.

A bit of a problem during check-in as the staff could not find our booking at first even with provision of proof of booking. Was glad that they found it eventually though, but we thought that was a bit odd because it should have been in the system. The room furnitures are simplistic but functional. The shampoos provided by this hotel are of very good quality. I especially liked the hair shampoo containing aloe, it made my hair very smooth! Funny that the shower stall has no shower curtain. So no matter how hard you may try to adjust the angle of the shower head, you are bound to get the floor wet. The absence of a glass door or curtain baffles me. It has been brought up before that the hangers installed on the shelf are almost unusable. For us it was not a problem. In fact we found it good for hanging jackets. The best part about this hotel is its proximity to Stadtmitte and a few main sights. Being close to Stadtmitte means that you are only minutes away from all other sights along the U/S-bahn lines as Stadtmitte is very well-connected.

Quite simple to get to from Tegel Airport. At Tegel just go to the counter where they sell the u-bahn tickets and try to know in advance which station you would like to get to, Stadtmitte. They will tell you which bus to take, I believe 128 which you take to Kurt-Schumaker Platz. Here you get on the U6 line in the Alt-Mariendorf direction, and get off at Stadtmitte where you walk about 2-3 blocks to Hotel GPC. Checked-in quite late but this was no problem. The area is quiet and we felt very safe here, freidrichstrasse is quite a popular and high end street that is just one street over and makes it easy to track down the hotel. Room was somewhat small, but exactly what we needed with a double-bed, tv, free wireless internet, safe in room and bathroom with many soaps, blowdryer and hot water. I would ignore the complaints about the green lights on windows, these did not bother us at all, and the shades on the window can easily block out the green lights if it is a problem. The green lights go off late at night anyways. My reservation included breakfast (I would recommend checking all hotel websites to find the best deal, I believe I found mind through agoda) and I was very glad that it was included. Breakfast was served in the morning and I did enjoy it. Many pastries to choose from, ham, cheese, you could make your own pressed sandwich, they also had potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage or you could boil your own egg, unfortunately, I could never get mine just right. This breakfast was perfect to start off the day and saved us some money, especially since the reservation was perhaps $10-20 more than one on other websites which excluded breakfast. The only slip might be lack of a refrigerator of sorts. We would get thirsty later in the night and after the first night, where we paid 5 euro for two 0.2 liter sodas (which i didnt even know existed), we made sure to bring back bottled drinks. The cold weather made up for lack of refrigeration, although the room was never cold but we were able to keep the windows open and have the drinks stay cool. Overall, great location, very close to checkpoint charlie, brandenburg gate, potsdamer platz, topography of terror and the holocaust memorial. We did much walking and in our 4 days here only purchased a U-bahn ticket once which was just to get from KaDeWe back to Potsdamer Platz in time for a show.

It can be easily accessed from the airports and from it you can make your way without to much trouble to the various delights Berlin has to offer, be these tourist sights or nightspots. The hotel had a deal on at the time of our booking which meant it was a lower price than usual, so we treated ourselves to a superior double room. The hotel was stylishly decorated (although we found the big green eye logo a little odd!) but if our room was a superior double, I can't imagine how a standard double would be furnished! We felt the name of the room suggested a certain level of luxury which was not present. We had a kingsize bed which was fab, and the look of the room, with the gorgeous lighting features, was great. The room was a big size, but the size didn't seem to be well used. There was a large gap behind the door which could have easily held a wardrobe, which would have been a huge benefit! The funky-looking clothes rails had fixed non-moveable hangers on them which were fairly useless, and those plus the shelves were insufficient storage for two fashionistas travelling to a capital city! We ended up with all our clothes draped over the chairs! Directly opposite the door as you entered the room was a small wooden thing on the wall - I'm struggling to know what to call it but have included a photo with the review - that didn't seem to have any purpose whatsoever, either practical or aesthetic. It would have looked better to have a map of the city on the wall as they do in the reception area, or to have left the wall bare. There were two chairs in the room, but one was a plastic 'school chair' and one an uncomfortable reclined armchair with no lower back support; which was particularly disappointing as I had let the hotel know in advance that I have a torn disc in my back and needed good and comfortable seating! Neither of us could use either chair and ended up sitting on our bed propped up against the pillows whenever we were in the room - which was comfy, but not ideal - and not what you expect from a superior room! The complimentary toiletries are a nice touch, and you can request extra towels (which we needed). The lighting in the actual shower itself isn't great, and the blind in the bathroom doesn't fit the window; also they only provide one glass even when two people are staying. The room was lovely and quiet when we checked in, but the next day we could hear (quite loudly) the sounds of children running around and shouting and squealing, which woke me up! The hotel's location does mean it's set back from the nearby main street though, so other than fellow guests, we weren't disturbed by any other sounds such as traffic. We didn't eat at the hotel (the breakfast was overpriced and the restaurant booths looked trendy but uncomfortable) but we popped into the bar on our last night and the bartender very kindly let us buy some bottles of cava to take upstairs to our room, where we enjoyed them whilst watching German TV! There are plenty of places nearby where you can eat - I especially recommend Sotto Sopra right near Checkpoint Charlie, which is a lovely Italian restaurant with fantastically priced food and really lovely friendly staff.

I'd descried the hotel as cool and quiet. The hotel has quite a funky design - streamlined and very clever indeed. The bedrooms are a standard shape but I really liked the curvilinear bend ply storage units which have incorporated plywood hangers! The lighting is also very smart. Over the bed there is a backlit abstract photograph and underneath it all the lighting controls are situated. There is a nightlight that illuminates the floor and gives just enough light in the bathroom so you won't be dazzled during the night when you need to use the facilities! Really well thought out. The shower was really great - though controlling the water temperature was tricky. The breakfast was expensive at EURO12 - which you can make the most of if you have a big appetite, but I don't. I would recommend giving breakfast a miss - and heading to the basement of the local Galleria Layafette on Friedrichstra\u00dfe for a great coffee and croissant! There is a tapas bar on the ground floor which I didn't try but it looked ok. There is a Thai restaurant - which was ok the evening I went there. Most of the recommended Turkish restaurants, which I wanted to try, are a 40 minute walk away! Shopping on Friedrichstrasse is very convenient. In terms of location other than the dearth of good restaurants within reach- Its only a 20 minute walk to Museum Island and Tiergarten. There are a number of metro stations within minutes of the hotel. You can hire bikes at the hotel too.

That said, there was an odd bit of wasted space behind the door and as you came in that seemed quite pointless, but that's their choice. No issues with the cleanliness, could easily ask via the door hanging sign if you wanted your room & towels cleaned.Small lifts, but no problem for us at all as wasn't busy and we never waited for one. We walked everywhere (TV tower, Brandenberg Gate, Alexanderplatz, Tiergarten etc) as we were quite happy to and although after a day it was tiring, it's perfectly possible if the weather is ok. The reception staff were polite but if i'm totally honest I wouldn't go as far to say they were friendly. The hotel restaurant had great food and an excellent waitress who spoke German, Spanish & English and was very quick with orders and helpful with menu advice. Moving on to the bad - the lack of air con was a problem in our room - the window didn't open all that wide and so didn't provide much air flow if any. Trying to get more also meant you had to make a choice whether you wanted to be cooler or have your privacy as you had to pull back the curtains. Another privacy issue that bugged me was that the window blind was essentially see-through and the glass wasn't obscure - when you stepped out of the shower you were therefore clearly visible to the windows on the courtyard area opposite. I booked a superior double with a city view - the view was not of the city, and there were two twin beds instead of one double, so whilst I had no issue with the size of it, the other credentials of the superior double did not live up to how it was advertised. The shower was another bugbear - looked great, but every now and then no matter when I showered and what temp I had it, it went almost boilding hot, for about 15 seconds like someone was flushing the toilet in another room. It was annoying but also painful and is something they really need to look at sorting out. Summary - Worth it for location if you pay a budget price, but needs improvement. Would I go back?

Room was spacious and it had a flat tv screen, I didn't really watched it so I don't know anything about channels. Shower was huge and all the room was very clean. Safety box in the room is also provided. Wifi on the rooms is free of charge and it had a good speed. We loved the picture on the room which has a light behind it so you can create a good ambience. Also there's a night light to go to the bathroom, little and doesn't bother your partner. The position was great, 2 minute walk to stadtmitte station on the U2, it can take you to Alexanderplatz or Potsdamer very easily. There's no nightlife in the area but it's safe to get back to the hotel at night. I didn't like the lack of the fridge on the room, the insanely expensive breakfast (though it's all the same all over Berlin, you can avoid to pay for it as there are plenty of nice bars and restaurant around the area). No thermostat on the room, temperature was ok but what if I was cold or hot? Also, other comments says there's no air con, well, I stayed the on October so no problems for me, I also noticed there are grill vents in the rooms, I reckon maybe they are still sorting out some thing as it's new.

The room had a modern feel to it, which isn't our style. Lights that take some getting used to, and never seemed to work the way we wanted. Cloth hangers which are connected to the ceiling/wall so it's very hard to use and not too practical. The little flyer in our room said there was laundry services, but when we asked about it they said they don't do it anymore. The breakfast, while not mandatory, is ridiculously expensive at 15 euro's per person, and not that good. The worst part however, comes with their little green lights in each room (or at least rooms that face outside, which looked to be about 40 or so from our side). These lights are on automatically from 7ish-11:30 (which if you're travelling around Berlin for 10 hours like we were, is very late), and are VERY bright. There is no screen on the windows, and no AC because they are a \"green hotel\". These lights are right next to the window, and opening the window just invites every bug you can possibly imagine, and a couple more we've never seen before. We left for dinner and came back to a nest. Closing the window just made it that much hotter in the room, and with no AC we just melted. So basically, they are a green hotel, that has at least 40 or so batteries charging these bright lights. It's like someone smoking a cigarette, yelling at another person for littering, and then flicking their cigarette stub onto the ground when their done. It's still pollution. Just because it makes you look hip and cool doesn't make you any less of a hypocrite.

However, on day 3 - it wokred just fine. Also, the bar in the lobby is pretty much a dead spot. Dead. As in nothing going on. At all. In short - I loved this little hotel and would happily return.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly and clean\u201d", "Author": "phillyndon", "ReviewID": "UR97923415", "Content": "Staying here for a long weekend and was very happy with it.

Breakfast was great - a buffet ranging from continental salmon/cheese/bread to more British style cereal, toast and bacon/eggs. Also great selection of pastries, cake and cookies.

We werent going for the sights, only for the beer and nightlife Found the staff very helpful when we wanted to know where to go out for the evening, and reccomended a great German restaurant called Maximillians which was around 5 minute walk away. The Friedrichstrasse was just around the corner, with good shops, designer and other wise all along the road. For those wishing to see the sights, Checkpoint Charlie is around a 2 minute walk away, and from there, there are all sorts of walking and driving tours along the old berlin wall. The rooms were quite small, but functional for our trip, as other reviews have said there isnt much wardrobe space, but what do you expect? If you are staying for the weekend it is perfect. lack of actual double beds might be annoying for those wishing to cuddle up or make love until the early hours, but you could improvise ;) Breakfast was very nice, although a short stroll (or stumble in our case!) to a local coffee house is cheaper. Taxis to nightlife are very cheap, around 5 euros so if there is a group of you it is great.

On Sunday we had to extend, because our flight to Heathrow was cancelled, and that was really painless. The rooms are not very big, but just the right size for the short stay. The bathroom quite big with a wonderful, huge shower. Overally the rooms and the lobby area are quite funky - very unusual but very nice design. We went to the bar on one evening and had a deliscoius Mojito - unfortunately the bar seemed very empty and quitet, but maybe this is the time of the year. The staff was very lovely and smiley, and the drinks were also very good. The check out was as easy as check in, and again the reception staff was extremely friendly.
