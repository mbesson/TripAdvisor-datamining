My friend and I have travelled for the past year to many different countries staying a lot of times in hostels. We knew Singapore was expensive so opted to stay here at the amrise after looking at many places online and thought this looked ok. Our expectations were not high as other people have said it's in the red light district and rooms are rented by the hour but we had no issues with either of these. On arrival we got shown to our room.... It was tiny!!! 2 single beds and a small wardrobe and desk ... No where to put anything! It appeared like it hadn't been cleaned..... We opened the fridge and it was full of food going moldy!!! I informed reception who came up and cleaned it out but the fridge smelt awful!!! There was hair everywhere .... On the floor and on beds. We had a constant stream of small cockroaches and bugs..... This was sorted after the first day as we got a can of insect repellent and sprayed the whole room each morning and night!! And left the aircon running whilst we were our!! More bugs were there but thankfully usually dead! Our room was not cleaned for the 5 nights we were there but this maybe because we didn't leave the key at reception ..... We did get clean towels and water but had to ask for them. The aircon is controlled by the hotel... You have to ask them to change the temperature which is a pain. The bathroom was not good.... Old and moldy in places. And bugs all the time came up the plug holes and from cracks in the walls. The tv didn't have any English channels... But not really an issue. The hotel is between 2 MRT stations and has bus stops close by so easy to get around. There are lots of food stands in the area and street restaurants. Yes it is in the red light area but we felt really safe and had no problems walking around. The staff were all male..... But very helpful and nice! Just a shame the hotel doesn't do them justice! Please improve the cleanliness!!! Overall if you are on a tight budget then it's a decent option.... But check the room first.....

My Fiancee was flying home the day before me, and as I was broke I needed somewhere MUCH CHEAPER than where we had been staying.

After a long sleep on my second night I had no idea what time it was when I woke up, or even if it was Day or Night ! There was NO wardrobe and NO drawers for clothes. Clothes had to be kept in my suitcase, or hung on the back of the door using the five hooks and three hangers provided. Totally Inadequate (and very crowded too) if a couple were using the room. The bathroom was OK. I had a decent electric shower, washbasin, large mirror, towel rack and toilet. Everything worked and it was clean. Geylang is a poor, working class suburb of Singapore and Sims Avenue is a very busy road with lots of traffic. The smells from all the street cafes take a bit of getting used to, but I've always felt Safe there, even at night, and the ordinary Singaporians are friendly and helpful. There are lots of market stalls nearby where excellent fruit and veg can be bought very cheaply, and at night, even if you are \"not buying\", a wander through the Red Light District is quite Entertaining and Totally Safe. Singapore has the BEST Mass Rapid Transit System I've ever used. The trains are Clean, Fast and Frequent, Very Affordable and cover most of the island.

With my hotel voucher on hand, check in took less than 1 minute after handing out my passport to be photocopied. Our room was on the 3rd flr and there was no lift but it's a small building anyway. Our room was pretty small and basic but I expected it since it was indicated when I booked. However, it was fixed up just like a hotel. The room was immaculately clean and the sheets smelled fresh. The bathroom was larger than what I expected, about double the size of what you'd find in HK hostels and was likewise clean. About the only comment I can make was the lack of a shower curtain which would help a lot to keep the bathroom floor dry. Location was ok, located between Aljunied and Kallang EW MRT stations. It's a bit of a hike and can be quite uncomfortable in the heat and humidity but quite manageable. It was my first time to stay in the Geylang area and again, it wasn't as bad as I've read.
