On arrival, very smooth transaction, and easy check-in. We were given a room on 3rd floor. I already knew from reviews that no lift was provided, but stairs were quite uneven to carry my suitcase. Pictures are a bit misleading because the room in actuality was a lot smaller than the pictures you see on their website. Room temperature was perfect, warm and toasy. but it got quite cold at one point in night. I was very impressed at how CLEAN the room and bathroom was. Beds were the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Bathroom was basic and shower's water temperature was just right, however a bit slow to drain. Didnt like the back view. And the floors were incredibly creaky and squeaky. which made me feel awkward to move around. Worse - could hear people moving above, hence creaky ceilings. Its a good job I was out for most of the day. When you go out, you have to leave key with owner and on return just tell them your room number. Breakfast - is in the basement, not a problem but again, pictures are misleading because this breakfast room was very very small. It had about 3 double tables and 3 single tables as the hotel has 22 rooms. We came a bit later on 2nd night - and it was more busy. Was served by a curteous European woman - who offered the best hot croissants I've had. Breakfast was very basic but was sufficient enough. Location - great, took me 12 minutes to walk to victoria tube station and about 9 minutes to the coach station. Neighbourhood is lovely, very quiet and I felt safe walking at night with my sister. Owners - very polite and pleasant. On check-out, they looked after our luggage for whole day whilst we did further sight seeing. Overall - be prepared to drag your luggage up uneven stairs.

We read all those nice reviews, photos were not so bad as well and we decided to stay there for 2 nights. When making phone reservation, we were confirmed a double room in the fIrst floor for the price 99 GBP per night BB. Well, upon arrival it was the first surprise- receptionist dressed in clumsy clothes, looked like he would be a homeless person. We asked to check the room first and he was not realy fond of it. We were shown the room in the basement, no. 2, extremely small, with very dirty shower all black at the edges and with a feeling that this would be the worst accommodation ever. We asked for another room immediately and recepctionist wanted to charge us 10 pounds more for the room which was confirmed to us by phone. We did not accept this trick and got a room upstairs finaly. This room was a bit larger, no. 9, more clean, only blanket and walls were dirty. Furniture was very poor and old, but it seems the same for all the rooms in general. Breakfast is continental, only from 7.30-09.00 and breakfast room too small. We came to the breakfast room at 08.30 and there were already guests standing in front of the door watching the other people eating. We explained to the receptionist that we did not intend to make other people uncomfortable by watching them eating and that we would go back to our room and we asked him to call us when there would be enough space to have breakfast. This worked out just perfectly and receptionist, Mr. Hussein, was very kind. Next day we had an early morning departure and asked how they deal with the breakfast. From our previous experiences in all other hotels or guest houses they always leave something for the guests as prearranged or they bring some things or breakfast box into the room. Reply was that they normaly would not do it as breakfast was complimentary anyway- free of charge- so it was not neccessary to deal with it. We explained that breakfast was definitely part of the room price calculation, that we booked BB and that these days people would not get anything as free of charge. Finaly we agreed to leave something for us, but night receptionist did not know anything about this arrangement. In general- absolutely dissapointing accommodation, matching 1-2 stars, very basic, but acceptable in a way.

Now, I like to walk so this review may not be consistent with your style but being in the Victoria area it was no big deal getting to places like Buckingham Palace and the Parliament area. BTW... DO read about the ALTERNATE Changing of the Guards area. When I went there it was a very manageable, small crowd and I could see everything just fine... good photo ops with the guards at the gate as well! Anyway... Westminster Abbey is also walkable, and if you're up for it, all the way to Trafalgar Sq, the Theatre District, Shakespeare's Globe (the tour is also worth the time)etc...

The shower is about 2.5 feet square so it might be uncomfortable if you're a large person, but it was fine for us. There is no air conditioner, and I couldn't find a way to turn the radiator on, but the temperature was comfortable enough while we were there. There's a small TV that worked fine. As other reviewers have mentioned, there's no elevator. We had a room up one flight of stairs, also the breakfast room is below ground floor so there are stairs involved there too. The room is small but not too claustrophobic. Also there's only one wardrobe to unpack into, so be prepared to live out of your suitcase if you have a lot of stuff. One other tip, make sure you have the address of the hotel with you when you show up - it's on a long street of identical buildings with identical doors and they're almost all hotels!", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramsey, Harwich, Essex", "Title": "\u201cSmall, clean fairly convenient hotel, needing a little tlc.\u201d", "Author": "VinceLun", "ReviewID": "UR80204827", "Content": "I spent one night here during the papal visit; booked through 'Laterooms' at quite a discount it was good value for a bed and breakfast deal. The hotel is easily found, a good 10 minutes walk from Victoria, a helpful map can be printed off from the hotel web site. A friendly member of the hotel staff manned reception; a good welcome and paperwork easily dealt with made the arrival pleasant and easy after a long day. The room (12) was small but clean; its decor was quite scruffy in places though and was in need of some 'tlc' to make it presentable again. The TV was limited in terms of channels and the remote was not working - not a major issue, but again it was something that could easily be put right. The bathroom was small with shower, basin and toilet; all were clean. Toiletries consisted of just a small bar of soap in the shower and on the hand basin - this would have been better individually wrapped; I always take my own shower gel so it wasn't an issue, one always likes to know that bar soap is wrapped, definitely fresh and unused. The bed was comfortable and a definite plus was the number of pillows! I am often disappointed at the wafer thin pillow allowance - but here there were two reasonable pillows per person; the bed was firm and comfortable. I cannot comment on breakfast as I went down twice at 20-minute intervals to find a small queue on both occasions - the dining area is too small for the hotel and cannot accommodate many guests at one time. I can sympathise on space, but as only toast, croissants and tea or coffee was offered, it was not really worth the wait, as I had to make tracks for the next event. Perhaps offering guests a continental style breakfast pack delivered to their rooms may be an option? Tea or coffee can be made with the facilities already provided; I'm sure some local croissants, yoghurt and juice could be sourced to make this a viable option. As I booked the room at a heavily discounted rate, I was happy with the deal and could overlook the failings mentioned; however, had I booked the room at full rate it would have been a disappointment. The hotel should look to make improvements to the decor and small touches like the toiletries - breakfast service must be improved. Would I stay again? At the same discounted rate - most probably; at the normal rate? Unlikely. However, the Victor functions well as a 3 star hotel in a popular area, with a little work it would fully deserve the three stars it holds.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cA basic hotel with everything you need\u201d", "Author": "NgfamilyHK", "ReviewID": "UR60722959", "Content": "I just stayed there for one night and although basic, you have everything you need... coffee/tea maker, hairdryer, TV, internet access.

I booked the hotel combined with the Eurostar from Brussels for the price of 260 euro or about 180 pounds sterling, which I thought was already enough. My eyes fell on Victor Hotel as it looked nice in the pictures, and it was one of the hotels for a reasonable price. Yay, Expedia! Arriving at the hotel on the lovely Belgrave Road in Victoria, I was greeted by the manager and a trainee. Both managed very well to look at me with hollow expressions. Reminds me of some of my collegues at my hotel when they see tourists. I did the effort to pay 130 quid for their hotel, and all of them failed to even push out one smile for me all weekend. So I don't know where the other reviewers get their 'amazing friendliness' from. Came into my single room, and I was quite amazed. A tiny television, a miniature window, wallpaper loosening up on top of the walls, no electricity on most of the sockets and hot boiling water from the shower, even if you turn the temperature down. I saw prison cells in Belgium on tv the other day and they looked nicer than this room did. Not to dramatise, but it's really how I felt at that moment. Very unworthy of a 3 star hotel. So I changed to a double room for the second night and I had to pay the excessive extra charge of \u00c2\u00a330. The room was better though and at last I felt comfortable. But they had to make up too much for me to think back about this hotel and think it was even acceptable.

It's a nice, clean, reasonably-priced hotel in a very pleasant neighborhood. Rooms are small and there are no drawers but good hanging space. I shared a twin room and we each had a rolling bag next to the bed. You do have to be good friends to live out of suitcases for any length of time, but we spent six nights and developed a rhythm that made us both comfortable. We do both travel a lot. Bathroom is clean with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Very small shelf for cosmetics, etc. Breakfast is wholesome, nicely presented, and incredibly boring. We ate there every morning to save money and we enjoyed visiting with the staff, but the clientele is so varied that you often find yourself with no other guests who speak your language beyond smiles and nods. We always felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood and it became a joke about who would say first \"I love this neighborhood\" when we left the hotel. My young traveling companion is still complaining that she can't find a restaraunt like \"Seafresh\" back in San Francisco. One of my best afternoons in the neighborhood was when I decided I needed to do laundry and the lady who ran the laudromat sent me across the street to the pub to wait for my wash. Met up with some Australians who were doing their wash and we all caught up with the local gossip. Of course, the pint of local brew helped with the whole thing--my traveling companion says I took a significant nap after my laundry run. I highly recommend it. If you're accustomed to luxury, you won't be happy here. If you have a sense of humor and can climb some stairs, this is a good opportunity to experience London on holiday rather than as a tourist. Every staff member I met at the desk, in the breakfast room, or in my room was friendly and helpful. You usually meet a stinker in every stay, but we didn't have that experience here. The hotel is close to Victoria and Pimlico underground stations. I arrived at Heathrow, took the undergound to Victoria, and walked to the hotel. It cost me about 6 pounds total. My friend spent about 50 pounds on a taxi to take her from the airport to the hotel. It just depends on what's most important to you. We bought day tickets that gave us access to underground, bus, and light rail. We used the underground to get around during the day, but always used the 24 bus to come home at night. Sit up top--it takes you past all the tourist sights and drops you right at the front door of the hotel. If you buy Day tickets, be sure to check out the 2 for 1 deals. Our big saving was on the Tower of London. We were tired and thought we'd seen all the \"old stuff\" we could deal with on our last day in London, but we agree that this is something you shouldn't miss.
