The hotel does NOT look like it does on their website, the doors to the rooms don't even have numbers. Well they do, they have duct tape with the room numbers written on the tape. No one ever told me about all the construction going on when I made these reservations over a month ago. One of our rooms smelled like a skunk, yes a skunk. The other room, the door was not hung straight so there was almost an inch between the top of the door and the frame, there was dust everywhere and smelled like cigarettes and this was supposed to be a non smoking room. When I set my luggage on the bed a cloud of dust came up off the bed. The top of the dresser was supposed to be black but was white because of all the dust. When we complained and asked to be moved to the Studio City location they told us we would have to pay a $70 difference per night per room. When I mentioned that the person I made the reservations with should have warned me about all the construction, I was told that they had issues with him and fired him. Not my problem. Then I was told that there are 2 different people that work on their website and that one of them puts information about the construcion on and the other one keeps taking it off, again not my problem . I explained that when I called last week to confirm my reservation again no one told me about all the dust and construction. We were not the only ones to complain. 3 girls that checked in right before us came back down to the lobby to complain abut the smell and dust and a family that checked in after us came back to the lobby with the same complaints. We also waited almost 30 minutes for the manager to come from the other hotel to talk to us, which was just a waste of time. He would not even look us in the eye, it was almost like he couldn't get rid of us quick enough. No one, not even the manager seemed to care or want to be bothered. We eneded up not staying there and moving our reservations to the Embassy Suites, should have booked there first. Only $30 more a night and that included breakfast the managers reception AND CLEAN rooms with NO smell!!! DO NOT stay here!! I'm not to picky about where I stay, as long as the rooms are clean it's good enough for us, but this was just horrible!!

I was totally prepared for the fake wood floors, dark rooms, shotty paint/construction and the poor excuse for a pool per previous reviews. But I was not prepared for the ants. We killed over 30 in the first 3 hours. They were mostly in the bathroom. On the second day there were so many in the kitchenette that we finally called down to the front desk. They said they would send someone right up. They did. Two men with a huge jug of ant killer. They sprayed all around the kitchenette and then wiped up the dead ants. They said \"they shouldn't bother you anymore\" and then left. No one ever apologized and no one offerered to let us switch rooms. But what good would it have done? If we had that many ants, I'm guessing all the rooms did too. We also saw some in the pool room. The PROS: Close to Universal City Walk and Universal Studios. You walk about 2 blocks and then catch a free shuttle up the hill to the fun. We stayed 2 nights for under $300. 2 nice tv's in the room - ours was a Queen suite. Great shower. Free Wi-fi that actually worked! Plenty of space to move around in the room. CONS: not very kid friendly. You have to walk all the way thru the entire parking garage to get to a room with the smallest hotel pool I've ever seen. There is no bible in the room, no book with hotel services or area attraction numbers or help in the area what-so-ever. The whole place was just cold and inpersonal. Other than the ants, it was just an ok experience. It was worth the stay because it was cheap and I managed to get free parking. I have no idea where the spa was, they gave me 3 brochures, but never said where it was. I doubt I will ever stay there again.

Good neighborhood restaurants are within walking distance. THE MINUSES: There's a difference between European minimalist which is what we think this hotel is going for, and just plain stark. Smallish rooms have harsh overhead spot lights and no bedside lamps so reading in bed is almost impossible. What appears to be a laminate floor is dark, without any rugs. The thermostat on the wall is not connected to the wall a/c unit so you have to turn it on manually, and it is difficult to adjust. Direct TV was not intuitive, and there were no directions. European shower, while efficient, also was not intuitive. we had to call the desk to find out how to use it. Even though the place has been open just a few months, it's already showing signs of wear in the wall covering. Worst is parking. It's available under the building, but is so limited that if your car is the last one in a slot, you'll be stacked behind another car and will have to leave your keys at the desk so staff can move your car if needed. Beds were way too soft for us. This hotel should not be open yet. Although we were told that bedside lamps are \"on the way\" and that the thermostat will be fixed, we'd be reluctant to stay here again unless we were assured that all problems had been fixed.

Upon first glance, the hotel would seem modern and smart. But after staying there, the reality is much darker. First off, if it's a hotel and spa, where is the \"spa\"? There was no literature about any amenity or service to be found anywhere in the lobby or in my room, which I find odd. Usually there is at least a booklet to tell a traveler where local attractions and services are located; this place had none. But this falls in line with the Spartan decor of the room. I decided to go to the lounge, where I proceeded to have to train two employees how to pour a tap beer because, as I was told numerous times, \"the bartender isn't here yet,\" and it was 4 p.m. The employee charged me $5 for two beers and said he would refill them. When the bartender did arrive for \"happy hour,\" we ordered another two beers, and we were charged $14 for them. Nice consistency there, fellas. When we arrived back at the hotel at 2 a.m., we wanted to get some food. We asked what was open and that we just wanted some grub. The outgoing young guy working the desk wrote down a restaurant and called a cab for us, presumably someone he knew. He assured us the first place would be open. Thirty minutes later, we arrived at this restaurant, which was closed, so the cab driver proceeded to drive us to a restaurant five minutes from the hotel, and the cab fare was $60 by the end. There was some sort of trickery afoot, I am convinced. Lastly, as I called the next morning for checkout time, no answer. I will never stay here again, and while it is close to Universal, it's a dodgy place to be sure.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cBeware - This place is not ok.

Cons: Lousy service, lousy functionality of room features (tvs, phone, etc.), freeway noise, inept management, lousy housekeeping, overwhelming odors, dirty lobby entrance, garage a questionable hang-out spot. Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my story: From the website and the price offering this seemed like a great idea for my ongoing visits to LA to spend time with my son. How wrong I was. Here is how it all went down: Upon arrival, seemingly odd bit of sustained \"hanging out\" of folks in the parking lot (ground floor below hotel), something you'd expect more in a 7-Eleven parking lot, not in a place billing itself as a hotel and spa. I'll add that this continued throughout the visit. Also the cigarette butts stubbed out in the parking lot were numerous as was evidence of fast-food garbage and spent cans of beer, here's an idea, if that many people are smoking and hanging in your parking lot maybe a trash can and ash tray might be in order. The check in process was mildly encouraging, seemingly nice front desk. The room itself was at-a-glance on par with what you might for a newly appointed hotel. Nice bathroom with a clever sink and newer bed and linens but the floors are not really wood, some kind of plastic vinyl situation and this kind of is a common thread throughout, the room, faux, it kind of looks good but isn't really. The room was also a bit dark, but there was a patio. But a patio with a spilled Starbucks plastic cup and a big chocolaty coffee stain, which was not cleaned or removed during the whole visit. Room faces freeway on ramp. I get settled and unpacked and head out with son for a day together. Back in evening, flip on TV as is my habit pre bed in hotels. Blue screen, no signal. Try other TV. Nothing. Two remotes one not working. Since I am now in my night clothes, think best to call down to the desk and explain the problem. Hotel phone not working. Give up, go to sleep. Next AM. Try TVs. Nothing. Phone still dead. Get dressed, head down the hall with heavy scent of what smelled like about a kilo of fresh cut marijuana, seriously. I'm not one to just toss that out there, but it was pungent and breaking through the overload of air freshener they use in the halls. For what it's worth, the next day I didn't smell the dopey smell again, only the air freshener and that was noxious. Anyway back to the second day after a night and morning of no TV, no phone. Go to front desk and gently explain I have some problems. Desk says this will be fixed today. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix it now because only the maid knows how to fix it (?) and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not here yet. I give her my son's cell and ask she call and let us know when all is fixed, so I can be reassured because my confidence is a little off kilter. Son and I head out for the day. Hotel calls, says all is fixed except the phone, phone can't be fixed. Something about needing multiple vacant rooms in order to fix the phone in this room, and by golly, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been full since they opened. Do I have a cell phone or should they move me to another room? I say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh no need to move, I have my cell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It's fine, I can deal with this. Back at hotel after dinner. Son and I have doubts so he comes in to check the room with me. In lobby, manager is there, seems nice. Make some small talk about the NBA Finals and then head up to the room. Try TVs. Neither works. Phone still dead. Son and I head down to see the manager. Manager says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new property and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he took the time to come in on the weekend. He says he knocked on the door earlier to address the problem, but we weren't there so he couldn't fix it. We try and explain we addressed it earlier and Hotel called and said they fixed it. He kept cutting us off as we tried to explain the situation. He says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come up to the room and fix it. Explains on the way that people sometimes misuse the TVs and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hard to use. Comes into room, adjusts something on back of one TV (voila, it works!), then tries the same trick on the other. No go. Tells us that remote control for second TV has no battery, that's the problems there. Would we be ok just using the one, ok sure. And that he is sorry but these things happen, we are all human after all. And would we like for him to buy us a drink. No thanks. How about some champagne he offers. No thank you. After he leaves I prep for next morning and find the coffee pot hasn't been cleaned. Ugh, so I clean it. Son leaves and asks to speak with manager, front desk staff say he is upstairs helping a guest. Son waits, and sees manager walk in from sidewalk outside hotel. Upstairs huh? Son meets him outside and explains coffee situation and asks if that is normal for this hotel? Manager explains that no, he is sorry and happy son isn't cursing at him, and that we are nice people, and that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maid must have lost her mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and offers to clean the room personally. And again offers champagne and drinks. No thanks. Son asks that his mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room and stay be without incident forthwith, could he see to that? Yes he says, he could do that. Next two days are without much incident. We say hello and goodbye and are polite but the earlier snafus are never mentioned by staff. Never see the manager again, although he is on premises. In the comings and goings the staff just seems sheepish, incompetent, and basically clueless. Last day there, back after an evening with son. Close to bedtime for a nice 65 year old lady. Knock on door. Manager wants to give me a bottle of some kind of champagne. I respond I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink champagne (I honestly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). Guy at door tries to get me to take it, but I tell him no till he finally leaves. Checked out the following morning. Once again, the parking lot seems to be a hangout for folks who may or may not stay at this hotel. Me, never going back. And I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to hotel stays but in this case, fellow travelers need to be warned about this place. PS: At one point the manager offered a reduction in room rate. Haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from him on that one since I left. ________________________________________ No virus found in this message.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service and accommodations!\u201d", "Author": "jen_bump", "ReviewID": "UR111181708", "Content": "Staying at this hotel was an extremely positive experience!

The price was amazing so I went for it. When we got there, wow I wanted to run. Its a refurbished Holiday Inn Express. Their website said: Discount tickets available for Universal Studios. LIE! I called downstairs and they said we \"dont do that\". --- BLVD guests will also enjoy a complimentary shuttle to Universal Studios. Half truth! Sure if we walk to Universal and catch the shuttle that is OFFERED TO ANYONE NOT JUST BLVD GUESTS!! Nice bait and switch, especially for someone who has a back problem and chose your hotel for the tickets and shuttle. I asked for the shuttle and was told to walk down the hill. BLVD Highlights: - Newly Built Luxuriously Furnished Hotel refurbished Holiday Inn Express - Free WiFi Would be nice if you advised your customers that they have to use a key to get into your net - Cafe Blvd a few SNapples , muffins and a box of Fruit Loops? - Indoor Heated Pool not open! Who wouldnt want to swim while on vacation? - 24 Hour Fitness Center where? Was it open? - 24 Hour Guest Service/Concierge Wasnt even asked how my stay was, was given a # to a cab instead of having one called for me - 24 Hour Security/Video Surveillance YOU NEED IT IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD - Tour Deck/Car Rental no such thing - Valet Parking luckily we didnt need it Having booked online I never even knew of what was NOT available at the time of my stay. When I got there I felt trapped because all other rooms were skyrocketing due to Spring Break. Trust me I tried to find another room. Our room had scuffs on the baseboards, the coffee pot was dirty, there was a wire hanging out of the wall....yuck. I understand that bleaching towels is imparative but consider lowering it because I broke out all over due to the amount of it. I understand a soft opening of a hotel but to pull a bait and switch online is outrageous.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The BLVD Hotel & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d2072559-Reviews-The_BLVD_Hotel_Spa-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$146 - $299*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10730 Ventura Blvd</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Studio City</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">91604</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2072559", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d3/97/8b/blvd-hotel-at-daytime.jpg"}}
