I think we paid about \u00a335 for the night so I knew the hotel was going to be basic and wasn't expecting a lot. I was right not to expect much because the place is pretty grim and I didn't sleep a wink all night! The foyer is horrible, the stairs and hallways are horrible and the rooms are shabby but ok if you are not at all fussy or squeamish about dirt and mould. Oh and the window didn't shut either. I wasn't necessarily disappointed - I think I just over estimated my ability to deal with the grime factor. Think Eddie and Richie's bedsit in the series 'Bottom' !! We skipped breakfast as I was too scared to even think about it! One thing though - as our gig at the Hammersmith Apollo finished late we would have had to get a black cab home to any of the other hotels we were thinking about staying at but as this was just down the road we strolled home which was one big plus and saved us ALOT of money! It is gross - but if you can deal with it it's a cheap way to stay in London - just make sure you have a few to drink before you go back to your room!!", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly adequate for the price\u201d", "Author": "Caomhinstravels", "ReviewID": "UR123744235", "Content": "Clean room, decent bathroom, good shower, wifi in lobby, ok breakfast.

There is free wifi in the lobby - don't bother trying to pay for the wifi in the room, because you'll never connect, the signal is terrible most of the time. The tv also had limited reception, sometimes great, sometimes crappy. After reading the reviews, I had reservations about staying but decided that as I've stayed in plenty of crappy English hotels... and the Premier West is an example of that. The lobby is shabby but the receptionists are very friendly. The ground floor corridor fire-door is helped to shut by a piece of folded paper - and this is where the Premier West Hotel comes into its own... My single room (109) looked ok - wooden flooring, private bathroom, the radiator worked and the window opened but despite it being newly-ish refurbished, you can tell in a few months it'll be a crappy room again because everything that should be fixed into position is starting to fall off already (toilet roll holder, toilet flush, bathroom floor tiles). The towels were changed every day. The bed linen was clean but the counterpane was splotched with what I hope were tea stains - this is because the bedside table is at the end of the bed with a small tv and kettle perched on top of it - no easy way to make tea without spilling it! They only refreshed the tea/coffee every other day but the kettle did work! For me, comfy enough for \u00a317.50 a night. I'd feel quite ticked off if I'd paid more though because there are too many little irritations to make your stay comfortable enough, unless it's just for one night.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zuerich", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs in Premier West!!\u201d", "Author": "gal5", "ReviewID": "UR21987931", "Content": "Stay away!!

I noticed something crawling across my chest on the last night around 3.30 am and i hopped out of bed, turned the light on and found these bugs crawling all over me.

( the continental is just two cereal, tea, juice and toast) The man at reception did seem sympathetic and said he would complain to housekeeping.

We went to the doctor and he confirmed with the help of the photos i took of them that they were indeed BED BUGS!!!! we had been bitten and our rash was an allergic reaction which we had for a week. We ended up spending a fortune on creams and tablets, sprays and disinfectants. The premier west hotel was not reasonable to us because of the further expense it caused our health.
