It's very close to the Octavia train station. The connections to the center of the city are ok in the morning, as the trains come every 15-20 minutes, but in the evening they only go every 40-50 minutes, and the last train starts a bit too early from downtown(around 10:30 PM) There are some night busses but the bus stop is not so close to the hotel. There are some trains that do not stop in Octavia, so make sure you ask someone before getting on, as the station displays might be missleading. The breakfast is typical italian one, with croissants and a lot of sweet things, no salty things like vegetables, cheese, eggs or ham.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Octavia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d626944-Reviews-Hotel_Octavia-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$59 - $130*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Bottari Giovanni Gaetano 38</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00135</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "626944", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/65/a5/65a5a2ed22e549dae140b37431483e5a8large.jpg"}}
