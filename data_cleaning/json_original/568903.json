Campo de Fiore which is close is a good place for young people but I would recommend Pizza Navona instead for a comfortable night stroll. The hotel recommends and opera which we attended. It was nice enough for a person that is not a great fan of opera. If you are a true fan, I would recommend an actual opera house.

In August 2005, on our return to the Eternal City, we re-visited this tiny hotel, now upgraded, refurbished and renamed Hotel In Parione. Hotel In Parione now boasts a gleaming new lift, all rooms have en suite bathrooms, air conditioning, telephone and satellite TV. Extra touches, such as plenty of soft fresh towels, soaps plus a hairdryer in the bathroom are included and certainly not commonly found in hotels costing a mere 85 Euro for a double room in the High Season in one of Europe\u2019s capital cities! The room we were given was compact, clean and comfortable. The huge bed was ultra-comfortable and the entire room, carpet and furnishings were spotlessly clean. The bathroom was immaculate and the warm invigorating shower most welcome in the heat of Summer. A sink, toilet and bidet completed our gleamingly tiled en suite. The manager, Eugenio, and every one of his most helpful, charming multilingual staff attended to our every need and query. This service commenced many months prior to our arrival, with helpful Email correspondence to all our questions and reservations. Upon arrival, as ordered by Eugenio, a taxi was waiting for us at Rome Fiumicino airport and another was ordered for us upon our sad departure at a flat rate of 55 Euro and 48 Euro respectively for the trips. Breakfast is an optional extra and we found this most enjoyable and nourishing before a hard day of sightseeing. Breakfast is served at the sister hotel, Smeralda, just opposite Hotel In Parione, at a cost of 7 Euros each. Excursions to all parts of Rome are organized by the Hotel reception, should you not feel like foot slogging it as we did. Theater bookings are also arranged by them. A tour was organized by Hotel In Parione for us to Hadrian\u2019s Villa and the Villa d\u2019Este on our last afternoon in Rome. We were picked up at the Hotel and dropped again close to the Hotel that evening, at an all inclusive cost of 50 Euros per person. This 4-hour tour included a multilingual and very informative tour guide as well as all entry fees. Being close to most major noteworthy sights in Rome means minimal transport costs and is the ultimate bonus of staying at Hotel In Parione. My husband and I walked nearly everywhere and thus were able to see the most important historical sites such as the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps, St. Peter\u2019s, the Forum and Colosseum in just a few short days without the hassle and expense of public transport. If you are footsore, however, the Hotel is situated within 5 minutes\u2019 walk of Piazza Argentina, from where buses depart to all parts of the city 24 hours a day. Just next to Piazza Argentina is the ancient Area Sacra, where (unknown to many tourists) on 15th March, 44 BC Julius Caesar was assassinated. Now Area Sacra is home to Rome\u2019s huge colony of stray cats, lovingly cared for and fed by the citizens of this great city. Being in the historic Campo de\u2019Fiori area is to experience Roman life as no other tourist is able to. By day, a colorful fruit and vegetable market is held in the square. Locals flock to this area in the evenings for its excellent and inexpensive trattoria, where the atmosphere, food and vino cannot be beaten. On our last evening in Rome, we had a wonderful meal at Tosca, a pavement trattoria in Largo dei Chiavari, just a stone\u2019s throw from Hotel In Parione in the company of some friendly young Romans out on the town. To many, a holiday spent in Rome, alas, means also a fortune spent on accommodation. This need not be the case if you choose Hotel In Parione!
