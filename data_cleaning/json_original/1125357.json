We may have had bad luck, but this was not exactly the best experience. Nice location, true; nice flat, true; polite staff, ok... but... 1) Wi-Fi did not work. The staff was quite friendly, but they looked at us as thinking \"you're not using your computers properly\"... Our iphones and computers worked perfectly well everywhere else... And after three days, Wi Fi was never fixed. It caused a lot of problems for me, since I work online. 2) Since our computer had no internet, I asked to use the staff's computer for the airline check.in. Printing our boarding passes was very complicated.The printer did not work very well. It lacked toners and paper sheets. I ended up printing in an internet caf\u00e9. 3) The credit card was charged twice. It took us a while to figure it out (no internet!). Back home we wrote the managemente and got the money back... Guess what happened! the credit card system did not work properly... 4) After travelling quite a lot (you may check my other reviews) I have learned to appreciate courtesy from accomodation services. Nothing luxurious, just simple things. If you pay nearly 600 or 700 dollars for a three-day service, a few extra details are welcome (i.e. we got chocolate in Vienna, wine in Paris, etc.)... We asked for detergent, and told us that it was their policy not to provide detergent for guests who stay for only three nights/days. There was no obligation for them to supply detergent for the washing machine of the apartment BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY DID IT ANYWAY.Not exactly generous. (how much is it, 1? 2 dollars?) 6) I know we may have had bad luck, but next time in Madrid, I'm going to have to skip this option.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "marche", "Title": "\u201cfantastic, central located, clean and spacious,well equiped flat\u201d", "Author": "mikiMarche", "ReviewID": "UR49060354", "Content": "i really did not expect such a great service, initially was afraid, because i have never used this type of accomodation and i thought that on arrival i might stay without the roof over my head, fortunatelly everything turned up better than i could have imagine. the office was in the same building as the apartament which was another advantage, friendly staff, and above all the central location of the flat made my holiday. well equiped kitchen, modern furniture, air condition and wi-fi this are another few things worth mentioning. i would strongly recommend apartments apart to everyone and will use in the future.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean, modern spacious apartment - perfect weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "OMacster", "ReviewID": "UR48975804", "Content": "Never done business with ApartmentsApart and was very pleasantly surprised to find that our apartment was fantastic. Me and a friend shared a 1 bedroom apartment (I got the bed, he got the sofa bed) - all with modern furniture and best of all air conditioning - definitely needed it in the hot hot madrid summer heat!! This apartment is very close to Chueca - the gay heart of Madrid and yet is off the main streets so was quiet enough (admittedly we were on the 4th floor too which may have helped). So we have used this company again (for a BCN stay) and would def use them again next time in Madrid", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful apartment in the center of the city\u201d", "Author": "catalepsky", "ReviewID": "UR48867517", "Content": "The building was well located, the apartment was large, well lit and well furnished.
