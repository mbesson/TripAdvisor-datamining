Some reviewers seem to have had a problem with noise, and John at reception did enquire if it was too noisy for me, but I really didn't notice the noise on the weekend once I closed my window, and I was in a room right at the front. Having mentioned John, I must say he was the most friendly and helpful host I could have asked for. He checked with me every day as to how I was going, and as a solo traveller I appreciate that. The breakfast was just right, all you could want from scrambled eggs to toast, coffee, tea, juice, cereals, cheese and cold meat. Previous reviewers have mentioned the difficult stairways - yes, it's Amsterdam, there are difficult stairways. The staff were very helpful and insisted on carrying my (very heavy) bag up and down the stairs. The room was spacious and very clean. It was cleaned daily and I had a hard time convincing the cleaning guy that I did not need new towels every day! The location was excellent, so close to all the sights, just a short walk away or catch the trams nearby. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it. I must note, the hotel is above a coffee shop (which in Amsterdam means a place where you smoke pot) and it is allowed to smoke in the rooms. The smell was quite strong in the hallways but I did not notice it at all in my room. I do not smoke pot but this did not bother me in the slightest - you have to remember it is legal there.

The room was spaceful, and the mattresses was good, only bad thing was that the beds kept sliding apart, and left me feeling so lonely with my boyfriend all the way over on the other side :) There was no hairdryer or ironing board, but you could borrow it if you needed to. The only thing we missed in the room was a small refrigerator for drinks and stuff. The reception is not open 24 hours, but we didnt find any difficulties with it because the coffeshop down starirs are open until 01.00 am and the staff there are happy to help you with anything you might need help with. They also provide very good regular ,and amsterdam coffe in the coffeshop :) Breakfast was good, but plain. Two kinds of bread and some different kinds of cheese, jams and ham.

The location couldnt have been better, nice atmosphere and lots of good restaurants, bars, cafes and coffeshops around. Impulsive preformances in the streets wich we think is very cosy and fun.

The room looked clean and well presented on the first look...but look deeper... The room was very small...enough room to walk around the bed though. The sheets looked clean, as they where white.. Bathroom was very very small, but we managed to cope for the 4 days. On the 2nd day, I started get these red lumps (very itchy) turns out there was bed bugs!!! Yuck. I am covered and so is my boyfriend. That put me off immediately. Plus one evening we where walking about in our bare feet and my fella screamed, and there was a rusty nail sticking up out of the floor. The location of the hotel is excellent. It took less than a minute to walk to the main square of Leidesplein and about 15minutes walk to Dam Sqaure. The hotel would be fine for those wishing to make alot of use of the local coffeeshops, but for those wishing to have a nice weekend away, stay in a nicer hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cThief\u201d", "Author": "simon1970Yorkshire", "ReviewID": "UR17871918", "Content": "Tired, small, dirty over priced rooms !!!

There was a carnivore there at the same time, they were cooking him omlettes and he was tucking into the meat and cheese continental breakfast too, so everyone is catered for. Coffee was nice too! The decking out the back is a great place to sit in the afternoon, and downstairs, Rookies itself is a lovely place for a coffee :) The stairs up to the hotel are a bit intimidating at first, but after 2 days I was not even holding into the handrail, they look worse than they actually are. I'm one of the clumsiest people ever, and I didn't have a problem! I loved it so much that we have already booked up for New Year, can't wait! I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Amsterdam.

Hotel Uptown shares its management with the The Rookies Coffee Shop, which is in itself a great place to hang out, and is a great place to wait for those in your group who like to sleep in, as it is directly underneath the Hotel. Because of this you may hear the hotel referred to as Hotel Uptown / The Rookies in some booking sites. Fear ye not, it is the same Hotel! We arrived much earlier than normal check-in time, but the man behind the reception desk was flexible and accommodating. He gave us the key to a room that had been vacated earlier that morning so that we could securely stow our luggage, and then by the time we had explored and had some lunch, he had already transferred our bags to our actual room. We had booked a luxury twin (as per the continental standard, a double wasn't an option), and while it isn't Dorchester-style luxury, you do get a nice bath instead of just a shower. The beds were lightweight, so they did tend to slide apart sometimes, but again, its par for the course in a continental B&B. The rest of the room was pleasantly decorated, and had plenty of storage space, while the bathroom was bigger than our one at home! There is a TV in the room, with BBC1 and the ubiquitous BBC World, as well as a phone. Breakfast was a buffet of cereal, bread, hams and cheese. Watch the toaster - it's got one hell of a spring on it and I lost one of my slices of toast down the side of the counter! I also had scrambled eggs cooked to order, and the Amsterdam standard of choosing from a plethora of flavoured tea bags to add to your cup of hot water was followed. There are no objections to taking food or drink from breakfast back up to the room, so there was no issue with the fact that my other half didn't manage to leave the room before 10am on any of the three mornings we were there. In terms of location, not only is there the cosy Rookies below the hotel, but next door there is a small supermarket, and the Leidse Plein is only at the end of the street, which during the day is exceptionally quiet, but at night (especially at weekends) turns into one of the main drags for bars and clubs. This can get noisy, so be prepared for a slightly restless Friday and Saturday night if you are not one of the revellers.

Arriving around 11am after a 12 hour flight, I was met at reception by John. Now John is a strangely engaging fellow, whose quick wit was always amusing. I had requested a room at the \"back\" of the hotel which was a good move for me because it got me into double on the 3rd floor (room 3.4) for the first 2 of 3 days spent there. Nice view to the rear of the property, with the only real noise being from little kids playing on the swings in a property at the rear. The room was larger than expected, very clean, had a room safe, comfy beds, TV with reasonable channel selection, and a practical bathroom including a tub. After a nice hot shower, with good water pressure, I was a new man, in need of a coffee, so I ventured downstairs (and next door) to the Rookies coffeeshop, which is worth a visit as well. The stairs weren't quite the challenge I'd expected, and the hand rail offers good support. The hotel is situated above the very roomy, \"quite\" friendly, and well equipped Rookies coffeeshop. Also just accross the lane is the Rookies Bar & Grill where a 10oz Heineken will set you back EU$2.10. Note that the bar (as well as the hotel) is \"smoker\" friendly. The little area at the rear of the bar, over-looks a canal and is ideal for sipping beers or even a meal. Breakfast (now served in the small but quaint dining room in the hotel reception area) was well presented and DO remember that JOHN loves to cook eggs to your personal preference if asked. Toast, jam, cheese, cold meat, cereal, milk, coffee, tea and juice are all there on offer as well. Trams 1, 2, and 5 will get you from Central to Leidseplain, then follow your nose down Korte Leidsedwarsstraat for a couple of hundred meters to the Hotel. Plenty of culinary options nearby, as well as several famous attractions all within easy walking distance. The small convenience store right beside the hotel is perfect for late night munchies. I payed EU$65 per night for a single room, booking directly with the hotel, and left there feeling like I'd robbed them. A very fair price indeed. On my third night I knew I had to change to a REAL \"single\" room as the hotel was filling up. John offered me one at the rear on the 4th floor. In the end I decided to take the room often critisised at the FRONT on the floor above the coffeeshop. I took it mostly out of fair play for having had such a nice room for the first 2 days at the single room rate. I feared the noise would annoy me... It didn't, in fact it was kinda cool to kick back in the room and watch the world going by outside. That said, this room is very small, but still adequate for one person. The noise factor was minimal. Reception closes about 6pm, after which you use the small electronic tag thingy on your room key-ring to access the hotel.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cAmongst many stays in the Dam\u201d", "Author": "DetroitJim", "ReviewID": "UR10038532", "Content": "The stay at the Hotel Uptown/Rookies was typically great.

Even the bathroom had a swinging door window that you could open up so that while you rested and painfully remove last night's Doner/Kebab (stay away from hot sauce), you could peacefully look at the trees out back and hear the birds sing. The bathroom was a major success, where you dont have to tuck your elbow's in just to dry yourself off! It's huge!! I will always ask for this room, it's quiet and fantastic (it's just roughly 5-10 euro each more per night). The only difference now is that you have to head across the very narrow street to the Rookies Restaurant to get your beer, as opposed to sitting at their coffee shop to smoke and sip your beer. But it didnt matter; we grabbed the smoke and did that with the beer at the restaurant seats out front of it!! No big deal!!
