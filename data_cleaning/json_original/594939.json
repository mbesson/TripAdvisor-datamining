The room was clean and I enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep here. The breakfast had a good choice. Continental style, lots of cheeses, cold meats, breads, cereals and fruit.

The rooms are small and tidy. The beds are good and the bathroom is clean. The biggest problem is the noise in the street at night. This hotel is well located for visiting, but unfortunately it is located in a street with a lot of nightlife. The first night it was quiet as from 3.00 am, the second and third night it was noisy all night long (till 6 am). At least 200 people are standing in the street just outside the discotheque (there are two just beside and in front of the hotel) and making a lot of noisy, screaming, shouting. It is a small street. If you keep your window closed or open, it doesn't make any difference. On top of this all, an ambulance came in the middle of the night to pick up some drunk party-animal, with the sirenes on for 5 minutes. Breakfast is poor.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington dc", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location\u201d", "Author": "alohaelyce", "ReviewID": "UR94391979", "Content": "Location Location Location, close to metro, Puerto del sol and lots of local restaurants nearby.
