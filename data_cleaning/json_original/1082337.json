Everything else about my four night stay was so nice I hate to give the hotel such a low rating, but really, beds are critical! Another reviewer mentioned that the beds are too soft - no, I disagree. The beds are not soft, they SAG. Two nights of this bed gave me my first ever back pain. Mine was apparently not the first complaint since there is a helpful list of back exercises included with the hotel information packet. I rearranged the room enough to pull one of the mattresses off the worse-than-useless box springs, put it on the floor and slept quite well after that. Other than that, the place is bright, cheerful, clean and friendly. The rooms are large for a city-center, the bathrooms are sensibly arranged and have all the necessities, and the breakfasts were wonderful. There are few restuarants within easy walking distance, but it's so close to a main subway line that this isn't much of a drawback. It would be a really good value if you didn't have to sleep there! Bottom line, I would not stay here again unless the beds were replaced.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Friendly Helpful Staff, Value For Money.\u201d", "Author": "Dufflepod", "ReviewID": "UR127843355", "Content": "Really can't say much more than the previous reviewers. 2 minute walk to the U-bahn.

Your room will not be comfortable enough to spend much time in, other than being asleep. There is one upright rigid chair and a very, very low bed. The one major thing that this hotel needs is a decent bar to come \"home\" to after a days sightseeing. The seats mostly do not have a back to them you feel as though you are not encouraged to spend any time there.

Back to the Best Western, we never ever felt that we could find a comfortable seat, in your room or even at breakfast, which I have to say is quite good. So many fruit juices, meats, cheeses, etc. One big worry for us was that nobody \"policed it\". We felt that anyone could walk in off the streets and eat there, we were never once (5 nights) asked for our room number. Luggage could be left there safely for a refundable 1 euro, but it does fill up very quickly. I would suggest going down and reserving your \"box\" the night before. The reception staff were really helpful. Free internet access in the reception. To sum this hotel up is: don't expect anything other than a bed to sleep in, in a clean room - which is all you could ask for as we don't want to see Berlin from a hotel bedroom. Be aware of the noisy works outside at the time. Don't expect to have a nice bar to unwind in after a full days sightseeing. You really must visit the restaurant in the TV Tower, not expensive but totally unmissable. Remember to book your table online before your visit.

Our room wasn't ready yet, which was fine as we were early, and they had a large selection of lockers downstairs to stow your bags until check-in time. Only a 1 Euro deposit for the locker, so it's essentially free. Staff were all friendly, helpful, and attentive. The room was much bigger than expected. Looking at the floorplan, we got the biggest room in the building (any room x01 it seems) which was the front corner on a high floor (6 out of 9). The beds were easy to separate and very comfortable. The bathroom has a large tub and a separate shower. The A/C was appreciated as it was the hottest day of the year yet, making an end of the day bath even more enjoyable. We didn't try the breakfast, but it looked like it offered a very wide selection. There are two bakeries just across the street, so we went there instead. There were restaurants as well, which could also come in handy. Only downside was no free wi-fi.

It had the best shower I think I've ever used. TV wise another English speaking channel than CNN would have been good but you don't go on holiday to watch TV.

The rooms are modern and clean. The beds are really comfortable. The hotel is quiet, only little noise from the corridor. The hotel is located central in Berlin.

Not so good about this hotel: The rooms are tiny and everything else than colorful. The nearest surroundings are Berlin-grey buildings, making the view or a walk in the neighborhood not very enchanting. You get the feeling that the hotel is much further away from the center than it really is. Rooms have no minibar, no pay-tv, and the hotel have no bar. The most negative with the hotel is the staff; the cleaning ladies came into my room not less than three times even if I hang the Do-not-disturb sign on the door; the receptionists were not friendly, helpful or interested in providing any service. I think it is important that the staff in a hotel actually likes working in the hotel business\u2026 My conclusion is: It\u2019s a great hotel to stay at if you are in Berlin on your own, if you are looking for a cheap and central place to stay, if you\u2019re not a demanding customer, or if you are in Berlin for business trip. I would not recommend the hotel if you want a bit of luxury, if you want to live close to bars, nightclubs or restaurants, or if you\u2019re staying in Berlin for a romantic weekend.

A 5 minute walk from the U2 line (and I walk very slowly!) The staff were lovely and very helpful, they were able to recommend places to eat, call taxis, and booked a table for us at the TV tower. Although there was not that much in the immediate vicinity there was a really good and reasonably priced tapas restaurant opposite - which had live music on the night we went. There was also a little bakery opposite, I would recommend skipping the breakfast, which although I'm sure was very good, came up at \u20ac9pp. The cakes opposite were 90cents! Under a mile away was 4 or 5 restaurants, a taxi there was not much, or it would be easy to find walking (ask for mutter hoppe - only go there if you are really REALLY hungry though!!!) I'm not sure what most of the rooms are like as I had a disabled room, I think maybe just slightly smaller however the room was very clean, had its own thermostat and the beds were amazing! The hotel is so new nothing has a chance to feel shabby yet...go there while it still feels luxury! I would definitely recommend this hotel, it's extremely comfortable, in a nice quiet area but with a central location and very close to the underground line. The staff were really helpful and I got the hotel for less than I would have paid for a not such a safe bet, privately run hotel in a dodgy area! Points for disabled travelers: The hotel itself is completely accessible, with lifts and level entry etc. There are 8 accessible rooms which were really good, they were easily wide enough to get a wheelchair around (although you would be limited to one side of the bed - which were 2 twins pushed together) The bathroom was a large wetroom, the shower was amazingly powerful, the floor was total non slip and there was a seat that could be slid along the rail to be under the shower or out of the way. The toilet was a little terrifying at first as they had raised the toilet seat from underneath with a bucket like contraption, so you still sat on the normal toilet seat. Actually I think that system is much better than the weird extender seats you get in england though. The room itself had no hand rails or anything, only the bathroom. The toilet was in the middle of the wall with lifting handrails on each side, so a wheelchair transfer would be possible from either side. Although it was well kitted out for a disabled user, the place didn't feel like a hospital, which was nice!! As far as the area goes, the street to the u station probably wasn't very useful for a wheelchair user - It was cobbled, drop kerbs not in useful places etc. However it was a very very quiet wide street that you could just go in the road with no issue. I am not in a wheelchair and found the walk to the underground station fairly easy (it's about 100m) There was a lift down to the underground (which you have to walk a little further for). I think I only went to one station that wasn't disabled/wheelchair accessible - and that was a random one right in the countryside (don't ask!). Generally Berlin was very disabled accessible. The public transport was all enabled for wheelchair users. Although the trams said they were, you have to go out into the middle of the road and they are pretty high up - so not sure how that works. Most of the transport was easy to get on and off with mobility impairments, except the tram, which involved a large step! I can't remember what the access into the tapas place opposite was like, but they had a disabled toilet so i'm going to presume it was ok! Generally most of the places we went were disabled friendly, unfortunately the TV tower was not wheelchair accessible and I encountered a very very unhelpful man at the berlin documentation centre (opposite the berlin wall) who would let me go up to the viewing tower in the lift but wouldn't let me come down - because it was 15 minutes before closing and he was turning the lift off! The restaurant mutterhoppe had a flight of stairs (although large and a good banister) and the 'story of berlin' had about 5 steps that had to be done (although they were very nice in there) One last note - When I went to berlin I was planning on borrowing wheelchairs in the galleries so I wasn't in so much pain. Alhough it is very common to find wheelchairs you can borrow in english museums, this doesn't seam to be the way in germany. The only place that had a wheelchair was the bauhaus archiv museum, which I would highly recommend as they were so lovely (before they realised they did have a wheelchair, they gave me a chair for my brother to carry around!)
