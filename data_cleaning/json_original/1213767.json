We were offered a room on the ground floor which I was initially worried about, as I thought we'd hear the traffic/noise/people passing by but it was very quiet.

If you go to the top of the hotel, you can step outside on to the balcony which has breathtaking views of the Blue Mosque. If you haven't got much luggage with you then it's worth booking the hotel's shuttle service to the airport. It's about 15 turkish lira each and it takes about 45 minutes to get to Ataturk airport.

Smack in between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia with incredible views of both, and the Bosphorus from the rooftop bar.

We purchased most of our water (you can\u00c2\u00b4t drink it) and such at the many little groceries in the area to save cost. Breakfast was adequate, if repetitive. Eggs, sausage, yogurt, cheese, the usual, and rather good. We were there for three nights. I think had we been there longer we may have grown tired of it. Staff was nice. Internet computer downstairs is a nice perk. Very low prices for use. Istanbul information is free, and just .06TL per minute (about 3 Euros per hour). As mentioned, location was great. Don\u00c2\u00b4t spend all of your time on the main street in Sultanahmet, venture just a few blocks backwards, towards the water for very lively streets with bars, restaurants, etc. Also, reasonably priced convenience stores. The ONE problem I had was with the rooftop bar. The bar closes at 11. We went there at around 10:15 or so. Ordered one glass of red wine, one of white. About 10 minutes later, the waiter came back with a BOTTLE of red, and said he would be back with the white. Ok...so we waited. Since the bar closes at 11, at around 11:10 or so we left, and took the bottle with us. Around 11:30 the waiter appeared AT OUR DOOR!!! with the glass of white wine, although we had not told him the room number, and demanded payment for the bottle and the glass of wine. My BF doesn\u00c2\u00b4t even really LIKE red wine. I suppose we could have left it upstairs, but with noone there, someone else could have taken it. So I said, I don\u00c2\u00b4t even WANT the wine now. It had been almost an hour, and I was ready for bed. Long story short, we all went downstairs, to see the lobby staff, who were a little dismissive. Almost as if I was making the story up. But I couldn\u00c2\u00b4t have been, I was there, in my nightclothes, with the waiter, and the glass of wine. When I mentioned I would speak to the Manager, miraculously the wine was taken off the bill, and we were only charged for the glass of red wine. Oddly, i had to GIVE BACK the glass of white wine, which was fine, because I didn\u00c2\u00b4t want it, but for what??? To give to another customer when the bar was closed???? Just strange.

When we mentioned that our toilet didn't flush and that we had no hot water we were assured a few hours later that the problem had been resolved. But no, it hadn't, the toilet never flushed (we used the dustbin provided in the bathroom and filled it up with water drawn from the bath) and the temperature of the water in the shower never got comfortably warm. Rooms need updating and bathroom needs refitting, urgently. The rooftop terrace is a real hidden gem with a 360\u00c2\u00b0 view over the city. Go up here at night to watch the sun set behind the Blue Mosque - it's exhilarating.

It's a five minute walk to the blue mosque, the Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Cistern etc. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful although I found myself slightly annoyed by one individual who would hover around waiting to be tipped for things like moving a suitcase 3 feet or bringing a spoon at breakfast. The hotel is clean enough, but the housekeeping staff is laconic at best about cleaning your room when you are in it. Hotel laundry is very reasonable at 10 turkish lira a kilo. The Bad: There is extremely loud music from one of the 'dervish shows' nightly until about 11pm. Its not just a bit of noise because it is so amplified that even with the windows closed, it can be heard very clearly. This is obviously not the fault of the hotel, however, I think it is something they really ought to mention. Especially when granting a booking to families with young children. We found the breakfast to be sort of gross including very runny scrambled eggs, hot dog slices in some kind of red sauce and cold french fries each morning. Stale bread was left in the bread basket, and fruits had obviously not been washed. Still, we all managed to find good things to eat like hard-boiled eggs, fresh rolls (if we got up early enough), and oranges. The Ugly: Our bathroom had been retrofitted with a 'spa tub' that leaked water onto the floor from underneath, each time we used the shower. We were afraid to even try the spa tub. Black mold was growing on the shower tile grout which could easily have been cleaned with a bit of bleach and water. The bathroom floor was vacuumed, but never washed during our stay. Linens were not changed until I stripped a bed and left the dirty linens on the floor. In summary: The state of the bathroom, lame housekeeping, stale bread at breakfast, and even the geraniums in our windowboxes, which were dying from lack of water, all told me that nobody in the hotel cares very much about the overall guest experience. There is an absolutely beautiful rooftop patio that the hotel barely uses, just too much effort to trudge up all those stairs, I guess. At over $250 a night, I would have liked to see some evidence of a little care.

We called the GM of the hotel and he put us in touch with Pinar (Armagrandi Spina) at the front desk. Pinar was really helpful and courteous and offered for us to stay at Amagrandi Spina instead. I do want to say that the rooms at Mangana Konak were really nice, only the location was not. Pinar sent us a taxi to bring us to her hotel at their cost. She showed us three different rooms on the 5th and 6th floor to choose from and we chose the room on the 6th floor overlooking the Blue Mosque. The elevator goes till the 5th floor and you have to walk one floor to reach the 6th. The room was large with a private balcony and floor to ceiling glass between the balcony and room allowing for a fantastic view. The room and bathroom were very clean and the air conditioning worked well. The bed was comfortable and linen was fresh. There was a little sitting area inside overlooking the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. The best part of this hotel is, firstly the location. The views, as mentioned above, are breathtaking and its only a couple of minutes walk to either of the monuments. Secondly, the staff is extremely courteous and friendly. As mentioned in a few other reviews, Pinar was a real star. She was extremely helpful and advised us correctly on every query of ours. Although a few reviews mentioned that the rooms were small we were given a really large, well appointed room with a private balcony!! Just above the room is a terrace which has truely the best views one can have from Sultanahmet. I will post a few photos in a couple of days to show what the room and the views are. Another person deserving mention was Cirken (don't know if i got the spelling right). He worked there as sort of a handy man, bringing us ice, glasses, food, sending our clothes for laundry and doing practically anything we asked for. He was really sweet and spoke basic broken English but could understand everything we asked. Breakfast was basic and disappointing. They have no menu/food, room service was limited to bringing us some breakfast in our room one day, glasses, ice buckets, a bottle of local wine, etc. Overall we were very happy we moved to this hotel. Ask for rooms on the 5th and 6th floor if you plan on going here as they have fantastic views especially our room on the 6th floor (it was the only room with a private balcony). Get your own bottle of wine, sit on the terrace during sunset and ask Cirken to bring you an ice bucket and glasses.

Staying there makes you feel like you are staying at home. Being a small hotel, it provides a very friendly environment between you, the staff, and the other guests, something one may never find at bigger hotels. I stayed there with my family for five nights. We had two double rooms with a very good rate that included airport transfer. Everything was great starting with the reservation emails that I have exchanged with the owner, who was kind enough to meet every single request that I have mentioned. The staff was very kind, friendly, and hospitable. They always meet you with a big smile. There also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a time when I was around any of the staff members and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer me something to drink (on the house). The rooms were nice and clean. The bathrooms as well. The WiFi in rooms was fast and reliable. To be honest, I was a little bit concerned when I was booking the hotel over the internet. I took a look at the pictures and the reviews and there were ones that concerned me. You always find people in reviews saying that hotels were not as good as they looked in the pictures posted on booking websites. I think with the spina it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite the other way around. For me, the hotel was much better than it looked in the pictures and than how I expected it would be. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any of the problems either that people stated in their reviews. I was also thinking when I was their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t these people request help from the staff if they had any problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whenever I requested anything from the staff, they were on it right away. Also if the request requires sometime to be fulfilled and you forget about it and get caught up in the touristy stuff, the staff never forget. One of my family members got sick and needed medicine. They got me the right medicine and gave me intake directions in less than 10 minutes, and sparred me the hassle of looking for a drug store. And I cannot begin to describe how perfect the location is. It is within a walking distance from most of the touristic attractions and also very close to the sultanahmet tram station that takes you to Taksim (city center) and other shopping places. The view from the roof terrace, where breakfast is served, is also the best view ever with ayasofya on one side, the blue mosque on the other, and asian side in the back. I also think that the hotel is great for all ages and groups. So being a group of friends, a family, or a couple, spina just works for all. If I am ever in Istanbul again I will definitely choose to stay at the spina. I am also very happy now that next time I will not have to go through the hassle of searching for the right hotel.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Base for Exploring Old Istanbul- Hotel Armagrandi Spina\u201d", "Author": "gfs53", "ReviewID": "UR22122236", "Content": "We are happy to tell anyone that our stay was thoroughly delightful, rooms and furnishings are generous and very comfortable, and the helpfulness of the staff greatly enhanced the enjoyment of our stay.

I booked Executive Suite 404 at the hotel after spending a lot of time on this site and general googling to try and find a really great suite for my wife and I to have a break from the children. I only booked three weeks ahead so many places were already full but the Spina did have a suitable room and were reasonably quick in answering my email request. On the confirmation email they only had me down for 2 nights so I called them and they (after a bit of persuasion) had the reservations manager confirm the booking was for 3 nights (even though the it was late in the evening when I called from the UK and he had left the hotel). All my other email communications were answered politely and without problems. They collected us from the hotel (even though our flight was delayed) and took us to a very clean and well sized room. The bed was enormous (we are both over 6ft but this bed was at least 6ft wide as well!). After chucking the suitcases on the bed we went straight out and found the locality still welcoming at 11pm but with no real noise audible in the room. The Arasta bazaar is 1 minute away with a large coffee house still open at that time. In a parallel street there were restaurants and bars. As others have said, there is a fantastic roof top view of the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofia. Absolutely fantastic. The sites themselves are no more than 3 minutes slow walk away. The tram stop is 5 minutes away. If you don't mind walking, the whole of Sultanahmet is literally on your doorstep but without the noise of being on the main streets. The suite 404 is one flight of steps from the rooftop restaurant but we only used it for breakfast which was certainly a big spread (2 types of cereal, breads/pastries, cold meats, cheese, jams, fruit and yoghurt, eggs both boiled and scrambled, together with fruit juice etc). Service was immediate and on each day they rearranged the tables to make sure we could be outside and yet in the shade. They always cleared the plates quickly and carried our drinks where they could. On every occasion where we had need to speak to the staff, they were polite, with excellent English, and attentive. The hotel was clean, and modern. It certainly looked like it was well cared for. The only slight quibble might be that the aircon could have been colder (it only runs when you are physically present in the room - but they had a good sized mini-bar that had space to chill water we bought locally). We would certainly stay there again. The hotel was close enough to the sights to let you go back to the hotel for a snooze between walking sessions.

While my colleague and I are friends, it was a little bit awkward. You don't necessarily want people from work seeing you in your pajamas. The front desk promised us transportation to the airport to make us for the mishap. The next morning, while I was in the midst of shampooing my hair, the water was turned off, literally. Half an hour later, there was a trickle of water that came out of the pipes but not even enough to power the shower. So I had to bend off and cup my hands to accumlate enough water to wash myself clean. Upon advising the hotel manager of this problem and asking for a discount, he indicated he was already giving us a discount by only charging us for one room and not two as was indicated in our reservation. I patiently explained that he was not giving me a discount and he only gave us one room. While he did not agree with me, after two minutes, he finally gave in and agreed to take 40 euro off the price of the room for one night. The day before we were meant to check out, we attempted to reserve the hotel car for a ride back to the airport. The hotel manager explained that he had discounted the room by 40 euro and that the ride to the aiport would not be free. I tried to explain that the 40 euro discount was for the inconvenience of not being able to shower and that we were still owed something for the mishap in the one room/two room situation.
