The location was excellent to walk around the old town of Istanbul and easy to find. On the negative side, there is no TV channels guide on English TV channels and the central heating in the room was abit too hot during my stay. But that can be overcome by turning on the fan high (was labelled as heater on the wall) which can be abit loud. My room window was facing a wall to another buidling, it provides quietness to my room but it was too close to the hotel lift on my level.

We hired a car from the airport but found there was no parking at the Hotel as it is in a pedestrianised area but the Hotel staff pointed out a secure car park nearby which was staffed on a 24 hour basis. The parking fees ranged between 15 to 20 Turkish Lira per night which was worth paying knowing the car was being looked after. The Hotel itself is in the historical quarter of the City and most tourist attractions are literally a few minutes walk away along with access to the tramway system. The staff were extremley friendly and helpful and the managers Mehmet and Gonulyavuiz could not do enough to help. The rooms are clean , fairly modern and ideal for our purpose as we were out most of the day and only needed them literally to sleep and shower in. If you like to stop in and watch English TV forget it as there are no English spoken channels available. The breakfast in a morning was fine , cereals etc and the evening meals were really good value for money. We did the rounds of the local restaurants and most were dearer , some double the price. If you like lager the local brew is Effes which is 5 Lira a pint at the Asur , most other bars charge 8 and even 10 lira a pint so it is good value. On leaving the Hotel we were unfortunate enough to miss our flights and had to return for the night. Not a problem for the manager who greeted us with a big smile and managed to find us a room with only a 10 minute wait whilst one was cleaned. We will be attending the 2011 Istanbul Grand Prix and will certainly book rooms at this Hotel as we could not fault the value for money , the staff and the location.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxenhope", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel !!\u201d", "Author": "OxenhopeTyke", "ReviewID": "UR65785648", "Content": "The Asur Hotel was perfectly placed in Istanbul for all the amenities.
