The location was great for me if just a bit far from Rome's central area. But being off the beaten path was a plus as the neighborhood is very safe and residential. In fact, there is a police station around the corner and the American Embassy is across the street. (Rooms facing the street are a bit noisier due to the metal pylons that go up and down with a bang for each vehicle that enters.) I wasn't bothered, however, since the sound spelled safety to me. There are also lots of good, inexpensive restaurants within a few blocks walk. I especially liked San Marco--not gourmet, but predictable, and always open. On the negative side, although the room was spacious (we received an upgrade), the furniture was a bit worn. Again, not a problem as we all have nicks and scratches as we get older. The one thing that was annoying was the unevenness of the housekeeping--half glasses of water left after cleaning, a dirty wash cloth left in the tub--no replacement of soap. In fact, there never was enough soap. Sometimes there was a nightly turndown--other times not. Also, the breakfast was very disappointing. By the third day I longed for something good and hot and different. The rolls were stale five days out of seven, the eggs and bacon uneatable, and the assortment of sweets never changing. On the plus side the breakfast room was pretty with an outside garden that will soon be in blossom with roses and the staff was courteous. I would give the hotel three and one half \"circles\" if allowed mainly for the location.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel with gracious staff\u201d", "Author": "Margaret F", "ReviewID": "UR126341441", "Content": "Lovely stay here, a terrific location.

It's not very close to the Vatican City -- you'll want to take a taxi there from the hotel. Or even better, ride the hop-on-hop-off open bus (cost 13-euros roundtrip without getting off the bus) which is only 5-blocks away from the Rose Garden (across the street from the Eden Hotel) and takes you to see all these sites and many more! The Rose Garden is perfect and enough of the beaten path to be away from the crowds, traffic, noise and hustle and bustle of the city. Small lobby/lounge/bar area but more relaxing that the fancier hotels. My room was lovely with high ceilings and was toward the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard and the outdoor part of the II Roseta restaurant.

Breakfast was very pleasant with an option to sit outside, the staff happy to get anything that wasn't on show at the buffet. We asked at reception for places they recomended for dinner, always happy to help when asked. Infact we asked reception a lot of questions about various places and always with great English they helped us. We found the Hotel location fantastic, we got a taxi to the Vatican museum and another day to The Colosseum, not that either couldn't be walked and indeed we walked back from both. It was only 7 euro to either and it suited us with the heat and early pre-booked tours to get taxi's. About a 30 min easy walk to either of these with much to take in on the way. The Spanish steps are literally just down the road, about 5-6min walk with many lovely restaurants and cafes(Caffe Leonardo), another 5 minuites on again to the Trevi Fountain. We found so much in fact all of what we had time to see within walking distance. The Hotel has a small whirlpool pool in the basement, so nice to get in and unwind after a long hot day sightseeing, really sweet for couples (not a family pool), i could see many dangers for kids in it, ledges etc. It is set out like a Roman Bath with a big ledge half way down all round the pool, the whirlpool jets are quite strong for kids i would think. Great to sit in and chat and chill out though, we loved it and never saw anyone else in it, like having our own private pool!

WiFi - Free and laptop pulled it up anywhere in the room. Picked up electrical adapter free from desk for 3 prong plug. Bed turned down in evening - A nice touch we didnt ask for but was not real comfortable NOT knowing they would be by. Use the safe at all times as always when on trips as we had clothing out, not expecting anyone to come in but our valuables were locked up.

Second, I had to keep the price at around $300, a number which doesn't always get you a clean, quiet hotel with a requisite amount of A/C. I dove into TripAdvisor and the Rose Garden was very well reviewed. I can now add to those reviews. The hotel is super-clean and the rooms are big by Rome standards. The people at the front desk are helpful, polite and even borderline cheerful (one night, one of the receptionists was playing some skilled piano by the bar). The neighborhood is both close to the action, and yet it's on a quiet street -- as it's tucked two blocks off the bustling Via Veneto (where lots of the priciest hotels are). There's a nice restaurant with lots of windows so that one can enjoy the tranquil garden just outside, and there are also 4-5 tables out in the garden. Had all breakfasts there and they were a solid version of the standard hotel buffet. Attentive service at breakfast. Staff all very bilingual. There's a small but clean and well-lit gym and a small indoor pool that's probably ideal for kids maybe under 10. Would definitely stay here again. There are hotels with more age and grace and charm, such as the converted convent, the Donna Camille Seville hotel (where I spent my second week just to mix things -- and neighborhoods -- up).

I booked the hotel based on its location and recent reviews on Tripadvisor. The front desk, on arrival, was initially helpful. We arrived at 11am so understandably the room wasn't ready. The receptionist was pleasant, but failed to inform us of anything the hotel had to offer. Nothing about where meals are served, the pool, nothing. Before going up to our room we had a coke each in the bar. The bar is actually a room leading onto the restaurant, at this time staffed by an officious member of staff who featured throughout our stay. We were served our drinks and a bill for approx. \u00a312! Ridiculous. Our bags were taken up and we got into our room early, which was good. The room itself overlooked the street on the first floor. It was small, but ok for a city centre hotel. The bed was formed by two, very hard single beds pushed together, both wrapped in single bedding. Great. The bathroom was small but did have a decent sized bath and a powerful shower over the bath. The toilet flush was so annoying. You had to press it about 20 times to build up enough momentum for it to actually flush. Sounds trivial, but after 5 days it gets a bit wearing. The next morning we came down for breakfast to be greeted with total indifference. This is the general impression given by staff most of the time. No, it wasn't after breakfast had finished, in case you're wondering. We worked out it was serve yourself. No mention was made of where you could get toast. We gradually realised you had to order toast, much to the frustration of the breakfast staff. Other than breakfast, we had one evening meal in the hotel. It was very good quality, served by a friendly and efficient waiter. Like everything in this hotel though, it was too expensive. The final bill (one bottle of wine and only one dessert) was \u00a3135. Overpriced, especially as we had superior meals, in other restaurants locally, for half the price. We had cocktails after dinner in the bar (\u00a314 each), where we were made to feel very much like an inconvenience. The staff were more concerned with noisily setting up tables to place the breakfast buffet upon and clattering the containers for cereal, as well as talking loudly to each other about their day. We just thought it was pretty rude really. The hotel is set in a nice area, with a 20 min walk to the Metro or the Spanish Steps. We really hoped for better and must have been unlucky based on previous feedback. It was as if the staff had all been given bad news and were going through the motions prior to the hotel being demolished! Our accommodation was \u00a31500 in total (B&B) not including evening meal or cocktails. I didn't even get a thank you when I paid or 'have a safe trip', nothing whatsoever. We will not be returning, neither would we recommend this hotel if you want any decent level of service. One other thing to consider, the hotel advertises free Wi-Fi. This is patchy at best, I couldn't log onto it throughout (iphone) but my fiancee did manage to get very intermittent coverage for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time.

While we were interested in seeing Rome on this trip, our main reason for traveling was for relaxation, so we knew we might be spending a decent amount of time lazing around our room. We chose the hotel because we heard they had \"true\" king beds, we could have a boutique hotel experience, and we could even use our AAA membership discount. Upon arriving, we were psyched to see that we had a large top-floor room and a bottle of champagne cooling in a bucket of ice. There was a walk-in closet, a good-sized bathroom, and a couch/sitting area. My partner was even more excited about the fact that we had blackout curtains so that he could sleep in late. I was happy for the robes and slippers (I ended up spending a lot more time in these and in the room than planned, since I got a bad cold on the trip). There was also a flatscreen TV with Sky cable available, but I can't really comment on this since we didn't use it. Throughout our stay, we had zero issues with noise. We're not sure if this was due to good soundproofing, or just that the people in the rooms around us were quiet. The staff was helpful before and during the stay. Before we arrived, I had been in touch with them via email to ask questions and set up reservations for restaurants and the Borghese Gallery. All of these emails they responded to within a day or two. They were also quite helpful during the stay and friendly, especially if I tried first to chat with them in Italian. Housekeeping was fast and kept everything clean and well-stocked. We both enjoyed breakfast, which was included with the room. I'll admit that I'm not a big breakfast person, but they had cereal and milk and coffee, and that's enough to make me happy. They also had a selection of fruits, meats, cheeses, eggs (albeit these looked a little orange) and bread. We also made use of the pool and the fitness center. The pool is nice, but be warned that it's more like a jacuzzi in terms of temperature. The fitness room is decent, one of each kind of equipment piece. Everything seemed to be in working order. Wifi, although free, was a little difficult to use. It took us a few tries to realize that the password you are given can only be used on one device at a time, so you need to request multiple passwords if you have multiple devices. The wifi itself was very weak. Wasn't a huge issue for us, but could pose an issue for business travelers. There's a small but handy grocery store right on the side street next to the hotel called \"Despar.\" An affordable option for drinks or snacks. Bring as close to exact change as possible! They often can't change 20 or 50 EUR bills. And finally, location. Other reviewers have mentioned that it's a bit separated from the main sites of the city, and this is true. Just be forewarned about that before selecting a hotel in this area. We're really fit and love walking, so we ended up trekking to most of the sites, but it was a good 30-40 minutes to the Colosseum/Forum and about 20-30 to the Pantheon (in 90 degree heat ;)). On the upside, the Borghese park is right down the street and a safe place to take a stroll at all hours, and the Spanish Steps are also nearby. We can't comment on how accessible public transit is to the hotel's location, but cabs were easy to get. Restaurant-wise, there are only a few good places in the immediate area (Gina's near the Spanish Steps and San Marcos); for some of the better food, I recommend you head down to the main areas or Travestere. \\ In summary... Pros: Good breakfast, spacious rooms (for the price), comfortable beds, friendly and efficient staff/housekeeping, gym and pool, safe, and blackout curtains!

We went for breakfast the next morning, it appeared that you had to find your own table in the Restaurant area as none of the Staff showed any willingness to welcome and assist, eventually a member of Staff ventured over and asked if we wanted coffee, that was it, communications over. The breakfast fare on offer was simply atrocious, if you wished something hot, then the choice was congealed \"scrambled\" egg, thin grease laden bacon and small sausages that stank when you bit into them, also there was no toaster. The fruit selection looked to be the same bowl each morning, with the none too plentiful bread, cheese and meat totally uninspiring and you end up wondering why you bothered to make the effort and not gone somewhere else, I guess you think it can't be like this everyday and must improve tomorrow. As you leave the Hotel front door turn left then first left again and you will find a SPAR Minimarket about 100 yds up that street, ideal for bringing back refreshments to your Room and make use of the near empty mini-bar. One incident I will leave you with is this: We took a taxi back from the Vatican, on arrival at the Hotel I asked the Driver what the fare was, he said 14 euros, I gave him a 20 euro note, he deftly switched this for a 5 euro note claiming this was all I had given him, knowing that I never had any 5 euro notes, I challenged him to drive to the nearest Police station to check if my fingerprints were on the note, needless to say he did not accept my challenge and I left the taxi to a torrent of verbal abuse, I would say either pay them with coinage or with the brown coloured 10 euro note, and make sure your travelling companion witnesses the payment.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston SC", "Title": "\u201cAwsome time at the Rose Garden\u201d", "Author": "Cabinownerwanabe", "ReviewID": "UR64164157", "Content": "May 4th throught the 10th Our first time to Italy the staff at the Rose Garden could not have been nicer or more helpful.

The location of the hotel is great. It is two short blocks from Via Veneto and within walking distance of just about every site within Rome, other than the Vatican. It is also right across the street from the American Embassy, so security is very tight. There is a local grocery store just outside of the hotel which is extremely inexpensive. Large bottles of water were just 0.60 cents. To reach the store, just make a left out of the front door of the hotel and make a left at the corner. It is about 20 feet up on the right side of the block. Also, another block up, on the left side, is a nice, inexpensive cafe which sells good sandwiches and hot food for lunch.

Maybe we got our hopes up too much, maybe the poor euro/pound exchange rate tainted our stay, or maybe we are just a little unfamiliar with high Rome prices - either way we didn't feel this hotel was as reasonable as others had made out. We shopped around before booking and found a rate of about \u20ac175 per room per night (about \u00a3175 per night due to the current exchange rate). It pays to shop around as some sites were charging double this. However, this did not include breakfast which, had we wanted, would have been an additional \u20ac15 per person per night. Many of the hotels and cafes within walking distance offered breakfast for a similar rate; a 15 minute walk towards the city centre took us to a variety of cafes serving cappuccinos and croissants for a fraction of the price. We found the reception staff friendly enough, although the hotel seemed deserted! Maybe it was the time of year - the weekend before Christmas - but throughout our four night stay we only saw two other guests! The pool area was lovely, though very small and intimate if you happen to turn up the same time as anyone else, as there are only two loungers. But just to have an indoor pool & sauna in the centre of Rome was a luxury in itself. The rooms were fairly spacious and very clean, though some items of furniture were looking rather tired. And the bathroom was lovely despite the heavily chipped marble around the tub. Being six months pregnant and a true tea-drinking Brit I was a bit disappointed that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room - returning to our room for a hot drink, feet up, at the end of a tiring day would have been nice. I know we could have asked room service, but at \u20ac12/\u00a312 for two hot drinks it was one expense too many! Oh yes - and the 'free' mini bar. Not so free, actually. Ours wasn't even switched on, so all the drinks were warm and they weren't free at all! From what I recall I think a small 500ml bottle of water was \u20ac5, and a Coke was \u20ac6! There was a Spar right around the corner selling chilled 1.5l water for 0.20\u20ac - much better! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cheapskate. Over the years we have stayed in various places - from 2 star budget Travelodges to 5 star hotels and we like to treat ourselves when we go on holiday.

I was delighted to find a great mix of travelers at the hotel and a very international atmosphere. I am no stranger to Rome, and having stayed at a variety of hotels over the years I would say that the combination of price, style, location, and professionalism here was special. The hotel is in a renovated palazzo just off the Via Veneto, within a short walk to the Spanish Steps. Being in Rome on business, it was easy for me to get to any point in the city for my appointments and for sightseeing. The staff at the reception desk was invaluable at helping with directions, train and bus routes, and restaurant recommendations. I love the decor of the hotel. The rooms are spacious, decorated in a soft contemporary style, elegant in an unobtrusive way, and everything works! The minibar has water and soft drinks only, but they are complimentary. I thought this was a great idea considering how much some hotels charge for minibar items. If I wanted a cocktail I went down to the wonderful lounge and sipped my drink either with other guests or outside in the rose garden. Yes, there really is a rose garden. The food at the hotel requires special mention. I have eaten many a buffet breakfast in hotels throughout Italy. Many of them rather ho-hum. On the contrary, here you will find an impressive spread including fresh breads, freshly cut-up fruit salad, huge wedges of cheeses, and, best of all, homemade tarts and pastries. I also recommend having lunch or dinner in their in-house restaurant. I invited friends to dinner there and we all enjoyed it tremendously. The service was attentive and professional. The food was great. There is a fitness room and lovely zen-like pool in the lower level of the hotel, which is also complimentary to guests. After a day walking your feet off in Rome, a dip in that pool was divine. I recommend the Rose Garden Palace to all types of travelers, business, leisure, even families.

I particularly loved the bath -- luxury fixtures like the rain showerhead and separate hand-held shower are head and shoulders above what you usually find at a European hotel at this price point. Nice thick towels and bathrobes too! Breakfast at the restaurant was great. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, and the buffet spread included an array of food that's not usually found at Italian breakfast buffets -- eggs, bacon, etc. There was nice selection of fruits and breads, as well as cold cuts and cheese. When I was there, the breakfast room was full of travelers from all around the world, and it was pretty clear that there was something for everyone at the buffet table. It's also worth noting that everything in each room's minibar is free for guests, which is a happy surprise given that many Italian hotels charge crazy prices for drinks you take from the minibar. The Rose Garden Palace's location just off Via Veneto is perfect for exploring the city, with the Spanish Steps and many other sights within easy walking distance. The staff was great about helping with directions, maps and public transportation schedules. From them, I learned about the little electric bus (116) that leaves from around the corner of the hotel and stops at great locations all around Rome.

Here's my take on the Rose Garden Palace: it's the perfect place to stay if you're an independent traveler and don't expect to be \"pampered\" with services like you'd get at most \"4 star\" hotels in the states. I\u2019ve given the Rose Garden 5 stars because for me, it was a perfect stay for what I wanted: an awesome room, great location, safe place (for a woman traveling alone), and good food. That\u2019s Rose Garden in a nutshell. The room was tremendous. The photos that I\u2019ve posted really don\u2019t do the room justice. The room I had was massive in terms of European standards, and even large for US standards. HUGE walk in closet and dressing area. The bathroom was beautiful and spotlessly clean with robe and slippers provided. The shower was large and spacious with a deep tub and strong water pressure. The housekeeping staff seemed to have monitored my room every time I left. I ALWAYS had new soaps, shampoos and bubble bath every time I returned to the room. The breakfast was TERRIFIC with a large and varied choice of things to eat (buffet style) such as eggs and bacon, cereals, breads, muffins, croissants, juice, yogurt, fruit, juices, etc., etc. It's not \"made to order\", so for any \"foodies\" out there, you might find it disappointing. But it's enough food that you could skip lunch and keep you until dinner. The location was perfect\u2026 close to Termini station and right across from the US Embassy. You couldn\u2019t get much safer, and although I had a room on \u201cstreetside\u201d I didn\u2019t hear a sound. Perfectly quiet. So, if you want a good night\u2019s sleep, you\u2019ll sleep like a baby here. They have a nice gym and pool. Granted, it\u2019s on the smallish side, but nonetheless, after a day in the sun, it sure is nice to return to the hotel and take a dip in the pool. My suggestion if you stay here is to not expect much from the staff. It\u2019s simply not too service oriented. It\u2019s not that there wasn\u2019t service, it\u2019s just not found throughout the staff.

As well, we aranged for car service at the Rome airport for 65 euros through the hotel. After some 20 hours of travel, we were pleasd to have had the private car service direct to the hotel and thought the cost reasonable - we recommend this. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by freindly and professional desk staff . We were given room 209 which is, I believe, a \"deluxe\" room. It was very clean, pleasant and of reasonable size. The safe and satelite TV were welcome amenities. The bathroom was very clean and serviceable (e.g., lots of water pressure and hot water) although quite small, given that it included a bidet. The hotel is located in a quiet part of the city and the room overlooked their inner courtyard, so it was very quiet. Bed was reasonably comfortable.

The room itself is very pleasant and is also used for a lounge and dinner - a nice quiet place to have a drink after a day of sight-seeing or business. On our last night we had dinner at the hotel.

While the room was not huge, it had a great walk in closet and comfortable bedding. I loved the remote control curtains with controls located next to each side of the bed. Another nice touch was the complimentary minibar in the room with waters and juices restocked daily. The workout room was small but sufficient with 1 treadmill, 1 bike, 1 rowing machine, 1 elliptical machine and some free weights and a few different weight machines. There was a dry sauna as well as a plunge pool. The daily breakfast, included in the price of the room, was fantastic. It was served daily from 7-11 so it fit in to about any plans we had made. The breakfast selection included eggs, meats, great cheeses, dry cereals, juices, breads, fruits and tea and coffee. Whenever we arrived down for breakfast, we were always immediately attended to and offered coffee. They gladly made delicious cappuccinos too. Just down the block from the hotel is a taxi stand so we could always easily catch a taxi anywhere we needed to go. The fare was no more than 9-10 Euros anywhere within the city. There are many restaurants in quick walking distance from the hotel and we always felt safe walking around. While this hotel is not right in the center of all of the sights, it was a lovely refuge at the end of our busy days. I would definitely go back to the Rose Garden Palace Hotel.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cNice but expensive\u201d", "Author": "KingTito", "ReviewID": "UR7432939", "Content": "Very clean, very nice hotel.

There were good features such as air conditioning and an excellent walk-in closet (with safe) - and touches such as black-out blinds and TV speakers in the bathroom. There were also several english tv channels including BBC World News, CNN, Fox and National Geographic. There was room service available (although each time we tried, little mistakes were made - like forgetting the tea bags for the tea). The breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of cooked or continental choices and was available until 11am. The hotel is well situated - especially if you like to just walk out your room and go for an evening meal (there are lots of good places along the via veneto).

It takes about 10mins to walk to the Spanish steps but the side streets were interesting and we passed both the Hotel Eden and the Intercontinental on the way - just confirmed how happy were were to be in the Rose Garden Palace. Secondly the ambience was cool! The 'new' interior is creams and cool beige, comfortable and relaxing. They have managed to keep the old character of the original building but give it a modern twist. The reception/bar area was great for a late night drink and a haven after a busy day sightseeing. Breakfast was ok, cold buffet with limited hot choice but was served until 11am.
