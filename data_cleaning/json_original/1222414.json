It's literally few steps from Puerta del Sol, that means the heart of the city. We did have the chance to stay in the superior apartment with the terraces on the rooftop, with a superb view on the city skyline. The apartment was made by two big main rooms, a kitchen, a big living room and two bathrooms, all furnished with style and simple elegance. The prices are quite low considering what they offer.
