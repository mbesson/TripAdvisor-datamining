Beds are always super comfy and super luxurious.....We have a VERY nice bed at home with the best sheets, memory foam, etc and I LOVE the beds at Verasa. Love the suites with the kitchenette (which is very chic-looking).....they are done very well and give a semblance of home away from home. I bring a few treats to put in the over-sized fridge (a PLUS...with no stupid mini bar that charges you when you take something out!). I also travel with my husband and our two Terriers....The dogs LOVE the Heavenly dog beds....they curl up and feel right at home...which is rare because Terriers are usually all over the place and freak out in hotel rooms trying to figure everything out. The beds are placed in the room before if you let them know that dogs are coming and they went right for them. Very nice =) Hot tub is great, the greenbelt out in back is a perfect place to walk the dogs so they can do their business and sniff around. The quality of the food is top notch...they have super antioxidant breakfasts (!!!!) that tastes GREAT....And if you want more variety, Oxbow Public Martket is about 2 blocks away... Everyone that works there is accommodating...When I/we check in the bell hop waits for you, brings you up to your room, makes sure you like the room and runs and gets whatever you need right away with a smile.

Otherwise wifi is only available in hotspots but if you say fine I don't want it in my room they tell you everyone has to pay the fee anyway. It also allows you to use the gym and other facilities that one would assume would be free with the room. Traveling with gold level friends they had no such fee but we were not permitted to put our shared rental car on their account and were told we had to pay the extra 20 a day regardless. Adding insult to injury there is no platinum or gold member lounge so the carafes of nice hot morning coffee in the lobby area are provided for them as they wait to connect with fellow travelers in the lobby. It is not meant for us though. 'Us' being those working their way to gold or platinum by paying $300 plus plus for our rooms. In fact even our gold member friend was accosted for getting a cup one morning and asked if she was qualified. For goodness sake treat your special members but do it apart from public areas that make the rest of us feel like second class guests. We asked to change our room to an adjoining one with our friends or perhaps if there was a two bedroom suite rather than suites on two floors as we had been assigned. We were told neither was available yet we saw or heard no one from the adjoining room the whole time we were there including staff. Overall There seemed to be an unwillingness to accommodate any changes or requests that might end up making our stay more convenient or reduce our cost. On plus side hotel service staff, waiters, valets and concierge were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I am sure there are many many $300/room guests and lots who book more expensive rooms but really I can get free coffee at every Marriot brand hotel even at Motel6 shouldn't it be OK for me to have one in the lobby at a fine hotel like this? The suite we had was lovely and well equipped in everyday even quality coffee for in room making, nice balcony bedding, towels, soaps etc. all worth the $300 but the extra compulsory $20 really bugged me along with being made to feel less than. It was also pretty funny watching the fit, 200lb, 6'4 guy coming back from the pool in the 'one size fits all' size 10 robe. Come on really?

The positives are the modern design, great beds, generously-sized rooms, excellent dual-head shower, and very pleasant service. And, while this place is not cheap, the rates were reasonable for this caliber of hotel, especially for the Napa area which can be outrageously expensive. A few things that could be improved. The room we had overlooked the pool and the folks enjoying the pool were having maybe a little bit too much wine :) and became quite loud as the evening went on. The management said they had strict rules for closing the pool at 11 and they did make efforts to get these folks to leave. But, it took several calls to the front desk to get this to happen and it was getting somewhat late by then. A little more attention to keeping the public areas quiet and pleasant for all -- without guests having to complain -- would be helpful.

Over the past year, we have been fortunate enough to stay at over 25 different Starwood properties. The Westin Verasa Napa is the best Westin Brand Hotel we have experienced and an excellent choice when visiting Napa and Sonoma. Here's why: Location - Last year we opted to stay in San Francisco (St. Regis), drive into Napa/Sonoma for the day, and return to the city for dinner. This was not the best plan as the drive back and forth was very long. The Westin Verasa is perfectly located within walking distance of downtown Napa and some of the best restaurants in northern California. We loved walking to dinner after a long day of driving and wine tasting. The hotel backs up to a peaceful river walk area to unwind at the end of the day. We enjoyed dining at Angele and Cole's Chop House and highly recommend them (both walkable from the hotel). We also recommend dining at The Farm and Boone Fly Cafe, which is a short drive away. If you're in Rutherford, have lunch at Auberge du Soleil for a picture perfect view. Staff - The team of employees complemented each other very well. From the valet to the front desk and restaurant servers, we were always greeted with a happy face and willingness to make our visit the best. Great Property- The hotel is smartly designed. When you arrive you are greeted by the valet which appears to be your only option for parking (the cost is included in your amenity fees). The property configuration can best be described as two connected horse shoes. One side is home to the pool/jacuzzi and the other side is quiet grassy area used for Bocce Ball. The building is three stories and newer construction. Our room included a large balcony, full kitchen, two full bathrooms, tall ceilings, and great living room area. It was lovely, perfect for entertaining, and hosting dinner. We loved our room. Platinum Recognition - As Platinum SPG Members, we have grown accustom to the best that Starwood has to offer. The loyaly program is the best in the business, The Westin Verasa did not disappoint. We were upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom premium suite, provided with a list of discounts/benefits at select restaurants and wineries, given a complimentary half bottle of wine along with a small box of chocolate. We opted for a complimentary continental breakfast (which was served at \"The Bank \",their lobby restaurant) as our platinum amenity. A nice touch included personal hand-written and signed cards from the hotel staff acknowledging our stay. Constructive Feedback: -Gym: Although the gym was clean with newer equipment, it's too small. We found ourselves waiting in line to use the equipment around 8am each morning. It's time to make the space bigger and get more equipment. It's clear your hotel demographic like to exercise. Wineries - While touring Napa we highly recommend stopping at Schramsberg, Chateau Montelena, & Beringer . While touring Sonoma visit Coppola, Lankmark , and Arrowood. Overall, this property was a wonderful choice for our trip to Napa and Sonoma. It is an excellent value and we will definitely return again and again.

The architecture is pleasing to the eye and makes it look modern with a feeling of outdoors. There is a heated salt water pool and jacuzzi that is open year round. In the lounge is a daily demonstration of local vinters displaying their latest vintages. The staff is nice to a fault and were quite cordial. However, i found the service to be very slow. When i requested a rollerbed it took almost 30 minutes for it to arrive. I called from their business center for help with the fax... and after 25 minutes of waiting i left and asked the front desk to fax the document for me. The room itself was very nice and well appointed. The hotel itself is massive and must have had at least 200 rooms. If i stop here i'd give this place 4 stars. They lose a star for slow service. For starwood members: If you are a Platinum Starwood client as I am, you have likely become spoiled with upgrades and other special amenities. However, starwood does teach us to be that way as they continuously flaunt the benefits of being a Platinum member. For those who don't know obtaining platinum requires 25 stays or 50 nights at a starwood property. My big issue here was that this hotel was fairly empty based on comments made from the parking staff and i was not given a \"real\" upgrade even after i asked. I even double checked online to see if better rooms were available, which they all were. Normally, i travel for business and it is not a big deal, but on this occasion it would made a big difference to get a 2 bedroom suite. A \"real\" upgrade is when you get a truly superior room.... Either larger than normal or that features additional amenities. A better view (unless the view is spectacular), or a small balcony does not really qualify in my books. But what really infuriated me was that they attempted to charge me for the upgrade. So they said they could not offer me the upgrade due to availability, but they could upgrade me at the cost of $70... Wow. Starwood hotels in the U.S. and Europe have really been devaluing the benefits of being a starwood platinum member. In Asia you can be sure that you will receive the best room available. In the U.S. you need to twist their arm to get it... It should not be that way.

The Westin Verasa provided the romantic breakaway that we needed and perfect base. It was unfortunate that our weekends schedule was so busy that we never had a chance to enjoy the hotel and what the Westin had to offer. The Westin Verasa is by far one of the best Westin suites in the United States that I have stayed in. I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite \"1092\" which faced the river. The suite was very modern with two bathrooms, full kitchen, separate bedroom with a king bed and large living room. I could have stayed at the Westin Verasa for an additional week. The kitchen was fantastic and has all the amenities you would need for your vacation. We were able to prepare a full English breakfast in the morning before heading out wine tasting. I also declined housekeeping to gather another 1000 SPG points. I called the front desk for additional coffee, towels and shower gel which were delivered to the room. The Westin Verasa has an awesome hot tub which is located outside next to the pool. Pool is also heated. Next to the pool area is a fire pit which seemed to be popular in the evening. The Westin Verasa has no Club lounge however both restaurants at the Westin were fantastic. We ate at La Toque on the first night and Bank Caf\u00e9 and bar the second night. The dinner at La Toque was brilliant. Wow what an experience. We ordered a few appetizers from Bank Caf\u00e9 and bar on the Saturday night before walking to Oxbow Public Market from dinner. Hill winery was also providing free tastings in the lobby of the hotel on Saturday night. I think every night a winery from the surrounding area provides wine tasting. The location of the Westin Verasa in Napa was perfect. Easy walk to good restaurants and the Oxbow Public Market. The Westin is also directly opposite the Napa Wine Train. Don't rely on the Westin for any recommendation to restaurants or wineries. The concierge desk wasn't staffed during our stay. Drive to the Napa Valley Welcome Center. The gentleman at the Napa Valley Welcome Center provided great advice, recommendations, maps and wine tasting 2 for 1 coupons -- all free! The check-in desk on the Friday evening was a circus/disaster. There were only two junior inexperienced Westin staff members with dozens of guests trying to check-in. From my experience the guys at the desk on Friday night were unable to provide the level of service at check-in that I expect as a SPG platinum guest. I was very frustrated!! Also tweeted my experience to @SPGinder. There was no introduction to the hotel, explanation of the resort fees. I was handed a key card and had to fend for myself. I was unable to find anybody who could provide directions on how I get to my room. I also could not find La Toque restaurant. Luckily the staff at La Toque took care of us!! They noted that they are not affiliated with the hotel staff. Crazy because after Friday evening the staff at the front desk where awesome. I would totally stay here again. I still don't understand why SPG platinum members have to pay the resort fee. Then again looks like Westin Verasa changed the name of the resort fee to amenity fee.

I almost didn't answer the phone, since I wasn't interested in a rote welcome call. No, that wasn't why they were calling. Apparently the valet crunched the side mirror of the car. Props for being forthright and calling the rental car company to take care it. Hopefully, there won't be an issue when I turn it in. Having missed the free tasting, I grabbed a glass at the bar. Very nice wine. I'll have a review on snootful(dot)blogspot(dot)com soon. The bar has reasonably good service, but they were backing up the wait staff in the adjacent restaurant, and were occasionally absent. The tuna lollipops were very good, as was the pork belly. The resort fee is lame. I appreciate that it covers things like Internet, which Westins usually charge for, but saying it covers the pool? Lame. And if you're charging $20, then the WiFi signal in the rooms should be better. Rooms had typical Westin style, mine had a kitchenette, which could be handy for longer stays or families.

So, make sure to ask for a room far away from the construction, which I did and I barely heard anything.

This happens sometimes so we were OK with this. Soon after we were in our room, we heard what sounded like a big party or reception in the room next to us at 5pm. I went to the front desk to inquire about a move and the agent informed me there was a group next door but that they were sold out. About 30 minutes later it got even louder, and we were concerned that when they returned from dinner it would get even louder. I spoke to a Manager on Duty, Laura, who was very helpful and moved us to another Traditional Room on another floor. We worked out in the fitness center, took a swim in the very nice pool (salt water) and hot tub (which is NOT noisy as was said by a previous reviewer). When we came back from dinner, we sat outside in the lovely courtyard with a glass of wine and enjoyed the fire pit. Around 12:45am, the suite across the hall from us had a party with yelling in the hallway. I called the MOD and she apologized and would send security up. It seems to us that this hotel caters to large groups - primarily during the week. We were surprised to hear, upon moving rooms that the hotel was Sold Out except for the 2 bedroom suites......which they could have moved us to when we had the noise complaints (and due to our Platinum level) but they did not. A nice touch is that every evening there is a Wine tasting in the lobby - on Thursday's there are also chair massages! Overall, a nice resort-style hotel, situated on the banks of the Napa River, which caters primarily to large groups. The staff is very friendly...but take note - the hotel is managed by a 3rd party as a Westin frnachise - so some of the Westin Quality Standards may not be met. Lastly - the Bocce Ball court was a fun extra - but no signage or information about how to play or where to get the supplies to play :(", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Humres32", "Title": "\u201cNice Place; Requires a Short Walk into Town\u201d", "Author": "Humres32", "ReviewID": "UR120763836", "Content": "When going to Napa, I felt the need to actually stay in Napa. I'm glad that we stayed there, but next time I intend to stay in St. Helena as it has a fantastic downtown area with lots of shops. For those of you intending to stay in Napa, here's my review (and I would stay in Napa again after I try some other areas). The Westin is a fairly new hotel and it's very nice. Our room had a small kitchenette and living room with the bedroom being separate. This was nice. I thought my husband could watch tv and I could sleep. The only issue....our satellite tv in the room didn't work during our stay. I'm sure this is not typcial, but it was disappointing. Otherwise, the facility was very nice (and clean). We did eat breakfast in the restaurant at the Westin. Not very crowded. Staff took our order but was not overly attentive. Guess that's what happens when a 15% gratuity is automatically added to your bill:) Food was good; service was ok. The Westin is a 10 min walk into a small downtown area. My husband and I walked to the Bounty Hunter for lunch and some wine. I'd highly recommend going here. We also went to Angele. This was disappointing and I'd find somewhere else to go. We tried to breakfast at Sweetie Pies, but found glass in my yogurt parfait (as I was eating it) so that killed my appetite. By the way...they were not real apologitic. The highlight of our meals was at a former bank, which is not an Italian restaurant named Allegria. It was great and it's within a 10-15 min walk from the Westin. Overall the Westin is very nice. You'll have a little walk to get to the restaurants/shops (or you could drive). It's a nice home base if you intend to do some wine tasting. We started our wine tasting day by driving up to Mt. Helena and working our way back down to the hotel. The plan worked well for us. The earlier you get to the tasting rooms, the better.

My husband and I and our niece wanted a nice, relaxing room to enjoy after a long hard day of cleaning out our deceased family-member's home. We were tired, and possibly not dressed-up by any means, but we should not have been treated badly by the fellas at valet parking. The valet made a disparaging comment to our niece, to the effect, \"are you staying here?\" She told him that she was, and he laughed at her. Please! Could this get any worse? Yes. I went to check in and, of course, we were told that there was some kind of \"mess up\" with our room. The check-in clerk walked back and forth to the back room for a good 20 minutes trying to .... who knows. Meanwhile, there were at least 4 other guests being checked in, with no problems by another clerk. One of the groups checked into a two bedroom suite...just like the one we had booked. After another trip by our clerk to the back room to talk to a manager, he said that he had our room. Well, not exactly. He found two rooms that were adjoining. I asked him twice .. were we going to get these two rooms for the same price as the two bedroom suite. We were assured that we would. We were disappointed but too tired to put up a fuss. Our room was very nice; big and very nicely decorated (even tho our bathroom door would not close). Our niece was next door and a janitor had to come and unlock the doors so we could have adjoining rooms. Our niece's room had a broken light fixture and, after we had gone to bed, she found out that the television did not work in her bedroom. We received our bill under our door the next morning and we checked-out early to return to get back to our tedious work. A couple of days later, I checked my credit card bill....and guess what? We had been double charged by the hotel. What a surprise. I called the finance department and I spoke with a very apologetic woman who assured me that the charge would be reversed and was surprised that this had happened.

Wow, what a great place to stay and call home base while touring the Napa area. I would easily recommend this property to friends and family. Check-in / front desk - what a wonderful staff. Every day, regardless of time the front desk was there to help. Check-in was easy, rooms ready upon arrival, and friendly, smiling faces! Room - we stayed in a one bedroom suite. I highly recommend paying the extra and get the extra space in your room. Full kitchen, dining table that seats 6-8, and sofa area that seats 5-6. Bed met the Westin standards and bathroom / shower was awesome. We requested a room off of the pool area and had no issue with excess noise during the day or night. Lobby / lobby bar - great lobby bar that in the evening opens up to the patio and pool area. Ample seating and a very friendly and knowledgeable bar staff to help you pick a great drink after a long day touring local wineries and vineyards. They have a small happy hour for those who are Starwood guests; I enjoyed the hours o'douvres although I noticed after 2-3 days that they didn't have a lot of variety day to day. The hotel also bring in some smaller wineries to showcase their wines with free samples. Lobby bar stays open until 11-12 PM. Restaurant - we only ate at the hotel restaurant twice, but the food was good. I was slightly disappointed in the Sunday brunch. It was not that the food was bad, and in all actuality it was great, but the hotel posts the brunch menu and I for some reason had expectations that there would be a small buffet type of setting where we could try a few of the different menu items...the brunch was more like a set menu to order off of. That said, the food was good. Pool - water was a good temperature given the time of the year and we made use of the pool cabanas which are on a first come, first serve basis...but absolutely great! We spend one afternoon just relaxing in the cabana after 4 days of touring vineyards and wineries. My only complaint was that they always seemed to be low on towels in the afternoon. Great poolside bar and food service from the staff. Thanks guys! Location - perfect location. The hotel is situated about 200 yards from the Oxbow Market, which is great for getting meats, cheeses, breads and other grocery assortments. More on that later. Then to get to the small, downtown Napa area its only about a 8 minute walk. Very convenient for hitting restaurants and wine bars. Very safe walk as well; made many a trip back from downtown to the hotel after midnight. Things to do close by - I would certainly recommend that you get your staples of meats, cheeses, breads and wine at the Oxbow upon arrival. They also have a small organic grocery store in the marketplace. Oxbow is essentially an indoors marketplace of about a dozen niche, boutique restaurants and food merchants. There is a great cheese shop in there, a great place that serves amazing breakfast tacos, and a very cool drip coffee establishment. Loved it. Also close by are other great places downtown. Some of our favorite was Carpe Diem wine bar; we met the owners and want back there every night for a night cap and felt at home. Angele is a great restaurant close to Morimoto's. Loved the food at Angele and their management staff is great (they helped us with a reservation problem and got our large party seated). We ate at Zhu Zhu...great way to feed a dozen of people, and at a reasonable price too. Awesome Sangria at Zhu Zhu. The wine train station is right out the front door of the hotel but we didn't use it so I really can't render my opinion there. :) Kudos - I also have to give kudos to the staff. I sent one of my favorite shirts down to get laundered and was misinformed as to when I'd be getting it back and ended up not having what I wanted to wear for dinner (birthday celebration) due to laundry not being back on time, the hotel staff still had my shirt cleaned while at dinner, ironed, and returned before dinner was over, and they left me a cake and card apologizing for the inconvenience. This was a nice touch.

We like the location because downtown Napa has lots of restaurants and Oxbow but people looking for wine country living might like to stay elsewhere. If you don't need the pool, I think the rooms are comparable to better at Avia, and Avia has friendlier service and is less expensive/better value. If you want more of a resort feel though, come here. But despite the fact that you will pay $400 per night or so at least, with taxes, it doesn't feel like the lap of sophisticated luxury so adjust your expectations. Examples: Some young people were hanging on their balcony overlooking the pool drinking a case of Coors rather loudly (and this is wine country, people). Our room view was fairly awful, overlooking a parking lot where the wine train boards. I do have an issue with Starwood to highlight - the Westin website says rooms are 12-16k starwood points per night.

There is construction next too and across the street from the Westin. There was no major machinery making noise or traffic jams or anything, but it made the area less pretty.

Workout room well equiped. The hotel is located a couple of blocks from the Oxbow Market, which has all kinds of food stalls, fresh fruit, coffee, wine bar, oyster bar. Really cool place. We were also within walking distance of downtown Napa - about 6 or 7 blocks. It was just far enough to walk off a little dinner on the way back to the hotel. Also across the street was the Wine Train. We didn't take that tour but it would have been very convenient. Noise level was average - we could hear the train and noises from the entrance and parking lot but it wasn't a problem.

I could not sleep with that kind of noise and had to ask for earplugs at the front desk. They were apologetic and said they would look into moving us to a different room the next day.

There have been some mixed reviews about this property and I wanted to take the time to write my own to tip the scales in favor of positive reviews. I would give it 4.5 circles if that was allowed. Let me start by saying that this is not a quaint B&B type place. It is a full size / full service hotel and it was great. The rooms are spacious and clean with all the Westin amenities. We were in a 1 bedroom premium suite with a balcony overlooking the pool and we had no complaints. We did not cook, but the full size kitchen came in handy when we needed ice or to keep our cheese cold. The common areas look like a lodge and give it a rustic, but high end feel. The pool was great with a mix of cabanas and lounges. I have read it is crowded - we found it only got crowded after 3pm when people were home from their tours etc. But we never could not find a place to lounge. The service was friendly and quick and the valets work hard! With almost everyone driving they have a lot of cars to get in and out of the garage and we never waited longer than 3 minutes.

I do have some good to say. The location is great, the rooms are beautiful and the valet/bell hops are outstanding. By the way their wi-fi valet and gym cost you $20 a day in a resort fee. Now onto the bad I booked my room on http://Booking.com Three nights in a suite. Before I left for vacation I called the hotel to double check my reservation. They had no record of it. A couple of calls later to http://Booking.com and they were able to give me hotel confirmation numbers. Three confirmation numbers in fact. Upon getting to the Westin, it came as no surprise that they could not find my reservation under my name. They checked the confirmation numbers and found two rooms for the first night. I explained to Sara O. at the front desk I only wanted one room for three nights. She told me it was all fixed and she had put a bunch of notes in the record so that i wouldn't have any problems. The next morning I received under my door a bill showing me checked out. Another visit to the front desk where I was assured everything was OK. Later that afternoon I got a call from the shift manager Miguel asking me why I had two rooms reserved? I was left explaining myself to Miguel. Miguel apologized profusely telling me he was going to personally make sure everything would be OK for the rest of my stay. The very next morning I had another bill under my door showing me checked out. This time I choose to ignore it. Later that same day upon returning from a day out and about in Napa we get to our room. Arms laden with the day's treasures. Yep you got it,the room key didn't work. My wife agree's to go back down stairs to get a new key (the third one in three days). Once we get in the room there is a message from Miguel telling me how everything is OK and my room key should work. I thought I would call him to let him know what ever he did didn't work. I was on hold for 6 minutes hearing their on hold message about out \"intuitive\" their service is. By this time I am beyond pissed. Problems I understand. They were great at sincerer apologies. They pretty much sucked at fixing the problems I was having. Doretta Welch from http://Booking.com was no help either. She offered me an apology and told me she understood.

I can't say the same about the customer service -- particularly when coupled with the so-called \"amenity fee,\" which is simply a $20/night upcharge. At check-in, the hopelessly overworked valet/bell staff could not help with bags because they were too busy moving cars around a very tight driveway -- part of the mandatory valet parking which would become a frequent source of frustration. Each time we requested a vehicle, it took 15 minutes or more to get it -- except the time that they could not find my vehicle and I had to walk down to the garage with them to retrieve it. I'm not sure if the mandatory valet parking is an attempt at faux class, or simply a way to \"justify\" the $20 daily fee. Either way, it's a pain and I ended up usually parking in the street. When we left at 9am, I called housekeeping to request early cleaning. We came back at 4pm and no cleaning. Spoke to the assistant manager on duty, who said she would send someone up right away. Housekeeping came at 530pm as we were getting cleaned up for evening cocktails. We took the clean towels and declined the service as at that point, it was too late. On the day we needed a concierge for assistance with dinner reservations and winery visits, we learned it was \"her day off.\" This resort does not have a full time concierge, something one would expect at $309/night (plus that vexing $20 fee). The guy at the front desk (not a concierge -- something he let us know) attempted to help by running a google search for wineries -- nice attempt but not really the value added help we were expecting from a Napa resort. It's apparent that the hotel is trying to provide customer service on the cheap -- employing too few people to provide competent customer service. One way to free up resources would be to cease the useless valet service. Interestingly, we had two digital clocks and two tv clocks in the room (total of 4). Two of the 4 were off by half an hour. Good thing we noticed and reset them. Again, the hotel structure is very pleasant and we really liked our room.

The pool is on the small side, but adequate. It opens at 8am and you can bet families throw down towels on loungers and in the (free) cabanas (this ain't Vegas people). Seems a little unfair since not everyone spends the whole day at the pool. Still, there is drinks and food service poolside at room service prices. Spotted a few out-of-place couples sans kiddies, felt a little bad for them. But hey, if you're staying here during school holidays, I don't think you can avoid screaming kids poolside. This place is probably nice for couples/singles outside of school breaks. We had a city-view room, which def isn't as nice as the pool/courtyard view.

We had breakfast the first morning at the hotel and the food was fine if rather basic (the Sonoma Sheraton in Petaluma does much better breakfasts). The service though was quite poor - it took us quite a while to get seated and there was lots of space - the staff were just ignoring us, it seemed like a game of dare for them \"how long do you think we can leave it before they walk?\". Service during the meal was poor also and we had to ask for a coffee fill-up. It was not going to be offered involuntarily. My daughter (like many other kids) has an issue with nitrates/nitrites in foods like sausage and ham. This really shouldn't be an issue at a quality place like this that should source good quality meats free of these additives. We asked whether the sausage included them and the answer from the chef was \"yes\". Not so good - they're sourcing cheaper product and charging high prices. One possible motivation for the poor breakfast service was that 15% service tip is included automatically in the bill - no option. Doesn't exactly motivate the staff to give of their best, and the result is clear. Don't like this automatic 15% addition, it's very poor and I haven't seen it elsewhere. The check had a space for a tip too and it was highlighted with a yellow marker pen as if to draw attention that you should pay it. Overall though - a really nice stay, lovely hotel accomodation and great reception/valet/bellhop staff, wish I had taken a note of their names so I could give them some credit.

Yountville, where all the wonderful restaurants are located, was a 10-15 minute drive away. Word to the wise, there are hardly any taxi cabs in Napa Valley (which we thought was very strange, does everyone just drink and drive?!) so a rental car is a necessity ~ and a designated driver helps, who wants to draw straws?! Otherwise, there are limo services available as well which apparently would cost roughly the same as a taxi if you managed to find one, especially if you are commuting to and from various areas within the valley (eg.

The hotel itself is very attractive and most of the service personnel were helpful and personable. The only real glitch in my stay was that I used the westin.com website to first book my reservations and then modified the original reservation from 3 rooms to 2 rooms. While I received an email confirmation for the original booking of 3 rooms, I received no such email confirmation (though it was displayed online when I did so) for the modification. Thus, upon arrival I discovered I had been charged for deposits for 3 rooms instead of 2. For whatever reason, the representatives at the hotel seemed very unwilling to offer to return the deposit for the 3rd room despite explaining the situation where i had cancelled the 3rd room in plenty of time to avoid the charge in painful detail several times to each person. It was only after I contacted westin.com itself and found a rep there to printout details for both aspects of the confirmation (which were unavailable to me on their website using any form of identification) as proof, upon which I was refunded that deposit by the hotel representatives. Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the entire fiasco, and it seems to me that there is some lack of sychronization between westin.com and the local hotel systems. At the end of the day, I won't hold the issue against the westin, as it was resolved, but I would strongly advise any parties staying at this location to make sure you have printed copies of any confirmation and especially of any modifications. Back to the hotel itself, its location is nothing to write home about but is easy access to the Silverado Trail and a short 5 minute drive to the 29 for the main winery road. The Westin Verasa had complimentary wine tasting which was nice, and the rooms themselves are spacious and accommodating. The valets were helpful and quick, and checkin was a breeze. In truth, after my ordeal with the deposit, I really wanted to dislike this hotel, but I honestly cannot. I just wish the hotel had given me the benefit of the doubt to begin with. As for surroundings, it is about a 15 minute walk to Bounty Hunter and some fabulous food. From there, I also strongly recommend the Ristorante Allegria (about a stone's throw from Bounty Hunter) for an outstanding dinner at a reasonable price. On a final note, I have also stayed at the Napa River Inn, and in comparison, the Westin is roomier and more elegant, with the River Inn having more of a B&B feel to it with a slightly better location for town.

Had a great stay with impeccible service in what was a much nicer property then I was expecting. I met an old friend of mine there, both of us travelling in from different parts of the world, to catch up, play golf and enjoy the fine food and wine of the Napa Valley. Property & Location: The location is ideal if you want to be downtown Napa. The restaurants of Main Street etc are a pleasant 5-7 min walk away so very accessible. The property itself is quite imposing but has a very 'chalet' feel to it which wouldn't put it out of place in Whistler or similar. The lobby and public areas are all very clean, modern, yet cosy and hosipitable. Facilities: I only really used the Gym once but it was a great size and well equiped. I had it to myself ([possibly due to it being end of week in the winter) There was a pool and jacuzzi which I overheard a few of the other guests saying postive things about. Room/Bathroom: For those who've experienced the Heavenly Beds well there's not much more to say then they are the BEST! This Westin did not disappoint and our room was much more a large serviced apartment then a typical hotel room with a large fully equiped kitchen, two full bedrooms with two bathrooms. Everything was modern and in great shape. We had a nice balcony off the back but since it was pretty chilly didn't get to use it too much. Food & Bev: This is where the Westin really excelled. If you are in the Napa area and looking for fine dining at its best, I would highly recommend booking into 'La Toque' which is the Michelin rated restaurant which now calls the Westin its home. We barely squeezed in on a Saturday night (9:30pm reservation) but what a meal!! The wine pairings are incredible and the food quality and portions were sensational. All the accolades of this place are incredibly well deserved and to be in the same hotel as where you are staying is a massive plus. Summary and Pros/Cons: Overall this property was fantastic and really checked all the boxes. Great service, clean modern and comfortable rooms, great location and fantastic facilities. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or stay there again if I found myself in the Napa Valley.

Did not bother us a bit as we were really casual and not really on a schedule, but we did get a good laugh from it.

There is a big construction staging area between the hotel and the market so it may see a bit imposing to walk by but it is really worth the trip. Just a really nice unique little spot.

I wonder how many they have in their inventory if any, They finally offered us an upgrade at 5pm the night before we were leaving, but we declined as it wasn't worth the effort to pack and unpack. On the positive side, it is a beautiful resort with a nice pool area with about 10 cabanas. I found the customer service service to be a bit lacking for a Westin property, more akin to a time share feeling. I don't think there is any poolside service, at least I didn't see anyone when I was there. The conceirge was nice but didn't seem all that knowledgable about the area. when we asked for restaurant recommendations we were basically given a printout of restaurants in the area, which wasn't all that helpful. The Owbox market is only a block away with a few good casual restaurants, but be aware that most of them are are not free standing. Better choice for lunch than dinner, unless you wants burgers at Gotts Roadside (try the ahi burger and sweet potato fries). Our best meal was at Mustards Grill in Yountville, great lemon garlic chicken! Overall a nice property that will be even better when the construction surrounding it is finished. Good choice if travelling with family as the suited are spacious and have full kitchens.

The room was very nice, as you would expect of a Westin. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was big, and we found the kitchenette useful for breakfast in the mornings, and also because one evening we got some rotisserie chicken take-out from the Oxbow market which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and watched a movie in the room with a bottle of wine we'd picked up at a winery during the day. We also liked the pool area and poolside cabanas, where we chilled out in the afternoon after a hard days wine tasting. Although there did not seem to be any poolside service, and we had to go to the lobby bar to get something to drink. For us that wasn't a big problem though. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the centre of Napa, and even on a 100 degree day it's really not that far, and there are some tasting rooms and some nice little shops on the way to break up the journey, although you do have to cross a pretty busy road (and the rail tracks) to get there. On the downside the hotel seems pretty big, and lacks a bit of a soul as a result. There doesn't really seem to be anything to give hotel guests much of a wine country experience; and once inside the hotel it feels like you could be anywhere in the world. We didn't see that many other guests there, and this was during peak season. We also didn't really see many staff members either, other than front desk and the porters/valets - some may say the staff were discrete, others may just say absent. But maybe that's because it's still quite new. The immediate surroundings of the hotel does seem to be mainly vacant lots, scrubland and the lot for the Napa Valley Wine Train (opposite). So the property is not exactly nestling amongst the vines; and this gives the impression that the hotel is leading the way in the redevelopment of the area. But the area isn't sinister or anything; just a little sparse. But that said for the majority of our stay we were either wine tasting, or visiting fine restaurants or exploring everything the Napa Valley has to offer; and the hotel was well located for both Highway 29 and the Silverado trail; and perfect for the wineries in the Southern end of the valley, as well as the town of Napa itself. It's also not that far to drive to Sonoma from there. But in general I'd say that for anyone wanting to keep driving to a minimum, and wanting to see the whole of the Napa Valley then somewhere more central (Yountville, Rutherford or St. Helena) may be more convenient choices - although a hotel of the standard of the Westin Verasa in those locations would demand considerably higher rates.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cSolid Westin experience\u201d", "Author": "allplanetsearch", "ReviewID": "UR74233971", "Content": "Our family of four (mom, dad, 5 year old and 2 year old) just stayed in a one-bedroom suite at this new Westin property.

The style of the hotel is Craftsman. The entry is spacious but rather plain. There is a bar serving lots of the local wines. There is a very expensive restaurant attached the hotel.

An LCD TV in both the bedroom and living room. A kitchen with all the utensils and a couple of packets of Starbucks. Spacious bathroom was beautiful with lots of marble, glass and stone. What was unusual about the room was the presence of a stationary bicycle, medicine ball, free weights, exercise ball, and lots of exercising accessories. The staff of the hotel really tried hard to please and one could sense lots of great customer service training. However, the valets (mandatory) doubled as Bell boys and there seemed to be only two per shift. Felt very sorry as they were really running their tails off to please while customers had to wait awhile on their cars. The reader should be aware this this hotel is situated just over a river and adjacent to the town of Napa. It is located on the extreme southern end of the Napa Valley. With a car it is a five minute drive to the beginning of the vineyards. The only reason I mention this is because some of the photos give the impression this might be a hotel in the country overlooking or amongst the vineyards which it is not. If you want that (and I would recommend it) consider Yountville, St. Helena, or Calistoga (note that the distance between Napa on the southern end of the valley and Calistoga on the north end is only about 35 miles on a superb road (not so superb driving if you have tasted too many wines). However, Westin does offer quality at a more affordable price then the boutique Inns and hotels deeper in the valley. Be aware that Westin has jumped on the bandwaggon with so many hotels that advertise one price but have all kinds of added fees. Thanks to Tripadvisor reviewers we knew in advance the real cost so this was not an issue (out nightly rate was $155 + $18.60 Napa tax + $20.00 amenity fee + $2.40 tax on the amenity fee so that is about 26% more than the published price).

A bit lower quality materials compared to other Westins I stayed but fine until they wear out.. The hotel staff is not up to my expectations for a westin. The main issue seems to be managers do not understand yet what a good quality service their customers expect from them. Once the managers understand, they will be able to educate their staff but I do not think that that is happening. Now, staff is saying that they are sorry and that they are a new hotel but you do not see and effort to fix anything you happen to bump into. They have a weird policy valet only parking with a completely empty garage. If you do not want to leave your car to valet, you need to park on the city street where there is no security. But, the garage does not have any security either :-) gates are always open. Some specifics They have heated pool and jacuzzi. They pitched so well that my kid had to have it. So, we went but jacuzzi jets were not working,.Without us calling anybody, somebody came by, then a manager, then the maintenace person. Each of them had almost had the same words: Ohh! You could not work the jets? Let me give try. I told myself that there is no magic in this, you just turn a dial. It is not about me not knowing how to do it, it is just not working. They all came and they all went back. They couldn't/didn't fix it. But, did not come back and say why. My guess that it was not working for whatever reason, they knew that from the begining but did not have the face to tell to us since they are over selling it even while we were checking in. We ordered of the breakfast items two days in a row. Second day, it was fairly bad, no consistency. They have a nice restaurant. I checked out the menu and wanted to have dinner there. I mentioned to the host that my kid would not able to eats and if they can find something simple to eat. The answer was no. I asked if they can bring something from the other restaurant's menu. The answer was an arrogent no. I finally indciated that I want to have dinner there but my kid is paying he bill and need to work it out :-) Then, the host suddenly changed the tone and said they could prepare some pasta or make a meal size outof some smaller plates they have. Too arrogent for a restaurant that has only a few people for thw whole night - hotel was also near empty due to Christmas time. I ended up going to a nice country frensh restaurant in downton napa - Angele and liked it. On the day of check out, we had breakfast and charged to my room. I went to checkout counter and told them that I have an additional breakfast since the last night's bill I gave to them. The person did n even listen and said that I was done. I said I had breakfast that is not on the bill and I would like them to put that on the bill and reprint. She called the restaurant and I could see both of them talking on and waiter saw me waiting. I got the bell boy bring down our belongings with me - which is another 5-10 minutes. My bill still not ready and the girl at hte counter put the blame at the restaurant that they have not put the charge in so I just walked to the restaurant which was a few steps and asked what happened. She started to come up excuses that the others already checked me out so she could not put the meal on, etc., blaming the other staff. I asked her why should I care about these excuses and blames? I asked her to just do it, which surprisingly took less than a minute. The girl at the check out counter said that they are a new hotel and they are sorry. I reminded her that it is not about being a new hotel, and that she did not even listen to what I told her about adding my breakfast to the bill and she ignored my comment my request and said I am done. She just smiled back. There are other less important irritaing things such as hot water taking really long time (>5 minutes), changing channels on TV is full 2 seconds and you cannot zip channels through quickly, missing pillow cover, etc. But the main issue is that managers and staff do not understand they are in service business. Some arrogance which is very unjustified for a Westin motel :-), especially while hotel is practically deserted, and no effort in trying to keep their customer happy. I think somebody miseducated them that they are Westin that they are better than other hotels in the area, that they know it all via good training on what to tell the customer without thinking or listening first... It will take some time for the behaviors to change since most had the same attitude. I was explaining someof my unhappiness to the bell boy while walking out, he was feeling very sorry. He asked for my contact information so that they could follow up and make it up to me. I had to tell him that he knows my room number and the hotel has all the contact information they need (my address, my phone, my cell phone) and I can not figure out why I had to explain these type of things.

They were also very accomodating to people with food allergies and picky eaters like myself. The hotel restaurant inside the lobby, However, is very limited with their choice of foods and not many options are available to people like myself who do not consume red meat, pork or dairy.

I guess that is a good thing--because one did not have to wait. They did not have an ice bucket for the white wine, so they put it in ice behind the bar. Despite the fact that we were sitting at the bar, refills from our wine bottle were hard to come by. We decided to head up to the room with the remaining wine in our glasses and bottle. They wanted the glasses back--because housekeeping steals them. Oh, you are automatically charged a service charge on all services of 15 to 20% at the hotel--even for poor service. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was good. The conceirege was rarely \"on duty,\" so it is an easy choice to eat at the hotel. I worked most of the next day and had no problems with the internet--as others have suggested. The door to the patio did not lock, so I called to get it fixed. Despite 2 calls during a 2 day stay, it was never fixed. My second evening, I went down to the bar for a bottle of wine--to take up to the room with no glasses. : ) After charging the 15% service charge for handing me a bottle of wine and after I interrupted a long conversation between 2 employees on a personal matter to get said bottle, the bartender was not happy when I asked that he open the bottle. He explained that there was an opener in the room I could use. The last day I went to the pool. It was nice, but despite a good crowd, everyone had to go inside and wait at the bar for food or beverages. Of course, all were charged service charges as if the food had been delivered. The starwood platinum benefits were not honored, and management was flat out rude when I called to inquire why. It was apparent they do not understand the rewards programs, and it was not worth the time and energy to deal with them. The room was nice and the location fine.

When we checked in, we had to upgrade to the suite, which has a pull-out couch ($40 more per night). This type of suite was not available, so we had to upgrade to the workout suite ($50 more per night, from base price). The workout suite is nothing special. It has a medicine ball, a stability ball, some resistance bands, and a stationary bike. The resort fee is standard, everyone pays it. Why Westin doesn't roll it into the price, I don't know. It might be because it's already overpriced and if they added $20/night, it would be way too much. To summarize, we ended up paying $70/night more. Internet is included in the $20 fee, so I don't see that as free internet. I was not impressed with the \"Heavenly\" amenities.

We are usually very low-key guests and easy to please, but there were so many issues with this hotel I felt compelled to write my first negative review. I'll try to keep this brief, but there were several issues, and I may go off on a tangent or two: 1. We arrived to check-in and were promptly told that we had to wait, that our room wasn't ready; check-in time was at 3 pm. We said okay, and checked the time: 2:48 pm. Are you kidding? I could understand if we were an hour or two early, but are you telling me you have NO rooms ready at 10 minutes to 3? The lady wouldn't budge, so we ran down to the bakery nearby and returned about 1/2 hour later - miraculously, our room was ready. Not a great start, but whatever; we were willing to shrug it off. But.... 2. When we checked in (as Starwood Gold members), we were told that all they had available was a standard room, but would let us know if an upgrade became available. Since we were going to be there for 5 nights, that was no problem. Until we realized that our room was right next to the exercise room, outdoor patio, and pool. SO noisy at night, and in the morning when we could hear people start to work out. We asked after our first night if we could change rooms, and the front desk woman (Lisa), assured us she would get us a different room and most likely an upgrade since it was Sunday and the hotel wouldn't be at capacity. She said she'd call us later. We leave for the day and come back around 7..... 3. Somehow, there are NO rooms we can move to - not even another standard room. Lisa never called us, and claims there are no rooms available. Now, we understand that as Gold members we're below Platinum on the upgrade list, but nevertheless one of the perks is that we're entitled to an upgrade (even a better view) when available. So we asked, \"does that mean that everyone who checked in today was a Platinum member?\" since that could be the only explanation that would make sense. Lisa had no real explanation, and said she'd definitely call us tomorrow w/a room change. Even a different/quieter view, standard room would have been fine - but no call, NOTHING was ever attempted to change our room after that. 4. Each day our room was cleaned, we were given fewer towels - the last day we were given ONE bath towel and two hand towels - for two guests? We were also supposed to receive a morning paper every morning outside our door (a small gold member perk), and got it 1 out of 5 mornings we were there - the rest of the time they were just stacked at the front desk. Also, we had no room service menu/hotel book in our room, nor any mini bar or fridge/snacks as other reviewers had mentioned. Was our room like an afterthought? Again, normally wouldn't complain, but on top of everything else.... 5. This one is my favorite. When we checked in, the front desk (Lisa) said, quote, \"Since you are using your Starwood points for your stay, your points include complimentary VALET PARKING, wi-fi, and use of our business center and workout facilities.\" I'd read on here about the $20 'resort' fee, but since she told us it was included in our point redemption, we thought, great! UNTIL we received the bill on our last morning for the $20 + taxes per day for the 'resort fee.' When we took it to the front desk, we were told - sorry, everyone pays the resort fee, whether you use the parking or not, and the only way to get around it is to book through an agency like Travelocity, since they pay for the fees upfront. So basically, they're saying that, even though we're supposedly 'preferred' Starwood members, staying at your hotel using points, we MUST pay an additional $100 + taxes for our stay, since in order to use our points we have to book directly, and don't have the option of using Travelocity? Wow, very classy, Westin. The location of the hotel is also weird; within walking distance of downtown Napa, but there really isn't anything in downtown Napa - good restaurants, but lots of empty store fronts. Overall, this was the most disappointing stay we've had at a Westin (and we've stayed at many). It's obvious the management and staff have not been properly trained in customer service, and are only there to cater to their 'big wig' customers, like the ones that were being wined and dined at an open house we saw while we were there, trying to get people to become owners.

While rooms facing the back of the hotel have reasonably attractive views, rooms to the front and sides would look out on concrete, streets, parking lots, etc. - hardly an idyllic getaway. While the concierge at the inn had been wonderful in recommending wineries to visit and making appointments, there simply was no concierge at the Westin at all until our last night here - guests were left to simply fend for themselves.

It's located on the edge of downtown, and not far from a pretty scary Wal Mart. If you walk a few blocks in one direction, you're in this really cute little downtown area (I think it's called the Oxbow district), but a couple blocks in the other direction isn't so cute.

Overall I was not excited about the stay there. When I originally called to book, the hotel forwarded me to corporate for the booking. The lady I spoke with seemed not to be 100% there and gave me a different list of potential room views than someone I had talked to a few days before directly at the hotel. I requested a rivew view and top (third) floor room. My checkin experience was probably the worst way to start a vacation. This is when I learned I got nothing I requested even though I did so way in advance. The lady who was handling my checkin seemed really confused and/or out of it. To top it off, they had charged me for two rooms (for just me and me husband). It was a big headache to get the second room charge reversed as it was prepaid. We had two other couples travelling with us. One got a \"river view\" which was more of a view if you only looked way around the corner. And they also had a clear shot of a neighbor's balcony. Our view was essentially a wall (but looking around we could see part of the pool - so it was deemed a \"pool view\"). We also had a closeup view of our neighbor's balcony. Honestly, I don't require an awesome view....it just would have been good to have expectations managed rather then selling it as \"review views\" and (the non-existent) \"vineyard views\" by corporate. The bed was VERY COMFORTABLE. We had a one-bedroom suite. The sofa bed did not have any sheets (unacceptable in my book). What's the point of having a sofa bed if it's not ready? The bathroom was nice - loved the double-headed shower. But at night, it felt as though the hotel either shut off or altered the overall room temperatures. It seemed you had to reduce the temp to the mid sixties just for it to stay comfortable. The common areas for hanging out were good. Plenty of space outside in the courtyards and the wine bar. The hotel location was good. It was nice to stroll to Model Bakery each morning and get a World's Best English Muffin. But if I had to do it again, I would not stay at the Westin Verasa.

We are Westin owners and were very excited to visit the new Westin in Napa...until we got there and even after we checked out. We have stayed at many Westin/Starwood properties and never had such a low level of customer service. Sure, the hotel is nice and new, but when you have such horrible service it ruins everything. I was never able to speak to a consierge because I was always told they wouldn't be in until later. The front desk often times did not answer their phone when we called from our room and when we called from outside the hotel. One morning we went to breakfast at The Bank Cafe and it took forever for someone to acknowlege that we were waiting for a table even though they glanced our way several times. After breakfast we went to the very tiny concierge desk (more like a podium) where a gentleman sat. We asked for his assistance and he told us he was just resting there. I then asked if he worked there and he replied \"what do ya need?\" RUDE! Calling for our car was always a nightmare because there doesn't seem to be a dedicated line for valet. When we asked who to call for valet they just told us to call the front desk, but they didn't always answer. The hotel seems to be very understaffed and that may be part of the problem. When we received our bill the day of checkout, there were charges from the prior guest that had our room and for The Bank Cafe. We did not put any charges for dining on our room...they were always paid with cash. After several conversations with the front desk, the bill was corrected. I was told upon check out that I would be contacted by the hotel manager that afternoon and left my contact info. Two days later, I still had not been contacted by the manager. I was also told that I would have part of my starpoints that we used for our stay returned to my account. I called the hotel back and left a voicemail to which the manager finally returned my call. He was very polite and appologized for the unfortunate experience we had. He promised to email me his contact info. After many more phone calls to the hotel I still have no contact info. I have spoken to a couple people at the hotel that promised my starpoints would be taken care of and it never happened. It's too bad I have had to waste so much of my time trying to deal with the hotel staff. I should have gone directly to Starwood Corporate.

On check in we were told of the resort fee (we were not lead to believe this was optional), this was to cover valet parking and use of the facilities. I would have thought that our \u00a3900 would have covered this and then some, but apparently not. There is plenty of road parking and i'm not sure if they actually check if you use the facilities or not (if your room key doesn't work in the pool for example, you can just reach over and open it from the other side) The hotel is shiny and new, and the rooms (we had a studio) was perfect. Nice large bed, balcony (although no furniture to sit on - have to go for the 1 bed to get that!), clean and functional kitchenette. Our first room was located on the road side - overlooking the wine train (hotel is perfectly located for this attraction). On morning one we were woken at 08.00 by someone using a hammer outside - we had to get up for an excursion (Platapus wine tours - fabulous) so ignored this. However, on morning two we were woken at 7am to construction noise - by 7.30am the drills at started up. I put a call in to the conceirge to see if we could arrange a room change to the back of the hotel and got voice mail. There were no other phone instructions in the room to call front desk, so we waited for a call whilst trying to doze. By 9am we still had no call back, so i called again - voice mail. By 10am i was down to the front desk demanding a room change - to be told the conceirge doesn't start work until 11am (they never did return the calls btw). The receptionist who had been really helpful on previous days, passed us on to a colleague. Her colleague was probably the least helpful hotel worker i have ever encountered...she tapped away on her keyboard and fairly much said 'computor says no' and told us to check again that night (she claimed they were full everynight of our stay). Around 4pm i went back and spoke to someone else, who showed us another room facing on to a courtyard, which we moved to. Room was identical, but at least quiet! Its amasing how suddenly they weren't full and could find something when the receptionist was actually willing to be helpful. The hotel is located around 10minute walk to downtown which gives a great choice of places to eat. One thing to be aware of is that most resturants close around 9ish, so head out early to eat. A real find for us was the Oxbow market, just down the street from the hotel. They had a bakery so we didn't have to pay out for breakfast at the hotel and a wonderful bar / wine merchant / deli / resturant 'The Wine Merchant'. They give advice and wine tasting, combined with a cheese shop, a friendly bar and food available all under one roof. We spent a lovely evening sitting up to the bar eating a cheese board, tasting wines and then buying a couple of bottles and a stinky cheese for lunch the next day (they had a deal on buy $15 of cheese, get 15% off wine when we were there). The facilites at the hotel were good (be warned there is little shade by the pool, so arrive early if you plan to spend the day to get a cabana to have the option). Both the pool and the spa pool are open until late, which was great to come back to after an evening out.

Not a big deal, but combined with the rest of the problems it was typical of my experience. I paid extra for a one-bedroom suite with a balcony, and the room was great. However, when I went out on the balcony, my view was of two massive air conditioning units that were blowing full blast my whole stay. Since I informed them that this was a special occasion I thought it was totally inconsiderate. Also, eating in the restaurant was a mixed bag. The food was great, but they were out of several items on the menu and it took over 10 minutes to get a waiter to come over to our table. One more thing. Room service stops at 11PM.

Our stay was perfect in every way!! The hotel is very new and is a beautiful property located near downtown Napa, along the river(to the back of the property) and across from the wine train station. It was easy to walk down the block to restaurants, The Oxbow Market, and even to the downtown Main St. area where all the restaurants and many wine tasting rooms are. I booked our stay through Hotels.com and got the best value ($189-midweek) for the Deluxe King Room with a kitchenette. The Traditional Room doesn't have the kitchenette. We saw the 1 bedroom with a FULL kitchen and it was very spacious!! Room: We had a pool view room on the 3rd floor. It was very plush, clean, and beautifully decorated in earth tones. The heavenly bed was so comfortable. The room had a small sofa, coffee table, small table with 2 chairs, 4 drawer dresser with flat screen TV (movies were pricey- $15.99), I- Rise clock radio- I-Pod player, in room safe (complimentary use), closet (robes to use). The bathroom had black granite countertops and slate wall in the shower. All the bathroom amenities- hair dryer, hair products, make up mirror, large mirror on the wall. The best feature was the kitchenette. It had a small fridge, 2 burner cooktop, small dishwasher, and the cabinets were stocked with everything to cook with- utensils, toaster, pans, blender etc. There was a one cup drip coffee maker with Starbucks coffee that was complimentary. The fridge had 6 sodas and there were goodies/snacks on the dresser, however, those were all for purchase. The counter tops were also black granite. Pool: The pool area was very nice!! The hot tub was large. There were about 8 cabanas with soft padded loungers and other lounge chairs around with pool towels on each. There was drink service out at the pool. Lobby and Service: The entrance and lobby are beautifully decorated. The restaurant/bar is there and the doors are all glass and open up to the pool area. It makes the lobby open-air style like I've seen in Hawaii. I didn't eat at the restaurant, nor did I eat at La Toque Restaurant that resides at the Westin now. It is one of the finer restaurants in town and very pricey, but highly rated!! You can have 2-5 course dinners there with wine pairings. Outside near the pool were sitting areas with a beautiful water feature/fire pit. The service was great and all staff very accommodating and friendly from everyone we encountered!! Other Amenities: There is a business center with use of the computer internet and copy machine, and also free wireless in the rooms. The small fitness center had free weights and plenty of machines. There is a workout walking path the hotel has established with cards that show you the route. Close by: Soscol is the main street running in front of the hotel. To the right on Soscol you will find Walmart and a Safeway, Ross, Trader Joes etc -turn left on Trencas Ave.-5 minutes by car. To the left on Soscol, there is a Super Target, Dennys, I-Hop, Banks and assorted other stores- 5 minutes by car. Also it is an easy jount up Hwy 29, the main wine road or over to the Silverado Trail. Also golf is nearby at Napa Kennedy Park and not too much further to Chardonnay Club or Eagle Vines Golf Clubs.

My wife and I do quite a lot of traveling for business and also during our free time as we enjoy adventuring. From start to finish the Westin Napa was very enjoyable. It is an awesome location and super close to all the the city has to offer. You can walk to the Oxbow public market which has everything from a tasty bakery and oyster bar to a kiosk where you can rent bikes and kayaks. Historic downtown Napa with all of it's boutiques, delicious restaurants, bars and shopping is only a few short blocks walking distance from these spectacular digs. The facility itself is organic, modern and classy but very comfortable and in no way pretentious. We did not eat at Ken Frank's world famous La Toque (recently relocated to the hotel) this time around but have in the past. The new La Toque is gorgeous and we would highly recommend it. When the wife and I dined there a year or so ago, we found it to be one of the top culinary experiences of our lifetime and we are quite the foodies. Though we did not swim in the beautiful pool or take a leisurely nap in the resort style cabanas, or play a game of bocce ball, or in anyway take advantage of the many outdoor spaces the Westin has to offer, we were very impressed at the thoughtful layout as we walked the grounds. Our light, bright and spacious studio room was very well appointed. We were on the South (???) side of the hotel closest to the bend in the river and the Ox Bow Public Market. We sipped fresh cups of Starbucks coffee (available in your room) from our balcony on multiple mornings while we soaked up the tranquil river and mountain views. The beds are indeed Heavenly as are the shower heads, plush towels and robes. We had no need for the in room safe, but thought it was a great idea for those that have that need. We loved the large LCD television (super picture) and used the in room X-box to watch a few episodes of Entourage. It was great that the Westin had a fully stocked kitchen (dishwasher, microwave, utensils, plates, stove, fridge, etc.) and we used it to reheat some yummy leftovers and create a few wine oriented appetizers and prepare some fixings for our picnic. The Westin concierge was wonderful and made delightful recommendations for dinner and shared with us some of her favorite wineries and experiences around the area. We felt like she really listened to us and got a good feel for who we are and what we were looking to enjoy, as we thoroughly enjoyed all her suggestions. The other Westin staff team were also equally attentive and knowledgeable about the local area and more importantly the hotel itself. I called the front desk on at least three occasions with questions about the TV, dvd player, room service and check out procedures. Each time I spoke to the front desk they were fast, friendly, polite and I honestly felt trying to make our experience memorable.

The Good: Nice, clean, rooms; beautiful lobby; nice bar/restaurant area; good location for the up and coming Napa area. The Bad: Service is sporadic; lots of confusion; differing prices; mis-quotes on prices; very bad chauffeur service; employees not knowledgeable. The Ugly: Price mix ups that took two weeks to resolve. Here's what happened: we checked in, granted, on a busy weekend, but they had our room and booking confused - with people in line behind us becoming increasingly irritated, they asked if we could 'wait' until they checked in the other parties. I told them definitely not - finally, they resolved the mix-up but had the wrong price for the room (I had booked a special on the website for one night for full price, one night half price and they not only had the wrong quote for the first night - twice the booking rate, but the full price the second night). They did resolve this, however. We then went to the room which was beautiful. We went to take the promised \"free\" chauffeured car to dinner and they told us \"it would be better to walk hire a car because there's a 15 minute wait...\" This, after I had confirmed the 'free\" ride when we checked in and they even told us what time to come down. I complained to a manger and voila, a car showed up. Unfortunately, the driver practically begged us for a tip and told us they didn't pay him enough and he had been hired at the last minute just for the weekend because the hotel had booked up at the last minute. Sadly, this entire situation was repeated the second night of our stay - almost identical situation - different driver, same story - except this driver got lost and I had to help him find our restaurant! More: We went to the bar/restaurant and had lunch our first day and it was fine - food was pretty good, no issues. Also had breakfast first morning there. Problem: the hotel charged us for breakfast and it was supposed to be included in the rate! We argued and they gave us the first morning breakfast, but not the second. Then, when we checked out, there was a charge on the bill from the bar that was not ours - it was charged when we were in town having dinner! The hotel said \"we can't do anything - the bar is separate - you'll have to call the manager...\" So, after two weeks of phone tag with the manager and having the restaurant where we dined call him and tell him we were there when the charge was made, they credited our credit card! Final Evaluation: Despite the above, this IS a nice hotel - it was all bearable because the hotel personnel were so polite and nice about each issue. I would go back, but, unfortunately, not at the prices they are now charging. We were given a special rate because the hotel was just opening - prices have doubled - I am not kidding - doubled - since we stayed there. The hotel even called us to say \"hey, did you enjoy your stay and will you come back?\" I told them we would love to but the prices were not justifiable when one can go to the Napa River Inn or River Terrace (just next door, not as plush, but inexpensive!) for half the price. They offered us a \"special\" but it was still $299 a night. This is a nice property, but it is not worth more than $250 a night - and yes, I realize this is the Napa Valley - but the competition is not charging any more than that and the hotel and the location (while a good location - it is across the Napa River) are not worth what they are now charging.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly\u201d", "Author": "moyates", "ReviewID": "UR30975351", "Content": "Great hotel.

Let me start with the positive, the property is beautiful, very clean, and in a great location. The beds are so comfortable and the concierge was helpful with restaurant selections. On the flip side, if you want to leave the property, be sure to request your car from valet AT LEAST 30 MINUTES PRIOR....I am not exaggerating. The hotel was no where near capacity and each time we requested our vehicle it took 30 minutes at a minimum. We had to request our vehicle 4 times while the valet guys stood around and chatted with each other looking at us like we were odd for standing outside for so long. Not to mention, you have to pay a $20 per day fee for this valet, which is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. We parked on the street because we had to catch a flight and were concerned we would miss it due to the painfully slow valet.

We stayed in a Deluxe room which to our surprise was a well-stocked kitchenette including stovetop ( 2 \"burners\" I think), microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, and some kitchen cookware and kitchenware. The bathroom was nicely sized with a dual head shower. And our view of the courtyard was pleasant and quiet. Front staff check-in and checkout was efficient and cheerful. The onsite restaurant, LA TOQUE, is FABULOUS! And hands down the best dining experience and food we have EVER had so it was great that we didn't have to leave the resort to go for dinner. It is pricey, but we thought worth it. Two issues we noted were: 1. We don't think there is much to do in terms of where the hotel is located - I think Oxbow Public Market and the Napa Wine Train Station are close, but I didn't really see much surrounding the hotel itself. 2. The $20 / day resort fee is a nuisance. I don't understand why this continues to be a trend at hotels that are \"resorts.\" It covers valet parking, the use of their exercise facilities (which we didn't check out), and bocce ball.

They lost the keys to our rental car for almost 24 hours. When I checked out, the final bill showed a restaurant charge that someone had falsely charged to our room. I went to the front desk to talk to Christopher the front desk manager and told him I had never eaten at the restaurant during my stay. Well he made me wait at the front desk and had the restaurant pull the receipts from their books to show them to me. Did he think my signature would magically appear on those receipts? They finally agreed to remove the charges but when I got home and checked my credit card bill, they never credited the amount in dispute, so I had to call my credit card company. I usually stay at 5 star hotels and the difference is when a place like the St Regis makes a mistake, they not only apologize profusely but they try to make it up to you somehow.

My friends and I came here for my 25th birthday party. Given the current economy and the off-season, we thought we paid enough (over $200) for a standard room with two beds. Upon checking in, we were informed that we had been \"upgraded\" to a room with one king-sized bed--for four adults!--because our original room had been given away. We requested to be booked in our original room, and asked for the Manger on Duty, Antonello, who subsequently refused our request. When we said that we didn't want the upgrade, he became visibly upset and informed us that if we wanted a second bed, we should book a second room at our own expense. He insisted that every single room in the hotel with more than one bed was booked, and that at 97% capacity he could only book us an extra room at our cost. We should also note that the Westin gave away our original room with two beds, and Antonello defended this by saying that the reservation was only made for 2 adults. We had put four adults on the reservation, but even so--we pointed out that there would be several occasions on which two adults would want to sleep separately. Antonello simply responded, \"that would be their problem.\" The manager seemed completely unconcerned that with one bed, two girls would be left to fend for themselves on the couch and the floor, despite the fact that one girl in our party was sick. When we brought this up, Antonello sarcastically suggested that we could book the second room on his credit card. Antonello repeatedly lied to us, saying there was nothing he could do until the Security Manager, upon seeing us make a scene in the main lobby, started to book us a superior room with two beds the instant we described the problem. It took us several hours to get to Eugene, who was the first person to treat us like customers, at which point we FINALLY got a room akin to what we had originally reserved. Given that it was already 11:30 P.M, it was clear the room wouldn't have been sold otherwise. It felt demeaning that we had to make a scene to get a room with two beds as originally ordered. The hospitality industry is one that is sensitive, particularly in this type of economy. It didn't seem like it would even remotely be an issue to be accommodated with a second bed (when a second room was entirely unoccupied) after 11:30 at night. We were astounded that the management argued with us, after giving away our original room, and we were appalled. Despite the quality of the room we were given in the end, we would not stay here again to deal with the hotel staff. Don Shindle, you should be ashamed; with management like this, it's no wonder this was the only hotel with vacancy the weekend of the Napa Marathon.

As a happy SPG member, I opted to spend 10,000 points per night for a couple nights at this brand new hotel, and it was certainly worth it. The only real problem we had was with the check-in process, and that was extremely frustrating. Other than that, there are some teething problems, without question, but they'll get them worked out and this place will be a steal if you're using points. Before we arrived, I called the hotel to see if we could use more points to reserve a suite. The agent was very nice and said that since it was our mini-honeymoon and I was SPG Gold, they'd give us a guaranteed upgrade to a suite without an extra charge. Great start. We arrived at about 2p exhausted from our wedding weekend and gave our car to the valet (it's complimentary). We walked in to find ourselves in a line about 15 people deep. Apparently a group of people have arrived just before us. Now since I was SPG Gold, I tried to find a dedicated check-in line to use, but I was told that everyone in front of me was also SPG. Yeah, right. During this time, Brett the bellhop did his best to keep us happy, and he deserves a lot of credit (as I saw in another review here). In fact, the bell staff was excellent in general. But we were barely moving toward the desk, and it appeared that none of the people in front of us were in rooms that were ready. So, I'm not sure what took so long. I also noticed as we got closer that very few of the people were SPG members, because the person at the desk kept trying to sign people up for it. That made me very angry, and I was not happy when I finally made it to the front of the line maybe 20+ minutes after we got there. We were checked in by the manager on duty and she did not apologize once. She also said our room wasn't ready and there was no other room available for us to have instead. This was despite the fact that the bell staff had mentioned that they weren't expecting to be that full on this Sunday night. We were told to come back in an hour and a half, a good 45 minutes past the check-in time. After this experience, our stay only got better. When we returned to see if our room was ready, there must have been a shift change, and the new person at the desk apologized profusely for our room not being ready. That's what the manager should have done in the first place. The bell staff delivered our bags promptly to our room. The room itself was very nice and of course, brand new. It was a one bedroom suite with very high ceilings, a kitchen, and flat screen TVs in both rooms. The master bath had a separate shower and tub and there was also another bathroom in the entry way. At this point, all we wanted to do was lay down, watch a movie, and sleep. Of course, as mentioned before, there is no on-demand system for movies here despite the fact that the TV remote has buttons for it. That was annoying, so we called the desk and asked about dinner. The concierge was very helpful and suggested a couple options of places we could order from. We decided to go to the concierge to see the menus, and she offered to have the hotel car take us to pick it up. We asked about movies, and she apologized while telling us where the Hollywood Video was if we wanted to rent. (There's an XBOX 360 in the room on which you can play DVDs.) So, we went out, grabbed a couple movies and some food and slept well. The next day, the TVs started to pixelate on the HD channels and those channels were effectively unwatchable. That never ended up getting fixed, but we didn't bother trying. We did use the free wi-fi which was nice, but it was extremely slow to the point where we gave up. Oddly, a bellboy came to the room with a card and bottle of champagne saying it was from the hotel when in fact it was from my parents. Kind of strange, but I suppose it's easy enough for him to have been confused. We didn't use the fitness center, but we did use the pool. As noted, the surprisingly large jacuzzi was warm at best but not worth staying for very long. My wife forgot a rubber band for her hair, so I called to see if they had one. Instead of offering to find one, they just said they didn't. Then a bellboy arrived with some very thick standard rubber bands saying that it was the best they could find. That was a nice effort, and since this isn't exactly a Ritz or Four Seasons, I wouldn't have expected more. When we checked out, everyone was again very nice, and the bell staff we had seen originally were very careful to congratulate us, including the concierge who went out of her way to say goodbye.

The flat screen television in our room was broken; it kept freezing in mid-program. A maintenance worker came and replaced a computer chip in the tv. We asked him to activate the On Demand system and he instead instructed us on the proper use of the remote control. We asked him to check to make sure it was working. Once he confirmed that there was no On Demand service, he made a call and then informed us that the On Demand system was not working hotel-wide. We returned from dinner, switched on our \"fixed\" tv, and found that it was still not funcional. We were moved to a new room at 8:15PM.

It was a good thing the new room was a suite, because only 1 of the 2 televisions was working. The tv in the bedroom was totally dead... so much for watching tv from the comfort of a Heavenly Bed.

The woman that answered the room service line took the order without hesitation. About 5 minutes later she called our room confused and asked where I had seen mention of the desserts I'd ordered. After correcting my pronunciation of the hotel restaurant, the woman confirmed my order. There were at least 2 other instances of the staff's lack of training. In both of the other cases the staff guessed at the responses to our questions rather than checking with someone to make sure they were correct.
