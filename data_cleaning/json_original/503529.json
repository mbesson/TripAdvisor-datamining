Also, be prepared to drag your luggage up multiple levels of stairs. They have a very small service elevator. I honestly wouldn't get in the thing, it looked very unstable. You have no other choice then to carry your luggage up stairs, and the first floor of rooms is 3 floors up. You have a long way up, especially when dragging luggage. The room was clean, but that was the only thing is had going for it. We had a 2 bed room, and it was very small. There was an AC unit above the door, but it didn't work, and none of the staff spoke English, and they couldn't get it either. The window was broken, and looked out to other apartments.

Our room had a bathroom which was clean, but many of the rooms shared the bathroom. Two twin beds were flanked by 1950's end tables on bare floors.

My screaming brought no other attention and upon emailing the hotel about this incident, they did nothing. The response I got was essentially that they are sorry that happened to me but that there is absolutely nothing they could do. They eventually stopped emailing me back all together. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone of my friends or family members. On a side note, the rooms are a little pricey for what you get.

As a budget hotel it provided us with very clean en-suite accommodation, air conditioning (which was very welcome) and a lift, which although a bit shaky, saved us walking up several flights of stairs. Breakfast, as others have written, was a little odd, but the hotel is so close to the cafes of the La Rambla and the wonderful market of de la Bouqueria, a more substantial breakfast can easily be found. Would definitely recommend this hotel for its location, price, cleanliness. If you can look past the scaffolding, the thinness of the walls and the graffitti on the street (which is endemic in Barcelona) you should enjoy your stay.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location but that's all Aneto has going for it!!!\u201d", "Author": "SJ_likes_to_travel", "ReviewID": "UR37339760", "Content": "I stayed at Hoetl Aneto with my friend for a long weekend in the last week of July. We arrived at the hotel only to find that the entire building covered in scaffolding. The hotel doesn't actually occupy the entire building just one floor in a building that houses apartments and businesses, which for me was a little odd. The room was small but I must say it was clean however there was no real window. our room looked on to more a brick wall and was blocked in so we had no fresh air and could only rely on the air con. There were not even any windows in the corridor of the hotel so once you entered it we could not see outside at all!! The breakfast is ridiculous, its just some dry cakes in packets and a vending machine that you have to buy coffee from yourself!! Plus they turn it off at 11am. The staff which consisted of two blokes that alternated on a desk were indifferent. Not particularly helpful, but not rude either. I know you get what you pay for and this is a really cheap hotel. If you are going to stay here then make sure you only come back late at night and preferably when you are drunk! On the positive, the location is fantastic.....We hardly took the metro at all.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "robyness", "ReviewID": "UR35322973", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel Aneto in April for 5 nights and found the hotel to be great.

All that said, our room, when we eventually got to it, was both comfortable and spotlessly clean. The air conditioning and heating systems worked well and our en-suite bathroom was spacious and well-equipped. If earth-shattering noise and loud, animated, interminable conversations right outside your bedroom door in the small hours are not your cup of tea, then the Aneto is not the place for you. In 30+ years of staying in hotels, I have only once been to somewhere nioisier than the Aneto. However, the hotel does have the merit of being smack in the centre of Barcelona, with all the sights easily accessible on foot. It is also inexpensive and everything considered, reasonable value for money for a short stay. Would we return to the Aneto or recommend it to others? Certainly not, even if we were paid to do so.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice\u201d", "Author": "Strumfica", "ReviewID": "UR24255721", "Content": "We staid at this hotel for 5 nights and it was a very pleasant experience.

We didn't had problems with the heat in the rooms by night, it was very warm. The location is perfect, you can get to any central part of the city or shopping area by foot. Also the subway is very close. A nice detail is the Boqueria market where you can buy fresh fruits and juice in the morning for breakfast at very good prices. The only part not so good with the hotel is that you can hear every move from the hotel and street. This is a problem that I've heard it exists in all the old buildings near Rambla. So if you have problems sleeping , I would recommend to choose a hotel in a new building with good isolation. But if you don't have problems waking up at 8 am and you only want a clean, nice place to sleep at night this is the perfect choice for a great budget.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Aneto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d503529-Reviews-Hotel_Aneto-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$86 - $142*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carme 38</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "503529", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/76/aa/aneto-hotel.jpg"}}
