The hotel was in a great location. It is right in the heart of Old Montreal. The hotel entrance front is right on Rue Saint Jean Baptiste. But the road is small and, when driving, it can look like ally way. It should be no problem with a GPS. The hotel has parking right there so just leave your keys and the front desk when you check in and the valet will park it for you (it is the same cost as parking it yourself). Because of the location we just parked the car there all weekend, they do have in and out service. During our stay we either walked around the Old Montreal or used the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Metro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The closest entrance to the Metro (Place-d'Armes Stattion) is about .3 miles away and really an easy walk. The metro is very easy to use and you can buy and 1 or 3 day passes. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a 2 day pass but the three day is the same cost. With the metro you can get to all the major attractions and areas. As a example we used it to go to St Joesph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Rue St Cathernine, the underground city , Little Italy and even St Helen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s island. Now there is some healthy walking involved but compared to finding a place, parking and paying for parking this is very convenient and less of a hassle. Also from the hotel it is an easy walk around all of Old Montreal and fairly close to the Notre Dame Cathedral. The hotel itself was decent not bad not great. the rooms were clean and had a microwave, a kitchenette with a counter, sink and cabinet. The only real negative was the layout was a little odd and when we opened the pull out bed it was very tight and hard to get by, and the bed wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as comfortable compared to other Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s I have stayed at. The hotel offers complementary breakfast which has your standard, cereal, waffles, yogurts, breads and frits.

Compared to New York prices, it was a relative bargain, as our rate included parking (often not included in Montreal and expensive at $20 and up per night), free breakfast, and a $25 gas card (which they ran out of so refunded us the money). We booked a one bedroom suite, which was spacious, with a kitchenette, bedroom, and living room, as well as a couple of large closets. Our room was basic but comfortable, with the usual comfy Marriott bed. Check-in was friendly and efficient, and the desk staff were extremely helpful at answering our questions about how to navigate the Metro and other questions about the area. The location is what makes this place special. Located in the heart of the old port area (Old Montreal), the Springhill Suites affords access to the quaint cobblestoned streets of the old district as well as being within a short walking distance of Chinatown, Rue St. Catherine, the mall, and various Metro stops. Because many shopkeepers take the week between Xmas and New Year's off, we did find that the dining and shopping in Old Montreal were quite limited, but we managed to find a really great breakfast joint (Le Gros Jambon) nearby. Delicious food in a funky diner-style eatery; reasonable and unexpectedly gourmet! We took the metro across town (on the north side of Mont Royal) to eat at Le Petit Italien on the recommendation of a chef friend originally from Montreal--it's worth the trip on the easy-to-navigate Metro! Back to the hotel, where we kicked back with some wine and rang in the New Year. The hotel is nicely soundproofed, so we didn't hear much in the way of festivities (other than a seemingly HUGE--from the sound of them--mob of revelers in the street after the fireworks displays; no amount of soundproofing could keep their merriment out!)

I had requested a high floor and the king suite with balcony. Our room was on the fifth floor with a view of the office building across the street. The balcony was shared with the room next door and by our fourth night we could no longer access the balcony as the handle would not work. My husband reported this to the front desk the next morning, and by the time of our check out this was still not addressed. Overall, the suite was small. It's basically one room with a 3/4 wall to separate the location of the sofa and the bed. There's a desk and a counter with sink and small dorm size fridge and microwave. There's essentially enough space for two people, although six of us did manage to cram into the living area one afternoon by using the balcony chairs and promising not to move. The location is excellent, within walking distance to everything in Old Montreal. We did enjoy the valet parking and since we drove our crew around the city, it was easy to have the car brought to the front for each trip out. Breakfast is pretty good, too. Most days had scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, croissants, dry cereal and fruit. Some days had a tremendous number of guests and the tables were full, and other days were much quieter. We used the whirlpool and pool (very small but good for relaxing)a few times, and both were clean. I do have to agree with another writer with regard to assistance with luggage by the staff. At no point in time did anyone ask if we required assistance, which is unusual for the better chains, however, when we had questions on touring the city they were helpful. Old Montreal is quite the tourist trap with restaurants serving ok food and the shops being mostly tourist traps (too many souvenir shops). We would recommend going to Ste. Denis to see the real Montreal. Wonderful shops, restaurants (Rockaberry - best slice of apple pie) and overall view of life in the city. Driving in the city was much easier than expected, they do a terrific job of posting street signs at every intersection.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "like2travel1", "ReviewID": "UR119046992", "Content": "My wife and I spent three nights here, as tourists, and everything was excellent.

GPS directions took me down the quaint side streets directly to the garage parking where the attendant swiftly tended to my car. As requested I was given a quiet room on the 5th floor away from the seemingly busy lower levels where families with children could enjoy the swimming pool facilities. I would recommend requesting the higher floors if this is something you're hoping for.

My room was amply spacious, clean, and equipped with amenities such as microwave and fridge which I took full advantage of. Steps away is a convenience store with everything you may need. The accommodations were both inviting and comfortable and could easily have been for a family or two couples. If you're looking for a fancy lobby bar and entertainment this is not the hotel for you. If however you want to be in the centre of action and go adventure outside for your amusement then this is it. Live music surrounds you be it in one of the wonderful French restaurants indoors or outside on one of the many patios (seasonal of course!).

The hotel staff was very friendly and offered wonderful family-friendly suggestions for dining and activities. The old staircase was beautiful and led up to a dining area for complimentary breakfast--a huge variety of great-tasting hot and cold items. There was also a complimentary business room with several computers for quick internet access. Our upgraded double room was huge and had a bathroom configuration that separated the living from the sleeping space, so it almost seemed like two separate rooms (most SpringHill Suites just have a half-wall divider between the sleeping and lounging areas).

I called the hotel and spoke to housekeeping. The woman knew exactly what I was referring to. She explained that they are all Moms, and as soon as they saw this torn up fabric under the sheets, they KNEW it was a special blankie! The housekeeper took it to her manager and said \"Keep an eye on this, it's special.

We booked a bit late and could not get a room at one of the older known hotels (Les Armes or Auberge de Ville). In hindsight, it couldn't have worked out better. The Marriott was perfectly situated in Old Montreal in the middle of everywhere we wanted to go. I would definitely book here next time, and I hope there will be a next time. We loved Montreal. We got a room with 2 full beds and a sofa. It was going to be a little tight for the 4 of us....until I realized the sofa pulled out into a bed. What joy! Basically 3 beds between the 4 of us. That extra space of having a sofa was great for the kids to hang out on at night and watch TV while my husband and I read over in the other area of the room. There was a very large desk where we parked our laptop and maps, etc. The room also had a nice size fridge, sink and microwave. The bathroom was fine, with a sink and mirror outside of the door, which always works out well so more than 1 person can get ready at a time. Breakfast was included and was very good. Everything from fresh waffles to cereal to muffins to eggs, etc. They would leave styrofoam cups and containers so that guests could take breakfast back to their rooms. It was a great way to start each day before heading out. Breakfast was served until 10, which worked out well for my travel-weary family. The staff was very friendly and spoke English. Parking is right at the hotel. My husband pulled in to drop us off so we could check in, and then he parked the car. We didn't need it again until we left, and then we called the front desk and they had it ready for us in 5 minutes. I rarely give a hotel 5 stars, but I thought it was as good as it gets for what I paid ( I got a great deal on a last minute travel website). My only complaint was that there were no dark drapes on the windows. Only sheer curtains. It was really odd. Not only was it somewhat bright in the room when you went to sleep, but there was an office building very close and facing my room, so we had to get changed in the bathroom. Just a heads up. You may want to bring one of those sleep masks in case the room isn't dark enough for you. I don't know if this is the case with all the rooms, but it was with ours.

We walked all over the place and found it all very doable. Montreal is a beautiful, clean and friendly city and we loved it and would recommend it to one and all. Two things I would note for our return trip to the hotel are to avoid the backroom for breakfast (it is a lonely conference room, meant for a spillover crowd from the ample breakfast and a bother to get to, especially with children); and there are meant to be two TVs in the larger suites.

We arrived in the evening to catch the fireworks festival. I thought the rooms were clean enough and it was good that there was a fridge and microwave in the room. However, there are hardly any services for the leisure traveler. There is no spa or room service available. Breakfast can't even be ordered to your room. Also, there is no one to help you with your luggage. So, don't expect it from this hotel! This is basically a 3 star hotel in a central location. It is true that the location is right in Old Montreal a block away from Saint Paul street where many restaurants and tourist shops are, but the hotel is kind of tucked away on a charmless street which sort of looks like a dark alley, The turn is easy to miss, so make sure you have a good GPS turned on! But, Montreal is a very safe city and we felt comfortable in this area. Also, almost ALL the restaurants around this area close around 10 or 11pm on the weekends, so if you want to go out for late dining or just need a snack in the middle of the night, you're fresh out of luck as the room service is non-existant. There is ONE bar that is open until 2am around the corner and has snacks available until 12:30am which we luckily found after our fireworks festival. I wouldn't stay around this area if you want to party to the wee hours. I think that most people who stay here are early risers to take advantage of Old Montreal sightseeing. The metro is about 5 or 6 blocks away or a 7-10 minute walk, but it is a bit hilly around this area, so you may find it strenuous if you're out of shape. We did not get to use any of the fitness facilities or pool, so can't comment on that. I believe the Internet was free, but not wireless. You would have to basically use the ethernet cable in the room. Also, breakfast is free but CROWDED in the summer/tourist season. Make sure you give yourself an hour to eat or go early because you may have to wait for a place to sit. I suppose you can bring the food to your room, but there is no table really to sit at in your room, except for a small side table. You must pay for parking in their parking garage, which they will valet for you. It's pretty expensive, but you will find you'll have to since Montreal is very European in that you have to walk everywhere or take the Metro around town. No parking lots at every place you go to like in the U.S. burbs :-). Overall, it's a good, basic hotel with no frills or luxuries and close to all that you want to see in Old Montreal.

First, the free wireless internet is restricted to a very small zone which is basically the breakfast area. Drift so much as ten feet and you immediately lose connectivity. Secondly, the cost of parking is ridiculous. The hotel contracts with an adjacent garage and charges $19 valet parking per night.

The hotel was smaller than I thought it would be, as was our \"suite.\" There was a large pullout couch, small refrigerator, one television, two double beds, workstation/desk - and certainly was enough for the four of us on our four night stay. Warning: when the pull out couch is out - it's hard to move from one area of the room to the other, without jumping across the bed itself. The hotel front desk got us tix to see a movie, and were quite helpful on what to see in the area. Breakfast was certainly plentiful with eggs, yogurt, breads, juice, waffles and such - the seating was a problem. With so many people trying to have breakfast before 9:30am - there were many people vying for seats. The staff made the conference room available, but those who immediately got off the elevators didn't know that - if either the front desk or if there was a sign it would have been better organized. The workers certainly were hard at work refilling or replacing during the breakfast rush. The pool was adequate, fine for the kids and I was able to work out while watching them in the pool - a very big plus! The internet at the hotel is \"modem/dsl based\" and I had a problem getting on - that was easily solved by calling the customer service to the company who carries the web capability. They were incredibly helpful and within mins. I was on the computer. This is a small city hotel in an old part of town. The charm of the front desk, accessibility to Old Montreal, the sites certainly do outshine the cramped feeling of the hotel.

It is close to all points of interest in Old Montreal and the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montreal. The hotel itself is probably a good place for families or business travelers who are traveling with their family, since the rooms are fairly large, and the continental brreakfast is included. However, the hotel can use some tender loving care ... the windows are absolutely filthy and really give the place an unseemly character. The carpet in all areas is worn and in need of being replaced, particularly in the room we occupied. This is the first Marriott brand where I was greeted with a towel with holes in it when coming out of the shower. The bedding was on the soft side and the room had nowhere to sit aside from a sofa and a desk chair. An extra chair in the room would have been nice, but would have taken up any extra space. The sink is separate from the bathroom which is nice, but it is a very small and tight area so only one person at a time can use it. The bathroom houses only the tub/shower and toilet which are extremely close together to make room for the door to open. The air conditioning works, however, it is an in-wall style air conditioner/heat system that makes a lot of noise when running. It was not difficult to hear noise from adjoining rooms or when people were out in the hall. Staff is certainly friendly and accommodating. The continental breakfast is adequate, however, the area on the mezzanine where breakfast is served is a bit cramped and gets very crowded during the morning rush. On occasion, it was difficult to find a place to sit. The Metro (subway) and train stations are a bit of a walk and are probably a half mile or so from this hotel. There is a bus, however, the 515 Vieux-Montreal/Vieux-Port that will take you to all the known sites in the area, as well as the Gare-Centrale train station. Buy a Carte autobus/metro or Carte touristique if you will be staying for three days or more. Overall, the hotel is adequate, and the best thing about it, at least in this reviewers opinion, is the location in Old Montreal and free internet access.

And while the weather was rather crummy, the stay at the Marriott was very enjoyable. The Room The room was huge. It was My parents, my sister and myself and while the beds were a double (slightly smaller than a queen) it was still enough space. I think the large sofa was a pull out and we could have slept on that, but there was really no need. We were however charged $30 extra dollars per (extra two) people per night. The room was clean, towels were ample (we asked for 4 more) big screen plasma TV with a substantial amount of English channels. It had many amenities including a working fridge, microwave, coffee peculator and coffee provided as well as a ironing board. The heater worked and you could open the window. All in all it was clean and comfortable. The Food The complimentary continental breakfast was great! I had no doubt mind you. Eggs, muffins, cereal (hot and cold) waffles, toast, sweet bread and hashbrowns. It was plentifull and enjoyable. You could take it up to your room or eat in their restaurant style mezanin. A+ Parking Parking was $20 a night. but well worth it. The parking lot across the street looked very sketchy and after hearing about all of the theft issues I decided to park in the underground parking. Well worth it. I was able to take my car in and out at will and the parking guys were very nice. Location The location was great. It was tucked away in the middle of old Montreal and you can essentially walk anywhere from the hotel. there are countless eclectic french restaurants in the area as well as many familiar chain fast food places.

If you want to make Old Montreal the centerpiece of your Montreal stay, this place is perfectly situated. Exterior blended in locally, but interior was American in style, new & good quality, and very well sound-proofed. I thought the front desk staff were acceptable but not exceptional, as a few verbal exchanges got confusing with them (and it was not a language barrier). But ultimately, the hotel was well-run and of high quality. Supposedly the \"oldest inn in North America - 1754\" is connected to the hotel lobby. We walked through it and it looked old and stately, but we did not have the opportunity to eat there. There is a parking garage connected to the hotel, and we had no issues unlike the other unfortunate poster. The rooms were clean, and were appointed as expected for this class of hotel. A little more drawer space would have been nice, but it was not a big issue. The only problem we had with the hotel was the buffet breakfast. We were there a whole week, so we tried it on a variety of days. Now, we were there during the summer, and based on how crowded the lobby and hallways appeared to be, the hotel seemed to be no more than 50% occupied. Yet, the few times we tried to utilize the breakfast buffet, it was jammed. When the eggs went empty, it took a while for replacement food to be brought out. So, despite the extra cost, we opted for eating out. Eating breakfast American-style in Old Montreal can present its own challenge. Most of the breakfast places simply had croissants, fruit and the like. In the whole of Old Montreal, we only found three places that offered an American-style breakfast. The nicest place for this was in the Le Saint Sulpice hotel, a few blocks away. The other two were nearby, as well, but were more diner quality. When you are here, you are conveniently in the heart of Old Montreal, but on a street which itself is not busy. All of the Old Port, church and museum destinations are only a few blocks in any direction. The coolest thing we did was rent Segways. The Segway rental place is in the Old Port, on the last pier on the north end of the port. We also were there during the long fireworks festival that they have every summer. Again, going out to the pier area on the north end of Old Port will afford you a good view. For dining, there are any number of \"historical\" places besides the place in the hotel lobby that one can eat, such as Gibby's or Restaurant Place St-Paul. Strangely, both my wife and I thought that just about every glass of wine we drank was of poor quality. We thought we would be awash in high quality French wines, but either the Canadian taste in wines is non-existent, or the French ship them all of their low-quality product. As with any touristy area, the food is somewhat overpriced, but there are a fair amount of good-quality places that can be found. One other thing to look out for in Old Montreal is a complete lack of bank ATMs. There were plenty of the fly-by-night ATMs, but no bank ATMs at all - zero. As luck would have it, my bank debit card is very finicky about functioning with the cheap ATMs, so when we ventured out of Old Montreal, we had to cash up at a real ATM. Bottom Line: overall, hotel is of good value, in a good location, and you will get at least what you expect from it, if not more.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cIn the Center of Old Montreal\u201d", "Author": "HollisCross621", "ReviewID": "UR20464542", "Content": "We loved the SpringHill Suites in Old Montreal as the hotel was one of the nicest Marriotts were have stayed at.

I called from NY the next day, and after leaving several messages for the garage, I finally contacted him on his cell phone! Both the garage and the hotel claim no responsibility for the accident. Yet, the hotel is the one that processes the charges for the garage. I asked the garage director for records of the car having been moved out of the garage and still I have received no documentation. I discussed with the hotel manager, Christine Marchand, the situation and she rudely brushed me off by saying she would talk tot he parking garage director and get back to me.

Subways is also 4 blocks away. We called for a large Dominos pie $20. We took a 30 minute horse and buggy ride for $45. I dont think it was worth it.

I was in Montreal for business and the accommodations were perfect. A nice mini-kitchen, a desk to work on, and complimentary Internet access were included en suite. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious. The room was clean and the bathroom was large with a separate shower and tub. My problem was the staff. The problem was so great that everything good about this hotel didn't matter by the time I left. I arrived at the hotel on a Thursday and checked out on Monday. When I arrived I presented my credit card for incidentals. I later learned that the front desk charged the entire room stay on my card. Whenever my company sends me out of town for business, it pre-pays the hotel room through whatever travel agent/travel site it goes through. Well, there was a problem with Orbitz so while they provided a credit card, the room was not, in fact, paid for. My travel manager immediately started working to solve the problem by doing a third-party authorization. Trying to get the hotel desk to handle the third-party authorization was a nightmare. It took almost till the end of my stay to correct the problem. That, however, turned out to be the least of my worries! Sunday morning as I was preparing to leave my room to go to the convention center, someone knocked on my door. I was puzzled as I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door. I was in the bathroom applying my makeup but went to the door to see who was there. There was a strange man at the door. He was not a hotel employee--he was wearing street clothes--no uniform. I asked who he was and what he wanted. He mumbled something in French and I told him he had the wrong room. He then said something else and again I asked him who he was looking for and got another answer in French. Again I told him he had made a mistake. He then switches to English and tells me to open the door again. Again I let him know he's at the wrong room. I walked away from the door, thinking nothing of it and went back to applying my makeup. About a minute later, there's a loud, insistent knock on my door. The man has not gone away. He then begins to beat on the door with his fists, telling me to open the door and that he was tired of joking and this wasn't funny. Stunned, I yell through the door that he has the wrong room, and if he doesn't go away immediately, I will be calling security (at which point I'm already heading to the phone). While I am dialing the front desk, the man starts jiggling the door handle, beating even harder with his fists, and yelling for me to open the door. I'm a woman, and I'm traveling alone, and I'm not easily frightened, but this had me a bit afraid. Here's the good part: I reach the front desk and tell them to send security up immediately as there is a strange man pounding on my door trying to get in. Front desk's response: \"It's probably just housekeeping.\" WHAT???? I cannot tell you my utter shock at that response! As calmly as possible I tell the front desk clerk that it is NOT housekeeping, as I have a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door and housekeeping wears a uniform and does not bang on the door with fists. This idiot at the front desk kept insisting it was housekeeping, and asked me if I knew the person at the door. Finally the clerk, who should have been able to hear the would-be intruder in the background, says he's sending someone up. Well of course the culprit is gone by the time someone arrives--and guess whom they sent up? Not security--a member of housekeeping! I ask the man from housekeeping if he saw anyone who fit the description of the man who was beating on the door. He could barely speak English and said he didn't see anyone. I then ask him to please stick around for about 3 minutes so he can walk me out, as I had to leave for the convention center. He promptly turned around and left! After nervously checking the hallway, I departed my room and promptly went to the front desk and asked for the manager. Of course it was too early for the manager to be in. The front desk clerk wanted to then know how he could help. Checking my anger I let him know that I was not happy with the way things were handled. I called with a serious concern and got brushed off as if I'm too stupid to tell the difference between a hotel employee and a possible assailant. Guess what the front desk clerk said? \"It was a member of housekeeping\". I asked him if members of housekeeping were prone to beating on guests' doors with their fists while shouting. Again, this clerk tells me it was housekeeping, saying a member from housekeeping went to my room. I told him, 'I know, you sent him up to my room AFTER I called to complain that a strange man was trying to gain access to my room\". The front desk just looked at me like I was an idiot and a thorn in his side. Since there was no manager there, I left to take care of my business at the convention center. When I returned later that day, I again asked for the manager. Again, the manager was not in. A different clerk asked if he could help. I explain the situation again. Guess what he said? \"It was probably housekeeping.\" I felt like I was in a twisted Twilight Zone episode. I again asked if housekeeping was prone to such violence--pounding doors with fists, shaking door handles, and shouting. For a moment I thought this guy finally got it, because he apologized. But then he ruined it by saying, \"Things like that don't happen here, Madame, I can assure you it is an isolated incident.\" Well, heck, it only takes ONE isolated incident to wind up raped or murdered! Upon checkout a third clerk asked how my stay was, and I told him. I also let him know I had filled out a comment card (and added three additional sheets of paper to it) detailing my thoughts on the hotel's staff. I then told him that I didn't expect anyone to act on it since no one seemed to give a darn about anything there anyway, but it made me feel better to write it. When I got back to the States, my travel manager heard about my horror story and called the hotel and read them the riot act. I then got a call from the general manager of the hotel who was quite gracious. He apologized for his staff's callous behavior, saying that they should have \"overreacted\" to my concerns and worried about whether they were legitimate later, in other words better safe than sorry. He asked for specifics as to the time(s) my calls and complaints were made so he could identify the employees who didn't treat them seriously and reprimand them. I asked the general manager what the procedure is for incidents such as this, and asked about the security staff. Much to my surprise--they have no security staff!!!! The general manager said they use housekeeping for security issues! While the general manager did everything he could to smooth things over (he took a description of the man and they were going to check security cameras), the entire thing was a fiasco. How do you not have a security staff to protect your guests????? I truly believe a lot of the attitude (condescending, snobbish) I received from the hotel staff had to do with my being an American. I found throughout my entire stay in the city that for the most part, I and other Americans who were attending the convention there were treated quite shabbily. I and another American business associate were treated rudely at the convention center. I had a taxi driver drive around in circles \"trying to find\" a restaurant for which I had given him the address--being that all the street names and signs are in French, he probably figured I didn't notice.

The hosts at the reception area were friendly; bellboy would not even accept a tip. I had asked for a quiet room and received one on the sixth floor. At the same price as many other motel rooms, it was so nice to have a suite that had cozy two-seater couch, desk and chair, mini-bar and sink. The bed, pillows, coverlet were, oh so, comfortable. We did not use the restaurant connected with the hotel, but walked to each of the great restaurants recommended by their staff. We were so pleased not to have to drive anywhere. Since we were only there for a day and a half, did our sightseeing by foot in Old Montreal and by Greyline (shuttle to starting point picks up hotel guests on site) throughout the city.

To begin with, the location is excellent - right in the heart of Vieux Montreal, close to the old port area, Notre Dame Basilica, myriad cafes and restaurants, quaint shops, and a short ten minute walk to the Place d-Armes metro station. We found the hotel itself to be very comfortable, relaxing, and clean. The staff was both friendly and helpful, always greeting us with a pleasant \"bonjour.\" Compared to other hotel venues, the rooms are quite large with a great deal of space, coupled with an oversized bathroom where you can actually move around and not feel cramped. Having a mini kitchen facility in the room that includes a compact refrigerator is a huge bonus as it allows you to keep cold beverages handy should you get thirsty in the middle of the night or while just relaxing in the room. An ice machine is located in the hallway along with a soft drink vending machine. Our room was clean, comfortable, and most important, very quiet. All electronic components (i.e., TV, air conditioning, etc.) functioned properly and the shower had very good pressure. Housekeeping was always completed in a timely manner and a newspaper is delivered to your door in the morning. The expanded continental breakfast included in the rate is excellent (although the orange juice is very watered down). The buffett consisted of the usual variety of cereals, juices, fruits, scrambled eggs, as well as a waffle iron to grill your own waffles. I was impressed that in addition to the usual fare of regular and decaf coffees, the buffett also served several specialty blends such as French Roast, etc. Moreover, styrofoam containers along with plastic eating utensils are provided to take items \"to go\" if you're in a hurry or choose to eat a light breakfast in your room. In summary, we were very impressed with the SpringHill Suites Hotel. Add the money you save (if you can garner a great rate as we did) compared to the rates of the surrounding \"boutique\" hotels in the area and you have a real winner. Unless you're interested or determined to stay in a hotel with a fantastic view, or one that radiates old world charm and character (and of course pay the higher rates that go along with these amenities), I highly recommend staying at the SpringHill Suites.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derry, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at SpringHill Suites!\u201d", "Author": "KittyGal18", "ReviewID": "UR5777383", "Content": "After reading so many wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to stay at SpringHill Suites. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed! The property is located in Old Montreal, on a side street that is right in the middle of everything: Notre Dame Basilica is a couple of blocks down the road, the Metro is a short walk (Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes stop is about 10 minutes away), the Old Port is nearby, as well as tons of restaurants and cute sidewalk cafes, and some souvenir shopping. There is valet parking at the hotel ($18 CAD/night) and I found it to be very convenient to use, and the price is well worth it. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rave enough about the location. Some people had told me that I might be better off staying downtown, and while I certainly enjoyed sightseeing in that area of the city, Old Montreal was much better suited to my tastes. There are cobblestone streets and horse drawn carriages, lots of little streets and squares to explore, complete with street performers, beautiful old buildings, and it is easy to get around. I was on a little romantic vacation with my husband, and this area was terrific. The hotel itself is very nice. Having stayed at other SpringHill locations, I found this one to be a bit more upscale. There is a small exercise room, a small indoor pool, and a small hot tub. There is a spa and restaurant adjacent, although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use either. We did check out the menu for the restaurant/room service, and thought it was a little pricy (we were trying to keep our costs to middle of the road type restaurants). The complimentary breakfast buffet featured scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, sausages, tater tots, make-your-own waffles, yogurt, and assorted fruits and muffins/pastries. The food was not terrific, but certainly adequate. We had a studio king suite, and it included a small kitchen area with a mini-fridge, microwave, and a coffee maker. There was a desk with a phone and lamp, and a couch and armchair with a TV on a dresser. A half wall separated the living area from the sleeping area which had a king bed and a small closet. The bathroom was large, and the sink/mirror was outside of the bathroom, which I always like. The room had a hairdryer. There are no safes in the room, but safety deposit boxes are available at the front desk. Our room was kept very clean. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is on a side street, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a view. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend enough time in the room for this to matter to us at all. The service at the hotel was good. We were checked in by a friendly lady, and each time we entered the lobby we were greeted with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bonjour!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by whoever was working at the time. They also provided us with a very nice map, and excellent pre-typed directions to some area attractions. The housekeeping staff always said hello, and the breakfast staff kept the tables clear and the food stocked. The valets were very helpful, and always got our car right to us. The only negative thing I have to say about my entire experience at the hotel was that one front desk clerk treated me rudely. I saw her be rude to others as well, so maybe she was just having a bad day. Honestly, the kindness and helpfulness of the rest of the staff made me all but forget about it. Overall, my stay here far exceeded my expectations and I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great stay in Old Montreal.
