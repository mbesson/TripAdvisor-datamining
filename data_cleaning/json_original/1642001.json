The hotel was very slick with a clean modern style. The front desk staff were excellent. The lady receptionist with the short dark hair was especially helpful. She was able to recognise the things we might be interested in doing in Berlin and made some great recommendations. Mauer Park flea market was a highlight, as was White trash a quirky restaurant/bar which looks like a Chinese restaurant but serves delicious German style American food with live bands every night we finished the night with first class cocktails at the Odessa bar nearby. Our room at the Cosmo was light, spacious and very clean. I loved the floor to ceiling windows and the view was great too. Not the prettiest area but really captures Berlin's gritty cool. Bathroom was huge! Beds very comfortable I slept like a log. Bar was very small but pleasantly located in the hotel's comfortable lobby area. We had breakfast one morning and it was pretty good too. Location was good right opposite spittelmarkt metro. One tip...if you want to visit the Reichstag new security regulations mean you must register online a few days prior to your visit.

Firstly we had to rearrange from a few weeks before, due to strike action at Berlin airport, which we only found out last minute while queueing at the gate at Manchester airport! The hotel were fantastic - we moved our dates with a cancellation fee of one night's stay, but were offered 3 for 2 nights over Easter so it worked out the same. We were fortunate to be offered an upgrade as well, and I have to say the deluxe room is one of the nicest I have ever stayed in, with two massive windows overlooking the park- lovely to lie on the large, extremely comfortable bed looking out at the snow swirling outside the window. The room is pretty warm so if you prefer cool temperatures make sure you check with reception staff how to operate air conditionning. If, like me, you feel the cold then you'll be very happy, especially in winter / spring months. I really liked the look/ feel - simple, unfussy, luxurious. The location is excellent, easy to get around, close to transport if you don't want to walk. Breakfast served until 2pm - this is such a good idea I don't know why more places don't do this.....plus loads of choice and great coffee. Staff are great, very friendly without being overbearing.

Lots of hanging space, mini bar etc. The bar and the restuarant was very modern, cool music playing in the backbground - just a perfect vibe. The hotel was very relaxed and all the staff super friendly. I just loved the late breakfast until 2pm and the late check out at 2pm. Why can't all hotels operate a more relaxed policy like this.

The twin wash basins were a nice touch, although one was right behind the door. The reception and bar area was rather small, and I am not sure how it would cope if the hotel were full.

The only drawback was that there really wasn't any nearby night life or fun shops for browsing. We did not interact much with the staff, but they secured a taxi for us to Tegel airport on the morning we left. It was on time and had plenty of room for luggage.

The Cosmo to us was WONDERFUL. Especially for those of you who *drive* and really need secure parking, but BOOK YOUR PARKING SPACE AHEAD. They took very good care of our (luxury) slk 350 car and we got a great deal on a Deluxe Room by booking a couple months in advance on Cosmo's own website. Our Deluxe Room at the Cosmo was extremely spacious, & kept very clean. We were in a Deluxe room on the fourth floor with a beautiful view of a lovely park with tall, lush trees, colorful jungle gyms , & very-cared-for lawn and gardens. There were also sleek corporate office buildings and nice residential/private apartment buildings surrounding this park, too--- which gave the perfect Urban Chic setting & concept that the Cosmo Hotel is successfully conveying. Cosmo's Restaurant also faces this same urban park giving the restaurant and breakfast in the morning a wonderful, tranquil view. At the front of the hotel is a big boulevard. That boulevard takes you into very important directions of the city which we found were very strategic. So the hotel IS VERY WELL POSITIONED. Another previous reviewer said that it was not. That was untrue as far as we are concerned, and we stayed there five nights. We actually walked several times to the beautiful Gendarmarkt & Checkpoint Charlie areas and we did ALOT of driving to and from the hotel and found that we were *easily* able to get anywhere and everywhere within HUGE XL BERLIN in a matter of minutes from the Cosmo! It was easy to get to Prenzlauer berg, Kreuzberg districts, and close enough to Tiergarten, Museum Island / Alexander Platz, etc. If you have a good quality, updated navigator, noone should have any problems touring berlin, period. If you are the type that wants to take public transportation, the Cosmo is also near a U-Bahn stop. The bath product amenities were NOT as bad as one previous reviewer described. The fragrance base is Bamboo & Verbena which is a very fresh, \"lemony\" scent & also unisex. Linens & Towels were extremely clean and white & plush, and the bathroom design was very simple, extremely modern with good BRIGHT LIGHTING and high-quality fixtures. (And by the way, don't bring a hairdryer because Cosmo has the best professional grade hairdryer that I have ever seen for courtesy use in a room at ANY hotel in a 4-star category and up!) Thanks Cosmo for that nice little \"extra\"! In the Deluxe bedroom we had a combination Shower/Bathtub which was great. We even tried the 18 euro BIO/Organic Breakfast that was very good, but maybe missing the hot mini sausages, golden brown breakfast potatoes, & cold Champagne mimosas that many hotels at Cosmo's level, do tend to include within their lavish breakfast buffets. The young Cosmo Staff was extremely friendly to us, without being intrusive at all. We really appreciate all of their kindness, all of the help and professionalism that we received from *Tim & Nicco* in particular. Tim also took care of our car and parking, and he understood immediately just how important our vehicle is to us! Tim made sure that his other colleagues who parked our car took extra care of it too! (THANKS, TIM!) There were also two other friendly ladies part of the Cosmo staff at the reception desk: one pretty lady with long blond hair & an equally lovely, petite, brunette who also spoke very good italian & spanish which is so good for any latino guests who may not speak english or german very well. When in Berlin, the Cosmo is a very good hotel for all of the reasons given earlier. We would LOVE to go back there the next time we visit Berlin. We know exactly what they offer and we feel very comfortable there. Please keep up the good work Cosmo! Stay just the way you are and DO NOT CHANGE!

The design of the hotel is interesting and the location is convenient as very close to many venues. However, we experienced several issues that spoiled our week-end. First, the air conditioning was not working and our deluxe room was too warm (above 25\u00b0C). We reported the problem to the staff, initially they blamed us for not being able to use the air conditioning system properly but as we insisted they were forced to admit that the system was not working and that the only solution was to open the window. The hotel being on a very large avenue, opening the window was not an option as too noisy. We asked if we could move to another room. They first offer a smaller room that we declined and finally moved us to another room at the back of the hotel which was less warm and calmer (park view). It is a shame that the alternative room was not offered to us naturally and that we had to beg for it and waste one hour. Overall, the staff is poorly trained and the service provided is not what you expect in a design hotel. Another example, during the breakfast the waitress and then the breakfast manager kept interrupting us claiming that breakfast was not included in our rate. We had to explain that we had already pre-paid for the breakfast and that the problem was in their system. They did not listen to us and kept mentioning that breakfast was not included. It became so embarrassing that we decided to leave and have our breakfast at the Kempinski. Staff has a very limited command of English which does not help. When checking out, we gave our feedback and the staff ensured us that the General Manager will contact us when he returns to apologize for the inconvenience. He never contacted us, that shows how little he cares for the customers.
