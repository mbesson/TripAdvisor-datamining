We had 2 rooms, one standard double the other a suite. The children\u2019s room was spacious with lots of light, 2nd floor (#201) facing the road. We had a suite on the 3rd floor, the room was very spacious, modern clean lines, and very functional, for once the shower was excellent. The only drawback with this room (#302) was its facing the inside walls, and no natural light really, couldn\u2019t see what the weather was like till you stepped outside the hotel. For a short stay not really a problem. Breakfast was adequate, standard continental breakfast (good coffee). Would recommend, good value for money.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geraldton, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFirst class hotel for the budget traveller\u201d", "Author": "brightestspark", "ReviewID": "UR139632930", "Content": "Miguel and his team are friendly, helpful and speak good English. As a new hotel, everything is clean with unique, modern decor. We stayed in a suite which was spacious - the largest room we've stayed in Europe - a bargain for the price. Free in room wifi with a strong signal in our room on the 5th floor - which we accessed by a lift. The location is perfect - easy access to all of Madrid and the airport from Lavapies metro station which is 3 mins walk from the hotel. It's only a 15 minutes walk to Plaza Mayor and many Madrid attractions The breakfast is fresh fruit, crossants/pastries, toast (con tomato or plain), cereals and coffee made to your liking. I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat family run hotel!\u201d", "Author": "vacpilot", "ReviewID": "UR137879912", "Content": "Stayed three nights.

Early checkin if room available was greatly appreciated. Only downside was all glass doors in triple room so privacy impossible.

Very high quality rooms, great staff and amazing value for money. Great location close to Metro stops, trains stations and art museums. We visited in August which was very hot - the rooms had very good airconditioning to recover from the heat and the rooms are very quiet. Staff were very helpful in recommending and booking restaurants. The area around the hotel towards Lavapies have great cafe's and bars and feel much more \"local\" than the more touristy streets in the centre.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Artrip Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d3167750-Reviews-Artrip_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$82 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Valencia, 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "3167750", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/62/9e/629e2e214907f7c089c65cdf9f44ca3c2large.jpg"}}
