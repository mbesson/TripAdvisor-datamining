We did not enjoy our dinner at the hotel as we came in very late always so I can't really give a fair comment on that one. Very kind and helpfull staff everywhere in the hotel.

The hotel is being overhauled AND SHOULD NOT BE OPEN: a. No lobby: There are temporary walls up everywhere with cheap pictures of their other (seemingly nicer) properties. I see that the hotel is major need of some TLC, but the amount of inconvenience to guests warrants the hotel to be closed. b. The pool is closed. They give you a pass to the YMCA - not what I would expect for over $200 a night plus taxes. c. THE DRILLING: Was happening everywhere until around 6:30pm each day - and was LOUD LOUD LOUD!! This was unacceptable for 12 hours a day. d. The Internet, which was spotty, was S$26.00 PER DAY. e. One the on-site restaurants: closed due to construction. I was really disappointed by this hotel and would recommend you avoid it at all costs. I felt ripped off, and we actually were prepared to change hotels our second day if we could've gotten a refund for our second night. I don't normally slam a hotel like this, since I know how hard pleasing so many different types of travelers is. But, I can't say that a traveler from anywhere would be moderately impressed with this property. My recommendation: Check out the Marina Bay Sands (just over S$300 some nights and well worth it); look into the Ritz-Carlton (pretty, seemingly good food); avoid Mandarin Oriental (looks like an NYC Convention hotel, not a standard look/feel for that chain).", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSuper location but check when facilities will be reopened\u201d", "Author": "Buster1980", "ReviewID": "UR101847658", "Content": "We had a 3 night stay at the Rendezvous. We were upgraded to a club room which was small but newly refurbished. The beds are very very hard but they did put another duvet under the sheet when asked. The concierge staff member who took us to our room was fantastic and so helpful but the rest of the staff were efficient and not over friendly. The concierge member who helped us leave was just unhelpful and rude. I asked him to confirm our flight time and terminal and he came back and handed me the Emirates phone number. When I asked if there was a pay phone around I could use, he said no and walked off. I was a little taken aback as all the other hotels we had stayed at would have done this with no problems. The wireless internet was approx SG$18 for 24hrs which is pricey. What we were most disappointed with was once we arrived we were informed that the pool and gym were closed. This was an issue for us as I had purposely booked a venue with a pool as this was the last 3 day stop of a two week beach holiday so we did want a bit of time to just chill by the pool. They did offer a YMCA pool and gym admission and towels to take but this is over two busy roads and the facilities there were just OK. But the location of this hotel was perfect, 2 min from the MRT, bus to attractions out the front (Singapore attraction express or SAex) goes direct to zoos and bird park) and not far to Orchard road and Raffles. The sightseeing bus also stops right outside the hotel. Sentosa is easy with a quick MRT ride to Harbourfront and then catch the monorail from VIVO city shopping centre to the island.

Though location wise its still within the vicinity of Orchard and near an MRT station, but can't be compared to the location of hotels like Meritus wherein when you go down the hotel you're really within Orchard. The hotel itself is clean and everything seems to be in order when we checked-in until we checked out, staff were courteous and friendly but not smiling at all times which I think is part of their culture. Though they extend an extra hand if you need one, like during our last day it rained hard and was soaking wet when we returned to the hotel, since we already checked out they offered us towels and a place to dry up. But one comment I have is that during one breakfast my son was disappointed since the rice they served was spicy (really spicy), hope they consider always having steam rice specially for the kids. Though its nice to taste new food but they should always have the basics specially to those who are not that adventurous in their way of eating.

I found this one for about 500SGD deal for 3 nights. I am familiar with Rendezvous as I mostly stay at Bayview when Im in Singapore. I wasn't expecting a good room as it was like a really cheap price but I was surprised that it's relatively good. It's not the modern ones that you see in new/newly renovated hotels but it's not bad. The bed was big and soft, our room looked out to the small pool. It wasn't LCD TV though but at least you get your news in the morning, you dno't spend the whole day in the hotel anyway. The bathroom is clean although I saw some dark spots in some corners of the shower area and on the ceiling but it's not really that bothersome. In general, it is a good hotel to base at when in Singapore. Our deal didn't include breakfast which is not an issue as across is a 24-hr Kopitiam which for me offers a more \"Singaporean\" food experience. For the regular kaya toast, egg and tea, you only pay 2.50SGD! There's also a 7-11 store next to the Kopitiam where you can buy your mineral water for about 2.50SGD compared to the 9SGD that they charge in the room. Rendezvous' biggest advantage would be its location --- it's at the end of the Orchard Road so it's not busy/noisy. In fact, I really love this part of Singapore. Dhoby Gaut station is only 10-min walk away while on both sides of the hotel are bus stops. One can also easily walk along Bras Basah road all the way to the Esplanade while 2 blocks down Bencoolen would be Sim Lim Square (less than 5 min walk). Little India is just 1SGD away by bus in little less than 5 mins. The earlier mentioned Kopitiam and 7-11 also make Rendezvous a very good place to stay. The hotel staff is also very helpful and very friendly. What I didn't like? well, the 9SGD tab on the mineral water. although most hotels I have stayed in Sin really don't have complimentary water.

This hotel is located near Bras Basah underground station (200 mtrs) on the yellow line and an easy 5 min walk to Dhoby Ghaut on the purple, red and yellow interconnect points. The hotel is situated in an excellent location with many attractions in easy reach including walking to them. Rendezvous to the airport is 30 mins by underground at about $1.40 for a single trip. Important note, the hotel takes a $100 security deposit when you check in. If you pay by credit card, then they swipe and tear up the receipt on departure. If you pay by debit, the take the money back then refund you upon departure. You may loose on the exchange rate so be careful. I did not want to give them cash as I did not want to get $100 back at the end of my trip so they took Australian dollars as I was stopping in Singapore en route to Oz. They took $100 AUD cash and sealed it in an envelope and it goes in a safe. I was able to check and get in my room at 11:30, if you arrive early, you can check in and leave your bags with reception and get into your room later. My room faced off the road so no view but very quiet. Room was air conditioned with a safe in the room, ironing board and iron and clothes hangers. There was a TV and mini bar; the prices are very high so be warned. The shower was in the bath, there was a good range of towels, even an extendable washing line in the bathroom. I never ate at the hotel as the prices were a bit steep so I went out for breakfast and dinner. If you hunt around, you can buy breakfast very cheap. There is a cheap breakfast and lunch place on the corner near the hotel; I would not recommend it to be honest as the quality was pretty poor. It is called Bistro xxx and located at 51 Bras Basah road. The Coffee Club do excellent eggs and smoked salmon for breakfast, accept the one in the lobby area of the hotel which does not serve breakfast. I was never too sure if you can drink the water in the hotel or not, down stairs in the court yard is a little shop that sells bottled water, 1.5 litres for $2.50. The 7/11 around the corner sells the same for $4.50. Be warned, some bottled water is distilled water and not spring water. There is a bar in the court yard of the hotel that does a happy hour from 5-8.30pm, one for one. This seems to be common in Singapore. The hotel put on Chelsea V Liverpool on a big screen in the court yard on a large projector, and to my amazement, around 100 Singaporeans wearing Liverpool shirts turned up to watch the game and have a drink. There was a mix of young and old and It was all very good natured and nice to watch. They are mad on football over there and both Liverpool and Man United are very popular, so you can guarantee that if either is playing, then the game will be showed.

On the first day we all got rooms with 2 single bed, since we were 2 pair plus 1, we asked to be switch to queen size but none was available (not hotel's fault as our agent made a mistake in booking the wrong type of room). The room we got was on the lower floor, equipped with \"this should be in the museum\" TV and old furniture. On 2nd day, we got a room change message from the front desk when we got back to the hotel near midnight. While the other couple's new room TV did not work, our room stink of cigarette smell, we told the front desk and again she said the hotel is full. So we went to our old room and said we would deal with it in the morning. Minutes after we hang up we got a call again (it's midnight) and this time they have a room for us on the upper floor (we were told the hotel is full). So we grab our bags and got up there. It turns out that although they are listed at the same type and pricing, these rooms are recently renovated with LCD TV, modern furniture, colgate toothpaste (lower floor room's toothpaste are un-labeled). However, although the new room is newer, I still find 2 of the lights failed to work and 1 bedside light is loosely hung from the wall... My take on this thing is that although they're priced equally, they would put your in a \"lesser\" room if you're travelling on a package deal (colgate vs. non label, hell, the shampoo even smelled better). I mean, with a vast variety of hotels in the nearby neighborhood and are similarly priced... why should I be bothered this?! my only positive comment about this hotel is that there's a foodcourt right across the street and you won't be disappointed.

At least the carpet in our 6th floor room had been replaced and for the most part the room was fine, if a bit dated. Ask for a room facing the street as the windows are double paned so they aren't too noisy and there is more light and a view if you are higher than the 5th floor.

I was excited to have booked a hotel close to Orchard Rd, the center of the universe in Singapore. But this excitement came crashing down right from the start at the check-in desk. Check in: Perhaps one of the most un-friendliest check-in staff I had ever interacted with. No smiles, no greetings, no welcomes. She asks for IDs, hands you the keys, tells you the check out time and expects you to 'leave'. Asked which way the elevator was and she pointed to another direction without even looking up. Where does she think this is, her own mansion?? Room: Sure, I got the standard room so was not expecting much but seeing a tube TV set looking like it was stolen from an antique shop was just too much. The toilet didn't flush properly. The basin didn't drain properly. The bed was rock hard - I have had better beds at youth hostels in Thailand. Pillows were too high. And to top it all off, my room was not made up when I came back at 11 PM. I was furious to see a messy room so called the operator to have someone make up the room immediately. Some thirty mins later two men came up, asking me \"what the problem was\"??? I told them that the room was not made and then they started cleaning it then, whilst I was in the room, dusting pillows, wiping the basin etc without a word of apology, all the while talking loudly themselves whilst cleaning up. How an earth am I supposed to rest???? (remember, this was at around 11:30 PM). So I went out into the streets at MIDNIGHT, walked over to the nearby 7-11 to get myself a bottle or orange juice, hung around alone for a while and then returned to my room to realize that yes, it was cleaned up but the sheets were not new, neither were the towels or the pillows. They were 'tidied up' but were still dirty (coffee stain from the morning was still there). Enough said about the room. Breakfast: Quite good, no complaints. Pool: Quite good. Morning disaster: Pls let me know if you ever had this happen to you at a so-called \"3+ star property\". I was sound asleep in the morning at around 10:30 AM on the day of my checkout when the doorbell rang. I ignored it and kept on sleeping\u2026 but then the person decided to WALK INTO MY ROOM. And yes, I was not wearing anything. The person came into ask whether I had any laundry????? Still half a sleep, I uttered 'no\u2026..' to which the staff went away. After about 15 minutes, I had another doorbell ring, and to my absolute resentment, this person walked into my room as well. I woke up from my bed and heard this man ask me whether I had any minibar consumption???????? After this I woke up, got showered and dressed fully to storm downstairs to complain. Not only the worst experience at a hotel but one that is humiliating and atrocious. Do they know the first thing on privacy??? Not only will I NEVER return to this property, I am going to do mankind a favor by telling all my fellow travellers to stay away from this place.

It was a great hotel for a stopover, but probably wouldnt have booked for a longer period of time as really is just a standard hotel with not terribly much else to offer. The rooms were nice, although we were given two rooms with single beds in rather than two rooms with king beds, seeing it was two couples travelling. Our room had a view over the street and would have been great if we could have opened the windows, but they were sealed tightly. Our friends had a great view overlooking the swimming pool. The pool area was great, we would go down after we had been out for dinner and sit in the spa and usually we had the whole area to ourselves. During the day we went for a swim, lovely pool, but does get quite busy with families. Also once the sun goes over the pool tends to get a bit cool. The hotel is located really well for shopping on Orchard Road. We would go wandering up there at night through the shops and also for some dinner and found a couple great restaurants along there. We didnt eat at the hotel at all as the buffet breakfast seemed quite pricey, however we did sit in the bar and have a cocktail which was an expensive evening. My husband and his mate had a bourbon and coke, my friend had some sort of cocktail, and I had a Singapore Sling which was more than double the price of any of the other drinks which were already quite expensive. That was the last time we drank there! Overall it was a good experience, nothing to really complain about, but also nothing to rave about. Just a standard hotel which met our needs.

The hotel is well located for the MRT interchange at Dhoby Ghaut. The Cathay Cinemaplex and shopping / eating is nearby, as is the Atrium mall.

All seemed happy with the hotel. The room I had didn't have a view as such but was large enough and more importantly, was clean and comfortable. The facilities on offer were what you would expect from a large hotel catering for business and tourist traffic and the front desk was efficiently run and helpful. The only complaint I had was that the WiFi in my room wasn't working, but this was minor as I had no plans on using it! The breakfast buffet was very good with a large choice of cuisines (Western / Chinese / Malay/Singaporean and Japanese) all of which were very good. The prices are OK for a hotel but as always, I would recommend getting a good B&B rate rather than pay separately. I didn't eat in the hotel in the evenings as there are so many places to try in Singapore so I can't comment about the evening offerings. There is a food court (Kopitam) across the road which is worth a shot - if for nothing else, for cheap large bottles of Tiger beer (SG$5)! The bar in the hotel is quite expensive but does a 2-for-1 happy hour. All in all, I'd recommend it as a good, comfortable base for a stay in Singapore.

Dear ladies and sirs, this is a complaint on the 4 star Hotel Rendezvous in 9 Bras Basah Road. I am not sure who is assigning the stars in Singapore, but may be the Singepore tourism board could forward this to the correct receipient: I have stayed several time already at this hotel and was quite pleased with the service and quality, but with my last stay the following happened: 1) When booking they told me that the deluxe and superior rooms where all booked, so I took the most expensive room category (Plaza Club) for a room rate of 300/350 S$ which is about 50 percent more as the regular rate. The higher rate seemed ok because the have some more amenities...up to now, nothing to complain. 2) What I have received was a room that had not even one star quality. The hotel used to have a smoking floor in the 11th floor. This room has been used by smokers for several years without renovation. In January this year, they had turned the hotel in a non-smoking hotel. So, the room which I have got, was a \"non-smoking room\" which actually was a \"smoking\" room for several years - without any renovation! They had burn marks from cigarettes all over the floor and the smell of smoke and air refreshener was disgusting. When using the hair dryer, you fellt like 10 smokers blowing smoke into your face. I also made pictures of the burn marks - in case you want to see them. So, the bottom line is: This was the room with the highest rate I have ever paid in my whole life for a hotel or motel but also had the poorest quality I have ever seen in my whole life (and I have seen a lot of cheap motels already which always were better than this room) I requested to change the room and once they had availability the moved me to a different room which was really a non-smoking room. My request that they will at least charge the regular rate for that stay in this \"smoking\" room was rejected. I do of course not complain about the staff which was very friendly, but the STB should not allow that hotels are selling such rooms for 350 S$ as a 4* room. The room I was staying in was 1135 and everybody should feel free to check the quality of the room there - nobody would understand why this hotel has been assigned 4 stars. They have already started renovating the 11floor last monday (which shows that there was really a need for that - but of course, this doesnt help me because I had to stay in a room without any renovation for sevaral years) Best regards, Markus Sehr", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane Australia", "Title": "\u201cOK for a night or two\u201d", "Author": "FreqFly", "ReviewID": "UR14354063", "Content": "This hotel is overpriced for the standard of the rooms, the service is just OK but its best feature is the location.

Having been to Singapore a few times I picked this hotel based on its location, price and the reviews previously posted on Tripadvisor. Location: I wanted to be within walking distance of Chinatown, Little India, Orchard Road and Clark Quay and this hotel fitted the bill perfectly. There is not a huge amount in the way of bars and restaurants within the immediate vicinity of the hotel but a 5-minute walk would get you onto Orchard Road or well on your way to Raffles City. There was a bar (called the Public House I think) and a couple of cafes as well as a small shop within the ground floor area of the hotel. I particularly like the bar (I frequented it every night for at least 1 drink) which was open until anytime between midnight and 3:00am depending on the day of the week. Check-in: I had requested an early check-in as I arrived in Singapore at 6:00am after a 13 hour flight. Although the room wasn't ready when I arrived at the hotel at 7:00 am they did get the room ready by 10:00am which I thought was pretty good going considering that the normal check-in time is 2:00pm. The room: The room on the 6th floor and was of a good standard for the price being well maintained and very clean. The bed was huge (super king or larger) and there was good sized LCD television set into the wall. The bathroom was a decent size and also very clean. There were tea making facilities, a minibar and a safe so pretty much everything I needed. Hotel Services: I dodn't really make much use of the services as I was out and about most of the time. The hotel bar, restaurant and swimming pool looked fine although I didn't use any of them. The reception desk staff were very polite and efficient and both check-in and check-out were nice and easy. Special credit goes to the housekeeping staff who kept my room perfectly clean and tidy and who were always really friendly. Value: Not bad for Singapore. Prices have definitely risen in the last couple of years so the \u00a380 per night (+ taxes) was acceptable when compared with other hotels in the city of a similar quality. I arranged a late check-out on my last day and had to pay half the daily room rate for an extra 6 hours use of the room - I thought that this was a bit expensive. Overall: Would I stay there again? Yes, if I wanted to be in that area of the city. If you're looking for a hotel with loads of facilities to keep the kids entertained then this might not be the place but for a good night's sleep at a reasonable price and in a decent location this hotel is well worth considering.

My room is at lower level, faces to the Bras Basah Road. It's a little bit noisy in the night. The room is clean but don't expect various amenties. As another reviewer said, there is NO free bottle water in the room, you have to buy it at nearby convience stores. Broadband internet service are over-priced, you should consider more before connect your laptop. Breakfast buffet is unappealing, for a 4-star hotel, I expect more choices. Food is a little bit over-priced, you can find similar dishes in a Kopitam (food shop) located one-block away (2 mins from the hotel). Except these probelms, this hotel still has its advantages. Location is great, very close to MRT station, food shop, cafes, and many attractions (e.g., Orchard Road, City Hall, Raffles Hotel...etc). Staffs are quite nice and are willing to help customers.

I chose my flight specifically as it arrived around 2.30pm so that I would not have any delays checking in. Within 5 mins of getting out of the taxi I had checked in on the executive floor, been given a brief overview of the facilities, and arrived at my room where the porter was waiting with my bag. The room had plenty of storage (I had clothes for a 3 month trip), an average sized, clean bathroom as well as a proper desk. There was also an armchair to sit at while snacking on the complimentary fruit basket. As a business traveller I was pleased to note that the desk had plenty of power sockets and all were multi region, so I could plug my US laptop in without having to use an adaptor. The internet access was charged at $0.85 a minute, or a maximum charge of $25 for 24 hours. Annoyingly the TV remote control could not be used to turn the TV on or off, and the picture broke up on certain channels, but that was only a minor issue. I didn't have occaision to use any of the hotel's other facilities, such as the pool or restaurants, so cannot advise on those. My only other previous experience of Singapore was a 2 night stopover nearly 2 years ago to the day.

The hotel is in a great location, from the pavement outside you can catch a bus to almost anywhere in southern Singapore, and just a block away is the Dobi Ghaut MTR station.
