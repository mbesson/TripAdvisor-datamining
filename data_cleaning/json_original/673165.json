{"Reviews": [{"Content": "only so-so for me. My stay here last Nov/Dec was okay. Very small pool. Room was sparse but spacious and minimally adequate. Toilet flush required minor repair/replacement and friendly male staff was quick to respond with immediate assistance and a smile.Breakfast for the first morning was complimentary but the quality and quantity of it was pretty much just very average. No buffet spread or colorful tasty treats; just plain white toast with jam and coffee/tea. But female staff here were nice and friendly, no less.Impatient female recep staff weren't as pleasant unfortunately. Left the place with an impression that they were far from being helpful and courteous; a vast contrast from the rest of their hotel counterparts. I will always remember the kind gentleman who picked me up from the airport though - he was exceptionally nice, smiley, friendly, and was definitely the highlight of my stay there.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR688186293", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nessa_11"}, {"Content": "good for young backpackers It's a hostel, not renovated and not very clean, but in a very good central location. We booked online 3 triple room, we wrote to know much about the accomodation and we were asked to upgrade the room (quite 5 times the price we booked) We agreed a price 3 times higher and when we arrived...... we found a room (dirty, small, ugly) with materasses on the floor. We saw they have also good room, but they are few and we understood that they give them to the first guests that come, so pay attention to these not serious people!", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR243592572", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lovina66"}, {"Content": "Some useful trip for BALI tour I personally felt that SAYANG MAHA MERTHA hostel is really ideal for backpackers..I booked this hostel via hostel.Besides its location just within 5 minutes walking distance away from KUTA beach, you can easily find delicious local food at mobile hawker during day time (e.g. Beef or Chicken Rice, Gado-Gado, etc at USD 0.30 only), and of course its price is much more cheaper than hostel main course.. Along the KUTA beach, you can also find a McDonald Restaurant. Surfing Course for beginner also available at the beach.You can easily rent a motorbike outside the hostel, at a reasonable rate (60 000 rupiah only for two days! i.e. less than USD 6..)If you can get a basic transport like motorbike, it's good enough, you can go further to town, DENPASAR...a place where you can try the most famous local food, BABI GULING (sort of like Roast Pork) with rice.Further up will be the Craft Centre, in Sukawati. here, you really have to bargain a lot..You can bargain up to 80% of the original price for certain decorative items.Further up, in PENELOKAN, located an active volcano, Mount Batur...Gorgeous volcanic view there.. with a big and beautiful lake downhill.Last but not least, remember to put on SUNBLOCK all the time.. if not, you will suffer from sunburn, like me.. enjoy!", "Date": "Dec 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR318807183", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Le rapport qualit\u8305/prix est...   showReview(16728276, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR253232521", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L 'avantage de cet hotel est...   showReview(16726524, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR324442240", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d673165-r22725826-Sayang_Maha_Mertha_Hotel-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "673165", "Price": "$19"}}
