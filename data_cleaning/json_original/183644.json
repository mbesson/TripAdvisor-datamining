I have been a resident of the Carman Plaza for all that time in the company of my wife. We both enjoy living here immensely. The Carmana is like having your own apartment in the heart of the city with maid service thrown in! I won't repeat what other reviewers have said about the great location but would be remiss if I didn't mention the staff. The ladies on the front desk and the conciergies are so helpful and a delight to deal with. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. The maids who do the rooms not only do a very good job but they too are so pleasant. Indeed everybody, including the less visible members of the staff, have always been so friendly and helpful. We looked at the \"executive\" suites and the regular ones: we prefer the regular. It is true that the regular suites could not be described as luxurious but they are very comfortable and have everything we need to live here (we do quite a lot of home cooking). The \"executive\" suites have hard-wood floors instead of carpet and are comparitevely noisy and cold. They also have more-modern furnishings which may be aesthetically pleasing but have much less storage space. Probably not a concern for a short-term stay. There are plans to upgrade all the suites which, for us, would be a backward step. But I can't close this review on a down note. The Carmana is a wonderful place to stay at a reasonable price and even after spending two months in Vancouver we would not consider staying anywhere else.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guayaquil, Ecuador", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "marialeonor", "ReviewID": "UR126888417", "Content": "I liked the hotel very much.

We travelled in an extended family group and my husband, 11 year old daughter and I shared a one bedroom suite. Spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds (my daughter's was a sofabed in the living room area and she got into it at 5pm the day we arrived and slept soundly til 7am the next day - even while we cooked and ate around her!) Bathroom does not have a window but that's not unsusual. Floor to ceiling windows everywhere else making it bright and airy and some lovely views through the tall buildings to Grouse Mountain. Some traffic noise at night from the street below but nothing to bother you (I am a light sleeper and noise bothers me greatly!) A huge deli across the road provided us with most of our food for eating in (quite expensive though!). Kitchen fine for cooking most things. Great restaurants right on your doorstep and an off-license just 2 minutes away selling a huge variety of wines (For UK travellers who might not know, alcohol is not sold in supermarkets so don't be put off having to go to an 'offy' - it really is not at all sleazy) Dining room in our suite was a bit of a 'goldfish bowl' - right up against the window and surrounded by glass. However, our other party were in a 2 bed suite with a much larger living area and dining at night with them was easy - we were able to squeeze 7 around their table. Perfect position to meet the shuttle buses a few minutes away to take you up Capilano and Grouse and easy walking distance to the harbour for floatplanes etc. About a 20 minute walk to Stanley Park - which if you do visit, hire some bikes and go around their cycle route - it's great fun and really safe. Plus the aquarium is defintely worth a visit. Beluga whales up so close you could reach out and touch them! Although this suite hotel does not have any restaurant/bar facilities this is not in the least bit problematic. We found we saved vast amounts of time (and money) having breakfast in our suites, and restaurants are moments away for other meals. There are also lots of takeway facilities nearby that will deliver directly to your door. Really friendly staff on the front desk and the bellboy(?) made helpful suggestions about where to eat and get takeaways from. A great base - not too expensive, comparitively, and just what you need - clean, comfortable and modern with excellent wifi to boot. Not luxurious but not 3 star either! No parking which made it a little difficult when we collected our hire cars for onward journey to Jasper, but with military precision we managed to ensure bags and all members of our little group were ready by the kerb and the lovely bell boy helped us again. Would definitely stay there if visiting Vancouver again and definitely recommend for anyone who's visting Vancouver as a holiday maker.

Stayed for a total of 4 nights on the 11th floor. Service staff was efficient and helpful, bellman was very helpful - even guided us through the maze that is the parking complex to where we can park our car! Location: Can't get more convenient than this. It's opposite the Shangri-La Vancouver so that should be an indication of its centrality. Opposite us is Urban Fare, a gourmet (upmarket) market where you can easily obtain breakfast materials (organic!) for use in your kitchenette. There are 2 nice ramen stalls (we're Singaporean Chinese and can certify the ramen to be pretty good!) on either sides of the block, a London Drugs around the block at Robsons, and of course all sorts of cafes and restaurants nearby (we ate at JJ Beans, Earls, etc). For drivers, it's not hard to get onto the main routes to get out of Vancouver towards Whistler, Stanley Park (very nearby), and the Trans Canada highway to the Rockies. Driving from airport took about 30-45 minutes. Parking is convenient and secure - access card is needed to enter the hotel parking area. Room: See photos. The kitchenette is well equipped with dish washer, coffee machine (using capsules), kettle, cooking hob, microwave, full sized fridge. We just stocked up for breakfast from Urban Fare or the 7-11/London Drugs :) The rooms are quiet - double glazed windows, can barely hear the town traffic noise. Spacious living room and bedroom. The room temperature is controlled by a wall panel, and the shower jet is of good strength. Room cleaning is done daily and newspapers delivered daily as well. Rooms are very clean, no problem there whatsoever. TV has quite a number of cable channels to keep the evenings occupied. And.. there are TONS of wall sockets everywhere, for a gadget hog like me (notebook, ipad, camera, phone, etc) this is very useful! Cupboard at entrance to hang your clothes too :) If bored, just look across the street to the posh Shangri-La and gaze with jealousy lol :) Hotel: As previous TAers have pointed out, rooms are accessed by a secure elevator- you need your access card to press your floor, and a key to open the lock. While archaic, I have no issue with this (never had to worry about your room access card going wonky!) The true test for us was that we were actually looking forward to staying at Carmana on our return back to Vancouver after a 2 week trip around the Rockies (where the hotels were not really that comparable to Carmana).

Thanks to fellow TA writers, I was led in the right direction to this affordable (for Vancouver) and spacious hotel. Carmana Plaza is a great spot for people who want to be centrally located to a lot of fun things near Downtown and are not necessarily looking for the \"standard\" hotel experience. Carmana actually was even nicer than we had expected it to be. First off, the hotel staff were very helpful during our entire stay, and the room was both clean and well sized. I knew going in that this was an apartment style hotel, and was pleased to see that they had taken care to provide little details like plates, silverware, etc. I also appreciated that my request to be on the side facing the water was taken into consideration and accommodated (that side faces Alberni, which is also more quiet). As other travelers have said, the grocery store *literally* across the street, Urban Fare, is a nice gourmet shop to bring home some food in case you would like to eat in. There is a separate dining area in the room with a table and chairs to better accommodate meals as well. Carmana Plaza offers a bag check and has gated parking ($15/day) that is key-card access (as are the elevators), which offers an extra sense of security. That being said, we went out at night in the neighborhood and it felt perfectly safe. Also, one note about the parking - you have to enter from an alley that is between Alberni & Robson, and it is underground. Look for the Carmana Plaza sign. I will definitely consider staying at Carmana Plaza the next time I'm in Vancouver.

Most of us were sharing the 2-BR standard suites with 3 or 4 to a suite. While the small bedrooms were tight for 2 people (two single beds, like twin beds), the living space was perfectly adequate and spacious. The balcony was really nice, and I also liked the fact that there were a number of windows you could open, both in the living area and in the bedrooms. Bathrooms were fine, nice, very clean. Kitchen space had everything you need, although the bowls were barely bigger than a paper plate. The Carmana is also a great choice because it is between Robson and Georgia, which are the two main busy streets and Alberni is much quieter with a lot less traffic, particularly at night. There is a wonderful Urban Fare grocery store right across the street (think Canada's version of Whole Foods) where you can groceries, flowers, organics and they have a similar coffee bar and hot food counter like Whole Foods. You can easily walk to the waterfront or convention center in about 10 minutes, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within a very short walk. Lots of coffee places as well close by. I also think the staff was great, very professional, courteous and helpful. Their concierge was also extremely helpful and friendly, with anything we needed including calling taxis. It's about $35 CAD from the airport via taxi (20 mins or so), but the new Canada Line light rail is also about 3 blocks away and a lot cheaper, so if you don't have a lot of luggage it's a great alternative.

The bedroom was well appointed, with a comfy bed, lcd tv mounted on the bedroom wall and ensuite bathroom. The bathroom was average, it was very clean and new so I cannot complain.

The hotel is in the main downtown shopping center, two blocks from most major public transportation lines, walking distance to many attractions, and most importantly, right across from one of the most upscale urban markets we have seen anywhere, called \"Urban Fare.\" The hotel also provides free coffee, tea and bottles of water. The downside is that there is no food within the hotel and all of the help is first generation Asian, do not speak English well, and do not know the city very well, so if you are first-time tourist you are pretty much on your own. Also there is no basic information about the hotel in the room, so you don't find out until you're checking out, for example, that local calls are 50 cents each, and it took us a few days to figure out that the bottled water was free and that there was a laundry room in the hotel. There is also no free wifi or other internet (it's $10 a day), so to use your laptop for free you need to head over to the Blenz coffee bar a few blocks away. In terms of the room layout, the room strangely provides an attached bathroom to the bedroom that has two twin beds. The master bedroom with a queen bed is smaller and has no attached bathroom. Those using the master bedroom must use the bathroom attached to the living room, which is the smaller of the two bathrooms.
