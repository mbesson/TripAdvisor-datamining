The bathroom required a refurb, the bath tub was cracked and patched up with silicone and the tub edges were a bit mouldy. When the shower was in the holder it sprayed the water onto the opposite wall so you would have to hold the shower. The aircon didn\u2019t work in the room and luckily it didn\u2019t take them long to fix. The room has a television and a small fridge which was ideal to store cold drinks. The television has about two English channels and several Asian channels. But you don\u2019t go on holiday to watch television. The breakfast room is on the first floor and once again the area was very clean and tidy. The only complain I had about the breakfast was food range was limited and orientated to Asian food. For dinner we ate out all the time as there was a number of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel; McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Fish and Chippy, Pizza Hut, Chillis and Nando\u2019s. There are two clubs on the ground floor and one on the fourth floor. From reading previous reviews I requested that I wanted a room on the second floor as the clubs can get a bit noisy. The receptionist could be a little proactive - the day before the last day I placed a request with reception to order a taxi to the airport. On the day of checking out I asked if they booked my taxi and they said no, they couldn\u2019t get through and tried several times. We ended up flagging down a taxi from the main road, which took 30mins. They could have told me this a bit earlier as we got a little delayed for checking in at the airport. At the checkout we also found that someone had booked drinks to our room. We said it wasn\u2019t us and the lady at reception was happy to have it removed. Overall I was happy with the hotel and the service. Other tips... There\u2019s a Big Bus Tour that\u2019s similar to the red tourist busses you get in London. We bought our ticket from reception. The tickets are valid for 24 hours and there are two routes, one takes you on the city tour (red route) and the other goes up to the beach passing the Al Burj Arab hotel (blue route). Note that the opening hours for the big bus are 9-5 so it maybe best to use the ticket in one day. At the Gold Souk you will probably get approached by a number of people of asking if you want to buy fake watches, hand bags or DVD\u2019s. We had a browse but didn\u2019t buy anything, they lead you down some back alleys to a room so don\u2019t be alarmed. We booked a car for the day for a bargain price from a shop round the corner. The driving can be a little chaotic at times so bare this in mind if you decide to hire one. The excess on the car was 2000 DHS so it can be costly if you do have an accident. The hotel offers a free parking so leave the keys with the car valet person.

He had to be transferred to their sister hotel in Bur Dubai, causing us to be late for our meeting the next am. The duty manager was adamant that they were not at fault. To make matters worse the next evening a female colleague stopped by for a drink and dinner after our meeting. The same DM was on duty. We were hounded to provide her ID twice, since they didn't like the first one. Their implication was clear to all concerned, including her. Suffice to say that racial profiling was going on. She was highly offended, as were we. Their demeanor changed when they learned her nationality and occupation. Ugh! The GM was never to be found to discuss the situation. Disgusting behavior.
