{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wouldn't go back! We booked our vacation through nolitours, and had a fairly smooth flight to Punta Cana. The checkin was alright, but the receptionist didn't speak english well, which delayed the process. The rooms were nice looking, but not as clean as we would have hoped. Upon arrival, we saw sand in the bathtub, a used bar of soap in the shower, and sand all over the bedroom floor. We understand that the we were vacationing over Christmas time, and there may have been more traffic at the hotel than what the staff are used to seeing, but for a hotel that claims to have 4.5 or 5 star accomodations, you wouldn't expect this. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, the service was outright horrible. We like to tip, but this doesn't appear to impact the quality of service received. We did notice that older couples tended to receive better service though, so some other reviews may find otherwise. We would not suggest using the room service. One evening, my girl friend was sick, so we decided to order room service. It took 4 hours for the food to arrive (following repeated calls to the room service supervisor and reception). There is a nice beach off the resort grounds (about a 10 minute walk east). The beach on the grounds was not very clear and had sea grass and debris. There are also quite a few boats anchored off shore, which limits your ability to explore tha waters. Checkout was terrible. The room where the luggage is stored is not secured; extended checkout was not available (the hotel had been overbooked); the two courtesy rooms that we were sent to were flooded with toilet water and did not have clean towels. After complaining to the staff at the checkout counter, however, we were lucky to have been overheard by the spa receptionist who then offered us a room in which to shower (she remembered us from our stay at the spa earlier in the week). Overall, we were disappointed with the stay. We've been to places in Cuba with lower star ratings that had far better service and were generally better kept.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR987702299", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "CubaLibre11"}, {"Content": "Really Enjoyed Our Stay       Our Room", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR845111587", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Liketotrvl"}, {"Content": "The Full Scoop on the Grand Oasis Bavaro (Cameleon Suites) My fiancee and I returned from the Grand Oasis Bavaro on December 18th with Air Transat/Nolitours. The Cameleon suites are a new section of the Grand Oasis resort with chic rooms, complete with comfortable king size beds, flat screen TVs, marble floors and modern, but small bathrooms. They also have a jacuzzi tub that would be best suited for one person or two, if looking in the same direction toward the tapestry. An advantage of booking with nolitours is exclusive access to a 5 star restaurant with no reservations required (mouth-watering steaks will keep you coming back, and a delicious outdoor BBQ on Tuesdays). As well, a lazy river, an adult pool and hot tub (warm), and a fabulous pool bar. This bar, unlike other larger bars on the resort, will blend your cocktails with fresh bananas and fresh fruit and serve them to you by the pool (rather than the pre-prepared slushy machines other cocktails are dispersed from). Also - take comfort in that all water served at the restaurants are distilled and the icecubes are brought in from the Arctic. No need to fear illness, although you'll need to use a water bottle for brushing your teeth. (These are provided).We found the resort on selloffvacations.com and had Sears price match and purchase the package for us so we could take advantage of their excellent deluxe insurance package. They arranged everything and requested a room high up with an ocean view, which we got. While the check-in was slow (35-40 mins) we were greeted with a mickey of rum and had our bags escorted to our rooms by staff waiting around on the grounds. The food is excellent here - an incredible Italian restaurant, an American grill (don't recommend the chicken wings, but the fajitas are tasty!), a pool-side grill, Windows (a buffet offering themed nights such as Italian or International). I was very worried about the buffet after reading several reviews, but as long as you selective, knowing what your body can and can't handle, you will love it. They put on fabulous breakfasts in the morning with freshly squeezed pineapple, orange and other fruit juices. When you return home, you will go into fresh exotic fruit withdrawl.The pool is fabulous, the beach is stunning and the grounds are kept very well. However - there are SHARKS onland. Staff members will be waiting around the exits of restaurants and will engage you in a conversation about your stay. It's really a ploy to get you to come and learn more about the timeshares. We got sucked in because the Dominican charm was turned up high. We were taken outdoors on a gorgeous patio overlooking the ocean and were brought several pina coladas. I was beginning not to feel well as I had barely touched breakfast and between the sun and the drinks needed to lie down. The manager then became very aggressive and rude towards me and tried to split my fiancee and I up, so that he could sign the papers. For the rest of the trip it became our joke sharks! and we steered clear of clearly marked staff in their beige and white attire. Had we not been so good-spirited about a very ugly sitution I could see why time-share reps and hagglers who continually harass you, would really bother and disturb one's trip. If you make a game of it - and steer clear - this is an excellent location with high quality food, cool wetbars, a fun disco, and a gorgeous beach at a decent price! One more tip - rent a safe for your ID, cell phone and money, tip the maids and you'll feel better leaving your belongings, and if you're nice to the staff who fills your fridge bar daily, they'll hook you up with more water, beer and pop than the daily limit.Finally, if you are going on an excursion or two - you simply must do the Marinarum with is next door to the resort. You will have an all-inclusive drinking and snack excursion in a natural pool/on the boat in the ocean following snorkeling amongst the coral reefs and swimming with sharks and stingrays (docile creatures, but truly an experience!). ALSO - try the zip lines in the mountains. The Nolitours rep will arrange this with the front desk person and have you picked up. There are 10 zip lines, flying over palm trees, in the mountains and the staff are both friendly and professional. One last tip - go to the presentation informing you about everything that goes on at the resort, the day after your arrival. It's very informative and will be helpful.
