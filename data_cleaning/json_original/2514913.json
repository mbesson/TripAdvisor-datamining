The great news is, that while it's tucked away, you can literally walk everywhere from this hotel. And if not, the metro is just a few blocks away. In addition to a beautiful room and great location, the front desk was very helpful in securing dinner reservations and showing us around the area. And the toiletries were Hermes, which is always appreciated. I also thought that for such a luxurious hotel, 190 euro a night was surprisingly reasonable.

One big plus side is the amazingly helpful and friendly concierge - they went out of their way to help us with bookings, suggested great places to visit and were in general really interested in our deals in Paris - especially Laurence that seems to have every number you can imagine in Paris in his mobile phone and is very in touch with the hot spots in town. The only negative side if so is that the hotel is a small boutique set up with a limited number of rooms and even knowing that the staff will do their best to accommodate you - it gets booked quite fast so plan yourself and book in advance as they have very reasonable cancelation policies anyway.

So chic with its halogen spot lights in the ceiling, in front of the mirror, but almost impossible to see your self in said mirror. And the whole height profile -- a make-up mirror set for someone 5'8 at least. Maybe a lot of the male guests need help putting on their mascara. Lighting is the biggest --totally fixable issue. Also --such a cool Alessi phone I wish I could have figured out how to use it! The room we were in needs reading lights, and something to warm up the nighttime coziness other than sconces on the red damask walls.

It's truly beautiful in it's own eclectic way. The reception man who is usually on did the typical grumpy French man act, but was always hilarious and had a twinkle in his eye. He surely did love his vanilla cigarettes. It's tiny when you first walk in, but you go up the elevator which yes, smells like vanilla cigarettes, and you get to your room and they're all different. Wallpaper, beds, floors, bathrooms, carpets, chairs, everything is different! But they are amazing. Ours was split level with a little black carpeted staircase, down to the bed area. Only has a handful of rooms, so not that many people there in the first place. Breakfast was just right, only a couple of tables. Easy, simple meals that you order.

However what we all found disappointing was the lack of atmosphere. There was a small bar, near to the reception but it was totally deserted, unstaffed and uninviting (I imagine had we required a drink the surly receptionist would have had to wander over from behind his desk and get it for us, but it didn't look like he wanted to at all.) This hotel is really quite expensive and promises room service, but on returning from a exhausting day shopping and sight-seeing, and feeling like a snack before going back out for dinner, the same surly receptionist said the kitchen was closed (this was 6.30pm on a saturday night) and the best he could offer was to tell us there was a packet of crisps in our mini-bar, or a supermarket around the corner.

The Hotel suggests using the Filles du Calvaire stop but we didn't do this. As you can expect this hotel is small but terribly cute. Our room was on the fourth floor, the top floor but the elevators only got to the third so we needed to take a steep narrow staircase to our room; thankfully a bellman was available to handle the bags! The room it's self was rather cozy with an angled ceiling wall to add some drama to the look. Included in the room is a safe, television, closet, bathroom without a shower but a modern bath and some decorative lighting. There was no clock so we relied on wake up calls (cute music plays) in the morning. I thought breakfast was included with the room but for the life of me I don't know why.

It's a wonderful hotel, designed by Christian Lacroix and oozing style and character. I was so taken with the Bellechasse, that when I discovered there was another Lacroix designed hotel in my favourite district of Le Marais I truly thought I'd discovered the hotel of my dreams. So maybe my expectations were a little high, but I have to say that in all honesty I was slightly disappointed with Le Petit Moulin. The hotel looks fantastic on the website, but although I chose a superior room, it was nothing particularly special. It was painted a mint green with one wall papered in a floral design. The bathroom was slightly whacky - a riot of patterned tiles, but really nothing too exciting. Compare this with the Bellechasse, where I had men in top hats on the ceiling, crinoline ladies on the walls, snakeskin tiles and a massive rolltop bath in the bedroom swathed in a big velvet curtain, and it was a big let down. I was also felt that for the price and the hype it was poorly appointed. Again, at the Bellechasse there was an ipod station and a DVD player, whereas the Petit Moulin provided no more than a TV. There was an overwhelming air of it all being a bit bog standard, and not at all helped by the unsmiling receptionist who made absolutely no effort to make us feel welcome on our arrival. Maybe if I hadn't stayed at the Bellechasse I wouldn't have felt so disappointed, but I couldn't help but feel that this was Lacroix on a much smaller budget. There was little here that you wouldn't find in any half decent hotel nowadays. The breakfast room was cold and uninviting, whereas every square inch of the Bellechasse's breakfast room was a feast for the eyes. On the plus side the Petit Moulin is in a funky area, great for young people in particular, and apart from the sourfaced receptionist on day one, all the other staff were perfectly friendly. It was very clean and quiet but I'm not sure that I'd stay there again. Only stay here if you really want to stay in Le Marais.

There were 3 of us - including a 9 year old child. We had a deluxe suite which was room 402. It was spacious and the extra bed was a fold away but more than fine. The lift only went to level 3 (we were on level 4) so we had to go the rest of the way up the stairs. No big deal and there was always someone on hand for the bags. Check in was easy - we had arrived straight from Oz and they did their best to get our room as quickly as they could. The room was big with a comfortable bed and was well maintained and serviced. Staff at the front desk were very helpful - some were friendlier than others but all were good at dealing with queries. Breakfast was 15 euros and a lot of food. It is arguable that you can go down the street and get what you need for say 7-8 euros, but it was convenient and you won't leave hungry. The three of us had three lumps of baguette, about 7 croissants/pains au chocolat etc, bowl of fruit salad each, cereal, cheese, yoghurt and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. No hot food if that matters. You could easily load up at brekkie then skip lunch and aim for dinner if you wanted to save some money. The location is in the Marais, which is very cool. You do get a better sense of the \"real\" Paris as you are not bombarded with tourist traps like in other areas. There are loads of restaurants nearby (within say 10 minutes walk) and also close to shops etc. The nearest metro is about 5 minutes walk. The only disappointing thing about this hotel is its room service. Now you might ask why we bothered with room service given the location but we were tired after the trip and didn't feel like going out! Anyway, it starts at 8pm and the menu has two parts to it. For one, you need to order at least 50 euros worth of food for them to deliver it but they don't combine with the part of the menu. I think they organise it via a couple of local resturants. We ordered some food including a sushi plate for two people for 28 euros. We got about 10 pieces of sushi! It was ridiculous! Best not to bother with the room service and make the effort and go out. This is a small groovy hotel (designed by Christian Lacroix) with a very boutique feel. The staff make the effort to remember your name and room number and it's so much more personal than a larger hotel. The location is convenient and we really enjoyed our stay.

I used to be one who prided myself in finding the value option in town, but I just gave up this time. One goes to Paris to enjoy oneself and to be hedonistic, and the hotel is an integral part of this experience. Location The Petit Moulin is in the Marais, near to Republique or Oberkampf stations (for those coming from Gare du Nord). My companion had spent some time in Paris earlier and her favourite area was St. Germain des Pres, but after this trip our favourite is firmly the Marais. Yes it can get unruly and yobbish at night but there are so many lively, young bars in the area as well as trendy clothes shops down Rue Vieille du Temple. Petit Moulin is a 5 minute walk from this world but still away from the craziness at the same time. Room The building is quirky and really quite cool. The reception is warm and personal and we were shown our \"superior\" room within 5 minutes of arriving. Our room, 203, is in the corner on the second floor with two large windows facing the street. It had a blue theme with blue-tiled bathroom, which was a bit too dark at first but really grew on us. The quirkiness extends to the room - light switches that are totally unpredictable, a strange angular shape to the room. However, we had a most restful night's sleep with excellent sound insulation and good shower to wake us up to the beautiful sight of narrow Parisien streets. The lauded Christian Lacroix design is quite distinctive. The furnishings in the room were very well maintained and everything is cleaned perfectly. Given the obvious cost of maintaining the unique items in the room, everything looks impressively clean and new. Only complaint is of a leaky shower door seal that dripped water onto the bathroom floor. Service Quite impeccable. Sure there are not dozens of staff fussing around you, just one very helpful concierge-cum-receptionist who was happy to look up opening times and addresses for us on the internet. Overall This is not a full-service hotel. You're paying good money to stay in a really fun area in a fun place. Pay 100-150 instead and you might end up with a disappointing, grubby hotel on a noisy street (what happened to us last time) or something further out.

The hotel staff even exceeded our requests and expectations with Herculean efforts such as offering to learn how to handtie a bowtie for my husband and cleaning our room after hours the night of the wedding and adorning the room with rose petals to make our first evening as husband and wife that much more special.

It stopped on the 3rd floor, and we had to climb the very narrow staircase to get to the room. (And with all the wonderful wine France has to offer, that could provide for a dangerous late-night situation.) On the other hand, that was part of the charm. Second, the suite didn't have a stand-up shower. It had a European-style tub with hand shower. And there was no shower-curtain or shower-door, so it made for a rather challenging bathing experience (if you're an American used to stand-up showers). All the rooms, I think, are different.

Considering there's hundreds (if not over a thousand hotels in Paris) I found that coincidence to be an absolute sell on this hotel.

Knowing that was our first reaction now, Im ashamed b/c the longer I thought about it and realized how little we were paying, what great service we were getting and how expensive this city is when it comes to hotel rooms, I realized we got this room for an absolute steal! We chose the Hotel du Petit Moulin for our honeymoon stay b/c we wanted to experience Paris in a more romantic and authentic way than the big American/chain hotels could offer, and we got it. The neighborhood the hotel is in is very quiet but only a few blocks from busier avenues (Beaumarchais in one direction, and Rue De Rivoli) in the other. The area is ultra-chic , with hip boutiques lining the streets belonging to up and coming designers. The Place de Vosges, the old Jewish Quarter and the Picasso Museum are all within a few blocks. The Louvre and the Notre Dame were roughly a 30-45 minute walk from here. As for the hotel itself, it is quite small (only about 14 rooms or so) so we received special attention from the various concierges and from the very small but friendly staff. The hotel is built into what was once a bakery. There are charming authentic touches (old french windows and ancient wooden ceiling beams, not to mention the original 'boulangerie' sign above the entryway) , coupled with the high interior design of Christian De LaCroix. Each room is unique. Even if the design in some rooms is not to your taste (and some are quite 'out there'), you can't not appreciate their creativity. The beds were so comfortable (with big down comforters), that siestas were calling to us each day we were there. For roughly $300 US dollars (250 euros) for a superior room, I really dont think you can beat this deal for this caliber of hotel /service (regardless of its small size). My only complaint- the hotel offers breakfast for 15 euros a person which seemed overpriced (considering it consisted of croissants, tea/coffee, fruit salad) but in Paris, what else is new. Also, just a warning- apparently only one room in the hotel has a stand up shower...the rest have tubs.

I got sick my second night there and they were very efficient and accomodating of our requests for such a small hotel with little staff.

Yes, 2 weeks \u2013 we stayed in the one hotel. With the Australian dollar conversion rates, it was a bit steep \u2013 but compared to other hotels in Paris, it was reasonable value. We had a wonderful time. The trip was for our honeymoon and we wanted something memorable. This was certainly the place. We really enjoyed the breakfasts. After the first breakfast, we thought we could find something cheaper elsewhere than 15 euro each \u2013 but the very next day we were back and had breakfast there everyday. I really miss the breakfasts. If you are looking for a cooked breakfast, look elsewhere \u2013 this is pure Parisian heaven. Freshly squeeze OJ, bread, cheese, fruit salad, yoghurt, croissants, chocolate pain and tea. And all served on delightful Villeroy and Boch china. Just superb. And the staff were so friendly. Every morning we\u2019d try out a little more of our French on them! The staff in general were very helpful. We read other reviews complaining about the attitude\u2013 but can\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. They were polite, helpful and prompt. What else could you want? If you want people to fall all over you\u2026maybe you need to go to a big US-style hotel. We only knew phrase-book French, which we always tried first in conversations and then most people would then continue on in English. It\u2019s rude to think you can just start speaking in English and expect everyone to follow suit. The front desk staff were particularly helpful when trying to book restaurants for us. After reading previous reviews, we specifically requested the one room with a shower. We thought that 2 weeks grappling with a hand held shower over a bath might be a pain. But of course, I was yearning for a bath every now and then. Plus our European friends told us that hand-held showers are very Parisian. So I really don\u2019 think it would\u2019ve been a big deal to have been in one of the other rooms. The design of the hotel was just magical. I was concerned from the photos on the website that it may be too over the top for a 2 week stay and that it could almost be \u2018headache-inducing\u2019. But the design was magical. Yes, it was colourful and vibrant but also warn and soothing. Amazing. I guess that is what good design is all about. Our room, I think was relatively sedate, compared to some of the photos of the other rooms. We had the \u2018blue room\u2019. The room was small as expected. If you had an open suitcase on the floor, you have to walk over it. But that was fine. We knew to expect that. The bed was comfy and the linen and towels just lovely and luxurious. Our room was true to the photos on the hotel\u2019s website. The Marias area was great as well. Really enjoyed staying in the there. Some people have commented that it wasn\u2019t in the heart of the Marais. Not sure what they meant by that. We thought it was a good location. Didn\u2019t really have any problem with street noise, either. Maybe one night, but not worth commenting on. We are so happy that we stayed at Hotel du Petit Moulin for our honeymoon. It was such s memorable and distinctive experience. We would definitely recommend this hotel. If you want a distinctive individual Parisian experience, this is the place. If you want something that is more run of the mill and more \u2018what you are used to\u2019, perhaps look elsewhere.", "Date": "December 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel du Petit Moulin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d548458-Reviews-Hotel_du_Petit_Moulin-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$253 - $387*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">29 / 31 rue du Poitou</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75003</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514913", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/65/60/e8/hotel-du-petit-moulin.jpg"}}
