I never got lost. When I purchased some French cheese at an artisans market in the Ramblas and came back to the EuroPark, the staff at the bar on the first floor gave me a knife, fork and napkin to make the snack easier to serve.From making dinner eservations to suggestions when to walk and take the metro, they were so helpful. the location of the hotel is incredible. 3 short blocks to Passieg de Gracia shopping, a 15 minute walk down Catalunya to Las Ramblas and walki g distance to Sagrada Famillia (Gaudi). There is an amazing supermarket and fruit and bread market on the next block on Arago and many restaurants and coffee places in the neighborhood. The Geronia metro stop is a block away and connects one stop up at Plassieg de Gracia which gives you a choice of most routes.

My room was clean with updated bathroom, comfortable bed and pillows, and had a reasonably quiet environment. I liked the toiletries presented in a box complete with a body sponge. It was a nice touch. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. They arranged the taxi and wake-up call for my departure.

Wi-fi is also accessible in the restaurant so convenient if you need to work on your itinerary or emails while having coffee or cocktail drinks. Location: The location is quite tucked in away from Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. However, it is only about a 5-10 min walk to Passeig de Gracia (Rodeo Drive of Barcelona) and Casa Batllo (one of Gaudi's); about 7-10 min. walk to Casa Mila (which is also along Passeig de Gracia), about 10-15 mins. walk to Sagrada de Familia (opposite direction from Passeig de Gracia), and about 15-25 mins walk to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. The area of the hotel felt safe and I was not worried walking back at night to the hotel from Las Ramblas. There's a drugstore right at the corner and a market (smaller version of Boqueria in Las Ramblas) about a block away from the hotel.

The hotel itself is modern and clean, our room was based on the 5th Floor facing onto the busy street but when the window was closed the only noise from outside that could be heard was the frequent ambulance sirens. The breakfast consisted of a good choice of hot and cold food but depending on the time the room could become very busy. Overall the staff were extremely polite and very friendly and the free wi-fi throughout the hotel was a bonus. We chose to get the train in from the airport based on price and location. The T10 ticket can be used on this journey with the cost of a one way journey for 2 people being less than \u20ac2. Based on a previous review when you get off the train at Passeig de Gracia take a left along the platform and head for the Pau Claris exit. An escalator takes you from the platform directly upto street level where you are further down Carrer D'Arago, the street which the hotel is on. It is then only a few blocks down the street.

The hotel is modern, well maintained and the comfortable bedrooms are kept spotlessly clean. The bathrooms are excellent with a good range of toiletries provided and re-stocked daily. We asked for and were given a quiet room at the rear of the hotel. There was no noise whatsoever, but of course there was no view from the bedroom window. If you want a good view, you may need to tolerate the traffic noise from the busy Carrer d\u2019Arago. Despite some previous TripAdvisor reviews, we found the reception staff to be friendly, welcoming, courteous and helpful. The hotel breakfast (around 8 Euro) is an extensive buffet of hot and cold food, with fruits, cakes, meats and cheeses. It is perfect for those who like to \u201cfill up\u201d at breakfast, but anyone who wants only coffee and a pastry may prefer to eat more cheaply at one of the numerous local cafes. For later dining, we enjoyed the \u201cmenu del dia\u201d late lunch and found that the nearby restaurant \u201cO Fiadeiro\u201d (at C Mallorca 334, intersection with Av Diagonal) provided an excellent 3 course meal plus wine for 10.5 Euro. We ate at around 3 pm daily and the restaurant was still full of locals, which is usually a good sign of value for money. For any other food or other purchases, there is a supermarket 2 minutes away from the hotel, housed in the basement of the old Mercat de la Concepcio (out of hotel, turn right along Arago). The hotel is easily reached by train from the airport. Use the RENFRE train to Passeig de Gracia station (25 minutes) and then it is an easy 5/10 minutes walk along Arago to the hotel. If you buy the T10 ticket strip (9.25 Euro) you can use this for travel to and from the airport, which is excellent value at less than 1 Euro per person per journey. Remember to keep one of the 10 T10 journeys on the ticket for the return to the airport. If you buy a separate ticket from the city to the airport, it will cost around 4 Euro per person! We paid a higher B&B rate compared to February 2011, but this seemed to be general in hotels across the city in preparation for a major trade fair the following week, when more than 60,000 delegates were expected.

Breakfast was on the expensive side, but there was everything you could want. It was delicious, filling, and open for a nice long time so you could eat very leisurely. We had dinner there one night, and the food was delicious but the portions were smallish. Turned out to be sufficient - but don't expect a hearty dishful like you get in the US. Hotel had free wireless, and three computers for shared use (one on main floor, two on dining floor that were only avail while restaurant was open). People shared well, and there was usually only a short wait, if at all. We had plenty to research, as we were there to cruise on Concordia - so we ended up having to do a lot of coordination once we found we were not going to be sailing. One of the misleading things that the hotel staff did tell us was that our calls to toll free numbers in the States were free. They were not, and we spent considerable time on hold - being charged nearly $45 at checkout. They said they have no control over the phones, but we had specifically asked about this, so we were not at all happy to have the bill presented to us. We would have purchased phone cards had we received the correct information. If you're going sightseeing, be sure and ask the desk what they have to offer. They had discounts for the bus tours, and maybe some other things we didn't have time to do. So ask. Hotel was great in extending our stay once we found out about the cruise. They even let us book it through internet price at hotels.com, which saved us some money. Beds were comfortable, but on the hard side. I liked it. Interestingly, they were two twins pushed together - so it was nice since I was in the room with my sister. It might not have been as wonderful if I'd been there with my husband. It took me two days to find the stairs - the emergency exit (marked as not to be used except in emergency) is not the only set of stairs as I thought at first.

This is a modest hotel in an excellent location, one block walking distance to Barcelona Metro and 5 blocks walk to Passeig De Gracia (with excellent shopping and restaurants within a 12 block area) and the hotel is 8 blocks/20- minutes walk to Basilica De La Sagrada Familia which is a \u201cmust see\u201d in Barcelona. The hotel staff is friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful. The guest rooms are on the small side however they are well appointed and very modern with good amenities (in-room safe, free Wi-fi, mini bar, flat screen TV).

The food quality is good at the EUROPARK with breakfast served on the first floor of the hotel in a spacious dining room and good selection of meats, cheeses, breads and breakfast fruits and juices and the dining room staff is very friendly and helpful. My issue with this hotel is how they charge the customer and their rates; we booked on-line about 2 months prior to our departure and booked at 140 Euros (including breakfast) for 3 nights during the week and at 230 Euros (without breakfast) for the night of Dec 31st . When we arrived there, I found out the hotel was selling rooms at $110 Euros during the week (including breakfast) and $170 Euros for the night of December 31st (INCLUDING breakfast) and I was told by the front office manager (a man named Marc) that EUROPARK and all of the other 8 Nunez Navarro Hotels throughout Barcelona post higher rates on-line and for those guests who book rooms on-line they cannot offer lower rates and the customer is stuck with those higher rates. I felt totally ripped off by this hotel and will never stay there again. My suggestion is if you are planning to visit Barcelona- Spain and are considering staying in one of the Nunez Navarro Hotels (including the EUROPARK) to look on-line and see what rates they are offering for your travel dates and then call the hotel directly and strike your best deal with the hotel and avoid getting ripped off as we did.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trieste, Italy", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, close to centre and great value\u201d", "Author": "Enrets", "ReviewID": "UR122647092", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel, close to the historical Paseo de Gracia and its Gaud\u00ec and other art-nouveau buildings (10 mins on foot), to the Sagrada Familia (15 mins on foot), and to the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya and the main shopping area. The Girona subway station is only 2 mins from the hotel (trains taking to historical sites of el Gotic in 5 mins; price of ticket 2 euros).

I booked the hotel through their website back in March and paid roughtly 100 Euros a night. I had rented a car and drove from Madrid and the only pain was trying to find where to park so I could unload my luggage before returning the rental. Once I arrived, check in was easy and the gentleman at the front desk was very kind and helpful. I was \"upgraded\" to room 001 - right behind reception. I think its an upgrade because there was a small patio outside our room. Nice but not needed. The room was impeccable - clean and tastefully decorated. I found the beds to be comfortable and the shower had adequate pressure. Nice towels and I thought the toiletry box (with a toothbrush, comb, shampoo, lotion, razor, showercap, shoe polish rag) to be a nice touch as well. There was a mini bar with the usual - vodka, rum, gin, sodas and water. But I found a little market just around the corner where I bought a bunch of waters and sodas for 3 Euros, so it would be a good alternative to paying higher prices for their drinks. Location is not too far away from Las Ramblas, but you can expect a bit of a walk. It is pretty close to the Passeig de Gracia metro stop which was a convenient way to travel to Parc Guell. One night I stayed in and ordered dinner through room service. I actually found the prices to be pretty good - ordered pasta bolognese and it was 13 Euros. Did not do breakfast and instead would walk to a small coffee shop about 3 blocks away on Arago to have a coffee and croissant. There is a computer in the lobby to check emails.

We really liked the location of the EuroPark. It was about five blocks east of Passieg Gracias and Las Ramblas, the two main walking boulevards of Barcelona, where you could go to shop, or to eat, or to see some Gaudi-desingned houses, or to pick up the Hop-on, Hop-off tourist buses (reviewed elsewhere). The Europark was also about six blocks west of La Sagrada Familia, the stupendous Gaudi-designed church. And the EuroPark was only a block away from the Girona metro (subway)stop, and from there only three or four metro stops (with no line change) away from the Barcelona Old Town with all its interesting museums and sights. The EuroPark was also only one block from a large, modern supermarket, where we bought meat, bread, cheese, and wine so as to limit the number of times we ate out. We stayed on the fifth floor (501) of the EuroPark. The room faced on to an alleyway. As such, it was removed from street noise, but the single window had no view and we had to keep the curtains closed to ensure privacy from the windows in the adjacent building. The room was small, only about 150 square feet (maybe ten feet wide by fifteen feet long) excluding a narrow entrance hallway. The decor was modern and clean, although the queen bed took up almost half the room. The room had a nice flat screen TV with three or four english channels. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows. You could set the thermostat to your preferred room temperature, and the heating/cooling (OK, the cooling) seemed to work well. The room also had a small refrigerator with a minibar. The minibar prices were reasonable, but we just used the refrigerator to store our own food and drink. Our room was cleaned well and promptly every day. The bathroom was interesting. It was fairly large, clean, and relatively new. The bathroom was done up mostly in black tile and dark colors, but because it had facing infinity mirrors and a lot of lighting, it was not dark at all. The tub-shower combination had plenty of hot water and good water pressure, although the shower door did not close all the way (but it closed better than a lot of other European hotels we have stayed at). The sink was large, but there was limited counter space, and the hairdryer worked well. At times, the bathroom did have a somewhat rank odor. This seemed to come and go, although my wife was more sensitive to it than I was. The EuroPark offered a hot breakfast buffet. The clerk told us that the buffet cost did not come with our room, but if we booked it for all four days of our trip we could get a discount from 13 Euros (per person per day) down to 10 Euros, so that is what we did. The buffet was the same every day, with a few hot items (scrambled eggs, bacon, and two types of sausage) and a wide array of cold items, juice, and coffee. The EuroPark also had a small pool up on the eighth floor. It was so small and shallow you really couldn't swim in it, but it felt good to9 get in the water after a long, hot day of touring Barceloona. All-in-all I would recommend the EuroPark as a good value.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood trip\u201d", "Author": "Ryan D", "ReviewID": "UR118455870", "Content": "Nice place and great hotel, the food was ok but the staff was so kind and helpful.

We took train from airport, but first you must ride bus over to T2. Then ride train to Passeig de Gracia stop - about 4 blocks east on D'Arago and you reach the hotel.

Reception was great always greeted you whether you're coming in and out of the hotel and upon check in are very helpful by giving you a map and showing you how to get around the city! Just a heed of warning, if you do not want your room cleaned, be sure to hang the 'do not disturb' sign on your door as we had learnt that after a couple of knocks while we were asleep housekeeping had no qualms in proceeding to open the door! We found it amusing, so we let it pass, and of the 8 nights we stayed there it had only happened once. Mini bar and room service prices are very reasonable, and there is a market about 2 blocks from the hotel where there is also a supermarket and and a 24hour flower market at the back! The metro is also only a few blocks from the hotel, essential when you don't want to walk back from a night out on the la rambla, 8 euros will get you 10 trips, which is worth it!

This was the only negative thing about the Europark hotel. The staff was very nice, so nice that they even upgraded us to a nicer room which was a lovely surprise for us. The rooms are beautiful, very modern. If you like the colors black white and grey you will LOVE the rooms. I will make sure to put a couple of self-made pictures up in this review so you can see for yourself. In the room you will have Wi-Fi access on your laptop, if you don't have a laptop with you you can use one of the computers that the hotel provides. I believe they don't charge for this. The breakfast costs per person about 12 euro which is pretty expensive but you do get access to an all-you-can-eat buffet which includes fruit (strawberries, melon etc.) bacon, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bread (whole wheat, wheat..), milk, freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, sandwich filling (cheese etc.), hot chocolate, tea, coffee........ anything you would like to be on your breakfast plate! The hotel is very clean. The rooms get cleaned everyday. Also the pool looks very clean but I should tell you that the pool isn't really to swim in because it is very shallow, it is rather a pool where you can just cool off from the hot weather. The room has a mini-bar which actually has a couple of not too overpriced drinks and foods so if you are really thirsty and don't have anything to drink it will not be too expensive! There is room-service which I believe is great too (at least the menu looks really nice). The hotel also has a gym but I didn't see it so I can't really say anything about it. I bet it is just as fancy as the rest of the hotel so you won't be disappointed. The location of The Europark is alright but know that it is quite a walk to get from the hotel to the center of Barcelona. It is about a 20minute walk from the hotel to the complete center, by that I mean the shops such as H&M, ZARA and restaurants etc. It is a 10 minute walk to one of the famous sightseeings of Barcelona: the art of Gaudi. The hotel has a supermarket very close which is a decent size to get some necessary groceries. In the same building you will find a little market where they sell beautiful veggies, fruits, fish and meat for nice prices.

By the way there were probably 8 or 10 m80s exploded, not fun when you don't know what's going on.

We had reserved through hotels.com. Initially, our impression of the hotel was very favorable, not least because we had been forced to stay an extra day in Brussels because of a strike that grounded our flight. As soon as we were able, we phoned the EuroPark saying that we would not be able to get there when we planned, but we would be there the next day. The desk clerk did not indicate that we would have to pay for that night, either on the phone or when we finally got there in person: in fact, he had to look up our reservation under the previous night. Both clerks at the desk that evening were extremely helpful and courteous. The room itself was lovely, especially to travelers used to staying in the typical small European hotel. The room was very modern, in a black-and-white color scheme; the bathroom was good-sized with a large shower (no tub), plenty of towels and free personal toiletries. We were also especially pleased by the mini-refrigerator with reasonably-priced drinks and snacks. The hotel also provides computer and printer access, has a small, well-equipped fitness room and a rooftop pool and deck with a great view. The location is also good, in L'Eixample. The room was also reasonably quiet, although sometimes you could hear street traffic on Arago. In all, what's not to like? When we were leaving on our final day, we spoke to the day clerk about our not being there the initial night, and could we have that taken off our bill, please? He said he could not do it; we had paid through hotels.com, and that this was not his business; we had to speak to hotels.com. He refused even to make a note. We might have pursued it further at the time, but our taxi was waiting for our return flight.

The hotel is clearly built within recent years, and has a very modern, minimalist and clean look, which I like. We were greeted by a friendly guy at the reception who spoke English well, and got checked in without a problem. We got a room on the 7th floor (room 705), which was a \"superior\" room. There was a tiny balcony towards the street (Carrer d'Arag\u00f3), and here comes the only big complaint: There was a high amount of noise coming from the street. Traffic in Southern Europe is generally very noisy, due to the high amount of scooters and motorcycles on the streets, and Barcelona was no exception. In fact, I'd say it's about the noisiest city I've been in. The street was a 6-lane, one way street with a high amount of traffic, and roughly every minute, as a nearby street lamp turned green, there's be a loud roar of traffic zooming by. It persisted all through the day and night, even the night from Sunday to Monday it was there on the dot. I was able to sleep through it without a problem (I'm used to city noise from home), but it was a shame that it was unbearable to keep the balcony door open due to the noise. Giving the handle on the balcony door an extra firm turn helped a bit, but a LOT of noise came through still. In conclusion, make sure you ask for a room that is not facing the street if you're staying here! Anyway, to continue with the room. Air conditioning worked flawlessly. Wifi worked flawlessly and was fast - but, it was a 100% public network, so consider this before you enter any sensitive information while connected. The room was clean and matched the modern style of the entrance of the hotel. New furniture of decent quality, big flat-screen TV by the opposite wall of the bed (no English channels though), and plenty of closet space. The bathroom was good. Clean, spaceous, plenty of soap, and a nice shower. One downside was that the lightning in the bathroom was ridiculously hot, it was like standing under one of those heating lamps at outside restaurants and almost made me sweat. Towels were replaced even outside of cleaning hours without a hassle. There was a free safe, which could fit a smaller laptop (my ThinkPad was about an inch too wide to fit). Bed was decent, although quite firm and had the usual crappy foam pillows. Great lightning in the room, except for a slightly buzzing reading lamp (weird). The breakfast buffet was pretty good. It was your standard European hotel breakfast, with bread, cheese, ham, egg, jam, sweet rolls, etc., even mini-donuts :). It was lacking in fresh fruit, but made up for it by having freshly squeezed orange juice, which I love. The hotel is located in a good spot. It's about a 5 minute walk westward to a big street named Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, which has a lot of shops and good places to eat. If you continue down south the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, you'll get to a huge square named Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a, which has an El Corte Ingl\u00e9s (huge department store), plus more stores and cafes, and south of that if the famous La Rambla street (which is rather crappy, but its side streets are good). The hotel is also right next to a metro station, although we didn't use it. We just took a taxi around the city and usually paid 5-7 euros for about 5-10 minutes of driving around. The rooftop pool and sunbathing area was nice, there was always a free chair/sunbed, and plenty of sun all through the day. A bit noisy though, thanks to the mentioned traffic, but there's also a part towards the back of the building, which is more quiet. The pool is only for dipping though, it's barely a meter deep. We had some sandwiches from the room service at one point, which were okay, but nothing special.

I would stay here again. Location: A bit north of the top of La Rambla, which I was actually fine with since La Rambla and the Bari Gotic area are so much more crowded. We were able to easily get to the hotel from the airport by train (straight to the Passeig de Gracia stop) and then a 5-10 minute walk. There are 2 trains near the hotel, one is basically right across the street and can take you directly to the Barri Gotic area (a couple of stops) and also to the beach. The hotel area is very nice, and and very close Passeig de Gracia, which is a popular shopping street, off of which there are any nice restaurants/cafes. We were walking distance to Casa Batllo, La Pedrera and Sagrada Familia. Hotel Room: We booked a standard room and received one on the 1st floor overlooking the street (no street noise to speak of). It was very modern looking and had a nice king bed (comfortable enough, blanket could have been better) as well as a clean, nicely-sized, well-appointed bathroom. Bathroom amenities included the usual kit of shampoo, conditioner, etc. I appreciated that the towels were pretty large vs the tiny ones you sometimes get that barely go around your waist. The room was also equipped with a TV, desk, full-length mirror and closet area. Free wifi service was sometimes in and out, but the front desk gave us a cable to connect to internet, after which we had no problems. Hotel Amenities: Nice lobby with a computer for guests to use. Rooftop pool area was very nice. The pool was too cold for me, but it was a nice area in which to lay out and relax. We didn't get breakfast there so I can't speak to that.

The hotel offers complimentary breakfast for a slightly higher nightly fee. ITS WORTH IT!! It was, by far, the most amazing selection and finely cooked local fare I have ever seen in a hotel breakfast. All fresh local sausage, ham, cheese, bread, smoked bacon, i can go on for ever!

La Rita was lovely and very reasonable. Doesn't open til half 8 and a queue forms very quickly so booking would be a good idea. But Pomarada gets our vote.

There's also a hair dryer in the bathroom so no need to pack one. My only down point is that it's not near any decent bars or cafes that are open late at night. However the room service was so cheap that we came back from a night out and ordered a nice cup of tea and coffee to our room it was cheaper than having it in a cafe. It appears pricey at first, but you can get good rate deals on booking sites. I recommend getting a deal with this hotel which will include breakfast in the price, it will save you money in the long term during your stay.

It was very clean when we arrived and was thoroughly cleaned every day, as you'd expect. All rooms have a TV, a phone and the whole hotel has free wi-fi which seemed quite quick and reliable. We only ate in the restaurant on one occasion and we were the only diners! The food was fine, but we found it much more enjoyable to venture into town and find more of an atmosphere. Two places we enjoyed eating at were Divinus and Pomorada, both on the Passeig de Gracia. The breakfast buffet was excellent - lots of choice and always plenty of food too. The staff at breakfast were excellent and friendly too. Sadly, we found some of the other staff rather stand-offish and lacking in warmth. For example, when we checked out on our final morning, the manager was happy to take payment for the breakfasts and handed back the card without so much as a thankyou, enquiry as to how we enjoyed our stay or good wishes for our journey home.

We had a room on the 7th floor at the side and whilst there was no view I think a room at the front would`ve been too noisy, the room was an excellent size, bigger than other city centre hotel rooms I`ve stayed in, and the bathroom was excellent with a very large shower. Only minor niggle was the heat in the hotel landings and the rooms themselves - not unbearable, and it was particularly hot outside, but perhaps it should be addressed. The breakfast was very good and the service excellent, no queues and the buffet was regularly replenished, a very nice room to eat and relax. The 8th floor terrace was a lovely bonus with comfy seating and a very small swimming pool - an excellent spot to unwind after a busy day sightseeing. Checking in and out was very efficient and all the reception staff knowledgeable and friendly, we were flying out on late evening flights and it was great to have a secure baggage room to leave our cases. We took the city tour bus on a 2 day ticket (30 euros) there are 2 routes of over 2 hours each and as you`re able to hop on and off wherever you want it was definitely the best option, buses leave Catalunya Square every 10 minutes. From April a lot of the popular attractions are open until 8pm which certainly helps to avoid some of the crowds/queues and if you can make the effort, as we did, the Sagrada Familia is possibly best visited around 9am before the coaches arrive!

Barcelona is a great place but sometimes we just wanted to sit and read so we made use of the room service. Ordering was really easy and the food arrived quickly and was really good quality. You can also order coffee's and drinks. There is a mini bar in the room which isnt too expensive (relative to drinks in bars water was 1.80, chocolate 2euro, mini bottle of cava 3.50) and handy if you need a quick drink, there is however a little shop just at the end of the block as you turn left out of the hotel which is very cheap for cans of drinks if you want a drink on your way to an attraction. Cans are 65cents. We walked everywhere from the euro park, to Sagrada Familia, the cathedral and Las Ramblas. It takes about 15mins to the square near the Cathedral which has the most wonderful atmosphere on an evening. We walked round and ate crepes and sweeties most nights. The selection of treats and food is wonderful. The square has side street that lead to las ramblas. If you stay here make sure you visit Dass cafe across the road, amazing coffee (Cafe con leche) and croissant! Coffee, orange juice and two croissants for 6 euros! I would return to the Europark and recommend it to anyone going for a city break in Barcelona.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "switzerland", "Title": "\u201cUnpleasant morning\u201d", "Author": "maplemountain", "ReviewID": "UR98055892", "Content": "I am currently staying at the Europark and I have to say that I'm not super happy with the level of customer service. Its a beautiful hotel with a good location but my interaction with one of the staff members has put a damper on the start to my holidays. I initially made my booking with the Europark for one person and two days ago called say my boyfriend would be joining me for the second night. Over the phone they said it was not a problem and that they would add 10 euros for the second person. When I arrived I again reminded them there would be 2 people the second night. The clerk said it was not a problem as the room was for two people. When I got in the room I noticed it had two single beds. I called the front desk and explained I needed a double bed. I was told they were all full and would have to pay the 40 euros extra for a superior room. I explained I had let them know beforehand there were two people and that it was a little frustrating just know they were letting me a double bed was not possible. The clerk said he would call me back. They called me back and said it was no problem they would give me a bed in the superior room - to pack up my things and move anytime in the morning I was ready. I packed up my things in the morning and went downstairs - the clerk was very rude - evidently knew nothing about the situation and insisted they could just push the two single beds together. I didn't want this as I hate sleeping between the crack of two beds - I find it uncomfortable. After insisting and insisting - they finally moved me to a normal double room.

We wanted somewhere that was within walking distance of the major sights. Previous reviews suggested that the beds were extremely comfortable, and that swung it for us!! The hotel decor is predominantly black and white - walls, sheets, wallpaper, tiles. The impression is of a hotel that has recently been updated. We didn't use the swimming pool on the eighth floor. We didn't eat in the hotel, except the free crisps in the mini-bar. We ate in different restaurants/cafes every day and were never dissapointed - all within walking distances. Because of the great location we were able to walk everywhere we wanted, and didn't use public transport once. All in all we were extremely happy with our stay here, but since we left for Barcelona some poor reviews have appeared on Trip Advisor for EuroPark Hotel. I'm afraid that we have to agree with the surly, unfriendly complaints with regard to the person that checked us in. There was no conversation whatsoever and certainly no eye-contact. This was the only time that we came across the individual concerned, and the younger chap that worked on reception was extremely friendly and helpful. Despite the hotel's assurances that this problem would be addressed, it obviously hasn't . It is a shame that such a rude person is allowed to meet and greet guests, but it wouldn't stop me staying at the hotel in future and I would still recommend it. For anyone wishing to buy a comfortable mattress, our mattress was a King-size FLEX Multielastic and I would definitely recommend it.

It had a handy open wardrobe system with plenty of hanging space and open shelves for suitcases and other travelling paraphenalia - everything could be kept neat and orderly but easily accessible. We had a superior room at the back of the property overlooking a large courtyard. The french doors out to our balcony were well soundproofed - once the heavy drapes were pulled at night, we didnt hear a sound. We had a fantastic night sleep every night during our 5 night stay. Our bathroom was big and beautiful and spotlessly clean. A minor quibble was the less-than-eco-friendly approach to toiletries. Each item seemed to be completely overpackaged (double plastic) and hard to unwrap and since our soap was removed everyday by cleaning staff (quite wasteful), every morning we had an irritating 5 minute battle to open another impossibly packaged bar of soap. The location of the hotel was great for us - 4 blocks from the main drag, in a residential area and near all the Gaudi buildings. Probably not a good location for party animals. Front desk staff were professional and helpful when required to help but not friendly. They rarely smiled or initiated a greeting and only reluctantly returned a \"hola\" if cornered. Cleaning staff were friendly and thorough. As we couldnt get a late checkout on our final day before our flight, we were very impressed with their huge luggage storage room which also had individual safes for valuables and nearby were a couple of big bathrooms for freshening up.

The hotel itself is very modern with spacious rooms, complete with balcony and triple glazing. The one that we were allocated had a 6 foot bed which was very comfortable, writing desk, chairs and 2 built in wardrobes plus 2 drawer units, Sky T.V, aircon and plentiful lighting . The pillows could have been more substantial but there were plenty of them. The safe was free and below was a well stocked fridge with prices that were not out of the way. All doors were very thick and secure which must have added to the soundproofing as we never heard any noise from other guests arriving or leaving. The rooms were very clean as was all of the hotel , which employed an army of cleaners. The bathroom was a good size with walk in shower and a box of toiletries that were renewed each day comprising of soaps, gels, shampoos, comb, shower caps and even a razor. The large mirror was heated to prevent steaming up and hairdryer prominently positioned. Elsewhere in the hotel there was a small pool and sun loungers on the 8th floor. The restaurant and bar on the first, which we never frequented so cannot comment and a free internet service on the ground floor. As this hotel is situated on the Carrer d'arago that is 6 lanes wide you can expect a bit of traffic noise. We were at the front on the sixth floor and at home live where traffic does not pass by. Although we did hear some traffic noise through the night, it was not excessive. Request a rear facing room if you are a really light sleeper. Location On exiting the hotel if you turned left , walked for 2 blocks to Passiege de St John then left again for about 4 blocks to where Carrer de Mallorca and Avinguda Diagonal intersect, continue up Mallorca for 6 blocks you come to Sagrada Familia. Incidently! right on the corner of Mallorca is Marbello Cafe ( I think!) where they do an excellent freshly made English breakfast, fresh orange juice and coffee for 6 Euros. If leaving the hotel and taking a right. Within 1 block is an excellent market with fresh fruit, veg , meat and breads. Walk for 5 blocks you come to Passeig de Gracia, where immediately down to your left and across the street is Gaudi's house, also here is the Metro station. Tip. You can buy a T10 ticket for 8 euros, which entitles you to 10 trips, if there is a party of you, it can be used against each individual rather than buying seperate tickets at 1.40 euros each BEWARE Ensure you don't enter by the ticket gates to the railway as we did, you cannot swap over and it will cost you. The Metro entrance is marked but it is also hidden away to the right beyond the rail entrance. What we were informed by a ticket inspector was. On the metro, one trip means to a place and return. Where on the rail system one trip was only the one way. The next street down from Gracia, is La Ramblas, which stretches right down to the sea, it is a haven for pickpockets as is Sagrada Familia, thankfully the friendly locals went to great lengths to tell us this. Some guests in the hotel had not been so fortunate loosing passports, cards and money. Finally about 4 blocks down right from the hotel on D' Arago is a restaurant called La Rita, it opens at 20:30 hrs. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced hence the queues trying to get a table from 21:00 onwards ( they eat late in Barca. ) A typical 3 course set menu with a glass of wine and a bottle of water is 20 Euros.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable stay.\u201d", "Author": "ginu28", "ReviewID": "UR83075509", "Content": "We stayed in the Europark for two nights, before our Mediterranean cruise.

I just love their stylish, quality hotels. I absolutely felt in love with U232 during my previous visit in Barcelona, and the same thing happend again with Europark... It met all my expectations and even more, making my stay in Barcelona totally great! Booking the room via the hotel\u00b4s own web site went nice and smooth. I had tiny doubts how smooth everything would go when I eventually get to the hotel, bacause of some reviews here telling about their bookings turned out to be nonexisting upon arrival. My doubts were blown away when I recieved a friendly e-mail from the hotel couple of days before my trip reminding me about the booking and wishing me welcome. Such a small, but pleasent gesture. Checking in went ok. I had a room I requested and service was efficient with a hint of smile, but no frills. Though later on I got great service from the front desk, they were very helpful to me with all my questions and tiny troubles. They spoke very good english unlike the room service staff at the time called them... The room was absolutely lovely. Loved the style, loved the view, loved the small details in there. Our room was huge double room with twin beds and balcony. Flat screen tv, safe box, fridge, bathtube, two windows (one to the street Arag\u00f3 and one to the inner court), black and white furnishing, lots of storage space... Everything was neat, clean and fresh. Air-conditioning worked totally fine, maybe some times too effectively. Only downside I can think would be the noice coming from the street. It didn\u00b4t bother me, but maybe for sensitive sleepers it may cause problems, especially if you have a room from bottom floors. There\u00b4s quite a heavy traffic on Carrer d\u00b4Arag\u00f3 in the mornings and daytime and I could heard it pretty well to my 4th floor room. Definitely not a big problem, but if you mind that, maybe request a room from upper floors. Before exploring the neighbourhoods, I thought that the location might be a little far away from all the attractions, but it turned out to be just the opposite! Especially if you don\u00b4t mind walking a bit. By walk, it\u00b4s about 10mins to Sagrada Famil\u00eda and 5mins more to the opposite direction to Passaig de Gracia with Casa Batllo and Casa Mila. Supermarket (Dia%) you can find on Carrer de Girona about 1,5 blocks from the hotel when walking towards Avinguda Diagonal. On your way there you\u00b4ll also pass a bakery and opposite the supermarket there\u00b4s a great shop of vegetables and fruits. Nearest metro stations are Verdaguer (L4 & L5) and Girona (L4). Girona is closer but I suggest not to change line from the others to L4 at Passaig de Gracia station cause otherwise you\u00b4ll end up walking an extremely long, hot and unpleasent tunnel connecting these lines to each others. But anyhow, the hotel is easy to reach from anywhere and the way to Placa de Catalunya and La Ramble is also walkable, about 20-30mins. Overall the accommodation experience here in Hotel Europark was totally recommendable, especially for everybody who likes to walk around the city, visit the sights nearby and appreciate unique looking hotels.

I thought that if I was going to go there, I might as well stay in a decent hotel, so booked myself into Hotel EuroPark, which did not disappoint. Extremely easy to get to from the airport, all you do is buy yourself a 10 journey T10 (\"tay day-oo\") 'targeta' at the train station, which is attached to the airport, jump on and stay on the train until it gets to Passeig de Gracia. Depending on where you exit, you might even get to see your first Gaudi building (Casa Batll\u00f3), which sits almost directly outside the tube station. From Passeig de Gracia it's a 10 min walk along Arago, or try hopping trains to Girona (Line 4) which is only 5 mins away. Upon arrival check-in was smooth - don't forget it's Europe, so they want to see your passport. My room was the smallest on my floor (I could see that from the fire escape floor plan) but as it was only me it felt perfectly snug. The rooms are very clean and I was delighted with the seriously strong power-shower! The mini-bar is reasonably priced and I was tempted to polish off the two mini-bottles of Cava for something ridiculous like \u20ac3! (The crisps were free). The bed was a double and the pillows perfectly plump. The aircon kept me cool during the day and I could open my massive window if I wanted fresh air. There's a proper hairdryer for the girls - it's slightly annoying as it's the type on which you have to keep holding down a little button to keep it going. This can sometimes mean stiff fingers, but a rubber band tied around the button helps with that. On my second day I was given a form warning me of a general strike in two days time and telling me about possible suspended services, which was extremely helpful. There's no iron in the room but if you need one just ring reception and it'll be delivered before you put the phone down. The hotel is very central and it's around a 10-15 min walk to Plaza Catalunya. Everything of interest is a 20 min walk from there. Or use your T10 (which can be used by more than 1 person at a time and all journeys within the first hour count as 1 journey. It works on all forms of transport except buses). Not only is EuroPark close to Casa Batll\u00f3, but Segrada Familia is less than a 10 min stroll, Sant Pere, La Ribera and Barri Gothic (all great for shopping, nightlife and restaurants) are 10 mins below you. La Ramblas is 5 mins away, the Arc de Triomf is about 15 mins and the park below it (highly recommended) is 20. Just jump on the tube at Girona to head straight to Barceloneta for cocktails and sundowners at one of the many \u00dcber chic restaurants along the beach front. A few doors from the hotel is a massive shopping center with a fresh food market and flower stalls etc. And along the side of the center in what looks like a small, sun-soaked alleyway are some authentic restaurants which are well worth a try. The hotel also features a swimming pool, a bar and a restaurant - non of which I sampled as I was too busy doing other stuff. Guests have free internet access (and wifi if I'm not mistaken) and daily Spanish newspapers can be found in the lounge by reception. I booked my trip with Expedia and got a great deal at \u00a3400 odd for my flights and hotel for a week. I highly recommend EuroPark to anyone who wants to treat themselves a little. P.S. My cousins stayed in the Hotel Barcelona Center, a 4 star hotel with a terrace and Jacuzzis, on the cnr of Mallorca and Balmes at a fraction of what my hotel room cost. Good places to eat are plenty, but I can highly recommend the following: Llan Tia c/ Brossoli 5 (just off Argenteria - nrst tube Jaume I) for an excellent 3-course dinner at a fixed price of \u20ac19.50 excl. wine. Drac Cafe in the Parc Ciutadella for inexpensive lunch in an atmospheric outdoor cafe. The Rose by the glass is excellent as is the potato Tortilla! I had the Tortilla, a glass of rose, coffee and two bottles of water for less than \u20ac15. Laie - el plaer de la cultura liberia. This is a bookshop with a restaurant upstairs. There's an excellent 3-course set lunch for around \u20ac13 or go a la carte for around \u20ac22 incl. a half bottle of wine. The cafe at the back of La Boqueria (forget the name but it's about the only one with chairs and tables which is still part of the market.) for the biggest mussels I've ever seen and oh so fresh!

My girlfriend and I spotted a great deal for 5 nights at the hotel, and after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided to book it. We were definately far from disappointed. On entry to the hotel, we weren't greeted overly warmly, and actually thought we had come into contact with a member of the hotel's staff who was criticised by a reviewer on here. As it happened, although he wasn't overly outgoing or friendly, he was more than happy to provide us with suggestions and recommendations for eating out and things to do and see in the city. We took the lift up to our room on the 6th floor and entered the room to find a very modern, sleek and boutique design. We had been left a welcome note with some almond sweets which were encased in a beautiful little bag. A bathrobe and slippers for each of us was also laid out on the bed. The room had a 37\" (or thereabouts) wall-mounted tv which we used after a long day of walking. It also had a balcony which we used to relax and enjoy a glass of Cava in the evenings. The bed, as many have described on here, was huge; really wide, and the pillows were lovely and soft, as well !! The bahroom was modern, clean and stylish, and housed a box of complimentary toilitries, so fear not if you happen to forget your shaving kit or shampoo ! I could continue by writing more about this great hotel. We thought it was superb, and both agreed that our room was worthy of at least a 4-star status !! The staff were helpful and friendly, and the free internet was something that you don't come across too often, and provided good use for both my girlfriend and myself during our visit. Overall, I would very much recommend staying here. It is located well enough to be quiet in the area at night when you need that much-needed rest. So, give it a go. Just don't forget to try some of the sweets that they have at reception while you're there.

I spent most of the holiday quite far down by the beach areas and if you are intending to walk back, then expect for it to take a good 40 min or so, otherwise if you are taking the metro, there's a lot of chop and changing between different lines and this can put a damper on the evening every time.

The rooms are a decent size for two people with modern features. Be sure to ask how to access the english tv channels if you need them as all are in Spanish or dubbed in Spanish. The only downside which didn't end up affecting us hugely was our room was behind the lift. The first night was fine as it was quite late by the time we went to bed but the 2nd night there seemed to be a bit more action and noise from slightly drunk revellers coming back. Other than that it was fine. Everyday we returned to nice airconditioned room and the staff were very helpful and a good bonus with free wi-fi all through the hotel. There's also a pool on the roof with lots of chairs to sunbake or sit in the shade - was quite busy while we were there and felt like we were in Ibiza with the house music that was playing! The cost of the room wasn't as inexpensive as we'd hoped but after looking for hotels in Barcelona and the amount of complaints regarding the noise in hotels on the Ramblas it was an easy choice. It's a little further out of the main streets but doesn't take much time at all to walk to the Passieg de Gracia or you've always got the option of the metro. Overall we had a very pleasant stay at EuroPark and highly recommend it. If you want fabulous Japanese just across the road is a restaurant called Nihon Sakari and it's the best Japanese I have had in a long time. The owner is a very attentive, welcoming sweet guy who understands english so no problems. There's also no real need to pay 13 euro for breakfast if your satisfied with a ham and cheese baguette and a decent coffee con leche (flat white/latte) which cost us about 4 euro each at the cafe next to the Japanese restaurant. I'd definitely advise the Barcelona card for travelling on the metro more for simplicity of moving on and off the metro as often as you like and even though it is pretty cheap to travel it would save you some cash. We got a 3 day pass for 33 euro and it got us anywhere and everywhere we wanted to be. The metro is also a fantastic way to get around and beats any public transport I'm used to in Sydney!

The location of the hotel is within easy walking distance of the train station and it is v easy to catch the train from the airport . I would strongly recommend prebooking the Barcelona travel card online which you then pick up from the airport. It can be used on bus's ,trains,subways and gets discounts at various places. It just makes getting around so much quicker as once you have this ticket you do not have to work out paymets on any of the services that you use.

But, if you want a great sleep on your holiday, Europark was perfect: cool, dark and quiet. - Lovely bathroom with large sink, lots of room for toilet bags etc, strong water pressure in the shower, and loads of amenities, which were replenished each day whether we used them or not. - The ROOFTOP POOL! Yes, it's small and shallow as other people have mentioned, but my god, what more do you want after a hot day wandering around Barca than to have a quick dip in a cool pool as the sun sets, and dry off on one of the outdoor couches, propped up by pillows? If you can't tell, I really LOVED the roof terrace and used it every day! - Free wi-fi, which helped with planning other parts of our stay. Cons (and they are few): - The location. Not bad in itself, but not really where the main action is. I did check the location when booking the hotel, but on my next trip to Barcelona I think I'd like to stay somewhere a bit closer, maybe in El Born. HOWEVER it was easy to get to from the airport (a short walk from Passeig de la Gracia stop, which is on the airport line), and there was a great little supermarket just up the road. - The room service menu was pretty poor. Looked like frozen/convenience food mostly. - There was one guy on reception who was just plain rude. I live in England, I am used to surly service, but he just seems to hate his job, people, and probably life in general. It's a shame because the rest of the staff were great, and we had a really wonderful stay, but the way you're greeted when you enter a hotel is very important. In all (apart from Mr Grumpy on reception), Europark is a great place to stay, and very good value for the price.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice\u201d", "Author": "bristol059", "ReviewID": "UR69942718", "Content": "Very pleased with this hotel.

We stayed for 10 nights in a Superior Room on the 7th floor, with a cozy balcony facing the courtyard. Very quiet! I recommend you do not request a room facing the Arag\u00f3 Street as it is quite noisy. As we checked in, we encountered the first example of poor service. The clerk hardly spoke any English, but that was not the problem. His attitude was like he didn't care, and rolled his eyes sarcastically when discovering we was to stay for 10 nights. In addition he took a long phone call in the middle of us checking in. He didn't tell us the check out time, or anything else of interest, rather than just handing us the key cards. We chose a non-smoking room, although we both smoke. Entering the room, we saw there was a clean ashtray on the balcony table. I rang the reception and asked politely if it was alright if we smoked on the balcony (it IS outside and it had obviously been used to that purpose before). The clerk answered \"oh well, i guess you can\" and sounded like he was doing us a BIG favour, which is funny, since it is the customers who pays his wages. Just to finish the negatives: No one in the reception ever smiles, the cleaners make a fair amount of noise in the morning, and don't EVER order room service...say no more. Over to the good stuff: The room: Spotless clean. It had a nice, fresh scent, and AC you could adjust to temperature. The room had everything one could ask for, even of 4-star hotels. Safe, hairdryer, bath amenities, bath robes, slippers, 32\" TV, fridge with extra room for a couple of your own water bottles, etc. Only Spanish and Catalan channels, but TV is not important when you're in Barcelona in June! There is free wi-fi througout the hotel, but due to the iPhone's bad antenna, we could only get a signal in the bathroom half of our room. No biggie. The \"pool\": On the 8th floor, there is a sun deck and a small pool, brilliant for cooling off. It is no more than 80cm deep, but it's perfect for soothing a sunburned body. One can see from the pictures that this is what you get, so I don't get the one who complains about this. Location: To us, this was probably the best thing about the hotel. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe, but there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars around for your lunchtime meal and breakfasts. Being Gaudi fans, the hotel could not be situated better - right in the middle of Casa Batllo + La Pedrera and La Sagrada Familia. It's a 10 min walk to either of them. Las Ramblas is 15-20 mins, but if you take the Metro (Girona station is literally around the corner from the hotel) and exits at Urquinaona (2 stops), you can walk to the rambla/el raval/barrio gotico in 3 minutes. Brilliant. A couple of tips: Some reviewers have recommended La Rita. This was the worst place we ate in Barcelona! Greasy, cheesy food, pretend gourmet. Go for De Tapa Madre for tapas, Patagonia for steaks, Bar Lobo for breakfast and lunches, Carmelita for dinner and Zoo Bar for Mojitos!", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA good choice in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Pro89", "ReviewID": "UR66850957", "Content": "Booked via Expedia, and was excited about the number of sports facilities near the hotel.

The only downside is that you'll need to search a bit if you want to find a place to eat at night that is closer than Passeig de Gracia (more options surround you during the day). However, one of our favorite nearby restaurants was Bar Mut and is off the nearby Avenue Diagonal. Regardless, it is easy enough to get to different parts of the city - you can follow Passeig de Gracia down to the Barri Gotic, or walk over to the Ramblas, etc - and the Metro is also close.

There's a subway station within 100 m which was great, although the line didn't take you to Plaza Catalunya. Near the subway there's also a big supermarket where you could buy some wine and snacks and of course anything else.

Unfortunately due to illness we were unable to embark the ship and ended up needing to book in for a further 3 nights. Staff were incredibly helpful and when we arrived back from our abortive trip to the Port they readily agreed to give us the same rate we had booked several months back on the internet. Rooms are very comfortable and modern and I would say that comments other reviewers have been made regarding road noise are valid and the need to take heed will depend on whether you are a light sleeper. On our first night we had asked for a quiet room which was exactly what we got - Room 611 at the back of the hotel. On our return we were in Room 104 on the side of the hotel and noise level was noticeably higher but did not keep us awake. Staff are very helpful and everything we needed at reception was readily accomodated with good English spoken. Away from the front desk the staff command of English is less, but you just need to show a little patience in making your needs understood. Small bar is very competitively priced but would benefit from a few more settee type seats and a later closing time than 22.30 but these are very minor points overall. We ate breakfast on the first morning at the inclusive rate and this was very enjoyable and more than enough to set one up for the day. On the other days we ate, as have others, at a little cafe just a couple of doors along the road. This works out cheaper, around 6/7 euros per head if you want a light breakfast but the hotel is competitive if you want a full meal, mindful that hot and cold food, fresh orange juice and coffee etc. are all available for you to help yourself to as much as you want. Location is excellent with cafes. restaurants and a large indoor market very close by. It is a two minute walk to Girona metro station on Line 4 and a 10 minute walk (5 blocks) will take you to Passage de Gracia on Line 3 where you can also pick up the train to the airport.

However the metro will take you there, and the many seafood restaurants, in no more than 10 minutes. Line 4 from Girona and get off at either Barcolenetta or Citadella Villa Olympica.

However Europark gave us a room right away without any charge so we can get some sleep. This is what I call excellent service.

I like the hotel decoration and everything is very well design. My only complain is the noise, which might be a problem only to us. Our room is uniquely located on the first floor right next to the kitchen, and i can hear all the noise and the talking from there. Also our room has a door to the next room--those that are normally locked. From that door we again can hear everything next door from our bed. Taking shower, blow drying hair, everything. I have a feeling that maybe our neighbor opened the door at his/her side. However, I will not go ahead and say this hotel is noisy. Maybe they have to give us a room that they usually try not to give their customer since we arrive at 6 in the morning.

The 'only' downside, was that our room wasn't ready when we arrived around 12pm. I'm unsure as to the usual check in times, but our flight was very early in the morning, and we wanted to just relax for half and hour or so. Having said that, they allowed us to leave our luggage in a room, and we just went on a little walk to pass the time. When i return to Barcelona, without a doubt, i would stay in this hotel again. It's fantastic value for money, and most definately deserves higher stars!!

I had read a number of reviews that said Barcelona was loud, so we asked for a quiet room in back. While we did not have a view (and were fine with this, since there is a roof deck), the room (and especially the blackout curtains) allowed for quiet and much-needed sleep. We only heard any noise at all once the weekend hit, and that was minimal. The hotel is in a fairly upscale part of the Eixample neighborhood, just a few blocks away from being in a heavily commercial area, so it was semi-residential as well with pretty, quiet blocks that were fun to explore. The EuroPark was about a 15-minute walk from everything we wanted to do, including Barcelona's most famous Gaudi attraction, the Sagrada Familia, in one direction and the Gothic Quarter in another. There is also a Metro station (the Girona stop) a block or two away. Food-wise, there is a nice supermarket on the next block and a good little place practically downstairs with sidewalk tables where we grabbed cheap breakfasts and coffee in the mornings. The hotel staff recommended great nearby restaurants whenever we asked, including La Rita down the street, which we ate at twice. I would not go with the hotel's food, however, unless you are really lazy. We took a look at their restaurant's offerings one morning and it was not worth the money. We did order room service once (a moment of laziness) and it was terrible, but thankfully cheap. I don't stay at hotels for the food though. The room itself was on the small side but modern and clean (everything about the EuroPark feels very new) with ample closet/drawer space for two people, plus a mini-bar and in-room safe. We loved the bathroom, especially the shower. If you ask for two beds, you will get two small beds pushed together, which we were fine with (see my photos). The rooftop deck is very nice but with fairly limited views, though we enjoyed a few uncrowded sunsets up there. There is a pool, but it's very small and not really for swimming, just to sit in and cool off. Also, there are three computers in the hotel (one in the lobby, two in the 1st floor restaurant) to use the Internet. Television options are limited/dull -- I didn't see any way to order movies, for instance. Finally, the hotel staff was very helpful and professional, though perhaps a bit cold. Housekeeping never intruded and always left the room perfect. Overall, this hotel became \"our oasis,\" as my friend called it a few times after long nights out. I suppose some would find the EuroPark bland or boring, and I do admit it did not give us much of a sense of Barcelona/Spanish flavor.

All in all the hotel was just about perfect with only two minor flaws: they don\u2019t sell stamps for your postcards, nor did the reception desk staff offer to post the cards for us and put the postage on the bill; the other is if you like to cuddle your partner it\u2019s harder on their beds because there are no queen beds, just two singles pushed together.

The room was spacious with a king sized, fairly comfortable bed. I do wish they had a chest of drawers for unpacking. There were only 2 small drawers and some shelves and a hanging area for clothes.

As many others have said, the location is in a relatively quiet area (Exiample) but just a few blocks from the Girona Metro stop and a 10 minute walk to the Passeig de Gracia Metro stop. By the way, the Metro in Barcelona is the best metro we've ever encountered in all of our travels to many major cities! It is cheap ($1 per ride compared to $2.25 in NYC), extremely reliable and we never waited more than 4 minutes for any train. There is even a timer letting you know when the next train will arrive and it was ALWAYS accurate (or quicker!). We found the T10 ticket to be the best bargain. 7.70Euros for 10 rides and both you and any one you're traveling with can use it at the same time. Buy it in any train station and at the airport. We never felt unsafe in this neighborhood even late at night. If we went back to Barcelona we may stay in a busier area in Barrio Gotic or Barceloneta just because there would be more to do at night very near the hotel, but if you want a little quieter area, than this is for you!

Location is good -- only a block or two to the Girona metro and a 5-10 minute walk to the bustling Paseo de la Gracia. High speed internet was a great amenity -- bring your laptop (all rooms have a laptop sized safe). Although there are a few computers for guest access, all seemed to be occupied at all times with people checking their facebook accounts. Go figure. As a random side note, I hated the shampoo. If you're a hair snob, bring your own. If you're looking for a place to eat nearby, we'd recommend La Rita on Calle Aragon. Great value for money and very nice (very popular among the neighborhood locals).

We are two girls in our early twenties, and we were looking for a relaxing hotel that was still close enough to the main city. LOCATION was perfect for what we were looking for, only a 5min stroll to Rambla de Catalunya, which turned out to be our favourite part of the city. We were still easy walking distance from La Ramblas and Gothic quarter etc. but taxis were also very cheap (never paid more than 7euro to return back in the evening). The hotel is in a slightly quieter area but we never felt unsafe walking around and we slept well as there was not as much noise. The hotel is also 2mins away from a supermarket, which is great for water etc, as the mini-bar/hotel bar was quite expensive. SERVICE at the hotel wasn't particularly great, whilst most staff (bar,maids,reception) were polite and helpful, it often took a while to find them and the service at the bar during the day was very slow. We also encountered one very rude member of reception staff when checking out, but overall it was pretty average for a 3 star hotel. ROOM/DECOR was really nice and modern, extremely clean and well maintained. All public areas of the hotel eg.pool/toilets, were of the same high standard and we really couldn't fault anything in this area. LIKED MOST- Location, cleanliness and decor, coffee,good sized bathroom with plenty of mirrors and lights and an excellent shower! Pool (small,cold & shallow-but needed after a long hot day walking around Barcelona) DISLIKED- Slow service, expensive breakfast (definitely worth eating elsewhere, loads of nice little places nearby) expensive bottled water, no view or balcony from our room.

Here comes the 'But.....' we had an unfortunate incident by way of a bottle of red wine leaking from our daypack - not an evening of revelry but something that happened at 11.00am this morning as we were packing for check out. We mopped up the damage in the room, noticing that there was some staining on the duvet but deciding that mopping that up with the pristine white towels was not the best strategy. We then checked out but when we returned some 3 hours later for our left luggage we were presented with a 150\u20ac bill for 'damaged duvet and mattress'. To say we were astounded is an understatement - whilst we acccepted responsibility for the problem, we struggled to see the justification of the cost. A long and rather heated debate ensued, during which we were threatened by the staff calling the police - not necessary, and very heavy handed - to the result that we paid up. This hotel is lovely and the accommodation is great but we were very shocked that a slip-up/accident resulted in such heavy handed treatment (we later felt tempted to claim ownership of the said mattress and duvet cover we had apparently paid for).

Modern design, large comfortable beds, very good air con, large powerful shower, a free safe and minibar which was handy for keeping our own drinks cold. The location was in the more residential Eixample area but it was only a fifteen minute walk to Las Ramblas in one direction and La Sagrada Familia in the other. The Placa de Catalunya was also only about fifteen minutes walk away which is where we got off and on the A1 airport bus, this is a quick, easy and cheap way to get to and from the airport. You will wait no longer than ten minutes for a bus in either direction. There is no need to get a taxi. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke very good English.

The rooms are fairly good size with good AC which is a necessity in summer. Reception staff were friendly & helpful booking restaurants for us when requested. Bathrooms don't have bath however do have large shower and good hairdryer. Iron & board is available on request and there is a safe in room. Sat TV with usual news channels but no MTV.

It's a 10/15 min walk to Placa Cataluyna and Las Ramblas. This was our 6th visit to BCN and I'm glad we stayed in this hotel as although it's not quite as central as we usually stay, it's good to stay somewhere different to allow you to explore and discover new shops, restaurants, etc. Rooftop pool is fairly small but what is to be expected for a city centre pool! It does the job of cooling you off whilst sunbathing/chilling in the sun listening to music on the BOSE speakers they have outside playing 'lounge' music.

It was a last minute booking that was made due to the terrible weather in Dublin. We arrived at 11:00 am on Friday morning and we were checked in and in our rooms within 5 mins. It will cost approx \u20ac20.00 by taxi from Barcelona airport (approx 10 mins) to the Europark hotel.. We stayed in a double room and it was perfect. Modern design, spotless and everything you would need from hairdryers etc to a well stocked mini bar. The room we stayed in had not got a scenic view. It basically looked onto the back of other buildings, but we weren't they to look out the window. The staff were excellent. The room was kept spotless. Unlike a lot of places when you travel abroad, the breakfast was excellent. The was so much to choose from. Everything you could have from back home and everything you would find in a Spanish breakfast. The Europark hotel is located approx 5-10 mins walk (depending on age etc) from the main designer shopping street and also from the top of Las Ramblas. It is only 5 mins walk from the Sagrila Familla (not sure of correct spelling) and all the restaurants, shops, bars in that area. You can walk to the beach (which is brilliant) but its much easier just to take a 5 min cab ride. The taxis are cheaper in Barcelona than Dublin. Actually, everything is cheaper in Barcelona than Dublin. We had to check out at 12:00 on our last day and even though out flight home wasn't until 10:30pm were were allowed to use any of the facilities within the hotel. We made the most of this by lounging by the roof top pool having ice cold beers delivered up to us!! The pool area is small but it is decked out well. We had the whole area to ourselves as the hotel didn't seem to be busy. The pool is only waist deep but it was ideal in my opinion. The roof top was a lovely place to relax and catch the last of the sun. We stayed in the Hotel Rialto before when in Barcelona and while it has a more central location (just off Las Ramblas) it didnt come near the Europark for quality.

The design and finition of the place are flawless (not like other Spanish boutique hotels where things look good but fall apart when you touch them). The interplay of black and white colours, the nice floors, flatscreen TV, good bathrooms (with a system to transfer TV sound to them) and sturdy doors all contributed to a really nice atmosphere. As some people have criticised, the rooftop pool is quite shallow but it is clearly meant for relaxing, not for swimming, and that is exactly why I wanted it! Too bad there's no bar next to it. Breakfast is expensive as always so I'd rather have croissants and pastries in one of the many places around. Service in general was extremely friendly, and the laundry service was fast and perfect. Finally, location is quite good: not in the old town but close to different metro stations (Gracia, Girona and others). At night, a taxi from the seaside will cost no more than 5-7 euros.

I was looking for ages trying to find a central hotel in Barcelona not too far from the city centre but just away from the noise, and this hotel was great for that. Getting to the hotel from the airport was so easy, we caught a bus outside (A1) going to the city cente which cost just over three euros and took about 20 minutes. We then had a short walk to our hotel. On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who booked us in with no hassel. Our room was 409 which was at the back of the hotel Overlooking some building work next door, but not a problem. The room was very retro with all the furniture in black and white. The room was very spacious with a flat screen tv. hair dryer, a safe and a mini bar. Ideal for what we wanted. We found the hotel staff always helpful and willing to offer advice if you were stuck for directions. We took the option to get our breakfasts at the local cafe which was great as we sat and watched the world go by and relaxed in the sun and cheap er than the hotel. To get to Catalunya it took us abourt 10/15 minutes walking which was a great place to start your day to either catch the bus touristic which cost 26 euros for 2 days an ideal way of seeing the sights of Barcelona. You will be able to pick up a route map at various places in the city, but as a rough guide: Blue Route: Covers the South and West of the City, visiting the Old Town, the Olympic area, the Port, the Zoo and Estaci\u00f3 Sants. Red Route: This route takes you on a tour of the North and the further Western part of the city including Sagrada Familia, FC Barcelona, Palau Reial and lots more. Forum Route: This route covers the East of the city around the Olympic Port, the beach, a beautiful park and the Forum. There are plenty of sights to see we just liked to walk and just see the sights randomly. We especially liked the cable car ride, the walk around the marina, The ramblas, the Gaudi masterpieces around the city and just taking in the general atmosphere. We had no trouble with pick pockets etc but you have to be sensible when you are out and just keep your valubles at the hotel and just take out what you need.

The other travelers at this hotel complained of street noise- what do you expect, you're in a major city! I had a single room facing the courtyard, so I wasn't subject to too much noise. The only noise I encountered was the sound of people slamming their doors and the loud American family staying next door (I'm an American and this is a plea to other American travelers- PLEASE do not embarass the rest of us, who are respectful, sophisticated travelers. I thought it was an entire group of students traveling. Much to my shock, it was one family of four making all that obnoxious noise. Unbelievable!) Anyway, there's a great market virtually next door (Mercat de la Conceptio) and a few coffee bars, and a lovely bakery. Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the bakery or a coffee shop nearby. I agree with other travelers- La Rita restaurant (2 blocks away) is an absolute MUST. My only regret is that I went there my last night and didn't have an opportunity to go back multiple times; but, it was a great meal to end my great trip. The prices were shockingly low- I couldn't believe the quality of the food you got for such low prices. I've been to many 4 star restaurants that cost far, far more and I haven't enjoyed many of the meals as much as this little gem of a restaurant. Don't bother asking the front desk anything. They act like you ask for their kidney when you're only asking them a simple question. The front desk is cold, rude and utterly unhelpful.
