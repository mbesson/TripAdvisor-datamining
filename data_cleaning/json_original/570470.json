It is however in a great spot - right next to the train and bus and walking distance to the main sites. The staff were great - friendly and helpful - and our room just fine - fridge ad aircon and good bathroom and bed - what more do you need? Highly recommend it!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and friendly\u201d", "Author": "MargaretSimons", "ReviewID": "UR92421806", "Content": "This is a clean, comfortable and basic hotel lifted above the ordinary by the friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is moments walk from the railway station, (take the right hand exit when facing away from the tracks) and has a laundrette and several cafes in the same street. Wifi internet is available in the foyer for free. The historical part of Rome is within easy walking distance, as are most things you want to see. The hostess will recommend a walking tour, which we more or less followed and enjoyed. There are a lot of budget hotels around this area, and one other even in the same building. But we'd use Hotel Galli again. One small criticism. One of the mattresses in our family room was a bit uncomfortable with springs close to the surface. The room we used was a bit tight for four, but perfectly manageable. Overall, very good value for money.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT stay here!\u201d", "Author": "kmulrain1013", "ReviewID": "UR68535835", "Content": "I stayed here for one night because the other hotel where I spent four days was full. The elevator holds 2 people, the owner doesn't understand much English, the room is small, you have to pay for air conditioning, the television didn't work, and you have to ask to have the phone activated. I probably could've gotten over all of this, but on top of all of that, SOMEONE CAME INTO OUR ROOM WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP AND STOLE my friend's purse, including her wallet, camera, and passport. Then, they had the nerve to come back for more but we woke up. This happened in the middle of the night, and all of the security doors that were supposed to be locked were all open when we headed downstairs to leave the hotel to go to the police. The owner tried to blame us, saying we must have left the valuables on the bus or metro, though we knew we didn't. He didn't seem upset or remorseful that this happened at his hotel, and when we asked about the surveillance camera in the hallway, he said it didn't even work. I didn't feel safe there from the beginning, and should have listened to that instinct. Pay a little extra and stay elsewhere!", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oshawa", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "Havekidswilltravel29", "ReviewID": "UR21446787", "Content": "My wife and i stayed here a few years ago and for us served it's purpose. As has already been stated the Hotel Galli has small but had clean rooms and is basically across the street from Termini Station.

No problems with the staff however the elevator was out when we were there so dragging our luggage up 3 floors or ourselves after a day of exploring the city was needless to say.....an inconvienence.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore", "Title": "\u201cnot impressive\u201d", "Author": "gichuki", "ReviewID": "UR6032071", "Content": "The hotel room is very tiny but very clean.

The guy who owns the place acts as if he owns you too , you have to get to him coming in and out , on the door of the hotel and the building with a nasty , loud ringing bell , that when people use it during the night awakens everybody . Although we had a 5 days reservation , I had to leave after one night since I we were so bothered by the owner . In addition , the location is very unsafe .
