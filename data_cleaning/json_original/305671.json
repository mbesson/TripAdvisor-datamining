I had a wonderful room that lacked nothing, still, they wanted to move me to a better room, but I declined. I liked it where I was.

We arrived at the hotel around 11 am, Reception told us that they did not clean the room yet, so we had to wait. We were led on the terrace where breakfast is served, where we were each served with a coffee and asked to wait until the room was ready. After about 45 minutes, the maid came to lead us into the room, at which appeared a very unpleasant surprise. Although I have made the booking made four months before, I was led into an annex of the hotel, in a room full of mold because of water that drained from the bath, with walls so badly cracked that I prayed the ceilling won't collapse on us, and windows that were not closing. We immediately locked the room and went to reception to ask for the hotel room we payed for, but the guy from Reception told us that by Tuesday there is no room available and he cannot help us change it. We were practically forced to 3 nights sleeping in the room that was not worthy even for a 1 star hotel. Eventually, after much insistence, Tuesday After breakfast, we were moved to the main hotel building, in a clean room, just like the one on the hotel website. From here was much more our stay became much more pleasant. The major problem is the hotel that sits right next to the railroad and the noise from the passing trains is quite hard to ignore. The good thing is that the trains do not run after 23 pm. Breakfast is very basic ....... cheese, a sausage that looks awful, yogurt, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits,Coffee / tea ...... We were also very shocked to see that they were also serving frech fries at breakfast ....... Never seen that before ...... EVER !! The good part is that the hotel is very close to tourist attractions in Sultanahmet.

We were hardly ever in our room, so much to see and do in Istanbul, but no one mentioned the trains! It was interesting to wake one morning to see a freight train of military tanks going by! The room also looks out on the water and that was beautiful. The room ceiling paint was peeling off and there was black mold on the bathroom ceiling. Yuck. The bathroom itself was about 4 1/2 feet by 6 feet (that includes hand held shower, toilet, sink) with a drain on the floor. That being said the staff was very nice and very helpful, giving directions, advice, recommending restaurants (Doy Doy is close, reasonable and good). The breakfast room is lovely looking out on the water and the food was delicious, fresh, plentiful. I suppose I would advise anyone looking into this hotel to ask which side of the hotel the room being considered is located. Also there are many other small, similar hotels in the area. I would recommend seeing the Blue Mosque but in addition see the uncrowded \"New\" Yeni Cami Mosque near the spice market. Don't miss the underground cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Topkapi Palace. There is a nice bazaar near the Blue Mosque and the Mosaic Museum. The weather in early April was warm and beautiful, the evenings were cool and nice.

Friends we traveled with had booked in a nearby hotel that had no more rooms. The hotel experience was overall very positive. By not booking ahead of time we got a better rate (55 Euros per night). The street was very quiet and access to all sights was very easy either by walking or by tram. We chose a street-side room because the side with the spectacular view of the Bosphorus is next to the railroad tracks and with many trains going by it could have been uncomfortable although the windows seemed to be quite well insulated. The view of the Bosphorus from the rooftop where we ate breakfast was spectacular. Breakfast food was OK. The room itself was comfortable and clean and the bed not as hard as many European beds so we slept quite well. The staff (especially Yaseen) were great!! Polite and helpful and his English quite good. The AC and everything else worked fine and I would highly recommend the hotel for people with \"reasonable\" expectations. One weak point can be the lack of an elevator. We are in our late 50s but we had no problem with that.

From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly receptionist and an abundance of smiles. Firstly, let it be said, that service, comfort and quality were all exceptional. I booked directly with the hotel's website since it had the best offer, better then all the other sites I know that offer hotels deals (expedia, tablet etc.) The location was perfect for us. Its on a quiet side street but not isolated from necessities. It is located in old Istanbul. We only used the taxi to/from the airport. The staff are very friendly and the whole hotel has a comfortable and relaxed feel. The breakfast room(terrace) is bright and the food was prepared to a high standard, again combined with a warm, friendly service. Despite being a little small, our room (No.8) was furnished very tastefully and with its views over the hotel's rear terrace, offered a quiet hideaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. I had told the hotel when booking that it was a birthday treat and on our arrival back that night we found a chilled bottle of champagne it the room with a personalised message. The hotel -like all of this area-is relatively new and was a great location for our short visit. The foyer is astonishing, the rooms are luxurious, the service outstanding and the food excellent. The food.... The staff..... The rooms... everything Magic!!! There was nothing wrong with this hotel, as soon as we got there we were treated like royalty. Did the hotel meet my expectations? Yes it did. What more can be said about this hotel. This is my new home in Istanbul and I am going to let all my traveling retired friends aware of the exceptional value.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oman", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and great location\u201d", "Author": "omansyahrul", "ReviewID": "UR7998134", "Content": "Me and a close friend of mine stayed at Sur Hotel for seven nights from June 16. Sur Hotel was an excellent choice in the Sultanahmet (Old City) area of Istanbul.The Hotel is centrally located near to most of the Historical Places. The breakfast was great in their roof-top. The rooftop(breakfast room) offers panoramic views. It was most enjoyable place, which I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met, with great views Sea of Marmara. Since we were there in the summer we had the space to ourselves much of the time. The breakfast was adequate with cheeses, meats, tomatoes, cucumbers, turkish meals, excellent bread and roles, and tea or coffee. The staff were extremely helpful, giving us advice on where to go, what to expect, how much to pay in the taxis... Not only is the service great, the location of this hotel is outstanding. And their driver is very nice. They picked up us from airport. If you book directly through the hotel and stay for three or more nights, this service is complimentary. My room had a sea view that was most enjoyable and worth the small additional charge. If you are looking to make all aspects of your trip perfect look no further.

The rooms are still very relaxing and comfortable. Good breakfasts in terrace overlooking Marmara Sea. Very very good value for Money.
