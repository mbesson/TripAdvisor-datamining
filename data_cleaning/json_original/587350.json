{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean, functional but bad customer service We where a group of 20 persons, we stayed there because it was close to the Messe and we all were exhibitors.The hotel was clean, but the attitude of the staff was terrible.They were rude. They didn't realized what a good customer service is and what important it is.The pillows are hard as a rock. The bathroom it's a tiny cabin like in the boats.The rooms are small but clean.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR896838903", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Atenas"}, {"Content": "Clean and functional Just stayed at this hotel for a few nights whilst attending an exhibition at the Messe.The rooms are fairly basic with a 'pod' type bathroom (shower only). However, the bed was comfortable, the shower had constant hot water, although some colleagues said this wasn't the case in their rooms.No tea/coffee facilities in the rooms which was a bit of a disappointment. Buffet style breakfast, 24 hour bar.If you're attending the Messe for an event/exhibition then you'll need to know that it's a good 20-25 minute walk from the hotel, but the no.17 tram stops right outside the hotel and takes 10 minutes to get to the main entrance of the Messe (Maritim entrance - not the Galleria entrance).Note that there are no restaurants within walking distance of this hotel, although the breakfast room doubles up as a restaurant in the evenings (didn't try it so can't comment).", "Date": "Mar 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561319562", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "AllyMac3"}, {"Content": "Fair und nett   showReview(22326137, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR631013777", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PuzzelKarlsruhe"}, {"Content": "Preiswert aber gut   showReview(18095302, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325390514", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "eyeshot"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d587350-r17924375-Ibis_Frankfurt_City_Messe-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "587350", "Price": "$170"}}
