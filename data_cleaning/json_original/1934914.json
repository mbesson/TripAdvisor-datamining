Unfortunately the latter are greater than the former. Pros: the hotel is located very centrally on Taksim square. The rooms facing the Bosporus are quite despite the hectic hustle and bustle of the square. The hotel spa is great and the views of the breakfast restaurant are also unbeatable. The hotel uses some modern technologies as far as security is concerned and the access to free internet is very welcome! The rain shower in the rooms is great. Cons: 1. Some of the rooms are tiny. We had a Bosporus view room which was very small. The pricing logic seems to be strange since the square facing rooms are much larger but they cost less! 2. The wardrobes are equally tiny, the coat hungers unusable and the location of the safe is odd; it almost makes it inaccessible. 3. Breakfast is a hit and miss experience especially if you are a bit later for breakfast. Food is not replaced and if they have run out of food it is just bad luck! We were there over the Easter period and we went to have breakfast at 9.45. Much to our surprise most of the food had gone and everything was removed at 10! 4. The staff does not speak any English and this make communication impossible. 5. The house keeping needs some improvements, especially in replacing the bathroom amenities and rearranging the room every morning.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo,no, no\u201d", "Author": "TheTravellingGabo", "ReviewID": "UR127817209", "Content": "I visited this hotel for business.

We were in total 8 adults and one toddler, the first half of our party arrived earlier in the day. Prior to check-in and booking, I was in touch with a lovely lady from the hotel (Irem) she made everything so easy and helped whenever she could with my requests. We took a private taxi from the airport, it was quite quick, just under half an hour as there wasn't any traffic. Check-in was very quick and the staff at the front desk were very pleasant. We were pleasantly surprised to see how lively the area was, restaurants left, right and centre and so much going on, which was perfect for us. The hotel is a mere 1 minute walk from the metro station, which is the main form of transportation we used during our one week stay, it's so easy to get to the main places. The rooms were standard, so they were on the small side, but perfectly clean and really stylish. Our 3 year old was sharing the bed with us so space was a little tight. The bathroom was very nice, the shower is heavenly with one of those ceiling shower heads. We didn't turn the TV on very often, but there are international channels as well as local ones, there's also an option to link the audio to the bathroom which I thought was nice. We had 4 rooms over 3 floors, because the hotel is small, it was so easy to get between the rooms without having to use the lift. I think it's perfect for larger families that want to interact with each other between rooms, it was one of the nicest things of the trip! Breakfast was good, there was plenty of variety and service was great. It starts at 7 and ends at 10 which we thought was generous. We got a 10% discount + free breakfast for being a tripadvisor member, which made it a great deal. On our last day, our flight was in the evening and asked if we could leave our bags until it was time for our taxi to pick us up, the reception informed us that they have a luggage room, so that was a big plus for us, we got an extra day of shopping before heading out to the airport. There was a slight hiccup, an hour before our taxi was due to arrive, there was a huge protest in Taksim Square (opposite the hotel) and the roads were closed. The reception did everything they could by communicating with the taxi that was delayed and helped arrange alternate transportation for us. All in all, the service was impeccable, the staff would do anything they could to make the stay extra special, it's absolutely perfect for families, even though there aren't any activities in the hotel for children, they are amazing with kids.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa, Hefa, Israel", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "Nashed A", "ReviewID": "UR121949104", "Content": "Best choice to choice!

The shower was fantastic , I could spend hours in there!

Free wifi internet was available everywhere in the hotel and I could say that if you let alone the fact of the small room the hotel gives you more than a 5 star hotel, however in a very reasonable price. The staff was polite and willing to help anytime. However some of them did not speak very good english making communication a bit difficult sometimes. On the first day of our arrival we had a problem with heating which took ages to get fixed and the staff at the reception desk were not very helpful on explaining what was going on and what was going to happen as the hotel was fully booked for new years eve a situation which was a bit annoying, I must admit.

Don't bother with the overpriced breakfast, everything you need is on the street below. Tell them to clear out your minibar to make room for what you bring in. We didn't try the spa so on that I can't advise. The wifi is spotty in the side rooms, you might want to check before settling on the room. The location is really good, overlooking Taksim Square which is Istanbul shopping and party headquarters and busy all the night. The window is more interesting than the TV. But if you're a light sleeper you'll need to ask for a room at the back overlooking the sea. The std/deluxe rooms are way too small for the price and without baths, but nice shower. The TV is embedded in a full wall mirror in front of the bed, which can also be kind of interesting if you're not alone.
