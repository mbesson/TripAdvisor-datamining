The hostel is close to the Ramblas, metro, sites, supermarket and different type of eats. The free walking tour is a huge plus!...you just tip the tour guide. Ok...so, the first and second night was ok...it wasn't until the 3rd day when i awoke to water dripping on my bed! We contacted the receptionist, but had to sit out of my room for 3 hours only to be told that the room is being fixed and I will have to move to another room and will have to wait till someone checks out. no problem, but I didn't want to spend my last day in barcelona in the waiting area till someone checked out. when i went back to the room to move my stuff out, the smell from the water was absolutely disgusting! i had to hold my breath!...I believe it was from the toilet above! now...at this point, some of my clothes got wet. After moving my things to the next room, I had to go to the laundrymat to wash the clothes, which took more time in my day! I complained to the receptionist and was told that she will speak to the manager. later that day, i was compensated only 10 euros for my laundry. they did not offer to reimburse me to at least one night! so, here's the worst part!...i went to bed that night and couldn't sleep....i felt this crawling sensation and was itching half the night!...when i woke up...I had a few welts on my arms!...yes!!!...BED BUGS! at this point...i wanted to just get out of there! i didn't even complain because they didn't even do anything about the water issue. the only reason i give this an average is because of the location and free walking tour, but in terms of the room...i give this place a very poor service!", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood, small hostel in the centre\u201d", "Author": "Sanders394", "ReviewID": "UR127280014", "Content": "We stayed her with 3 girls for 4 nights, and we had a really nice time. The hostel is very small, so we didn't really see other people who stayed in the hostel. It's clean and the bathroom was quite big with a good shower and bath (we had a private bathroom ensuite). The hostel is really close to the Rambla with many restaurants, so it's right in the centre. I can really recommend the pub crawl, it was a lot of fun. The breakfast was really basic, only coffee, tea and bread with ham and cheese, but it was free. There are 2 computers downstairs with free internet. The rooms were quite small, but I think that is not a problem, as Barcelona is not a city to stay in your hostel all day. Towels and linen were also included, we got new towels every day. I can really recommend this hostel for friends who are staying in Barca for a few days, but when you are alone and you want to meet other people, this hostel is not the perfect place.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alicante", "Title": "\u201cDo not be late!\u201d", "Author": "LS173", "ReviewID": "UR122310791", "Content": "Positives Points: the free wifi, breakfast and the location, it is located about 4 blocks from \"Las Ramblas\", but their street is not safe (an advice: do not be late!).

Being a Hostel is a good one comparing to some horrible hostels that you can find around Europe. LOCATION On the Hostel's street you can find mini supermarkets, ATMs, cheap souvenir shops, bars and the beautiful Palau G\u00fcell from Gaud\u00ed. The Hostel is well situated, literally less than 5 minutes walking to the famous Las Ramblas. From there you can easily go to Pla\u00e7a Reial, Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, La Boqueria, Barri G\u00f3tic, Port Vell, Avinguda del Paral\u00b7lel, Rambla del Raval, etc. At night the street can be busy and loud because of the pubs but the Hostel's windows are double glass, so you can get a good night of sleep. There's excellent access to public transports: metro, buses, taxis. BEDROOMS The bedroom ensuite is small but doable. All bedrooms have balcony with excellent natural light, flat TV, air conditioning, free internet, linen and towels. The room was clean everyday. Towels and linen changed everyday too. Anyway, the towels and linen were not so clean because everyday we found some stains in it and little hairs in the sheets. We were really concerned about it. The bathroom has everything we needed and has a good shower. In our last day there, unfortunately, we found 3 small cockroaches running around the room, I don't know if we let the window open or if they were there before...anyways, is always disgusting! BREAKFAST Some people here liked the breakfast, some people don't. We didn't like in regards to the quantity and variety of it. Everyday we went for the breakfast room at 9.30am and almost everything were gone...almost nothing to eat and no variety. I am not asking for a fancy breakfast because I know that is a Hostel but 1 or 2 things can be added in it. The breakfast was not enough to achieve the classic expression 'good to go'...we had to stop in some places to eat something more to be able to start our long walks around the city. LOCKERS Be Ramblas has lockers where you can put your luggage after you do the check out. Our flight home was only at 6pm, so we put our luggage there - for 2\u20ac - and we went for our final walk in Barcelona. Once you put your luggage there you cannot open the locker again unless you want to pay another 2\u20ac. So, be sure you put everything you want in there until you open it to grab your belongings and go. STAFF Staff is polite and helpful. We had a little problem with the TV, we went to the reception and they quickly fixed the problem. The moment you arrive to do the check-in, a staff member of the reception will charge you the room. Be ready to pay in cash! Some more info: - The elevator starts on the first floor, so you have to go up the stairs with your luggage. - Every time you leave the hostel you have to give your room key in the reception. - A bit expensive for a Hostel but perfectly located to explore the city. Maybe in that area there are better hostels with better prices and conditions. Is a matter of looking for those hostels and compare them. But I have to say, even with those flaws I mencioned, Be Ramblas is not an awful hostel...is just doable. With some improvements I am sure that it will be like an average Hotel and not just a Hostel. By the way, you must go to M\u00e9son David to have dinner. The restaurant is from the Be Hostels Group. We went there and it was a great spanish experience!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hostel, not great assistance\u201d", "Author": "LovinItAce", "ReviewID": "UR116646145", "Content": "Room was great, small but doable.

Our room was clean and well presented. Breakfast was included and was sufficient to fuel you for a day of exploring the city. Our only gripe was that there was a surcharge of 8% on the bill if you paid by card (either debit or credit). This wasn't mentioned on the website anywhere. Since we had come straight from the airport with our luggage, going looking for a cash machine wasn't an option, so we were charged the 8%. The wireless Internet also went out for the last 2 days of our stay, which was inconvenient as we needed to book accommodation for the next leg of our journey.

Location was not as close to Las Ramblas as expected, a little way up a side street, but very close indeed. Loved the Gothic Quarter most of all. And Gaudi's Palace created for Guell should be open now... it is on the same street as this place! Walls were a little on the thin side, but we weren't really in the room in the evening anyway so it wasn't a big issue. The free walking tours are a must do, really gives you your bearings!
