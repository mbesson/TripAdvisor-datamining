The man at the front desk was extremely helpful with explaining how to get the shuttle that would take us to the L station at the airport. He also gave us great information and a map of Chicago and showed us where the L stations were in town. We felt very welcomed and informed. The shuttle to the airport was very nice and free! The shuttle runs every 20 min. The drivers we had were friendly. The shuttle does serve the all of the hotels in the complex so plan for extra time for stops. Our room was huge and clean. I slept better than I have in a long time in a hotel room. My kids loved having their own room and TV. The pool was huge, clean and warm. The woman working the breakfast area was fantastic!! She actually came to our table and removed our dirty plates. I have never had that happen before. The breakfast was well stocked and the food was good. The only problem was finding the hotel in the dark. It is in an area that has quite a few hotels and finding the correct driveway was difficult.

We weren't expecting much, since normally you don't get much when it comes to reward program redemption, but from the moment we got to the hotel (via free shuttle from the airport), everything was wonderful. The staff bent over backwards to welcome us to the hotel. We were greeted by a \"manager's reception\" which they may have well called dinner (included with the room stay). Our menu featured baked fish, fries, coleslaw, and more, complete with wine & cheese, as well as a selection of desserts. After dinner, we headed up to our room, which was a suite that, in addition to a full bath and king size bed, included its own kitchenette, fold out sofa, microwave complimentary bag of microwave popcorn and two flat screen televisions. The room was clean and comfortable too. In the morning we were treated to a full hot buffet breakfast, also included with our stay.

It was a quick overnight stay but I found this newer hotel to be quiet, the studio room very comfortable with a thoughtful layout (I could easily see staying here for a longer term) - a huge flat screen TV, comfy sofa, a kitchen as big as mine in Manhattan, nice work desk, dinette . . . probably my sole complaint about the room is that the lone blanket was very meager and I was cold, but unwilling to turn on the heat which would have only made the room stuffy. Parking was free and convenient. The staff person at check in (late flight arrival) was very cheerful and more than helpful in his desire to assist me with my directions for the next morning. The next morning I grabbed a couple of things for breakfast and took them to my room. The breakfast was far from memorable but I suppose better than nothing if you have to get on the road.

The room was more than spacious, great kitchen, bathroom was clean, and really new looking. Check in was easy, front desk was very nice and polite and breakfast/dinner attendants were wonderful and took care of us. The hotel also provides a free shuttle which was great and free internet. There aren't many options for food around except for overpriced hotel restaurants. There is a Giordano's and White Castle down the street that were decent. If you walk too far you will be in the ghetto, so watch out! The shuttle runs every 20 minutes or so and is usually prompt. My biggest concerns were over people lingering around the hotel that don't appear to be guests. During breakfast and mostly dinner I observed quite a few cars pull up, people walking over from other nearby hotels, and getting in line for food. Basketball court, pool and whirlpool, and guest computer were also tied up by 'non-guests'. There needs to be a way to keep people out of the hotel for the safety of paying guests.
