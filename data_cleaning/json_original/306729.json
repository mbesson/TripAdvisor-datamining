The weather was not too hot and we could walk to the gold and spice souk - about 15 mins. The hotel was easy to find and always taxis passing outside to take you to the attractions. The square outside is being turned into a metro station - bit noisy but we weren't there much during the day. Great when it is finished. Rooms were big and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Got a very early check-in which I asked for by email. Breakfast was plentiful and for everyone's tastes. The reception will book you a safari if you want. Good value. Older hotel but in good shape. Lots of Russians and signs in Russian around the place. Good if you want fur coats! Lots of cheap shops in the vicinity. After dark the pavements turn into little restaurants and you can eat cheap and tasty souvlaki style meals. English menus too. Try the fresh juices. There are juice bars every where and juices are on all the menus. Juiced right there in front of you. A whole coconut is really cheap. Loved Dubai at this time of the year. Dubai mall has great shopping - some expensive. Go down to the food hall - and book at least one day ahead for the worlds tallest building. 5 minute walk from the hotel to the 'Creek' and a boat across. You'll be asked if you want a cruise as well. Go, but make sure of the price. If you want to get to the gold and spice souk from the hotel go down to the creek and walk along there, following the road signs for the souks then go into the back streets. Easy to get lost but easy to find a way back!!! Mosques in the area, and lots of local life!!! The hotel does advertise 2 restaurants but only one was open but this was fine.

For the money though, the hotel rooms were extremely nice. We had one of the rooms on the 10th floor and even had a view of the river from our balcony. The rooms themselves were spotlessly presented with brand new furniture, fittings and new flooring. There is also a mini bar (no alcohol) which is very reasonably priced. The fridge also gives plenty of space to pop in your own beverages. Most handy. As we were aware, there is a new metro station being constructed outside the hotel. However when we were there the noise generated was no worse than the general street noise. Staff were extremely helpful and polite. No, their english might not be the best but it was good enough to help us with everything we needed. They were very attentive and looked after all our requirements well. A few people have moaned about the breakfast. There was melon, toast, cerial, pastries, cakes as well as the cooked breakfast (which was not the best I must admit). I thought it was perfectly adequate to fill your travelling tummy, but not excellent. Cakes and pastries particularly handy to nick for consumption during the big bus tour!! The bathrooms were a wee bit small, and the shower did indeed leak water all over the floor. However, we simply mopped the floor with our bath mat after each use and found that meant there was no mess. The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant. Within walking distance to the creek, Gold Souk & Spice Souk. Also convenient for the stop to get you on the big bus tour. I don't think we could have asked for more for the money we paid. The room was cleaned every day to our satisfaction, and we geniunely could not find fault with this place. It'll be even better once the metro is complete.

We arrived at 8am after a 20 hour flight, and check in is at 2pm. That was fine. We were just going to drop off our bags and have a walk around the area before the jet-lag set in. However, the reception staff advised us that we could check in early, that our room would be ready soon. So we waited, and were basically ignored. Three and a half hours later we were shown to our room. (This was 20 minutes after my mum had a stern word to the reception staff). We had to leave our passports at the front desk \u2013 which was a little odd. The room on the top floor was large, clean and cool. There were no windows, but it had an enormous balcony off the room. The balcony didn\u2019t have any views as it was surrounded by high walls. The bathroom was also large, with a bath/shower (water leaked all over the floor no matter how carefully you showered). We had breakfast twice in the restaurant. The buffet was ordinary, but quite adequate. The restaurant staff seemed disinterested in service. There is a great caf\u00e9/restaurant on the opposite side of Al Naseer square called Tavolino. Great fresh juices and shawarma. The hotel is a favourite with Russian tourists.
