The lobby and bar area is small but adaquate and is always staffed. The location is very good ,close to all busses and a 10 min walk to the subway. Good restaurants on Borgo Pio are a 3minute walk. We walked walked to just about everwherwas e . The rooftop garden is great for viewing St. Peter's and relaxing. The not so good points, can be noisy when tour buses come and go esp. in the am as people open and close the heavy doors to there rooms. The staff is friendly and helpful.

I was using a wheel chair and a walker and found the room very well equipped for me. It was large enough for the wheel chair to fit in the door and move around the room. The bathroom was very large and had safety bars and a pull down plastic seat and movable shower head which worked very well for me to use. The glass doors on the shower opened up and the entrance to the shower was flat so that I could easily get in and out. There was a small elevator that I was able to use to get into the building. (I was told that a new one was being built with the new patio to access the main lobby area which would be more convenient.) The front desk people were very helpful and polite. The lounge was nice and access to WIFI good. The breakfast room and sleeping rooms were cheery and bright. The food was great! The rooftop patio was beautiful and had a fantastic view of St. Peter's Dome, Castel San Angelo and Maximilliano!!! We will definitely recommend Domus Carmelitana to any of our friends who visit Rome. It's only 6 blocks from the Vatican!", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot to disappoint, another great trip............\u201d", "Author": "CKBergfin", "ReviewID": "UR116994938", "Content": "This trip, my neice met mom and I at the hotel. Easy trip via shuttle, only about 30-45 mins depending on other hotel stops. We had a 3 bedroom room on 2nd floor, and a sitting area just outside the door. We spent a lot of time in this 'private' area-as no one else was around. Breakfast was full of choices and if you walked away hungry, it is your own fault. Views from the roof are not to be missed, especially at dusk. We did reserve tickets about 4 months ahead for the Scavi tour (accessible online for reservations), which was the highlight of the trip. Swiss guards at entrance are up close and personal. Also, took a city tour this time. Catch bus on street the vatican faces. It was great as mom has trouble with too much walking and wanted to see everything. Tour guide was great, got plenty of time to take pictures and see what was on the tour. Hadn't ever done this on this trip-but I recommend it even on long trips, and return to places you want to spend more time.

Its well located for site seeing of ancient Rome and all other kinds. Its right next to Borgo Pio where one can sit in any of the road side cafes and watch the pilgrims/tourists go by; or simply browse in the shops and get a Vatican bargain. The Food: Breakfast is a whole experience, the variety is geuinely great and one cannot say they were not catered for. even one of us with a medical condition got catered for, whether to their tastes is moot. Dinner was a 4 course affair, and the meals were fabulous. A choice would have been great because again we ate what we were given. The rooftop terrace is fabulous. one can watch Rome byu day/night up there and not ever want to go home. The Room: we got a room on the 3rd floor, and one of the problems we faced in our group was the Lift. The lifts kept getting out of sorts and taking people up n down or stopping at tyhe wrong floor. Also they are very slow. The room was okay, but looked like it hadnt got a good dusting for weeks. And didnt get it while we were there despite tyhe cleaners coming in on 2 seperate occasions. the shower was broken and it looked likemnit had been broken before we arrived dur to the mo0uld marks on the wallks and ceiling. That said the Bathroom is anple and has all one needs. Beware of the towels in Italy we got what we would consider table cloths for towels...Take your own. Staff: staff were quite okay and tied their best, but emglish is an issue for some and communication may be a bit of a problem there. Would I recommend the property, of course yes, esp if one is on a budget and wants to see as much of Rome/VAtican as they can without having to fork out for taxis everywhere.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest Value-10 mins to Vatican & museums-Very quiet and clean~\u201d", "Author": "CKBergfin", "ReviewID": "UR97150294", "Content": "Reception staff very friendly and helpful, welcome expresso, great bonus.

While the beds were comfortable, their height gave the appearance of a doll house. The bathroom was extremely small, and the very tiny cubicle that served as a shower had a slippery plastic drain board on the floor, which caused me to nearly lose my balance every time I showered.

I was pleasently surprised when discovered that children pay only 50% of the price - a rare offer in Rome! I certainly recommend it to families with children. Domus Carmelitana is listed as a catholic guest house, but it is really a very cozy hotel, with moderate, but comfortable and modern rooms and a magnificent roof garden, where it seems that you can touch the dome of St. Peters cathedral with one hand, and Castel Sant'Angelo with the other. We also loved the view from our room - seeing Castel Sant'Angelo from our beds made us really feel in Rome. Breakfast was very copious and fresh and very tastefully presented. My son liked the satellite TV in the room and internet in the lobby. I liked the chapel. For people coming by car there is a lot of parking space in a private yard, and for all of us, impatient to explore the eternal city, there is a terminus stop of a very useful express bus line right around the corner. (It also gets you directly to the Termini Station in just 15 minutes or so). We will always remember our stay in Domus Carmelitana. It made our stay in Rome even more memorable. ... And it also taught my son (who loves ancient Rome and Romans) once and for all, that the Latin word \"domus\" is one of the very few nouns ending in -us that are not masculine but feminine; therefore, not \"Domus Carmelitanus\", but \"Domus Carmelitana\"!", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cClean, neat, quiet!
