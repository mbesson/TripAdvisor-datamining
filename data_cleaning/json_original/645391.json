This is by far my worst experience in Sydney accommodation. Lets start with what my room didn't have: no wardrobe, no refrigerator, no air conditioning, no television, no tea/coffee making facilities. Basic is your most accurate description of this room - a bed, a chair, an old coffee table, a luggage stand, a ceiling light and fan. Thats it. Oh, and a small rubbish bin sat in the corner near the door. Their were blinds on the windows, thank goodness, otherwise the heat would have made the room uninhabitable. In what at first appeared to be a closet was the smallest, most dilapidated ensuite bathroom I have encountered - and I've seen some shockers in London guesthouses! The ensuite was not very clean either but to be fair it would be a very difficult space to clean given its size and layout. I decided against utilising the soap dispenser and went out and bought my own cake of soap instead. The room was noisy, of course. Well it was on the first floor of a 24 hour pub on the corner of a busy CBD instersection. Mind you that made it handy to the beer tap, slot machines and MacDonalds across the road if the impulse took you at any time throughout the night. As I said there was a ceiling fan in the room, and a cooling southerly change on my first night meant I did manage some sleep. I have no idea how a guest would cope in winter and I'm not going to find out. The best part so far? I was told at check-in that this room was an upgrade! When I mentioned that it was pretty basic I was informed that they had really improved the rooms - \"before the rooms were really rough with bedbugs and stuff\" said the unhelpful manager who escorted me up to the room. Speaking of staff I found the service in the pub downstairs - I never encountered anyone else, staff or other guests in the accommodation area upstairs - varied between sullen and indifferent. But the manager's behaviour was really bad. Check in was hopeless, involving a lot of time hanging around the bar and slot machines waiting for the manager to finish whatever else he was doing. But if check in was hopeless then leaving this establishment was decidedly worse. I asked the manager when checking out if there was somewhere I could leave my bags as my flight wasn't until the afternoon. He said security could be an issue downstairs - surprisingly he said they had previously had problems with staff! He then said I could leave my bags in the room. I asked, \"are you sure, won't you need to have the room cleaned\" to which he replied that no it was OK as there were plenty of rooms and no guests. So, off I went about my business and then when I returned briefly at about 11 am my keycard didn't work and the manager asked if I was ready to take my bags. I told him I wasn't and he said then he'd have to charge me for another night if I left them there any longer. I said what about the office downstairs? Nope, no room, can't do it says he although I could see that there clearly was plenty of room. So, that was the parting of the ways between me and the manager who clearly did not know the meaning of hospitality. I've visited over 50 countries, stayed in countless hotels and written quite a few reviews here. I know that this hotel is not a five star property. I've never written a review as critical as this, not even come close, but this place was poor, the hospitality was non-existent and value lousy. I've waited several weeks before writing this review to give me time to get my experience in perspective. I am comfortable with my thoughts on this establishment.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "taree", "Title": "\u201cnew owners,fantastic location and clean\u201d", "Author": "bowen_11", "ReviewID": "UR120478692", "Content": "I was reluctanct to stay hear because of past reviews, but when i rang to enquire i was told there was new owners and that they had done a complete revamp.The staff were excellent and very focased on customer service.The room and bathroom were simple but were very clean and comfortable.

However we were surprised about the place. Quite a drawn out process checking in, bar staff running round trying to find someone who knew what to do. Got the key, ( and paid $50.00 deposit, which was not mentioned at time of booking) and went upstairs through 3 locked doors. Upstairs is showing great signs of wear and lack of maintence. We had 2 rooms, one twin and one single, both at $80.00 per night each. Rooms are basic, no hand basin or water. Bathrooms, down the hallway, left a bit to be desired. cracked basins, no shower curtains at all. However plenty of hot water and a good supply of water, even if it all finished up all over the floor. At bedtime, beds were comfortabl, and had clean linen on them. Heavy curtains blocked out Street lights, so we slept very well. It could get hot in rooms if weather was hot and sticky. For what we paid, it was acceptable. The location is excellent, Cnr Pitt and Park Streets, very short walk to Town Hall Station. We would stay again if needed to be in centre of Sydney.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLiken this hotel to a third world place,no power, filthy dirty,smelly infested, keep away.\u201d", "Author": "whalley255060", "ReviewID": "UR90850186", "Content": "I booked in for 2 nights.

On our arrival we had such rude service and had to ask the manager how to get to our room and for help with our bags as there was no lift. The bedsheets on the first night had splatters of blood on them and you could see bugs crawling on the walls, curtains and bed. We later discovered that these were bed bugs and when we asked to change rooms we were taken to 3 different ones as they all had bed bugs. Management were disgusting when it came to dealing with it and even refused to pay for medical expenses after 2 trips to the doctor where the bumps turned out to be SCABIES!! The manager had no sympathy for the situation and was completely rude and dismissive, later even denying that we caught scabies from there. Even the staff there said they wouldn't stay there!
