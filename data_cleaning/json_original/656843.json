Very good cleaning and the bathroom is very pleasant. My tip is to sit upon the terrace on the topfloor, have some wine and eat Prosciutto crudo :-). The hotel is situated in a square so of course there is some traffic but me and my husband were not disturbed by that.

This is quite simply a fabulous little gem in the heart of Rome offering excellent value for money, a warm friendly atmosphere and lovely modern fixtures and fittings. I think one of the hotel's huge plus points is the fact there are only 12 rooms, so all the guests are treated like part of the family. With my reviews, I always try to be as objective as possible, but I really can't fault anything about the hotel. From a personal point of view, the bed was a little on the hard side, but that is purely my preference. The only warning I would give is that as the hotel is located at a busy junction, those who are light sleepers may benefit from taking earplugs, but the potential noise is not a reason to skip this hotel when making your selection for accommodation in Rome. The hotel is around 15 - 20 minutes walk along a straight road (so you can't get lost) from Termini (the main train station) and many attractions are within easy walking distance.

Our experience with it was not too memorable; for the money we expected better compared to our other accommodations in Italy. Lack of free Internet is deplorable for this price. We were in room 13 and there were two main issues that bothered us. First, there was something really funky about the ventilation in the bathroom. If we did not close the bathroom door and the AC was running, putrid bathroom odors emerged into the bedroom throughout the night, presumably from other rooms. This was a real distraction to sleep until I discovered that closing the bathroom door fixed the situation (I thought it was coming out of the air conditioner.) Second, the bed was made from two single-size mattresses lashed together, so that the middle of the bed was an uncomfortable jointed section with no support. The mattresses themselves weren't great either. I would expect better for a hotel at this price range.

The room was spacious, clean and new. There was a balcony via our room that wrapped around the corner where we could stand and watch the lovely people, the Roman ruins and the crazy traffic below. The traffic noise is nothing a set of ear plugs can't block out. We loved coming back here mid-day for a little siesta, and just taking it easy after a long day walking around the city - it was a such an oasis for us. The staff we all so positive and helpful and always smiling. That makes all the difference for us. The breakfast was just what we needed, yogurt, breads, cheese and ham with aromatic Italian coffee and steamed milk.

It is situated on a busy Piazza approximately 1 1/4 miles from the Colosseum and the central tourist area that can be reached via a leisurely stroll in about 25 minutes. Alternatively the Piazza is criss-crossed with buses and trams enabling quick and easy access to all parts of Rome once you understand the route numbers. (The front desk can help with this.) Although the hotel is situated directly on the Piazza it does not portray the hotel name and therefore isn't easy to spot. It pays to check it out on Google Street View prior to your visit. We stayed for 6 nights arriving very late on the first night. The front gate was electronically locked but a buzzer on the post soon had it unlocked from within by the night desk porter. He made us very welcome and we were soon unpacking in our rooms. The hotel has three residential floors with about 4 rooms on each. The decor is modern and pleasing and the hotel is spotlessly clean. There is a small area opposite reception where a self-service continental breakfast is provided which is more than sufficient to start you off for the day. The hotel is non-smoking throughout but if you like the occassional puff as I do then take the lift to level 4 which is a lovely little roof terrace overlooking the Piazza where you will find tables and chairs and you may smoke here. This is a lovely place to relax with a glass of cool wine in the evening after a busy day sightseeing. Being just out of the main tourist areas means there is not an abundance of local restaurants but close by on the Piazza there are a couple of local pizza/pasta establishments which are passable but if you want a really nice meal turn right out of the hotel and almost immediately right onto the road leading into central Rome. About 2 or 3 blocks down look for a restaurant with tables spilling out onto the pavement on an avenue leading off to your right. The food and wine here was pure Italian, absolutely delicious and not overly expensive. The hotel has double glazing and very efficent air-conditioning. Being on a busy Piazza there can be a rumble of traffic at peak times but this always sounded distant and was never intrusive and our room was very quiet and comfortable. A small fridge is provided together with a kettle and tea/coffee facilities. The shower room is tiled throughout with a bidet and toilet and the water was always piping hot. I highly recommend this hotel but do bear in mend you cannot step straight out into the Colosseum, you either stroll, as we did several times, or take a short bus ride. Public transport is cheap and if you buy a 16 Euro 7 day pass you can travel anywhere on trams, busses, the metro and trains as much as you like. We took an excursion to Ostia Antica about 25 minutes by train from Rome using the same ticket. (Check out Ostia - it's amazing.) One word of warning when using buses - make sure you know when the last one runs. We stayed late in central Rome one evening only to find our busses had stopped. Don't despair if this happens, we took a taxi back to the Hotel. These are regulated with a meter and only cost us 11 Euros - a fraction of London prices.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Drogheda, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNo room at the Inn!\u201d", "Author": "Berniebobcat", "ReviewID": "UR68980636", "Content": "I booked Hotel Latinum for our recent weekend trip to Rome on the basis of reviews that I had read on several travel websites.

Such a pity that a city with so much history left such a bad impression. We will never go again and my advice would be for nobody else to, but if you must go this hotel is a good choice. Now on to the hotel review..... We arrived at the Termini station at 11 a.m. after 36 hours of traveling. we took the Leonardo express from the airport for 11 euro each. I had previously done a Google Earth search of the hotel and knew that you just had to turn left out of the station and walk down Giovanni Giolitti and you would bump into the hotel at the Porta Maggiore. Alas, it was that simple. A 15 minute walk and we were at the hotel. As others had previously mentioned, there is no signage whatsoever on the hotel, just the number 11, so I'm glad I had seen traveller photos from this site because it made it super easy for me to recognize the building. The iron gate was open when we arrived so we didn't have to use the buzzer. The building itself made a great first impression. A little gem in the middle of a bunch of filth. It was 11:15 and we were praying we'd be able to check in early as we were soo very exhausted but were not expecting to since they only have 12 rooms. We walked down the walkway to the door and the tiny little lobby/ breakfast area is so clean and the glass floor with the ancient ruins underneath is cool! There were two ladies at the front desk who were both very nice and to our surprise our room was ready! As one of them took our info, the other pulled out a map and started to show us how to get to the Manzoni subway station and the stops for the various historical sights around Rome, etc.. I gave them 5 Euro each which I have always found sets a good tone for any trip. :) We took the little elevator to our room #33 and were so impressed at how new everything was. It was obvious they gutted the building and started from scratch. We opened our door and were so glad that the room was as clean and new as the pictures showed. It may sound funny, but that is one of our top priorities! We got to the window and.. cool! we have a balcony! One of only two rooms with one. O.k., time to get clean and take a nap. But not so fast...I expected noise as others had mentioned it before, but even with how well the room is insulated with very thick double pane glass and carpet, it's incredibly loud. Bee boo, bee boo, bee boo, there was a siren every 15 minutes in the daylight hours and about once an hour at night. It seems the Porta Maggiore is a freeway off ramp? When the trains go by the entire building rumbles a bit. You do get used to it though, a \"white noise\" if you will. :) A few other things to mention so you aren't surprised. The beds are very firm, which is what we love and have at home, there is no tub, only a stand up shower, which is what we love and have at home, they didn't change our linens after the 3rd day, so on the 4th we left a note for the housekeeper to change them and she seemed to be taken by surprise, there is no iron / board and there really isn't room for one so we didn't even bother asking for one, there is very little shelf space in the bathroom, the towels are a very thin European type which we grew to LOVE, I didn't get any wifi signal in the room, but I found a free hotspot right past the newsstand around the corner, and yes it's a long walk to anywhere, but Rome is a walking city and I don't think it would be much closer no matter where you stay, don't show up for the breakfast before 7:30 as we did at 7:25 by accident on our first morning and were shooed away by the mean night guy that others have mentioned here, and most importantly, don't forget to tip! Leave a 2 Euro at breakfast, a 2 Euro on the bed for housekeeping etc... it turned the mean night guy into our best friend by the time we left. :) Be sure to go up to the terrace on the roof.

Andrea is the person who helped me make the reservation and was very nice. I did not think I was the greatest candidate for solo travel if public transportation was part of the plan, BUT there right outside the hotel, there is a bus stop, tram stop and taxi stand. This made it so convenient to go anywhere in the city. Literally, every site I visited was reachable within 10-25 minutes. The termini station is 10 minutes and 2 bus stops away and that connects you to anyplace in Rome, the rest of Italy and beyond. I booked a double room for single use, which was a great option....some of the other single rooms I saw from pics at other hotels were literally the size of my closet. Quite the contrary here, there was plenty of space for everything I lugged along with me. The beds were a bit hard, but I have a pillow top mattress at home and anything less is hard to me. The shower had an adjustable shower head and the water was always hot (I take long showers). There is no room service in the hotel but they serve a continental breaakfast daily and have a bar where you can get a drink at any time. The key card operates the remote control to the lights and a/c or heat in the room. Someone else mentioned the person who worked at night - Carmelo...but he was perfectly nice to me and very helpful. The whole staff was very helpful in getting directions to anywhere in the city (and I am directionally challenged). My room was on the 1st floor off the street and there was a bit of noise, but not really early or too late. I did open the window (the breeze at night was so nice), which magnified the noise level by 10, so there was pretty good soundproofing - it was just not completely noise/sound-proof.

Within walking distance to the main historical attractions (the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Nero's Golden House, the Sacred Steps, the Capitoline Museum) yet far enough away from the throngs of tourists that visit the city year-round. The evenings were nice and quiet (the rooms have sound-proof windows) and during the day the bus stopped literally five feet away from the hotel for easy access to tourist areas. My husband and I discovered the wonderful underground Metro system, which allows for daily tickets or these great weekly tickets which provide unlimited use of the Metro for around 18 Euro per week per person. The nearest Metro station (Manzoni) was only a few blocks away and right next to a large supermarket that offered toiletries and of course fresh deli meats and wonderful cheeses (not to mention superb Italian wine) that we would cart back to the hotel for a snack after long days of sight-seeing. I can't say enough about the Metro! We boarded at Manzoni station and within 20 minutes we were outside the walls of Vatican City across the Tiber River! Do mind your bags and wallets, however, as the Metro can get extremely tight and skilled pick-pockets are about. The hotel itself was a beautifully refurbished building with a free continental breakfast every morning (fresh espresso or American coffee, fruit, croissants and other rolls along with deli meats and cheeses), a gorgeous terrace on top of the building that boasted quaint bistro tables and chairs with a neat view of the Porta Maggiore (ancient city walls) and of course a wonderful, friendly staff who were always ready to answer any questions about the sights or to recommend shopping or good restaurants nearby. All-in-all a wonderful stay, and we can't wait to go back in the summer time! The only negative aspect of the hotel that comes to mind were the firm mattresses which, if you have back issues like I do, may cause a bit of soreness but we just took the extra blankets in the closet and softened my side which worked fine. Also, be mindful of the automatic heat system in the rooms. If you don't like it too hot or too cold, be sure to adjust the thermostat in your room immediately upon entry as the heat kicks on automatically when you place your room key card into the slot next to the door (really neat system though). Other than that the stay was wonderful and we were sad to leave! We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples on a honeymoon!", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chalfont, PA", "Title": "\u201cvery cute place\u201d", "Author": "lulush91", "ReviewID": "UR10542175", "Content": "The employees at this hotel were wonderful, especially Andrea and other young women.

I\u2019m glad to say we weren\u2019t disappointed. In fact we were absolutely delighted with our stay there. The room, on the 3rd floor with a balcony, was spotless. The bathroom, with shower and bidet was absolutely pristine. All very nice indeed. House keeping was great with clean towels provided and the room tided, even during our brief 2 night stay there, something that in our experience, not all hotels do when only booked in for a short break. The hotel itself is an older building that\u2019s been renovated to an exceptionally high standard. The English speaking staff were always helpful, courteous and polite. The hotel is on a busy junction but with the shutters and/or door shut you rarely hear any traffic noise at all and it certainly is entertaining to watch how the cars and mopeds dodge each other! The air conditioning worked superbly and was very welcome after a day of visiting the sites and walking around Rome. Whilst the other reviews recommended walking up Via Giovanni Giolitti to get to the Termini I\u2019d recommend walking up Via de Porta Maggiore to the underground station Vittorio (Manzoni underground station was closed) instead, the walk is certainly no longer than walking to the Termini, in fact if anything it\u2019s shorter, and it\u2019s a much nicer walk with (what I\u2019d call) proper Italian coffee bars and shops to look in!

We chose the hotel at short notice based on 1 Trip Advisor review and hoped we had done the right thing. We were not disappointed - the hotel hasn't been open long and is in an older building that has been beautifully restored. The decor is contemporary with carpet on the bedroom floors and dark wood furniture. The air conditioning was most welcome whenever we returned to our room and we had it on throughout the night. There's double glazing so any traffic noise isn't intrusive but it would be noisy if you had the windows open during the day. The bed was firmer than I like but I used a couple of blankets folded under the bottom sheet to soften it. The bathroom was spacious with a great power shower (no bath). The dining area is off the reception area and the inclusive breakfast was continental type with plenty of choice - a bonus as we often stay in hotels where breakfast incurs an additional charge. The staff were welcoming and most helpful if we needed anything. The hotel was located about 1500m down a straight road from the Termini and we found this to be a very convenient location (walking down a parallel street is prettier where there is a supermarket and a famous ice cream parlour). Some of the area around Termini is a bit run down but we felt safe walking back to the hotel in the evenings - and there are plenty of buses and trams that stop right outside the hotel. In overall terms we had a super holiday in Rome and would be happy to recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Latinum", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d656843-Reviews-Hotel_Latinum-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$119 - $219*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazza Porta Maggiore 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "656843", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a3/cb/a3cb708a4e22dc8bdc610f8f4f392c565large.jpg"}}
