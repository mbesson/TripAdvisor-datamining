THIS HOTEL SHOULD NOT BE OPEN!\u201d", "Author": "pauljack40", "ReviewID": "UR127141807", "Content": "Let me start by saying, Me and my mate are two working class blokes who regulary stay in Premier Inn so I am not reviewing this from a top class hotel staying background. (Although I must say Premier Inn is really great!) Right on to the review. We actually got put in this hotel as The Gresham round the corner was overbooked. From the front it looks nice and welcoming and even on the inside foyer it is ok. However, after checking in, we were shown to a room downstairs, through a disused reception room with double beds stacked in the corner like a warehouse, past what looked like a disused dirty kitchen area and through to the back of the building. It was at this point that the women on reception left us to continue on our own way (room 4) and my alarm bells were ringing. Upon opening the door we were greeted by a smell of damp (radiator was off). We put our bags down and looked at each other and started laughing, it was so bad we couldn't do anything but! I have never in all my born days seen anything like this in my life! It was like a seedy bedsit used by call girls and the homeless. The curtain was held up badly by string that didn't draw right across - so let light in. The room itself was filthy. Thick dust on skirting boards, windows, etc. It had a small tv that was ok if you sat near it, but from the bed you needed binoculars to watch it. The worst part was the \"ensuite\" Jesus! It was more like a porto cabin off a campsite welded into the room than a proper ensuite. You opened the door to be met with a smell of damp - Again! Surrounded by plastic walls and floor! Also, the step into the porto cabin was covered in black dirt and mold. It was so small I could hardly sit on the toilet without getting my legs struck against the sink pedestal. There was no plug for the sink and the shower looked minging so I avoided that at all costs. Arn't you supposed to go into a bathroom to get clean clean and refreshed? Not in there! I was in and out like a shot for fear of contracting some airbourne contagious disease lol The bed heads looked like they had been fashioned from a 1970's Indian restaurant closing down sale and the bed spread was worn, old and faded - I think my nan had this cover in 1975 god rest her soul. My bottom sheet had orangey brown stains on it, I am not typing what I think it might be as I don't want to scar anyone else for life like I am. At least the mattress look fairly new - Probably one of the ones taken from the stack in the reception room? Tick there I thought lol As mentioned there was no heating as the radiator was cold and I just assumed it didn't work! As you do! Was freezing in the middle of the night, and it wasn't until the morning that I noticed the main valve had been switched off so I could have turned it! - Dam! Was annoyed with myself for that! On the plus side, me and my mate had a great night out in Soho and then clubbing, we didn't get in till 3 and we left the room by 10am so didn't stay in that long. But be warned! even though we didn't stay long, it will be etched on my memory for life! As a side thought, me and my mate discussed how much we would have paid them had we been visiting from the Chan 4 program \"Four in a bed\" We agreed on \u00a320, purely for location. I said they should have paid me to stay there!!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't go there- it's a complete rip off\u201d", "Author": "Ros B", "ReviewID": "UR126873056", "Content": "We were prepared for something basic but this was beyond imagination for crapola.

No lamps, only an overhead light. Paper thin walls. We were not given a front door key and assumed someone would be on reception through the night. When we arrived just back just before 11pm, it was locked with a mobile number stuck in the window. The woman who took our money was surly to the point of rudeness; her level of English was appalling.

The 'Hotel' IS in a nice part of London; the building from outside is quite attractive ( as in the photo ) but the reality once you get inside the doors is far from that.

However, when we arrived at the hotel I was overwhelmed with the smell of body odour - and I mean really overwhelmed. The decor was very shabby and the place just looked extremely rundown. I went to check in and the man wouldn't take my credit card but asked for cash so I said I'd have to walk to a cashpoint in the snow. He did give me a brolly which was nice. However, he didn't seem happy about letting me leave without paying and suddenly the credit card machine started working. I was so tired I forgot my PIN and he said 'well how were you going to take money out the cash machine then?' This was a valid question but it was said in an accusatory way. I explained I'd have used my debit card to which he said I could use it at the hotel. Basically the whole rundown look of the place made me nervous entering my PIN for my bank account whereas at least with a creditcard if you get cleared out it's easier to get the money back. Anyway I paid and the man opens a door leading down to a seedy looking, damp smelling basement and told us our rooms were down there. I actually felt quite scared and was worried about being kicked down there and locked in! A Japanese couple who were also checking in got quite upset and the women said she wouldn't go down so they left. Our room was horrible. The bed had massive springs poking out, there was no heating/radiator on despite it being below zero outside, it smelt of damp, the electric socket looked unsafe as it wasn't completely covered, there was one thin sheet and a stained blanket for warmth, the walls were thin and we could hear talking throughout the night. I could go on! I don't normally moan about hotels as I've stayed in basic ones in lots of different countries but this hotel was beyond basic. There was no excuse for how horrible it was and at \u00a360 a night I'd have rather paid an extra \u00a320 and stayed somewhere better. It's funny that the worst hotel I have ever stayed in happens to be in my own country. Needless to say my husband and I didn't sleep well at all as we were huddled for warmth and we left at 6am just to get out of there.

The type of room which we had pre-booked some months previously (double room with en-suite) was unavailable due to plumbing issues, and we agreed to look at a twin room before deciding whether to stay or not. We were given the key to room 26, which was next to room 33 bizarrely enough, and made it very difficult to find. On entering the room we were struck by the sweltering heat, the lack of any bed linen and the general scruffiness of the room itself, which had a dirty carpet (like the rest of the place). While trying to find the room we were struck by the poor state of repair of the hotel in general, and the grimy feel of the place, not to mention the uneven floors and a the general lack of any Fire safety, if that place catches light it would be very difficult to get out. The lady on reception was actually fairly helpful, obviously well practiced in the art of fielding complaints/ dealing with refunds. She even offered to provide a free taxi to another Hotel which we declined as it was probably of a similar standard to the Lonsdale! I would guess that this establishment is the sort of place where asylum seekers are housed temporarily while their cases are handled.

Cons: Very poor service, rude staff, dirty & dusty, old & decrepit, no security. We arrived at check-in time (3:00 pm) and were provided with our room key. Climbed the stairs (no elevator) to the 3rd floor, used towels, used bed sheets, even buckets with cleaning products strewn throughout the corridors creating many obstacles / trip hazards / hazardous substances particularly for children. This was the same on all floors... Arrived at our room to find the door already wide open with a used towel being used as a door wedge. Suffice it to say, the room wasn't ready for us. Cracked walls, chipped paint, worn out smelly old carpet. The state of the room, and the mess in the corridors gave the impression that the cleaner(s?) had suddenly stopped what they were doing and ran off in an emergency! There was no one around at all, so had to return to reception to complain. Was fed a load of rubbish and excuses, and had to demand another room. Cancellation was not an option as we were refused a refund. Our new room was ready this time, but the general condition was the same. The whole place is very OLD and is in desperate need of refurbishment. The cleaners only make the beds with fresh sheets which are clean, and provide fresh towels which are also clean (the Lonsdale's only positive note). The cleaners do nothing more it seems, as the whole place is caked with dust and is quite drab. The showers are dirty and mouldy, a warning for allergy sufferers such as myself. Receptionists hand over the keys to ANY room, no questions asked. Went in and asked for the keys to three separate rooms at once (for family members not present) and they were quickly provided with nothing said. The front door to the street is ALWAYS kept ajar, despite a sign on the outside asking for guests to ring the bell to gain entry. The shared toilet for the non en-suite rooms on our floor was not resupplied with toilet paper and ran out. My wife advised the receptionist who had the cheek to hand a roll to her expecting HER to re-stock the toilet herself!!! My wife explained that we were actually just going out, and when we returned later that afternoon, the toilet paper had still not been replenished. Again, my wife advised the two lazy receptionists, one of whom said \"Oh yes, this is the lady who wanted the toilet paper\". My wife responded \"No! I told you that the first floor wants more toilet paper, and YOU can take it up\". Still, the receptionists tried to hand the roll over to us. Still no paper in the toilets the following morning... The images of the hotel give a false impression in my opinion. The images of the rooms look much nicer than what we saw during our stay.

The hotel didn't seem to be as bad as pictured in many other reviews at first. I have stayed in worse hotels before, meaning less clean and uglier. The room was basic and not particularly beautiful, but it seemed reasonably clean. The first thing I did was check the mattrass for signs of bedbugs, that is small blood stains, but couldn't see any. But the second night, before going to bed, I checked the bedclothes again and I could see three small blood stains...which looked very suspicious. Apart from this, they were cleaning the room everyday, and we always got clean towels. The toilet and showers were not particularly clean, but also not particularly dirty. Acceptable, I would say. The people at the reception were always very friendly. All in all, when I left I thought it was not as bad as I had expected. But 4 days after coming back home, I noticed that bites started to appear all over my left arm, and on my feet. I had never had bedbugs bites before, but I am quite sure that these are indeed bedbugs bites. I have lots of them, appearing in the shape of a line, one on the top of the other. I read on the internet that as opposed to mosquito bites, bedbugs bites always appear in a cluster. And they tend to itch much more, which is what I am experiencing now. The thing is, I really hope I didn't bring them home... All in all, I think it was a terrible mistake to go to the Lonsdale Hotel. It's cheap and central, but keep in mind that you will be sharing your room with tons of bedbugs.

The hotel staff, who were rude and generally unhelpful (didn't even have managers contact details to give us), told us to come back half an hour later and the rooms would be ready. Asked about leaving our bags there and were told just to set them on the floor. They was no where secure to put them. On arrival back at the hotel we were informed that wehad been given another room, even though we had agreed to change this before. Therefore we ended up paying for a room we actually didn't need. One room was blocked with towels preventing people getting into it. The en-suites are tiny (look like a built in wardrobe). Window's wouldn't stay open and as the heating was on all day you were returning to an uncomfortable room. No proper blankets for the bed. Only one thin pillow per bed, you may as well be lying with your head on the mattress. Locks looked as if they had been broke.

We weren't expecting a five star hotel for the price but we were at least expecting the rooms we had booked! I received a phone call from the hotel around an hour and a half before we were able to check in at 1500. They were just confirming the number of rooms and type that we had booked. They never mentioned that there might be problems ahead for us. We headed for the hotel early to try and leave our baggage in before check in time. When we arrived they confirmed that we would have to wait until 1500 to check in. This was fine as that is what we expected. But then I was told that a single ensuite I had booked was no longer available so it would be a single basic (with shared bathroom facilities). This wasn't ideal but we convinced ourselves it would be okay. Then we were told that we would be in 2 family rooms, the single room, and a triple ensuite. - 4 rooms in total not the five I had booked (2 x twin ensuites, 1 single ensuite, 1 double ensuite and a triple basic) This essentially meant that people who should have had there own room would have to share with friends. After a considerable amount of arguing we worked out that the price would now be less since we didn't have all the rooms we had booked. But then we were told we would not be able to check in until after 1700 rather than 1500. That in itself was unacceptable as we had to be leaving the so called 'hotel' after 1600 to get back into town. Then the time miraculously came down to 1530 when we could check in. I also asked for a discount for the lack of an ensuite with the single room now to be told \u00a35.00 a night is all they could throw off the price - a grand total of \u00a310.00 of a reduction - wow very generous of them! I also asked to speak with a manager to be told he had already been that morning and probably wouldn't be back at the hotel over the weekend. On asking if they could not phone or contact them the receptionist said they did not have contact details for him (which I believe was a blatant lie). We also asked to see a room but were told we could not because they were being cleaned. We headed to a local pub to wait on check in and grab some food after being told they would phone us. No call came. We returned to the 'hotel' at approx 1550. We could now check in but the price had returned to normal as they had moved a guest to another hotel and gave us an extra room that we didn't have the people to fill! We ended up paying for a room that was empty all weekend. The young man at reception said that now we got what we wanted 5 rooms again. After thinking and accepted that we would have to share for a cheaper price this only infuriated us again. It was an absolute disgrace. Unfortunately for us we were stuck. Having flown into England only hours before and knowing hotels in the area and London generally were already fully booked we had no option but to reluctantly pay for the rooms they were giving us. It is amazing that they didn't keep the rooms we booked online free rather than having to move us to a rooms we didn't want nor book. Using an excuse that one room had been flooded. That doesn't explain us getting none of the rooms we booked. The rooms themselves were basic to say the least. Falling apart - damp on the walls, window frames rotten - a light missing it's fluorescent tube but no measures taken to make it look at all safe. Nails protruding from the wall. Basically sheets as covers for the beds. Not even a wardrobe. When they made out our receipt they had listed on it the original rooms that we had booked not the replacements they had forced upon us. It therefore seems as though we payed for the rooms we wanted which is not the case. I honestly don't think the staff cared at all about our situation. As long as they were taking our money. This place should be closed down - how it has ever managed to pass any inspection is a mystery to me. Really put our trip to London off to a bad start. Would never go back there again.

We paid \u00a378.18 (between us) for each of the 2 nights we stayed, which was a very good price for the location. We were located in room 4 on the ground floor. The twin room itself although clean was very dated small and smelled a little \"fusty\". The private bathroom it is more of a converted cupboard which housed a toilet, sink and shower tray with curtain. The ceramics & fitments, although clean and working exhibited lots of wear and tear and the whole hotel looked a little tired and neglected. We had to ask for toilet roll as there was none in the room, and some was left in reception for us (not sure why they couldn't put it in our room for us). The room had 2 single beds, a desk (but no chair), a small portable TV (no remote), and a wardrobe with shelf and hanging space (although only 1 hanger). There were spare blankets in the wardrobe (which was great as the room was very cold when we arrived). There was a radiator which did get warm but it didn't pump out much heat after we turned it on. The lighting in the room was very poor. Fresh bath towels, hand towel and soap were provided each day (which is just as well as there was no where really to hang anything damp..) . There was a toilet right outside our room which proved quite handy when both my and my friend needed to use the facilities at the same time. There was only member of reception staff on shift at a time and they were polite and attentive, although not always able to man the reception (I'm guessing due to other duties/rest breaks) so we had to hang round for a few minutes one night until they returned to their station before we could get our room key. They do have left luggage (free) which is very handy and much cheaper option than leaving it at Kings X left luggage (\u00a38 per item per day) Check in is advertised as 15:00, we arrived early with the intention of leaving our luggage but as our room was ready we were able to check in early. check out is advertised as 11:00, We checked out at 10 and left our luggage and were able to collect it much later at about 17:30. Hotel was mainly chosen for the location & proximity to attractions (10 minute walk from Euston/St Pancreas/Kings X) very close to Russell Sq underground, on the doorstep of the British Museum, 5 minutes from Oxford street/Dominion theatre/Soho). The Original Bus Tours stop on Bedford place and the Big Bus Company stops around the corner. The Hotel is fine if you want an inexpensive hotel stay and will not be spending much time in the hotel itself.

I found the hotel on-line, and booked directly with the hotel (they did not take internet bookings at that time). The room was clean, bright, not too small, the breakfast was ample, and the desk staff were most helpful. We arrived early, and they actually let us use another room to get cleaned up and changed so that we could go out and about while we waited for our room to be made up. Like in a traditional B&B, there was no lift, and we did not have a toilet in our room, but then again, being realistic about what we were paying for a room in the high season in the centre of London, we did not expect these. The staff helped us with information about the neighbourhood and local transportation. Located near the British Museum, the area was lively and safe, walking distance to almost everything, and very well connected to several tube lines. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay.

We stayed for one night after coming down from the Midlands to see a musical in the West End and it was very convenient for that. That, however, is one of the few good things you can say about it. The staff was generally surly and uncommunicative and entirely foreign - some spoke very poor English. The first room we were given had no headboards on the bed and stank of stale cigarette smoke - despite our requesting a non-smoking room. The second room was very hot (radiators on full and no way of turning them down) and the light in the bathroom didn't work. We were assured that this would be fixed, and in all fairness both were fixed quickly. However, although the radiators were off the room remained very warm; it was not a cold night and we had to have the window wide open all night, which made it rather noisy. The furniture and fittings were barely adequate - many items were cracked, old and poorly maintained. The carpets were shabby and frayed. The 'ensuite bathroom' was a cabinet installed in one corner of the room and while clean enough was very cramped; there was hot water, as long as you worked out that the shower had to be turned towards the cold end to get hot! The room wasn't too dirty, but could certainly have been better. The television worked, but wasn't tuned into any stations. Breakfast was adequate (bacon, sausages, fried eggs, toast, orange juice, tea), but kept running out and had to be replenished (slowly) by very surly kitchen staff. There was only one flavour of jam and no sauces at all. All in all, not a particularly pleasant experience and I'm glad we only stayed one night - I certainly wouldn't have stayed any more. \u00a375 per night may be cheap for London, but it is still not exactly cheap and I expect much more for my money.

Well, what can I say...a weekend in London planned and we booked in here for two nights. Arrived late on Friday evening to find out that out double en-suite room was in fact a double room, with a shower cubicle within the room and a shared toilet along the corridor. The carpet was terrible - looked like it had been scrateched by a cat, the furniture was very basic and very shabby. The bedspread was threadbare, the decor in desperate need, oh and one towel between two of us. In normal circumstances I would have asked for an additional towel and asked about their understanding of the word 'ensuite', but the shock and horror of seeing the room just overcame us. Things were so bad, we were nervous about taking our shoes off....the only thing we could think was that we wouldn't be staying the two nights that we had paid for....but we were just too tired to do anything about it there and then. On the positive side, the bed linen was very clean and the bed very comfortable, but the moment we woke, we washed and went on the serach of new accomodation....at any price! We skipped breakfast at the 'hotel' and ate in a lovely cafe in Russell Square. After asking around at a few hotels, everywhere seemed fully booked, but one hotel booked us in at a hotel in the City (not really where we wanted to be, but anywhere, anywhere was better than another night at the Lonsdate!!), back to the Lonsdale, collected our bags and ran to the nearest tube station. We felt like two school children running away!!! It was so dire that we didn't even stop to ask for our money back for the second night, the relief of knowing we could stay somewhere else was so enormous!! Once across town, we checked into a fab hotel and immediately showered and changed....Saturday morning all but over, but the rest of the weekend was excellent, however, without a sense of humour and the cash to book somewhere else, it could have been a right disaster! My advice - if you're looking for a Bed and Breakfast that you are willing to pay over the top for, then this is the place, but don't believe what you see when you look at the booking options....I am sure with a lick of paint and some decent furniture this could be an OK place, but if its a cheap hotel you're after you'll get far better value for money at a Travelodge or Travel Inn and at least you know what you're getting.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cB Y F A R T H E W O R S T H O T E L I ' V E E V E R B E E N I N\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3178953", "Content": "I wish I'd found this web site and read these reviews BEFORE I stopped in this sorry excuse for a Hotel.
