Overall: Great value for price in a good location not far from main attractions and sights in Berlin I would definitely recommend this one, but wish I could rate it 3.5 star instead of 3 or 4 because it's not quite one or the other to me. Positives: -Very polite and friendly staff that actually smiled (bit of an issue for some German venues) with easy checkiin and check-out -Only a minute or two walk from the underground/subway/tube stop, only two stops from Friedrichstrasse, which has good access to most destinations around Berlin, and not far at all from the Brandenberg Gate (about 10 minutes away by underground) -Whenever we left and came back, there were always people in the lobby bar. We didn't have drinks in the bar ourselves but took this as a good sign and hints at good bartender service as well. -Excellent bathroom and shower and bathroom supplies. In our room (room 341), we had little bottles of shampoo, bath gel, and lotion, but shampoo was also in a dispenser in the shower, meaning you had virtually an endless supply! -Good security in that you cannot use the lift unless you use your room key -Because it wasn't quite in the center of everything, we welcomed the slower pace on the street. -An excellent chinese restaurant next to the hotel with very reasonable prices -A very reasonably priced middle eastern (gyros and souvlaki) restaurant across the street and just south of the subway stop -A tram (M6) that runs late into the night and runs right on the street of the hotel -Our room was fairly quiet and looked into the roof/courtyard Negatives (or \"Could-be-betters\") -The hotel sign is a little bit on the small side, so the close proximity to the subway stop is slightly dwarfed by the fact that you have to walk about 20 meters before you see the sign. There are also other bright signs that will block your view of the hotel sign so not all their fault. -Beds were hard and we requested a double room and ended up with two singles pushed together. Not sure if this is the norm in German/European hotels but it wasn't a huge issue as the two beds didnt wander away from each other very easily. -The room was a bit cold as we stayed in December. I tried to turn up the heat but the thermostat was set to max out at 25 C, which is ok if it hits that temperature. But as we had two single beds, we also had two single blankets which were narrow and hard to keep some of the cold out. -The street is a bit dark (perhaps we were spoiled by the Christmas lights in the main city squares) and the neighborhood was usually a bit too quiet with the occasional streetperson (but we found this around Berlin so I don't think this was only on our street)", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best bargains ever\u201d", "Author": "PerryM", "ReviewID": "UR121592428", "Content": "It's hard to believe that we paid just 55 euros a night for our room at the Tryp.

The bathroom is designed for six foot five baldies.The main shower head being the very modern \"rain forrest\"type.No shower caps provided so I had to use the smaller conventional shower head.The mirror is miles away from where you stand at the wash basin & is to high to dry your hair at.Thats fine if you use the hotel drier as it wouldn't dry my hair in an hour anyway. You need to stand on a box to look downwards into the shaving/make up mirror.Great for shaving to top of you head,not so good for under your chin. Oh and there is no light in the walk in shower,it has an opaque window into the bedroom.Fine if you shower at 10 am on a sunny day.Not so good when its dark outside.Poor shower cream & no body lotion rounds off the complaints. I made the girlfriend iron my shirts first night.She reports the iron is very good(Her report on me is not as glowing) So the room is almost but not quite very nice. The bar & breakfast area looked like an airport lounge.I only ever walked through it so it didn't matter to me.The bar seems to close early too or maybe I just got in late every night. Transport links are all first rate.M6 tram at 50 metres.U6 at 200metres & the Nordbahnhof just around the corner.Maybe ten minutes walk if you are slow. Berlin is a city full of bakers & coffee shops and you can find a breakfast to suit every price range not far from the Tryp.Hotel breakfast prices are a bit of a sore point with me.It is fair to say that I would never be using the Tryp's offering at 16 euro.Maybe it is very good? To sum up then.Lots of people will like the Tryp.I almost did and at the price I paid it was good value.Having stayed down the road at the Melia I can't help puzzling how they are both four star hotels.I would rate the Tryp 3star & the Melia 5.See what you think", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - right opposite the U Bahn\u201d", "Author": "saz-up-north", "ReviewID": "UR116577548", "Content": "Myself, husband, sister and her partner stayed at the Tryp Berlin for a long weekend in July.

Beautiful, new, modern, clean & modern hotel with polite & helpful staff. Hotel is less than a year old so feels very new & clean. Decor of the rooms was spot on & very trendy & modern, with some nice flooring & no cheap stuff. Nice LCD Samsung TV in each room & roomy power shower in bathroom. My room was facing the rear so it was nice & quiet & tranquil at all times. Downstairs in reception they have a bar which is open all day until late (about 2 or 3am). Bar only ever had a few people staying at hotel there at any time. So not very lively, but nice still. They have a clean & modern dining area right next to reception but never got to eat as we were out every night partying. But quite high food prices did put us off eating there in first place anyway. For instance breakfast was 16 euros (which is about \u00a316 nowadays!) which was pretty expensive for a buffet. And a coffee was about 2 & a half Euros (about \u00a32.50). So about Starbucks prices for a little cup. Hotel is very centrally located. It's not slap bang in the middle of the hustle & bustle of Berlin but it is very, very near to travel to. About 20 mins walk or 10 mins by underground train & the train station is 5 mins walk away. Only very minor quibble was one morning we did have a bit of breakfast. Not the full 16 euro one but a 6 euro one where they let you have a bit of meat & cheese & one roll & a cup of coffee. We had that & as I was eating I noticed what looked like a little flea (or could be a fly) crawling over my sandwich. I called the young waitress & she just sort of said \"yes, and?\" I was expecting her to refund me in full for the breakfast but she just said \"yes we do get a few fleas here sometimes\". My friends thought I was making something out of nothing but I'm not really used to eating fleas for breakfast! That could have been just a one off & to be fair the waitress was only about 18 & looked quite inexperienced hence she didn't react how I expected or wanted her to. They claim to have a gymn at this hotel which I found on the top floor. It's really just one running machine, one bike, one multi gymn & a couple of free weights & a sauna room & that's it. It's quite a small room too. So don't expect a proper well equipped gymn as the gymn here was just basic. Another thing which may be of interest is this hotel is part of a Spanish-owned chain. So the hotel had loads of Spanish staying there. Being half Spanish myself that was a big bonus as I got to speak Spanish with some of the other guests & they were all very friendly, polite & respectfull (as the Spanish naturally are!). So apart from the expensive food & drink & the odd flea, this was a brilliant hotel & if I go back to Berlin (as I'm hoping to soon), I'd definately stay here again as I loved it.

We are regular tripadvisor followers and have had \"trip anxiety\" on occasion over the years as a result of some wayward reviews so hopefully you will find this an honest and positive account of the hotel. The room was lovely, nice and new and the bathroom was fantastic with stone tiles and a big shower. We would have preferred a double bed to the two (very large) twins pushed together but it was not a problem for us and I slept like a baby every night - I'm sure they would have changed if asked as don't think the place was too full. The beds are firm but very very comfy and supportive in my opinion. The only real negative was that, on very rare occasion, there was a sewage smell in the bathroom but the occasional whiffs seem to be a city-wide problem and I was glad for future trips to see they appear to be working on the sewer systems. So I don't think this is anything you could blame the hotel for and I think it only really affected us on one morning. However I haven't stayed in Berlin before so I don't know if any other hotels have experienced this. If it was a hotel problem i'd have expected it to be constant. Anyway regressing back a bit we arrived on the U-bahn and were delighted to be just a few strides from the hotel door. The check in process took 2 minutes and the desk staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. I don't know why people had negative staff experiences, I can't say I usually try for much interaction with hotel receptions other than checking in/out and getting a map, and for this they were brilliantly friendly and efficient. different staff on each shift generally said hello or have a good day or something as you walked past them even if not approaching them, which was nice, so don't think negative staff reviews are representative at all of the hotel. Barman was also friendly and beer as good value as anywhere else if you fancy a nightcap. We did not eat in the hotel - you don't need to due to great range in the city although the dinners looked to be decent value (not sure why the \u20ac16 breakfast though). The rooms were cleaned and well made up every day with new towels, one morning after a late night I forgot to put the \"do not disturb\" on the door and at least 3 different housekeeping staff knocked on it in the space of half an hour or so, so they are definitely keen to clean! Neighbourhood nice and quiet. To underground station - 1 minute. Walking to nearest cluster of bars etc - 10 mins (or one stop on the underground). Schoenfeld Airport via trains around 1h depending on time of day, inc 2 station changes \u20ac3 for a single ABC region ticket. Particularly good places (although everywhere good value and all food superb that we had) - Schwarzwaldstuben (and the place over the road, forget name), Chipps Serious Eating, Barcomi's Deli, Hasir, Gambrinus, that's just the food! If you don't fancy more cocktails and German beer and want a cop-out night, Kilkenny's Irish bar has great live bands and (my husband's fav) cider, which is relatively hard to come by.

However, because it is so new, not many businesses in the area actually know of it's existence. Part of my reason for selecting this hotel was it's proximity to the U-Bahn (just 1 min from Naturkunde Museum), in the summer it is not visible from the exit as ithe sign is obstructed by foliage. So I would recommend exiting from the lift, crossing the road to the LHS and then taking a left for maybe 100m, you'll then see the hotel. The hotel is on fact located directly opposite the junction of Chausseestrasse and Habersaathstrasse. If you get as far as Subway / Balzac Coffee / the junction with Invalidenstrasse, you have headed in the opposite direction to the hotel. The location of the hotel was fine, I'm happy to walk everywhere anyway and it was just 5 mins to the junction with Friedrichstrasse (Orianenburger Tor U-Bahn. There is plenty of nightlife close by, and Berlin is a very safe city, but the location meant that the road was quieter in the evenings than more central hotels. I wouldn't recomend walking north of the hotel, it is just on the edge of the centre and there is nothing going on beyond, although there is considerable construction (new hotels??). The hotel reception was open and spacious, with a modern bar. The male staff members were welcoming and informative, but I think some of the female staff perhaps needed a bit more training, they neither particularly friendly nor efficient, but this is a very minor niggle. What it did mean was that reception could be very busy when patrons arrived concurrently. I was allowed to check in before time (12.30pm) but my request for an upgraded room away from the road could only be met if I checked in after 3pm, and I was happy with what I was given as I'm not bothered by traffic noise. If you are, you should be aware that the road outside is reasoinably busy, and that the tram runs right outside too! (The premium rooms are on the 6th flr, so I'm guessing that the hotel is cleaned from the bottom to top). I was happy with my double room, which was comfortable and stylish although minimalist, there was a nice mini-bar with space for additional small bottles although the safe's positioning on top of this was I think a design error as the contents became rather hot. The bed was large and comfortable, and their were both privacy and blackout blinds. As noted in previous posts, the bathroom was lovely, the shower in particular was well-designed, designed not to flood no matter what the angle of the showerhead, and the tiles dried quickly. The hairdryer was much better than expected, it did well to tame my curly mass. I was very mindful of the cleaning, in fact housekeeping asked me whether they could clean my room just 1 hr after I had arrived, which wasn't necessary, Based on that, I left the do not disturb sign on my room whenever I was in it, and staff were generally unobtrusive. The toiletries were fine, but could be eratically replaced. The gym on the 6th floor was small but more than adequate, and importantly accessible 24/7. The sauna had more restricted times (6am-10pm I think), and required a member of staff to be informed before using these outside these times. I didn't try the bar or dining facilities, but would say that E3.00 for a cup of coffee is not a lot to pay compared to the prices charged by the numerous coffee shops in Berlin. The only thing that I would change would be the cost of the wi-fi, it would have been preferable to me if this had been offered foc. The nearest free wi-fi point I located was at a cafe on Invalidenstrasse, 3 mins away and just down from the Mercure Hotel, but this never seemd to be open! Starbucks gives 2 free hours of wifi, the nearest branch is on Frierichstrasse (just past the station on the LHS of the road, a 10 min walk away) although Balzac Coffee is actualy far tastier! I would also highly recommend the Michelin-starred Weinbar Rutz which is just down the road, and avoiding the Bellini Lounge on Orianenburger Strasse. Berlin is a fantastic 24-hr city, the negatives I have mentioned are very minor niggles, and did not detract from my great experience at this hotel.

There was some roadworks immediately outside the front which made things a little difficult when we arrived with our car but we used the hotel car park which was very secure if a little expensive at EUR15.00 a day. The hotel itself resembles an up market Travelodge or Premier Inn with a modern design but even after only a couple of months of opening it is already showing signs of wear and tear which I think means the place could look a little run down within a year or so. Check-in was quick and the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was nicely decorated with a lovely bathroom, the shower was great but no matter how careful we were the bathroom did get flooded every time. The mini bar was extortionately priced and we were charged for something although we never used it but the reception staff waived the cost with no doubt. The beds were great and the room was quiet so we managed to get a really good nights sleep even though the room overlooked the main road. The room was let down by not having tea or coffee making facilities and upon asking we were told they are only available in the Premier rooms. The breakfast buffet was good value for money (for some reason we were only charged EUR10.00 per person). There was a really good selection but the food from the hot plate was only luke warm and the cereals were of cheap quality (which seems typical in German hotels). Not sure if it was an extreme means of portion control but they only had tea spoons and tiny tongs to serve food rather than large serving spoons which is not ideal when trying to get a bowl of grapes and you can only pick up one at a time. There was no restaurant but just an area off the main reception and lobby bar. The seating was set up in an informal way that was equivalent to that in a work or school canteen so you were seated in rows next to each other which doesn't seem in keeping with a 4 star establishment.

I booked a flight + hotel package through a website but needed to adjust the booking slightly shortly before my stay. I emailed the hotel directly to adjust the booking and they did so without any problems, replying to me within a day. The location of the hotel is very convenient to the U-bahn station which provides easy access to all of Berlin. Confusingly the U-bahn station must have changed its name fairly recently as some maps still had its old name \"Zinnowitzer Strasse\", its now called \"Naturkundesmuseum\". The area isn't the most glamourous, its very much on the edge of the city centre and a little rough around the edges but we (2 fairly big guys in our late twenties) felt fairly safe at all hours of the day and night. Its location is made by the proximity of the U-bahn but it is also only maybe 15 minutes walk from Friedrichdtrasse Bahnhof and 5 minutes from bars and restaurants at Orananienburgerstrasse. Service at the reception and the bar in the hotel was excellent. The bar workers in particular were very friendly. The bar generally had a few people hanging about, a few groups at times, but generally the lobby was pretty quiet and relaxed. The rooms were certainly not dirty but I did find a few stray long dark hairs that certainly weren't mine in the bathroom. They're modern and comfortable and the wooden floors were not as cold as I thought they would be. Our room was at the back of the hotel so I could open the window but at the front of the hotel this would probably be quite noisy. There was some construction work going on in the next building but it didn't cause us any problems. I didn't use the restaurant for any meals but the 16 euro breakfast is a bit expensive, a cheaper smaller option would be appreciated. All in all I'd say the hotel is decent, I'm not sure if its 4-star but its certainly modern and comfortable.

Great bar in the foyer. Brilliant location (walkable to central district & train station. Tube is directly outside). Restaurant food is excellent for breakfast & dinners - a wee bit expensive for food though (although at least at breakfast there's an amazing buffet big enough to keep you going until dinner time!!). The staff are friendly, helpful and generally really lovely people. Check in was prompt. We were placed in a very large & most impressive premier room on the 4th floor (it was just luck, we didn't request it) where we presented with a huge 4-man very comfortable bed (big enough for both of you to 'starfish')!!! Great showers (2 in one beautifully tiled enclosure) & an OK hair dryer (not great power, but did the job). There is also a coffee/tea maker in the premier rooms. Issue 1-this is NOT replenished when the room is serviced, so you need to ask reception every time you run out of tea, coffee or the milk sachets. There is also a gym & sauna on floor 6. The gym is small but has a great range of machines and an exercise Mat. Issue 2 - when in use, you could hear the treadmill from our room! Kind of annoying if you want a lie-in & there's someone pounding away at 7.30 in the morning. A dull Bang, bang, bang was heard on several mornings.....The hotel should think about sound proofing the gym area. There are 2 lifts and a flight of stairs. Issue 3 - Guests are not permitted to use 1 of the lifts (opposite the premier room) - (if you try to get to 'Ground') you end up in the laundry area on the ground floor, although you can get to reception through a side door entering the restaurant. We were told off (very nicely I must say) by one of the waiters that this lift/door was for staff only. Also, if you want to work off some of your beers and apfel strudel the stairs are a 'no go' - you end up in the same laundry area!! The hotel should clearly mark that this lift / stairwell is for staff use only. As in most hotels the rooms are serviced every day - this consisted ( i think) of fresh towels and a wipe around the sink. Issue 4 - the bed making is pretty poor to be honest (I am being too picky??) - the duvet often looked very crumpled (I'm sure on one day it wasn't touched at all) & I'm not sure that the floors were well cleaned. A bit sloppy on the room servicing front, but fine if perhaps room rates are kept low as a consequence (or if this is to save on using harmful detergents)- this should be made clear to patrons though. And finally, Issue 5 - they use huge metal crates to shift the dirty linen - they are loud. Ironically base camp for these crates was opposite our 'premier' room. (the door to this room with the crates was generally open & not that aesthetically pleasing) . So we also had crashing and banging noises some mornings from the laundry crates. Despite these issues, I have rated the hotel highly. I would definitely go back. It has huge potential - we're just telling you about this minor issues - so you can become even more brilliant going forward! x", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "saarbruecken, Germany", "Title": "\u201cperfect stay\u201d", "Author": "mhbusby", "ReviewID": "UR89772909", "Content": "location is nearly perfect.
