The hotel is woefully understaffed. Asking anything of reception is pointless as they don't have a clue. Wifi only works in reception and is a bit piece unsecured network. According to the girl on reception it was our 2 iPhones and laptops that were to blame! The rooms smell of stale smoke as they are interlinked by the same ventilation system. If you are a non-smoker I strongly advise you don't stay here as you will smell like a 60 a dayer after one night. The man on reception told us it was impossible that the room could smell of cigarettes as if we were having him on. Terrible customer service. Whilst the area is safe the hotel doesn't feel secure. There was only one person working in the hotel after midnight and he was away from reception delivering room service. Fire doors onto the street remain permanently open to any passer by. It may not be central London where I come from but they're very trusting I'll give them that. The rooms exclude some bizarre amenities. For example there's nowhere to throw rubbish away, leave it out and the cleaner will leave it too! Don't bother with the TV as its mainly static! Furniture has seen better days, needs some investment to get it back up to standard. I obviously had much higher expectations with regards the price and star rating.

Our room looked out onto the big hills where the telecomunication tower is and also there is a big cathedral and some sort of theme park on the hills too because at night around 9 o'clock the cathedral lights up and the big wheel's lights go on,so amazing to just lay in bed while trying to get over to sleep and just watch all the pretty lights. The corridors in the hotel were very fancy, the doors are kind of hidden in the walls and you get a card which you need to put into the door then you hear a click and it pushes inwards into the room. The room itself was very modern and fancy. to operate the lights you have to put your room card into the wall of the door then the air conditioning and lights will be able to work. the air conditioning was quite tricky to work but you can adjust the temprature of it which is good. The blinds at the windows were so cool!the buttons to operate the blinds are by you bedside( and also there are buttons at ur bedside to put all the lights off in the room so you don't need to get up to put off lights you've forgotten about!). there are two blinds- one that has holes in it so that when u have it down people outside can't see in but you can see out then the second blind that is a blackout. you can press a button that puts both down at the same time to save you time at night having to put both down seperately. There is a roof terrace on top of the hotel (although me and my boyfriend who i went with weren't sure if the terrace was private for the one room that has a hot tub in the hotel but whenever we went up no one batted an eye lid). it had the most amazng views you can see for miles and miles i recomend you go up there if ur staying at the hotel!you can even see the sea if you stand at a certain bit!. the room service was very good as well, no troubles ordering it or recieving it and the ingredients were always extremely fresh and tasted really good and healthy. breakfast was EXTREMELY expensive though i wouldn't reccomend it unless you don't have any other choice. there is a supermarket in sarria where we got cans of juice to take back to save us having to buy them from the minibar The Metro station is barely 5 minutes away from the hotel and then is only about 7 minutes if that away from the centre of barcelona and the trains are very very frequent and are never late or delayed. the station is extremely hot though but when you get onto the metro it is air conditioned. we mostly went into the centre of barcelona for meals but there is a pizza hut about 10 mins away from the hotel room and they have no problem with u bringing food back to the hotel or even ordering something for you to be delivered from the hotel. it has a laptop in the foyer that you can use whever you like and it has a really good fast internet connection. all the rooms come with free wifi if im not mistaken but don't take my work on it. safes inside the room are in the wardrobe and is very easy to use but if (like us) you aren't sure how to first work it then if you just call the reception desk they are very helpful. any problems and most of the staff speak good english. there was the odd member of staff who wasn't very helpful and couldn't speak english very well but they were usually always on with another member of staff who could speak english. This was me and my boyfriend's ( we're both 18) first holiday away outside of the uk and we were so happy with it. not at all scary or over whelming. I would deffinitly recomend this hotel for anyone who was thinking of staying in barcelona. the area we stayed in was called Sarria.

The room is as nice and hightech as you get in 5* hotels and is nicely decorated and clean. The barthroom area is separated by a see through glass wall, so while fine for couples may be a problem for some. There is a small swimming pool with a pleasant loan and deckchairs in a nice garden. Unfortunately the hotel is quite a bit of a walk to the underground station and there is nothing much around the hotel. Great place to stay if you get around by taxi but if you walk / use public transport I would suggest staying nearer to the city centre.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "mich_cra_holidays", "ReviewID": "UR8236577", "Content": "My Boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights starting on 13th July 2007. We found the hotel perfect for what we were looking for. Yes, it is slightly out of town but I think that wherever you stay in Barcelona you will end up getting the metro at some point so this didnt bother us. The closest metro stop was a 10min walk (MAX) and we bought a T10 metro ticket which was excellent value. We also got the open top \"bus touristic\" which had a stop even closer to the hotel which meant we were able to use it as a mode of transport too. The hotel was very quiet which didnt bother us. We booked without breakfast included which worked out well as we didnt see a single person in the restaurant and the area it is based is famous for its cakes and pastries! The hotel lacked atmosphere but we didnt go to Barcelona to stay in the hotel in the evenings!! I would definately book this hotel, it is clean, modern, with daily maid service. We found that it was such good value compared with the hotels directly in the centre of Barcelona.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurostars Angli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d596514-Reviews-Eurostars_Angli-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$119 - $404*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Angli 60</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "596514", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/57/3b/573bf8cc45d944b5c44ab6895577f9523large.jpg"}}
