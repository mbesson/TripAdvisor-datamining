We travelled on a budget as we were going south to Belize, but let me assure you if you can get a flight to Cancun and need a base in a great location (Playa del Carmen) then this is the spot for both cost and location as i would give it maximum points on both. The hotel is clean, comfortable and basic and if you bear this in mind you will not be disappoint. The owners/managers were very nice and helpful but spoke very little English.

It was only a few blocks walking distance to 5th avenue, beaches, nightlife, etc and I felt very safe walking at night alone. The rooms were clean and simple yet charming with mexican flare. The showers always had hot water but it would always overflow onto the bathroom floor. The window air conditioner cooled my room down just fine in 90 degree weather but I like it hot sometimes. The hotel was very quaint and quiet. I would not stay here if you were looking for a very nice hotel as this is a place to crash but comfortable. the beds were hard as most are in Mexico. The staff was friendly but did not speak english very well so when I asked a few questions they had a hard time answering me/ I would stay again if on a budget.

They are very sweet but do not speak English so if you have no Spanish it might be a little tuff but not imposable. It is a family place with the Mom, Daughter and sSn helping you at the front desk. They are sweet honest and friendly. It is a basic place with af ew little details that make it nice. There is a kitchen sink in every room and a little bar to make food and some rooms have kitchens too. It has great air conditioning and wonderful water pressure- which you do not miss unless you go without it.

You have incredible bang for your buck and the place looks great too with its authentically Mexican tiled floors and kitchen areas and the exposed beams. Nice Ranchero feel to it. It has a nice courtyard and offers an appreciated silence at the end of the day. The staff as well were lovely and friendly. The bed isn't much to write home about but that's often the case in Mexico so our expectations were low to begin with. The showers were good and always had hot water, and the cleaning staff always did a perfect job. Some people have mentioned their misgivings about alcohol --- the hotel does prohibit alcohol, as the owners do not want it to be a \"party hotel\" and they want a reliably peaceful stay for their other guests. However if you bring in a few beers and are respectful they are not likely to say anything - this is what we found during our stay. There are no refrigerators in the rooms - what we did was buy a styrofoam cooler from Walmart and we kept our beverages in there. Same goes with beach towels - we just picked up a couple at Wallies and walked down to our favourite place on the beach. Ice is available from most small stores and Oxxos. The value is incredible. I highly recommend this place. We stayed at three different places in PDC (including a beachfront hotel and a 4 star) during our most recent two week stay and for bang for buck no other place came even close.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cideal location, clean, modern rooms, great rates\u201d", "Author": "BeantownTourist", "ReviewID": "UR35421808", "Content": "This hotel is within walking distance of the beaches, restaurants, and shopping of Playa del Carmen.
