This is an old apartment building that's been converted to a suites hotel. Pros: - rooms are enormous: very large main room combined bedroom & sitting area, beautiful bathroom, huge comfortable bed, high ceilings, living room area with two full size couches, tall old windows that open out. Very clean. Lots of local magazines left out to read. - Turkish breakfast included in price, brought to you room on request every morning. - apartment building feel: big interior staircase, apartment style elevator. - great location for food and streetside entertainment. This is not a tourist neighborhood, unlike the \"old city\" neighborhoods around Hagia Sophia -- although there are plenty of tourists so you won't feel out of place, this area is mostly for locals. 5-7 min walk to Taksim Square, or walk the other direction down Istiklal to the tower. A few minutes walking to any number of restaurants from small casual street-facing places to top-notch high end places. Istiklal is hopping with locals and tourists every night of the week until the wee hours....you can just walk down the street and get an eyeful. - owners & staff at the suites were all helpful and welcoming. They can give recommendations for restaurants, shopping, arrange for taxis etc. Two downsides: - at present, there's no onsite bar / restaurant. In my opinion, this isn't a big deal, since there are bars & restaurants everywhere just steps outside. The main drawback & it's huge: there's a nightclub right across the little alley and the club blares music every night (not just weekends) until about 3 pm. It's INSANELY loud, even with windows closed and heavy curtains drawn. I'm not sensitive to noise -- I regularly travel to New York & other places that are known for their street noise -- but I've never been in a room this noisy. I didn't bring any earplugs....tried to sleep in my airplane noise-reducing headphones which helped a little but wasn't comfortable. I suppose if you lived here, you'd get used to it, but even after a week I hadn't adjusted. So I ended the week with big bags under my eyes and that stoned feeling you get from sleep deprivation. Bottom line: I loved everything about this place other than the nightclub issue, but I don't think I stay there again -- I'm old enough to really need my beauty sleep. Too bad because otherwise it's a great place & the noise is a difficult problem for the owners to solve.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is very close to the hustle...\u201d", "Author": "DoubleALondon", "ReviewID": "UR66075063", "Content": "This hotel is very close to the hustle and bustle of istiklal cadessi and you can't escape the noise from the local bars and clubs.

Sirkeci Konak is top rating hotel on Trip advisor but this is really only due to numbers as Misafir suites only has 6 rooms. Misafir suites is a million times better. The rooms are absolutely huge and also very nice and well decorated. The marble bathroom is great as is the bath and accompaniments provided. The staff we dealt with provided lots of information. I strongly advise getting airport transfer as taxi drivers can't find the place. The location couldn't be any better - it is just off the main street. When one steps outside one's door there is also a whole lot of small bars on the street all with live folk music - so one can pick a different one every day. I highly recommend staying on this side of town rather than Sultahnmet as there is excellent food, bars, night atmosphere etc on this side of town and one doesn't want to travel from one's hotel on the other side of town just to eat. If one wants to see the sights in Sultahnmet it is easy to catch either the Tunel or Funicular one stop and then the tram - you will be there in 15 minutes. We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and only one of those nights was noisy as there was a party at the hotel bar - but this was unusual and the street noise is not bad at all - however, this may be because we stayed on the other side of the hotel (at the back) where it is not facing the bars with music (room 6) - so I recommend you stay on this side of hotel. I seriously don't know why this isn't the top rating hotel in Istanbul - but like I said, probably due to the fact that it only has 6 rooms and many people staying are attending conferences etc so they may not write to Trip Advisor. Sure, it doesn't have the facilities of a five star hotel in terms of pool, gym etc - but if you're not into that stuff then why pay for it.

The restaurant is nice, and we had a hot breakfast made to order, which is a nice change over the standard hotel buffet fare. The room was gorgeous, very modern, large, and comfortable. The bathroom was fabulous. The location is great for shopping and bar/restaurant hopping, BUT (a huge but) the place is located in the heart of the disco/bar area. There was a club with extremely loud music on every corner right around us. Nothing quieted down until about 5 am. Forget sleeping well unless you can sleep well with a giant party raging within a few feet of your pillow. Overall, for the money we spent, I expected more professional service.

If you want to join the party and go to bed at sunrise or you sleep undisturbed like a log, this place it's the perfect spot for you. If you plan relatively quiet early nights or have light sleep forget about it. There is little staff can do about noise. Although smiley however they are totally unprofessional. Reception is more often empty than not, breakfast for us took ages to arrive-40 minutes on average -and it ends up being a bit repetitive. It feels really like home - during carnival season- but because you do not see anyone and have to sort out any problems that come up.

Visit the tourist sites by short taxi during the day and then come back to this hotel in the heart of Taksim. The rooms are large (suite size) and extremely comfortable - after a hard day visiting the sites there is enough room to grab one of the many choices of food sold on the street nearby and open a bottle of red in the room if you feel like it. The bathroom is also lovely with good quality toiletries and a decent hairdryer. It has a fantastic oversized bathtub to relax in - only downside - the shower is over the bath, which although common in Europe, is maybe not so great if you are an older person, especially as it is so big, making it hard to step into. Two other points to be aware of - this hotel is in the heart of Istanbul's nightlife area so expect some nightclub noise at night. Also, the hotel is located in a sort of back alley off the main pedestranised strip, so sometimes taxis will drop you a short walk from the hotel and you may have trouble explaining to them where to drop you. As others have said - the breakfasts are lovely - fresh juice, cheese, olives, cucumber and the host, and the service generally, were both super. This hotel is a little on the expensive side compared to other Istanbul hotels but it is a high standard. Also, as a general point Istanbul itself is not that cheap - although the currency is Turkish Lira - on conversion to Euro, things seemed to work out to cost about the same as they would in a Eurozone country. I am not exactly sure why it is listed as a 'B&B' on Trip Advisor - don't let this put you off if you are a person who dislikes B&Bs (like me) - it's a hotel (albeit privately owned).

As you walk down Istikal from Taksim Square, look for a Benetton store on your right. You'll then see on your right a single tree (in front of a mosque). Turn left on the small cross street directly across from this tree (there was a Swatch shop on the corner as well). Then take the first mini street to your right.

Tip: You can get New Turkish Lira, Euros and US$ from some ATMs - most notably the HSBC machines. There is an HSBC ATM immediately to your left upon exiting the international arrivals hall. There are also at least two near Misafir. One is next to the Benetton store (kitty corner from the Body Shop) on Istikal Street (if walking onto Istikal Street from Misafir, turn right). There's another HSBC ATM tucked away on a nearby side street. Turn left onto Istikil Street upon exiting Misafir; walk left for a while and start checking the side streets to the right.
