The hosts here were all really nice, the rooms were clean, the street can be a little noisy (but that did not keep me up), and the location was good. The breakfast served each morning is simple, but it gives you a nice start for a day in Rome. There are a few very nice little restaurants close by.

If compared to hotels, I would rate this as very poor. If I was to compare to a B&B, I'd say it is basic. Located close to the termini, close to a lot of attractions and metro stations - although some reviews say the termini area is very dodgy, we felt totally safe in this area, even when walking at night. Breakfast is very basic and served after 8am. Our room was very noisy as we had very noisy neighbours, and walls seem pretty thin. Heating also works on timer during certain times of the day, and during our stay in December, we were cold most of the time we were there. TV channels barely worked (satellite). No internet, no wifi. No safe. Shared bathroom was very clean.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBasic!\u201d", "Author": "Essex_London", "ReviewID": "UR47782333", "Content": "I would say this a very basic place to stay bedrooms ok but old fashioned bathroom clean but hot water came and went throughout a shower which weirdly had a bidet in at the shower opening so had to get past that as sort of in the way! It states sound proofing but I think it must be in the floor as not in the walls doors or ceiling heard lots of noise from the corridor and upstairs. Because of the language barrier our supposed breakfast each day never materialised and we didn't receive a discount for this. The best i can say is good location! I wouldn't recommend to my friends!", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cspotlessly clean, reasonable rates, pleasant staff,great location go again\u201d", "Author": "Seggie", "ReviewID": "UR25407237", "Content": "we stayed for 3 nights in february 2009. rooms were basic but spotlessly clean, comfortable and warm! It was freezing in Rome I normally pay for Air Con even in winter cannot stand the heat, but was glad I took my coat. However the rooms were warm and welcoming after a long day. Very easy to find junction of xx septembre and Giotto by lights large wooden door and brass plaque. 5-10 minutes walk from termini (I walk slowly) pleasant court yard, cute wooden lift, Not the best breakfast we have had, plastic wrapped rolls and nice coffee with refill. as it was included in the room rates ok if you have to pay extra remember it will cost you 1.5E to stand and drink a coffee 3E if you sit inside a cafe and 4-5E if you sit outside.you decide. 2E for a bounty choc bar.to take away! several nice places to eat watch prices though God I sound like a tight wad but seriously we turned left and found a small snack bar full of italians prices clearly displayed. 4 slices of pizza (weighed) 1 beer and a snack that looked like a scotch egg but contained spicy rice and cheese- mmm- cost 5E25 2 large pizza, 1 beer 1 carafe red wine 2 coffee 25E in pizzeria next day in basic 2 large slices of pizza 1 coffee 1 beer 28E! no prices were displayed you have been warned. pick up a map from the tourist info centre at the airport first night we walked to Trevi Fountain turn right from hotelmap is easy to follow. next day did the vatican tour with viator- Tiffany - brilliant we booked the hop on and off green bus 19E 48 hrs special but was a waste of money because we walked to all the sites remember ancient Rome was quite small. Only used to go to the vatican and then sat on it for 2 hrs around the city just to get a warm and see the sites from the window! sorry do ramble on", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ekeren", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, clean but needs a renovation\u201d", "Author": "s1m0n2", "ReviewID": "UR7816585", "Content": "the overall stay was without any problems. Bathroom and the room were clean. Breakfast was a very pour thing (maybe something Italians don't do?). the location is perfect. Near termini. Taxis are cheap in Rome. food is excellent and cheap. the tourist attractions can be done on foot. Except the Vatican and the colloseum. Take the subway, works perfect. The aicon didnt work but we didnt need it. Our room was very noisy but that is due to the location of the hotel. If they would invest in the rooms I would recommend this hotel to our friends.
