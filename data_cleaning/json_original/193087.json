We didn't choose the hotel ourselves. Overall, I am surprised it has 4 star rating, but it is convenient for working, and the location is handy for entertainment in the evening. The decor is very dated. The room is not huge but has the necessities and a bit more (desk area, two arm chairs and a coffee table). The bathroom is very old and crumbling in places. It is not the most 'lively' of hotels but the one thing that stood out for me is the customer service. The bar staff are warm and friendly (even though the Happy Hour prices are very misleading - make sure you check before ordering because they overcharged on one occasion). Room service was (pricey but) prompt. The maid was very efficient and helpful towards my needing to work in the room and 'can you come back later' etc. The breakfast service is good with a wide choice of cold and cooked dishes. The only down side was a member of staff removing the teaspoon from my saucer when I took my coffee to the lobby to smoke - I think she thought I was going to steal it. Overall this hotel is okay for basic business/tourist needs if you want to feel looked after and if you can overlook the basic shabbiness of the interior.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, England", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "chrissie_bubbles", "ReviewID": "UR4122240", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend on a romantic weekend away and was not disappointed.

The lifts were fine too, not noisy or slow. the location of this hotel is fantastic too, as you are just off Oxford Street so you avoid a lot of the street noise, but close enough to all the shops and theatre district. We drank in the bar a couple of times and the bar staff were lovely, although the price of the drinks and food were quite expensive, but this is London afterall. Mini Bar expensive too.

It looked good from the outside, but that impression lasted as long as it took us to walk to the reception desk. The receptionist immediately tried to sell us an upgrade to a room with air conditioning and a fridge. Obviously then, our room would have neither. Not a good start. The lifts were small and slow. Thank goodness for the corridor signing, otherwise we would never have found our room. What a maze! The room was small and dark. There was little direct daylight because we looked out onto another wall of hotel windows about thirty feet away. There was no central overhead light in the room, so it was only lit by a table lamp and two bedside uplighters. Not sufficient. We had to squeeze between the bed and a wall in order to get into the bathroom. This was a disappointment too. Thin, rough towels. An over-bath shower with curtain, not what you expect today. Tiny, thin bath robes. Loose toilet seat. No extraction of air from the bathroom, so that it was like a sauna after you had used the shower. Returning to the room, the kettle and complimentary tea & coffee were hidden in the wardrobe. There was no plug socket in there, so we had to stand the kettle on the floor in order to use it. There was no fridge or air-con, as previously stated. Neither was there a room safe, nor an iron. There might have been a radio, but the switches didn't seem to work. Neither did the trouser press, despite reporting it. The TV set had a mind of its own, even to the extent of turning itself on at half past two in the morning and blasting football at us. Quite a shock when you are fast asleep. The bed had seen better days, and had a pronounced sag in the middle. It was also a surprise to find sheets and blankets in use, rather than a duvet. A request for an iron brought one, but it was quite basic, and the ironing board had seen better days. Breakfast was the highpoint. A pleasant, ornate, dining room, and sufficient choice of food for me, though not enough variety of fruit for my partner. Staff were not very welcoming though, and their uniforms were often stained and grubby. A huge disappointment after staying at the City Inn Westinster.

Oops.OK, so by London standards it's pretty cheap, especially bearing in mind the excellent location (\u00c2\u00a399 including breakfast for 2) although my wife took one look at the room and entirely justifiably demanded an upgrade to the Club floor (another \u00c2\u00a330). The first room was small and dingy with a barely-adequate \"double\" bed.The second room was larger and dingy with the same barely-adequate bed. We ordered sparkling mineral water, and it came in refillable bottles suggesting that it was in all probability London Tap with a bit of added CO2, but at only about \u00c2\u00a31.60 a litre bottle that was pretty good for hotel prices (and there's nothing wrong with London tap). However, serving tap water as mineral water is something that's guaranteed to get my back up...The water pressure was feeble, the breakfast was adequate to reasonable (as usual, juice was served in shot-glasses).It wasn't appalling, but next time I'll definitely be paying twice the amount and staying at the Sanderson...- Andrew", "Date": "June 9, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Berners Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193087-Reviews-Berners_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$357 - $436*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Berners Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W1A 3BE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "193087", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d2/2c/d22c3a9125b165d6966cafbf9eac68da3large.jpg"}}
