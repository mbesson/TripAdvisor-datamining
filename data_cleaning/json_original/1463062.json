We've appreciated the value and consistant level of cleanliness at Ibis Hotels in the past so we chose one again for our stay in Barcelona. This one didn't let us down. It was clean and the staff were all courteous and helpful to us. They were especially helpful with getting our boarding passes printed - without cost to us. Although we used both the Llacuna and Glories metro stops in coming and going to the hotel the Glories stop has a walk to the hotel that feels much safer and is in a more pleasant neighborhood to look at so I would recommend using the Glories stop if arriving by metro at night. When you look at a map of the city the Llacuna stop looks much closer but it doesn't really seem to be any closer when actually comparing the walking times between the two stops and the hotel. We never eat the hotel breakfasts so I can't speak to how good they are. We love to get fresh European pain au chocolate and pain aux raisins plus cheese and apples for our breakfasts while in Europe and eat picnic-style in a park.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newmarket", "Title": "\u201cClean, practical, great value\u201d", "Author": "spinnerdolphin2", "ReviewID": "UR126919194", "Content": "Stayed at the IBIS near Plaza Glories in Barcelona March 12 to 19, 2012 with my 18 yr old son. The hotel is very clean and modern. The staff were kind enough to let us use the internet for free in 20 minute intervals but I appreciate they were restricted by corporate policy on that front. The breakfast did the job effectively and was better than your average continental spread. The room had a bit of the dormitory feel to it but we spent so little time there it hardly mattered. During the time we were there, the hotel was overrun with international school groups and while it didn't bother us I could imagine it annoying couples for example. Certainly true, access to the metro and the mall was easy. Rambla de la Poble Nou was our supper time destination and rather nice in that it was \"Catalan\" as opposed to \"tourist\". My son enjoyed the easy convenience to the Razzamatazz nightclub which was favoured by tourists.

I usually stay in Ibis hotels across Europe so know what to expect. The hotel is located 5 minute walks away from two metro stations, one serving L1, the other serving L4. This means the door-to-door journey from the airport is 45 minutes by rail followed by metro. It is also 5 minutes from a large shopping centre. The proximity to the L1 line means the main attractions are 10 minutes away using the metro and, in the opposite direction, is a 10 minute walk to the beach and an extra 5 minutes to the marina and casino. However, I was so annoyed with the attitude of the staff that I would not stay again. I was called over by someone shouting \"hey you\" when they wanted to check my competition license for the race as I stayed on an Ibisport rate (which they should have done at check-in anyway). When they did this they had the cheek to tell me my valid UK and French running licenses were not genuine! One more thing irked me on my last day. I was told, contrary to other reviews on Tripadvisor, that the internet in the lobby is not free and you have to pay a daily charge. Outside of France, you usually have to pay for internet in your room but you get it free in the lobby. I was told that I would have to pay the daily room wifi rate to access the internet in the lobby, which I suspect was down to the fact they couldn't be bothered as their mates dropped round for a chat. The demenour of the staff was generally unwelcoming and unfriendly, pathetic for a hotel that has been opened for less than a year.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Adventure2009", "ReviewID": "UR126365177", "Content": "This hotel is located close to the subway.

For a romantic getaway, maybe stay someplace a little nicer. As others have said, the location is ok, about 4 blocks from your choice of two metro stations (Glories and Llacuna). There isn\u2019t much that I saw within a 3-block radius of the hotel, but there is a shopping mall up the street 4 blocks (near the very-easy-to-spot Agbar Tower and Glories metro) with El Burger King, El McD\u2019s, El Subway, Carrefour supermarket, H&M, and many other stores; they\u2019ve pretty much got you covered. This is a cut above your normal budget hotel. The hotel appears to be very new and was very clean. The rooms are well-designed to take full advantage of the modest space and use some savvy cost-cutting measures that you might notice but can live with (small flat-panel TV ~21 inches, power in only one place (two ports), desk chair is very cheap, combined shampoo/soap, no fridge, no Kleenex). Internet is 5 Euros for continuous 24 hours, so just add that right away to the stated price if you need it. At least it worked well. Staff was great and very helpful (especially the French guy). My 2nd floor room (3rd if you\u2019re American) was very quiet and the shades block out the light extremely well (good for the jet-lagged who want to sleep in the day time). I was surprised to see a fitness center, consisting 4 cardio machines (2 treadmill, ellipse, and bike; sorry, no free weights) but a tourist is not likely to need any extra leg work. Airport: Catch the free bus shuttle to Terminal T2 then take the train to Clot, then take the metro back to Glories. It\u2019s no more than a 8-minute walk from there. The T10 card is currently about 9.2 euros and covers 10 trips (with connections within about an hour), including to and from the airport. It\u2019s a great value \u2013 just over $1 per trip including to the airport - and a no-brainer. In theory, it can be shared amongst a family. TIP: Take the 92 bus to Park Guell. It stops a lot, but is more convenient than the metro, which requires a long walk to get to the station and then another long walk (3/4 mile uphill) to get to the park.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGood, but its not the one.\u201d", "Author": "malcolmtalcum", "ReviewID": "UR123458508", "Content": "Rooms are nice, clean and basic, everything you would expect from a chain like Ibis.

Breakfast was 6,50eur each - good value for money for the expected continental type buffet. A large San Miguel was 3,00eur at the bar.
