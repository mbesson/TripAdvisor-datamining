In the restaurant in the morning we encountered the only smiling, friendly face in the hotel and that was our waiter. He greeted us with a big smile the first and only morning we walked in there and was so nice and pleasant the entire time we were in there. He was truly bright spot of our stay!

The staff of the hotel were excellent and attentive, and had the help I needed, in English, when I needed it. The rooms are small but I have seen much smaller hotel roms than these. The room was very well laid out, cleaned well each day, and I wasn\u2019t there to stay in my room. My room overlooked Plaza del Carmen and the big problem was that half the nights I was there someone drank too much and decided that at 2, 3 or 4 AM it was time to bellow at the top of their lungs whatever was on their mind. If you stay at Hotel Liabeny you should consider asking for one of the interior rooms, rooms that overlook a courtyard inside the hotel. What Pusenin from Oslo forgot to mention is that whenever I asked the hotel staff to fix something it was done with Spanish cheer and German precision. My safe freaked out and had to be broken into by the hotel staff and it was done within ten minutes, forms to sign, and life on vacation resumed. When I asked for a certain number of towels in the room they made sure they were in my room every day. But what stands out is the location, four minutes from the Plaza Del Sol evening crowd viewing spectacular and the Metro station. Each day I walked to my destination and either walked back home or caught the Metro. The trains do run on time. The gym is small but well equipped for any workout that involves dumbbells and cardio; there were four cardio machines and a large range of dumbbells. Just off the gym is an excellent sauna. Just call down to the front desk when you leave the room for your workout and they will turn on the sauna for your exclusive use. The sauna is large enough for six, and there is a very private bathroom with shower for you to use before returning to Madrid life. The breakfast buffet was good, though not great. It never changed, the eggs were always runny, but if one was willing to embrace cold cuts, fruit, runny eggs, cereal, breads and cheese for breakfast it was very good. The buffet included an abundant supply of meats, cheeses, pastries, cereal, tea or coffee, fresh fruit and more. I had it for a week and it was just fine. I think the hotel should try to add variety, whether different egg preparations or something. The hotel also gave the same exchange rate that as the best rate I found at the Santander/Salamander/something bank just around the corner. The bank required 30 minutes to wait through the lines to exchange funds, the friendly staff at the hotel took a minute for the same rate. I was originally booked into another hotel, but due to a reservation mix-up I was transferred to the Hotel Liabeny. I will return to this hotel. The hotel is also located a three minute walk from the best vegetarian restaurant I have ever eaten at and I was raised a vegetarian. That vegetarian restaurant is called Artemisia located at Tres Cruces 4, just off Plaza del Carmen, and while the staff is frosty and okay (the service is gruff, which happens when the tip is included in the price you pay for food, just sayin\u2019), the food is amazing on a scale never seen in this world before Artemisia. These folks are great at what they do, which is preparing incredible vegetarians\u2019 food.

Most of the reviews are pretty on. The hotel is in the perfect location. Location (the best part on the slight downhill): Right in the heart of Madrid. You probably could not find better. You can walk to everything. For those of you late 20's/30's you will love the proximity to the hip area Malasana. I will review a bunch of the places we checked out there. If you want to take day trips, the Puerta del Sol station is right under the square. So close! Check In/Service (Very Bad): Girl at the front desk was a little snippy and not at all helpful. She took our passports and told us the room number. We are a couple and booked non smoking. When we opened the door on the 4th floor - ash tray and two twin beds. It 'stunk' in both senses. ;). So we go back down, ask for the proper room and a 'bed'. I don't understand common sense mistakes like this in the hotel industry. She was not at all friendly nor apologetic. These are easy fixes and good hotels know its not good treatment and most people have been travelling for many many hours to get here! lol (like us). The bellmen are overly friendly when you arrive and insist on taking your luggage and likely make a living off the tips. I'm fully capable so dont like the forcefulness of that (no way out of having them do this). Mind you, they are nice so hey, c'est la vie. Also, you would think she would give us the wifi code at check in? We had to go down and ask as well. Perhaps other desk staff are better and we lucked out with BRUTAL. Rooms (eek): I guess its European standards, but it certainly did not seem 4 star. Very old and outdated. The carpet and furniture was a little icky. However, we lived with it as we spend our days exploring the city. The beds are hard, and you will likely need to ask for an extra pillow as they are weak. Service wise, they enter the room a lot to do the sheets, turndown the bed etc. So that was nice. Also somes with some toiletries. Note to girls out there: You will need your own conditioner. ;) Also, the noise others write about is true if you keep the window open. In March, it was too stuffy in the room (AC not on yet in hotel apparently) so we wanted it open. Here is where you hear the late night life of madrid. After two nights we got used to the noise. Window shut - very minimal, so hopefully for you summer guests its not an issue. Gym: did the job. Had water and decent equipment. No window. Also, the sauna they advertise has a sign 'let the staff know if you want to use it one hour before'. Makes sense, saves money, but meant we never tried it. Resto: Didn't try, can't comment. Likely MUCH better out there. Taxi: We paid about 16 Euro from the airport and about 28 going back. There was the extra charge going back for taxis and maybe he took us for a spin. That or the other terminal is farther. Either way just wanted to give you an idea of cost. Both times, no traffic except for a little downtown Madrid. Other: You can lend an electrical adaptor from the desk for a deposit. Wifi is free, but you have to enter an annoying code every time you connect. That resto near the hotel is NOT WORTH IT. The one everyone mentions in the reviews called Garbo. I had the veg lasagna and my BF the pizza. The lasagna was not even made with noodles, no idea what that was, and the pizza bland. Service ify. For the price not worth it. Also, they charge 10% extra on the terrace. Be adventures and keep going up the street into Malasana -- some AMAZING fun tapas places with WAY better prices.

They were very accommodating to find us a room looking out on the plaza - unfortunately on the second floor. That brings me to the only \"downside\" of the Hotel Liabeny - street noise. Spaniards stay up much later that we North Americans are used to and the disco that is a few buildings away from the hotel kept its doors open until three or four in the morning.

There's a late night pizza place at the end of the road(25 metres from the door) and a shed load of everything including bars, restaurants, shops all very close by! Quite often (4 days) we had a siesta preceding the heavy drinking session in the late afternoon and there was a really annoying tune played continuously by some local shop nearby but then I guess you have to expect that when you're in the heart of a massive busy city like Madrid! The room had a safe which was easy to use, a minibar, very comfy beds and nicely appointed rooms. The reason we stayed at the Liabeny was the feedback we saw on trip advisor and it was absolutely worth it in my opinion. It offers sensible rates for what is in effect a fairly classy hotel. The white leather sofas in the bar/lounge and the white and black striped carpets in the landings were a nice touch and amazingly clean considering they are sat and walked on so regularly! None of us took euro adapters for the phone chargers but reception lent us these, even when I didn't have the \u20ac5 deposit in cash to hand which I thought was nice of them! The porters were up all night to allow us entry through the main doors even at 9 in the morning!

We had not booked breakfast as we knew there are many cafes close by. We were allocated room 610 on the 6th floor - a non-smoking room which overlooked Calle de la Salud. The room was a good size and very comfortable with a large bed (excellent mattress and pillows) and free WiFi which was a reasonable speed and a good bathroom. One of my gripes is hot water and Hotel Liabeny has copious amounts at a good pressure. In addition the lighting has got to be some of the best I have come across with bedside lights that are actually good enough to read by and room and desk lighting next to a comfy chair. We were very comfortable during the day in the room. However, unfortunately, although I had requested a quiet room (based on previous reviews), at night it became very noisy. The double glazing is effective at keeping out the noise but the room becomes stuffy and so you have to decide whether to go for earplugs and fresh air or peace and stuffiness. We were visiting during New Year and so there was obviously a lot more noise but this is just something to be aware of. There are rooms on the other side of the corridor which I presume face onto an inner area so would be quieter. However, that said, the hotel is in an excellent location in central Madrid, only a few minutes walk to Puerta del Sol where everyone gathers to see the New Year in. Most places can be easily walked to and we arrived by metro from the airport which was considerably cheaper than a taxi and again only about 5-minute walk from Grand Via metro stop. Although we did not eat in the restaurant the menu looked very nice and for a hotel fairly reasonable priced. As an aside we had two particularly memorable meals - one evening meal at La Finca de Susana on Calle Ariaban 4, where we had eaten on our last visit over 3-years before. It looks classy but the prices are very reasonable (read cheap!). Although they do not take reservations, if they are busy just give your name to the chap on the door and he\u2019ll give you an idea of time, have a wander to work up an appetite and return for a great meal a bit later. The fact that this place is still going strong since we last visited and is always full, is testament to the quality of food. Madrid is a city where everyone eats late so bear this in mind. Our other good meal was lunch on New Years Eve in one of the older tapas bars - La Casa del Abuelo on Calle Nunez de Arce, 5. Although our Spanish is not great (we do try really hard) the staff were very welcoming and helpful. The food is so good with generous tapas and racion portion sizes (try Pimientos Padron, gambas and the patatas bravas mista).

We stayed at Hotel Liabeny for all 8 nights of our trip, and found the hotel to be welcoming, comfortable, and phenomenally well-located near Puerta del Sol (historical significance; metro stop; many vendors and demonstrators) and Plaza Mayor (historical significance; many fine restaurants, vendors, and artists/musicians nearby). Additionally, while perhaps not culturally significant, El Cortes Ingles (an extremely large department store which even includes a grocery, travel agency, and wine shop) is only 1-2 blocks away from Hotel Liabeny. That was very handy for last-minute \"necessities\" like additional memory cards for our camera, more contact solution, and food supplies for our picnic at Retiro Park. Our room at Hotel Liabeny included daily breakfast, which my husband and I agreed was excellent, hands-down the very best that has ever been included in our European hotel rooms. Some books note that the Spanish diet does not emphasize fruits, and that these can be difficult to find while traveling. This was not our experience at Hotel Liabeny, however! Each day of our trip, my husband and I enjoyed a wide array of fruits, including pears and kiwi! We also enjoyed eggs, cereal, juices, and several types of meats. Delicious! Based on suggestions from travel books, I e-mailed the Hotel Liabeny staff a few weeks before leaving for Spain and requested a non-smoking room on a higher floor. The staff was very attentive, and accommodated this request without any trouble. One night, I did wake up to a little street noise, but I feel back asleep without much difficulty. This only happened once, however, and, in my opinion, was a small price to pay for the hotel's superb location. I would suggest that guests consider requesting a room on a higher floor, as it seems that this may have solved some of the street noise problems that others experienced. One side note, in September 2011, the church across from the hotel was being repaired, and was in a state of construction-related disarray. There were a few homeless people who slept with their dogs next to the church each night. They never bothered my husband or me, but their constant presence and the relatively unsecured state of the church did concern me a little. I would imagine, however, that this will be less of a problem once the church restoration process is complete. For all I know, this may have already happened. My husband and I adored Madrid, and cannot wait to return some day! Of the major European cities we have visited, Madrid is, by far, our favorite.

She never asked how our stay was but by that point we just wanted to leave anyway so it was probably a good thing.

The room - which we book and paid for in advance to get an exceptional deal - was larger than rooms in some of the other hotels we booked in Spain. It was clean, well appointed with comfortable beds and very efficient air conditioning (a necessity given the hot summer days in Madrid.) There are so many good places to eat in Madrid - and within a few minutes walking distance from the hotel - that we didn't have a meal there, so I can't comment on that. However, breakfast, beyond croisant and tea, seemed overpriced. An early morning walk to the Prado, or the Royal Palace, is reasonable, very pleasant and shows just how close you are to many of the places you'd want to see. Aside from the Prado and Reina Sophia museums, I'd highly recommend a visit to the Thyssen-Bornemisza. After a day visiting the Old Masters at the Prado, the excellent collection of modern art in Thyssen is refreshing. The Madrid metro system is convenient and easy to navigate when you want to get farther afield. Buy a multi-pass ticket to save on those trips. As an aside to visitors, you will greatly enhance your visit by getting on 'Spanish time'. Stay out and eat late (9 or 10), have a light breakfast and eat again around 2. Enjoy walking in the evening. Enjoy the crowds of strollers, window shop and have a late latte. Go to bed at midnight or 1:00.

The location is second to none - 3 mins from Puerta del Sol, 5 mins from 3 different metro stops and all the shops on Gran Via. And yet it's quiet - although that impression was probably helped by being in a room that gave onto the inner well, rather than the street, although the street it's on is basically pedestrianised (except taxis can pull up outside). It is fantastic, after a night out and a couple of late-night drinks sitting out in the warm evening near Sol or the Plaza Mayor or Plaza Santa Ana, to only have a short stroll back to the hotel through the teeming, non-threatening streets at 1am . . . One reviewer mentioned the hotel felt a bit old fashioned - perhaps it is, slightly, but it was so well constructed and fitted out originally that it has stood the test of time very well (with the odd bit of refurbishment). My room didn't feel in the least bit tatty, unlike some other more apparently 'modern' hotels that often start to look run down quite quickly. Good solid wood and nice joinery that has been well looked after only adds to the classy, long-established feel of the hotel in my opinion - I'd say 'classic' would be a better description than 'old-fashioned'. The rooms are scrupulously cleaned every day, pillow cases and sheets are changed every day too - the housekeepers also come round in the evening and re-make your bed - nice touch, if you've messed it up by havig a siesta in the afternoon (well, you know, when in Spain . . .). The bed was a (large) single, and the bathroom was a good size with a marble floor - again, left squeaky clean every day. The aircon was controllable in the room, very efficient and VERY quiet when in operation. Internet access is quite expensive (9 euros a day, I think - a lot if you're only going to be on for a couple of minutes checking emails), but there are plenty of cheap internet cafes etc around as an alternative. The public areas are all very nice, and the staff friendly and helpful - although, since I speak Spanish, I never needed to test the limits of their English but I'm sure there would have been someone on hand to help out with any language difficulties. In summary, I cannot really recommend the Liabeny highly enough - I got an extremely reasonable rate for a hotel of this quality through Expedia and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a gem of a place. Congratulations to the management on keeping standards so high in this charming hotel. Quick 'getting there' tip: when coming in from Airport, the pink metro line (line 8) drops you at Nuevos Ministerios. You can then carry on to Gran Via or Sol by Metro but you have to change at least once - can be a bit of a struggle if carrying heavy bags p and doown the flights of stairs in the metro station. A better option is to take one of the the 'Cercanias' trains (local trains that run underground as they pass through the city). It's just two stops direct to Sol, so it's quite a lot quicker: the trains aren't quite as frequent, but you'll probably find it an easier option than the metro if you've got bags. Within the city, these trains are covered by the 'Zone A' travel pass just like the metro is - and you can buy a Zone A multi-day pass to cover yourself for unlimited travel for up to a week from the ticket machines in the airport metro station.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cQuality for the price was unbelievable!\u201d", "Author": "sjburme", "ReviewID": "UR72296251", "Content": "I felt like I was stepping into a very expensive 5-star hotel, yet we paid under $100 a night.

By this I mean the quiet side, near to El Corte Ingles and the Gran Via. The other side of Sol has much much more nocturnal activity and noise. We had an interior room and, yes, we could hear the boiler but it never bothered us, certainly nothing to be excited about to the point of complaining. Our companions had an exterior room and there was no street noise worth worrying about. Show me a totally quiet Spanish hotel. In 47 years I haven't found one. Noise is part of Spain; they are not aware of it. We liked the other guests, mostly well-to-do Spaniards, South Americans and a few North Europeans. Convivial times in the excellent cocktail bar - reasonable prices and good measures. A very comfortable large panelled lounge. All in traditional style. Good cafeteria. Breakfasted there. Friendly waiters. A few tips. Have a coffee at the tables outside Garbo's, diagonally across the square. A disloyal Liabeni guest might even have a light breakfast but nothing else. We had a diabolical dinner there, with ludicrously expensive G & Ts. Ten euros each; going rate 6 - 7 euros max. Appalling service. Cafe Yanvi - grubby little cafe on the square, opposite/near Liabeni. Good to sit out on the pavement. The strolling accordionist and violinist each pass slowly by, eyes darting, sadly not on their way to music lessons. Parrilla El Gaucho - just beyond the Cafe Yanvi, turn right. Another good reason to stay at Liabeni is to be near El Gaucho. I have visited since they opened. Eat very reasonably at the bar or, also reasonably, considering the quality of the meat, in the restaurant. Vegetarians will love their Mediterranean Salad. Pleasant waitresses. Special place. La Trainera - everyone should go there at least once, for fish. An institution. Bank on 50 euros a head, with wine, and up. Superb service and seafood of highest quality. La Torre del Oro, Plaza Mayor - Do go there for a drink and a small tapa but on no account ask for their rather expensive jamon. Don't allow any of the very prosperous-looking staff serve you a selection of tapas because they try to slip everyone a plate of jamon. This small bar has a wonderful collection of historic bullfight pictures which the aficionado/a will love. Anti-taurinos also, though their appreciation will be of matadors with horns in unwelcome parts of their anatomy. Something for everyone. Touristy; go once. Renfe / Cercanias / Metro: Sol is the best place to access metro or rail transport. It is easy and cheap to go to, say, Aranjuez for lunch. Well, lunch at Casa Pablo anyway. This traditional provincial town restaurant is worth the trip in itself. No tourists ! Meson de Candido in Segovia is another easy train excursion for lunch. Plenty of tourists, a bit pricey but much better pig than Plaza Mayor places. Get there early (by 1.30 pm) Leaving Liabeni - most times there are taxis outside. Airport 30-35 euros. Even 25 if no traffic. The metro involves two changes.

Still, if quiet is important to you, request a high floor away from the street.

I would definitely recommend it. Our room was very clean, everything well maintained, very comfortable king sized bed. Very quiet (I made sure to request a room away from the street and noise). Couldn't ask for a better location as this is one minute away from the Puerta Sol metro station. Lots of restaurants around. Only complaint was that the internet in the room didn't work, but they have a business centre where you can use the internet. The only bad experience was at the end of our trip when the cab driver cheated us when we were returning to the Liabeny from the Madrid Atocha train station . The driver claimed he didn't know the hotel or the street it was on but he had a GPS... I knew exactly where we needed to go, and even gave the guy directions, but he claimed that he couldn't get right near the hotel because of traffic and one way streets. I knew this to be a lie because we had seen cabs pull right up to the hotel. He ended up driving us around the Puerta Sol, charged us 4 euros more than he should have. He yelled at me in the middle of the street and threatened to call the police when I refused to pay him the extra. Thankfully I know enough Spanish to get by, but with all the luggage and a sick husband, I just paid him the money to get rid of him and we dragged our bags back to the hotel. If I had been smarter, I would have written down his cab number and reported him. The staff at Liabeny were very willing to make a police report for me. i will know what to do if this ever happens again. And this does happen everywhere in the world.... For your information, it should have cost us about 10 euros to get from the Atocha train station to the Liabeny.

True the location is the main attraction, and the rooms are clean and have all conveniences, but I found the waiters in the restaurant and bar very off hand, and prices for a \"thimble\" size glass of wine high in a land where wine is next to water. The concierge and reception staff are particularly helpful and the cleanliness of the hotel is excellent. If you want a nice hotel in an excellent location, close to Puerto del Sol and Plaza Mayor etc which isn't too expensive, then this is for you. I would add that Madrid was a lovely surprise - such fabulous architecture and top class art galleries and museums - a weekend is too short a visit. The open top bus is a good way to see the city, but be warned the commentary is hit and miss, mainly due to the poor quality of the ear phone connections in the seats, but I'd still recommend the tour.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWatch Out for Airshaft Rooms\u201d", "Author": "NYBritannia", "ReviewID": "UR7293138", "Content": "I found this room through Trip Advisor and booked it because of the reasonable rate.

Being my first time there, I had a couple of itinerary issues which went wrong, and the staff at the hotel assisted me to great effort in resolving. I have stayed at a few hotels in Madrid, and a few more in Spain. From my experience, the staff at this hotel was the best of any of the hotels I stayed at. In addition, the hotel is in an excellent location, a short walk from Puerto Del Sol, and numerous other points of interest. When we would leave out in the mornings, we would stroll down to Gran Via and grab breakfast Zahara's Cafe off of Plaza de Callao, or one of the other restaurants along that strip, a short walk away, and grab a bite. I will stay there again in the future. It has a well trained polite staff that makes the greatest impression on me.

The hotel has a cafe and a restaurant. We ate breakfast a la carte both days and a lunch once and found the food and service to be good. The desk personnel were entusiastic and helpful.

Room rates - I paid 95 Euros per night for 3 nights booking through the hotel's website. Over the New Years weekend, many hotels in Madrid were increasing their rates for Dec 30 and 31. I had one consistent, reasonable rate for all 3 nights. 3. Room size - I had a single room with one twin bed. The bedroom area had storage for one suitcase, enough room to walk around a bit, a chair and desk, and a flat screen TV. There was a good sized closet that contained an in-room safe. The bathroom was plenty big with good shower pressure. 4. Ambiance - despite being in the center of Madrid, the room was very quiet. There was no view, but the ability to sleep peacefully more than made up for that. Room was also very clean. I never ate in the hotel's restaurants. There are too many good choices in the area.
