{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Charming, great service and location Stayed for the weekend in this charming hotel. I chose this hotel because it looked charming, centrally located at the same time easy to get to from the ring road. You can park your car for a few minutes in front of the hotel when you arrive and check in. Then they will call the garage to pick it up. When you enter the city center, you will see street cameras because the zone is ZTL zona traficco limitato - the hotel will take your plate number and they will call the ZTL authorities to cancel your 'ticket' for entering the city. The 24 hour parking is about 25Euros which is standard for most Florence central hotels, you can extend for a few hours where they charge about an additional 2.5Euro per hour. Our room was nicely decorated - like an old palazzo and we had a view of the cathedral. I liked the interior of the breakfast room as well, breakfast was basic. The most I liked about this hotel was the service staff. They were also very nice to let us keep our room free of charge until 3PM since it was still the low season. If you are sensitive to noise, do ask for a room at the back, you wont get a view but it will shield you from the street noise and from the bar across the street. Regarding the 'smell' in the elevator foyer from other reviews, it never bothered us as it was hardly noticeable. If I had not read the reviews, I wouldnt even know it was there. Location was also great, right beside the duomo, close to everything. Overall, great value, nice experience.", "Date": "May 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR144999299", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "joyful_sun"}, {"Content": "Good enough for the price The entrance is through the ground floor of an office building that smells very bad.

And, a bargain! In September 2004 I booked a trip to Florence for myself and my 11 year old niece. I found a great package which was ridiculously affordable and was given a choice of hotels. While the Palazzo Ruspoli was not rated as highly as a few of the other hotels offered, I was amazed at the photos of the rooms on the Internet and the location was perfect. Having traveled through Europe a great deal, most often to Paris (home of the tiny hotel room), I was a bit skeptical but I had made my decision. When we arrived at The Palazzo Ruspoli I was truly worried when we had to enter through the lobby of an office building. But, exiting the elevator, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The desk staff were charming, and showed us to our room almost immediately This was unusual as we had arrived at the hotel several hours prior to the normal check in time. We had flown in from the U.S. and needed to drop our luggage before heading off to explore the riches of Florence and the hotel staff were more than accommodating. Our room was just to the left of the front desk and had a double door to insure a quiet rest. The room was stunning. Beautifully appointed with matching draperies, bedding and pillows. A small desk for writing, and small closet. I will admit, the closet could be larger by 100%, but we were only there for four nights. The bath was also a bit tight as we are not small people, but rather tall. The shower was tiny, but I feel when traveling, there are some things you just put up with. After all, I was not staying at a fancy hotel and if I want all the comforts of home, I stay home. I am not sure what the others who have posted are referring to when they say it was noisy. The windows are double glazed and there are room darkening/noise absorbing curtains. We heard nothing at night and in fact, slept with the window ajar for fresh air. The breakfast was perfect and a great way to being the day. I am used to staying in Parisian hotels where breakfast is usually a broiche and espresso in a caf\u8305 on the street, so this was a treat. My niece who is also rather well traveled truly enjoyed this hotel. In fact, she enjoyed everything about Florence and was a real adventurer on the entire trip. The location could not be more perfect. Directly out the front door are major bus lines and the Duomo and Baptistry are less than a 30 second walk. Everything in Florence that one would want to see is less than a 15 minute walk. I had been to Florence before and this was by far the best location and lodging I have encountered. Bravissimo!I was so fond of the Palazzo Ruspoli that this coming September I have rented a villa with a group of friends and will need to stay in Florence for one night at the beginning of the trip and one night at the end of the trip and I will book with the Palazzo Ruspoli.", "Date": "Mar 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR637531800", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tamara"}, {"Content": "great location - ok hotel greal location less than a block from the Duomo and within walking distance of everything. the location is a little weird, you have to push through crowds waiting for the bus in front of the door to get in. yes, it is noisy if you want to nap at 2 PM - but we had no trouble sleeping at night.

The hotel itself is very nice, and you can almost reach out and touch the Duomo from its 3rd floor location, but if you have a problem with noise, this is not the hotel for you.
