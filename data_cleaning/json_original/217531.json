This hotel was booked for a family trip to Ocean City this August (2010). Wen we arrived later on Sunday afternoon, we got signed in, received our keys, and went up to our room on the second floor. The big plastic room keys look like the old punch cards from the old computer days. When we entered the room we were a bit surprised. The TV was an old 19\" CRT model, there were holes in the walls that were patched but not painted, the light above one of the beds didn't work, and the room had a funky smell. Next I pulled out the laptop to see how the internet speed was. I needed a password so I went to call the front desk, BUT thats when I realized the phone in the room was dead. I walked down to the front desk and spoke to the desk attendent Morgan. I told her the phone didn't work and Morgan said there was nobody there to check the phone until the next morning. I asked for the Internet password and right away Morgan informed me that the WiFi has not been working well for the past few days. She said I could come to the front office and plug in if the WiFi didn't work. I went back to the room and attempted to get connected. Getting connected didn't happen. The connection wouldn't stay on for more than a few seconds. My wife and I then went down to the front office to speak with a manager. Morgan at the front desk said there was no manager available until the next morning. I told her we were unhappy with the room and didn't want to stay there, but I was just told that I would have to take that up with the manager the next morning. We then went back up and took all our luggage back to our vehicle and took the keys back to the front desk. Morgan said she couldn't give us a refund because only a manager could do that. I asked Morgan to call a manager and received alot of attutude. She did call a manager named Shauna and left a voicemail to call back. Morgan printed out a checkout slip, but didn't refund the charges. We went down the road and found a new place to stay and the next morning we went back. There was a manager there the next morning and he did refund all the charges in full. I thought the nightmare was done with but then a few days later I found a new charge on my credit card for an amount over $400. I right away called the Serine Hotel and sure enough Morgan answered the phone and told me there was no managager there. Morgan told me she seen the charge but couldn't explain why.

However, if you are looking to enjoy a vacation and have a front desk that you feel like it is your aunt and you can call and ask for anything, then stay at Serene. Each guest gets a free bag of ice once a day. This doesn't seem like a big deal but you get to walk down from your room, top off your cooler and roll right down to the beach. The beds are comfortable enough, the views from the balconies are great. There isn't always enough towels, that does annoy me but the front desk does what they can. Honestly, I would say the #1 problem with the hotel is the owners willingness to put any more money into it. The staff that is there is friendly as can be though. And after a day on the beach it is nice to relax in the pool for a bit which the sun hits perfectly in the evening hours. Also, the restaurant on the block has great bloody mary's and breakfast.

In addition, we didn't arrive until 2am and did not think to investigate the room prior to paying the full amount. Upon entering our room, we were completely outraged and disgusted. First of all, the carpet is dirty, and the curtains were literally falling down on one side. The mattress was covered in very noisy plastic, the TV blinked on and off, the couch, which was once navy blue and white striped, was literally brown and blue. The toilet wouldn't flush and there were pale stains on the white towels in the bathroom. Also, the ceiling looked as if it was rotting away in the bathroom, probably from years of steam and moisture. It was grotesque. I couldn't fathom that a hotel was this dirty and still had numerous occupants. We talked to the front desk and they denied us any refund but they did agree to move us to a \"renovated\" room. The next room, which was slightly larger and had a better view of the highway had a similar filthy couch, a hole punched in a wall, and a spider that had built a nice home in a corner. I have never in my life stayed in such a filthy place, and I have stayed in much less expensive hotels when I was a teenager.

We stayed in a king suite with an ocean view. If you sat in the living room on the pleather couch and looked out the window at an angle you could see the ocean. Our balcony faced Coastal Hwy. and we got alot of use out of it because it was Cruisers weekend. We didn't know that when we booked so it was a nice added bonus to sit in the privacy of our own room and watch the steady stream of classic cars. The location is good. There's a Wawa. 7-11, Dunkin' Donuts and CVS right across the street. Dough Roller pizza, Hooters, and Dumsers Dairyland are a few streets up. Dough Roller has excellent pizza if you're like me and prefer it thin and greasy. Dumsers serves good food and the best ice cream I've ever had. They say they make it fresh every day the old fashioned way and it blows the stuff from your grocers freezer away. The crabcake factory is an onsite restaurant and their jumbo lump crabcake was decent. We had a great shrimp appetizer that featured peeled shrimp with onions and old bay.

We rented a suite with no view, but from our balcony we could see the ocean and the bay. They also have a good size built in swimming pool and they are about 100 yards from the beach. Also they have plenty of parking spaces. If that is all you care about, then this is the place for you. However.... The bathroom, it had a fiberglass built in unit and they decided to add hand rails, and they used wood attached to the fiberglass unit and attached the hand rails to wood. Wood in a bathtub/shower? There was a towel plugging a hole in the bathroom ceiling and the sink did not have a stopper. The water pressure was very low (I don't know if this was just during our visit or like this all the time) The TV's had no remote controls. I asked at the desk and they said they had none. I haven't had to manually change channels in 25 years. (Ok I am lazy). The air conditioners worked perfectly but I will not be surprised if it fell out of the wall in the coming days. There was a crack in the wall....... that I could see light coming in from outside!! There was NO ICE for our entire stay. They didn't have an ice machine, but purchase bags and you can take one bag a day... if there was ever any to begin with. The hotel issues keys and not cards.

Everyone was very nice when we checked in. We proceeded to our suite which we were told that it had two beds and a living room area with a fold out couch. We were put in a Smoking room which were were unaware of. We walked in and the smell was so over powering, and it was so dirty.
