The bathroom had a bath and shower unit over the bath and was adequate although a little pungent at times. Reception staff obliged with a plug for the bath and extra milk for the tea and coffee, and were always smiley and friendly. As an earlier review states the quad room is right next to the kitchen and you feel that you are IN the kitchen when the chopping and preparing breakfast happens at circa 6.30am (this is the only downside). Breakfasts we worth the noise though - a good standard and variety of foods on offer. Location was good for walking-based expeditions, not the nicest looking street but less than 5 mins to restaurants, a Metro and only 20 mins walk back to the railway station on our departure.

Very very cheap toilet roll was not comfortable at all so hard :) 42 inch tv in double room which was quite impressing and had decent amount of channels.

Had a vending machine which was useful as not very close supermarkets around.

We were very happy with the hotel and our room. Staff were always welcoming and helpful. The bed and pillows were so comfy we had good sleeps. The bathroom was fine with nice toiletries and I loved the huge radiator to keep as warm or cool as you like. The rooms were relatively basic but were clean with nice furniature, big tv etc. Too be honest I have been to Amsterdam many time and stayed in many places, I personally feel that this hotel is the best value for money. It is not much more expensive than a hostel but is much better quality, for the price I think you get quite a lot. I cannot afford to stay in 5star places but personally wouldnt need to, this has everything we needed. I didnt notice the smell of smoke anywhere in the hotel which is surprising considering Amsterdam allows the smoking of cannabis and I assume many visitors come to take advantage of this. Maybe some guests don't realise its a non smoking place because 3 years ago, the hotel WAS smoke friendly. My only gripe about the hotel is when we booked through EXPEDIA, we were told that If we wanted breakfast we would need to pay an extra \u00c2\u00a372 for us both to eat breakfast during our stay. Of course we opted to eat else where at those costs but on arrival we were told breakfast was included! certainly pleased I didnt pay the extra. however, this is down to expedia. And thanks to the Falcon Plaza, we had breakfast when we were not expecting it. A great stay.

The beds were so comfy and the pillows were the best I've ever slept on. The staff were friendly, breakfast was continental, enough to fill you up to start the day. There is a handy supermarket 2 mins round the corner. The hotel also kept our bags in a room because we had a late flight home and wanted to do some more sight seeing.

Pondering what to do and where to stay, worrying over every negative comment that is made and after all the stress and worry I still end up going for the cheapest available within reason that I can at least find one half decent review for. I am therefore going to give a very blunt and honest review to try and save you the same pressure i unnecessarily put myself through each time i plan a trip. - Its was rated as a 3 star hotel - i feel this is a correct rating in comparison to other places I have stayed. Ive given a pointer for each catagory and then written more details below - Location - Close enough to be convenient but far enough to be quiet!!!! Hotel Room - Small but clean and equipped. Food - Continental and as you would expect from this level of hotel - But no room service! Staff - Mostly friendly Noise - Quiet and no \"Louts or Stag / Hen Parties\" Location - It was in a quieter part of the City Centre - Approximately 5 minutes from nearest cafes and restaurants, Approx 15 minutes from Dam Square, Central Station and Red Light District. If like us you are into Strolling and taking in the surroundings it really does not feel a long walk as you are looking at canals and monuments along the way and stopping for the occasional drink. When booking tours they do a bus service from the hotel so there is no need to worry about getting to the tour near central station. In the opposite direction about 10 mins away you have the Artis Zoo (this was expensive at over 18 euros a ticket so we didn't bother) but another 10 mins further on is the Oosterpark which was peaceful and very pretty. Living in a town near London I like having everything on tap and can be a bit lazy with walking - I did not feel this hotel was too far out or a problem. Furthermore on the odd night where you are worn out from walking or had one too many holiday cocktails then the tram is cheap and very accessible. Oh and the Ice bar is only 5 mins away Hotel - From the outside was not the best (but then you are not there to stare at the outside) After reading reviews on here about the canabis smells and thugs I was nervous expecting the worst but must say extremely surprised it was clean, fresh and modern looking. The Reception staff were friendly. Our flight was early before the room was ready so they happily locked our bags away for us and explained where we could get food and drinks etc. Room - When entering the bedroom i was a little disappointed by the size (it is small) but again it was clean, modern, fresh and very well equipped. The TV was a large flat screen and had several English channels, the bed although a small double was comfortable with crisp sheets. Bathroom - This was probably the most disappointing as it was Tiny. Don't expect to pamper yourself in the bath as there is not one and the toliet is so close to the wall you have to sit sideways. However, again it was well equipped with a warm shower with good pressure. We didn't get any hot/cold situations and the hairdryer although not the best, did its job. Food - The breakfast was standard. It is continental and same each day Consisting of Croissants, Bread, Rolls, Tea Cakes, Boiled Eggs (although luke warm) Scrambled Egg, jams, cereal, yogurt and tinned fruit plus some pineapple. It is not the best by any means and don't expect a hearty fry up or hangover cure but it filled a gap and was included in our price. Normal Selection of Drinks. The only downside was that you cant get Room service so if you want a romantic breakfast in bed its not available. We did ask reception if we could take food back up to bedroom and they agreed but be careful as this is not correct information. Do not attempt to remove food from the restaurant as the two little chinese waitresses will pounce on you, waving their fingers, shouting no no no! and creating a scene in front of all the other diners so unless you have thick Skin like my other half who gave as good as he got I would recommend stick with not attempting breakfast in bed in this hotel :-) Staff - Polite, well spoken, friendly (apart from waitresses if you remove the food), Noise - I was from other reviews a little worried I would be kept up all night or in the morning but have to say our room was very quiet. The average guests we saw at breakfast were middle age couples and young couples. One group of 4 guys in their 20s but we experiences no noise trouble. Did not see one stag party or any \"Louts\" near the hotel area. Overall - We could not fault our trip but we expect to get what we pay for. If I want 5 star to enjoy a luxury hotel with huge baths, tip top Staff and incredible food then I spend \u00c2\u00a3400 a night to go to the Dorchester London or George V in Paris. If I want a last minute good city break for a reasonable figure where I am more interested in the Sights and Experiences then this hotel did a good job and was clean quiet and friendly.

For God knows what reason, the bedsheet was too small. I'd only noticed it in the middle of the night when my PJ rolled up and my legs felt the rough texture of the mattress underneath. Of course I pointed it out to the receptionist the next morning. He appeared appalled, saying that is unacceptable, and will have it changed immediately. What a liar! When I came back to the room at night, it was status quo. As I had only one more night left, I left it as it is. This is in addition to another complaint that I had lodged in the first evening to another receptionist. Our room's main light wasn't working. He came up to check, after which he suggested us bearing with it and relying on the bedside lamps first, and he'll have it rectified the following morning. Another liar! So together with the bedsheet, I complained again about the lights to the second receptionist. Not surprisingly, nothing was changed at all. Location's not as good as described.

Having seen a number of negative reviews and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low ranking on this website, we were a little concerned before we went. However, we needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have worried and our experience of the hotel was very positive. It was a comfortable, friendly and extremely good value-for-money base for our stay in Amsterdam. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location might not be ideal for anyone wanting to be right in the very heart of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightlife. However, it is only a 5 minute walk from the transport hub of Waterlooplein, and, for people like us who are happy to walk around the city, it was a comfortable walking distance to most of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractions. Approximate walking distances from the hotel to various places are:- nearby restaurants (5 minutes), Rembrandtsplein (10 mins), Red Light District (10 mins), Dam Square (15 mins), Central Station (15 mins), Anne Frank House (20 mins) Leidesplein (20-25 mins). The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look anything special from the outside (and not as nice as the Ibis next door) but it is fine inside. It is situated on a non-touristy street which seems to have a lot of furniture/interior design showrooms. One apartment a couple of doors along from the hotel does look shabby but the rest of the street is fine and we felt safe walking at all times. We stayed in room 310 which was clean, spacious and nicely-decorated, with side views of a canal. It also had a Plasma TV, free room safe and a good-sized bathroom with bath/shower. It was much better than we were expecting to be honest. The breakfasts were also good:- fairly standard continental fayre but with hot scrambled eggs and particularly nice fresh bread, and much better than my previous two Amsterdam experiences at other tourist class hotels. The decoration in some of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corridors looks a little tired in places, but nothing too off-putting.

It was also nice to open the wardrobe and find a decent quantity of clothes hangers!!. Even though the Hotel was fully booked the only time I heard other guests was in the morning when they were leaving. The buffet breakfast was, as most people have previously reported, above that which you would normally expect and the staff were very courteous and polite. The Hotel does not have a bar but as there was one at the hotel next door this was not a major concern. It does however have a drinks machine and a small snack machine should you get thirsty or peckish during the day or night. As I was not driving I did not need to avail myself of the car parking facilities but the receptionists were very happy to order taxi's for me when needed and they usually arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered.

Upon entry, the reception did not give away much and we thought, we can tolerate a hotel we haven't yet scoped out for just one night. As soon as we entered the hallway with rooms however, the scenery changed. A chamber maid was cleaning a room right next door and had casually taken the sheets, towels, you name it and plopped them onto the floor in the middle of the hallway. Yuck! Then we opened the door to our own personal hell. Our hotel room immediately stank of cigarettes and some other odors I don't care to identify. We noticed the carpet was littered with many mystery stains of impressive size. In addition, the window sill was full of cigarette butts, empty wine bottles and odd objects like a hair brush. The bathroom appeared to be clean but at this point we were so disgusted that we decided to shower in our slippers and not take them off unless they were to be replaced with shoes. We're not neat freaks mind you - just normal people that enjoy a healthy dose of hygiene. That night I dared to look at the mattress. What a mistake!! i won't go into the details here but I refrained from telling my husband what I saw lest he sleep standing up, propped against the wall or something. We did however, sleep in our clothes, vampire style with our hands crossed across our chest. Needless to say we were more than eager to get the hell out of this garbage place and get on our flight. I can safely tell you that our economy class seats were more comfortable and clean than that pig sty. We thought of taking pictures but decided against such a reminder of a horrible night on a trip that had been so pleasant.

I do have to comment on the sheets though, very comfortable...felt as soft as a baby's arse. I slept very well. Decor: Left a LOT to be desired, painting and carpeting was very shoddy and heavily used, it looked like the owner had got a couple of his mates to do the maintenance and they had taken him for a ride, this place seriously feels like a low budget motel, for a high star rated price.

There was a TV, a wardrobe (with safe), a dressing table but the best feature was the hot power shower - just what you need after a day in the red light district...

Not their fault, but no attempt to hide it away or even sweep it out of the way, just left it in the path. When we entered, wasn't too fussed with the interior, seemed pretty o.k. based on the outside, got our room key from a women who didn't even know we were coming even though we pre-booked before.... Got to the room by using a rickety old lift that would be more suited to... well nothing, and was shocked at the state of the room compared to what we were paying. O.k, so we weren't expecting the hilton or anything, but the bathroom was dirty, bed was dirty, window was cracked and the wardrobe was kicked in and looked like it had been taped back together! Myself and brother were not going to pay \u00c2\u00a3100.00 a night for this, so we (After reading GOOD reviews) decided to go next door (Like many others) to the hotel ibis. On route with our bags, a man who I can only guessed owned the place tried to rugby tackle my brother for walking out with the bags while I gave them the key back.... customer service at it's best!!
