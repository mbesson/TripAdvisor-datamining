The hotel was working on renovations during our stay. At times we felt that we may have been the only guests in the hotel, we didnt see anyone else the first day. The staff working when we checked in was friendly and carried my bags to our room. He did not speek english and told us, so that we didnt attempt to ask him questions that he didnt understand. The front desk staff gave us a map and told us where to get on and off to see all of the attractions. The staff told us how to buy train tickets and wrote down the names of the stops that we should get off at. This hotel is near the tube and the line that runs from here goes near all of the paris attractions. This hotel is not near the main train station Nord. Our room had a nice view of a court yard. The tub is quite small and the shower is a bit low. My husband is over 6 ft tall and needed to almost kneel in the tub to shower. The room is very clean and the bed was very comfortable. There is a cafe at the end of the block, a p\u00e2tisserie a block away and a lovely grocery shop a black away. The tube is a black away and the hotel is situated on a lovely and quiet street. Staff are friendly and are helpful with reservations, taxi's and info. Note: If you call a taxi you pay a reservation fee, if you just go to the street and hail a taxi you save 15 euros. This is a lovely hotel on a quiet street. The only reason I dont give them 5 stars is because they worked on renovations early in the morning. We also had to be very careful not to touch the walls or the rail on the stairs cause the paint was wet and the floors were covered in drop cloths. Our room was comfy.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our family stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "stevejanklm", "ReviewID": "UR122986879", "Content": "The rooms were small (which we were prepared for) and it was a little hard to find when we arrived in Paris but we got there in the end using the metro.

The room we were given was very small. That's not unusual for Paris so nothing to complain about there really but besides this there were other big problems. Firstly the room was in dire need of re-decoration. Wallpaper was peeling from the wall, I believe due to a lack of ventilation, a brief shower would make the room very stuffy. Upon entry to the room the first thing we did was to open the window and there was a noticeable odour if it was not left open. There were cracks and bulges on the bathroom ceiling with what appeared to be red mould growing in them. The toilet was in a separate room to the sink which was unusual and the fact that this small toilet room had no ventilation was an issue. Other flaws included, but were not limited to, chipped paint on the skirting boards and cracked plastering around the light in the toilet boxroom. When I raised the issues with the staff we were told that there was no space (not surprising given the time of year) and that the room was clean so there shouldn't be a problem to stay in it. The young man on reception on arrival was very pleasant and nice about the situation and there was clearly nothing he could do. Other than that I was disappointed by the level of service. I specifically emailed prior to visiting and asked if we could have breakfast on the 1st of January and was told it would be no problem. On arrival we were informed that no breakfast was being offered. The hotel was in the process of renovation so it may be that the issues with this room will be eliminated during this process but for now I would recommend avoiding the hotel. The young man who we dealt with was a credit to the hotel and we settled up for the one night we stayed with no problems. Other than that I unfortunately don't have anything positive to say about this hotel.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "taillebourg", "Title": "\u201cA no go\u201d", "Author": "rogerrheydt", "ReviewID": "UR121084382", "Content": "Too expensive, bad service, nice view but noisy, just forget about it.

Must mention a special thank you to Crystalle who tried sooooo hard to book a table for us at 'Frenchies' restaurant prior to our arrival.

The hotel is not located on a main road so all was fairly quiet at night. Also, the hotel is located close to two metro stops (Chateau de Vincennes and Berault) on Line 1, which takes you directly to stops in the center of Paris such as the Louvre, Rue de Rivoli, Etoile,etc. Although some people do not like small hotels such as this in which the rooms are so close to one another that you can hear everything that goes on outside your room, if this does not bother you, I highly recommend this hotel.
