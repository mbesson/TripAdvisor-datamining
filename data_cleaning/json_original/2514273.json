Once you enter this hotel you would smell a terrible sausages smell that would make you feel like throwing up. I stayed there for 13 nights with friends, 2 double rooms and 1 triple. My room was average, had a large double bed, a couch, a TV, an extremely small closet, a kettle that doesn't work, a heater that was too hot to the extent that we used it as a drier so that things would dry in no time, the bathroom was tinny as well without shampoo or soap, only toilet papers. Another double room was sooo small, my friends couldn't move around, the bathroom wall wasn't totally connected to the ceiling so there was an area that had a void, there was no bathtub just a shower and the water would flow inside the room. the triple room was small as well, it had 2 or 3 desks inside, no idea why??? the 3rd person was sleeping on a mat put on the floor, and it was next to the storage room, so they could hear the staff moving around them all the way. Every time somebody walks around or climb the stairs you would hear him/her. The walls are too thin so you always hear noise. For breakfast, we had the same food the whole trip, eggs, cereals, jam, butter and bread. They wouldn't serve enough bread for the seven of us, they would throw the plates in our faces, and yell at us if we ask for more bread or ask if our food will arrive soon.

Due an error made by Hotel Enrico we were shunted off to this hotel late at night. We were met by a very nasty and rude old man. Our room was on the top floor - it was so dirty we were afraid to take our shoes off. We were afraid what we might find in the bed, we were afraid of who might enter the room while we were sleeping. Not the ideal hotel experience. The next day we decided we had to move, after being offered a room somewhere else we were approached by an Indian staff member who said he had a better room for us. The room was better - it was on the ground floor and much more spacious. Albeit that the shower did reek of urine and the plumbing was from somewhere during the 1800s. The area (near Edgeware rd station) was dominated by Middle Eastern people - if you like the smell of turkish pipes then go no further - this is the place for you! Back to the hotel - the breakfast was good - eggs, bacon, baked beans, tea/coffee, toast, juice and cereal - nothing fancy but enough to get you through. Just be warned if you ask for bacon and your skin is not white, they may ask you outright if you are Muslim - the girls in the breakfast room dont have a lot of tact but they are efficient and nice. Other thing to remember - if for some reason you read all these bad reviews and actually decide to stay here, is that there is a real day/night difference. The night staff are Middle Eastern and must have missed the customer service lesson, the day staff are Indian/Pakistani - they are much nicer and will try and help you out as much as they can. Also if you stay in room facing the street, make sure you close your windows or you will arrive home to a room that reeks of hookah smoke. Overall we would never ever stay here again, even if you paid us! It was horrible and really the hotel from hell.

She had to literally crawl up the stairs on all fours and come down the stairs in the sitting position.

An electric socket on the wall, adjacent to the door, had wires exposed and was without a cover. The main door to the room was secured by a simple Yale lock and the sliding door to the ensuite was loose which made it very difficult to operate properly. The decor comprised cracks in the walls, from ceiling to floor, and large areas of water staining on at least two walls. The curtains were attached to the rail with several of the hooks missing. There was no soap, towels or floor mat in the ensuite toilet/shower. Only two towels were left in the room for three guests. Two additional towels were provided by reception, one of which was damp and was to be used as a floor mat to prevent slipping on the wet tiles.

We walked into the hotel and there was many young muslims in there and very rude speaking, I dont have a problem with muslims as my boyfriend is also one but even the guy at reception didnt even smile or greet us, he gave us our key and we had to walk to the top floor and once we got there, we noticed are door was open! we walked in and the bed filled the whole room apart from a tiny sink in the corner, there was no sheets and the wardrobe didnt even have a door! ... i couldnt stay in here i said, so i went back to the lobby and told the receptionist that its discusting so he made us pay \u00a320 for an upgrade room, so the room he gave us this time was *i would say* in the basement, we walked down many stairs which were only half carpeted! and had grip rods sticking out at you! we walked into the room and admittedly it was alot better than the other room, but there was still many problems, the wallpaper was stripped off, the tv didnt work, the blinds were broken also the dust was dispicable! the only room that looked nice was the bathroom. the heater only comes on till about 9pm and goes off all night when its cold and in the middle of december and snowing! also 30 minutes of going into the room, me and my boyfriend wanted to have a rest as we travelled a long way and was tired, but we found the door opening and this woman just walked in! and she said \"oh ur already in, ok\" and shut the door .. we found it to be the cleaning woman, never gave us an apology or anything, i really dont recommend this hotel, its vile and discusting and also very noisy!!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheringham, Norfolk", "Title": "\u201cOk for budget hotel.\u201d", "Author": "XActingX", "ReviewID": "UR47917486", "Content": "Me and my mum booked three night and after reading the reviews we were very close to booking a different hotel, however we wasnt willing to pay over \u00a3600 for three nights so we decided to stick with it. On arrival we were quite surprised, staff were ok and reception not too bad. Walking upto out room we noticed the further we went up, the worse things looked, paper off the walls, walls scratched... getting into our room it was extremely small, hardly any room to move around. the forst thing we did was check the bed (from everybodied reveiws on bed bugs) which were extremely clean, and the shower, again, very clean. there was only one towel so we sked reception for more and we got them. The shower was lovely and hot and rooms were cleaned everyday. Poeple complain about the noise, but what do you expect in the centre of london?? For us, the location was fantastic and we use a hotel room to sleep and shower. We would only use this hotel as a last resort, as the rooms are small and could do with one heck on a make over....but we survived, slept well, showered and explored london! By the way, there is a beautiful Tapas restaurnt round the corner which i recomend.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cOkay for a budget hotel.\u201d", "Author": "DotDevon", "ReviewID": "UR37611834", "Content": "Just returned home from a two night stay at the Ventures Hotel. I arrived at the hotel with great trepidation having booked the hotel and read the reviews after, plus three teenagers in tow.

Teenage boys in twin room quite a way from myself but checked their room and found it adequate, plus they loved being away from me.Breakfast was small portions but filling as it was three courses.Staff friendly and efficient considering the numbers they have to cater for in a short space of time in the mornings. Overall for a budget hotel with a fantastic location which is what I wanted on a short break to London with teenagers I found this hotel absolutely fine. I felt the staff tried to accomodate me and my family well. After checking out we were able to leave our suitcases there all day with no extra charge.

The staff are rude, the wallpaper is held together with sellotape, there is so much limescale on the shower head that the water merely trickles out (if you are brave enough to even have a shower there), the toilet bowl is stained, the tables and TV are covered in a thick layer of dust, there are exposed wires at the electricity sockets, the 'carpet' is full of holes and tears...it is absolutely HELLISH. We booked a double room for 2 nights...we struggled through the 1st night, barely getting any sleep as the locals who frequented this place tramped up and down the stairway through the night. We both woke up with skin irritations due to bed bugs, dirty sheets, or both. We then demanded our money back, and were told that usually they do not offer refunds but since we made it clear our health was obviously at risk they gave us back the money for the 2nd night.
