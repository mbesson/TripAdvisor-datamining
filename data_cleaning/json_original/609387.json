{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Value for Money I stayed here with my young son for three nights recently, and was consistently impressed with this property. We negotiated directly with the hotel for $US30 per night for a room very close to the pool, with a fan, including breakfast. While the room had no TV or fridge, it was roomy, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It had an outdoor bathroom which was enchanting. The pool is quite big and clean. Everyone was very friendly and the service was prompt and personal.Given that this is one street back from the beach and is rather more budget than those along the beachfront, it is much cheaper, but I found it to be great value for money. The inclusive breakfasts are smaller with just fruit and toast and/or pastries, but you could order two eggs and bacon for 6000 rupiah ($1NZ). The restaurant was really very reasonably priced, but I was a bit disappointed that it was not open in the evening.Swastika is in the middle of the Sanur strip, but is still very quiet, and only about 500m walk from Hardy's supermarket.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR954548298", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SweetOtter"}, {"Content": "The best .Budget but good.

Stayed at the Swastika for 5 nights in August,  had a really pleasant stay, for around \u62e28 a night each, you cannot expect the earth  it met all our expecations.Lovely staff, nice huge room with 2 double beds, good AC, hot water, front terrace, set in lovely gardens.Don't know about the brekky - never had it! And never used the pool either.Security seemed good - staff on duty all night long.No safes in the room, but free deposit boxes available at reception.Also helped me recieve an important fax from the UK during my stay!Mozzies weren;t a problem, but as a precaution they provided an electrical mozzie killer  also sprayed the rooms each evening.Beach is approx 5 mins walk away, shops  restaurants are all less than 2 mins away.Would definitely recommend to the budget traveller.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR924950040", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AdrianGFC"}, {"Content": "Great Value Traditional Bali Accomodation Ok so i wasnt sold on this place when a friend of mine suggested it , firstly it sounded too cheap and secondly i was kinda used to resort hotels.But im slowly coming to terms with the fact that all i require from a hotel is a clean airconditioned room with reasonable facilities.The Swastika bungelows has it all , friendly and extremely helpful staff nice clean basic big rooms , we stayed for 5 nights and were extremely satisfied.Great value for money it worked out at \u62e28 a night each dont expect 4 star etc but i think you will find it great value for money.As mentioned before maybe the masks are a bit scary bit the rooms are done out in tradional balanese style which really did work for usThere is a pool on site which although we didnt try always looked clean.As keen divers we didnt spend too much time in the room however we definatly wernt disappointed by this resort.Sanur itself is crying out for tourism at the moment there are so many hotels and places to eat to choose from which may be daunting , this place is a gem if you like simple traditional style rooms with the bonus of aircon youll love this place we certainly did", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR632937650", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rvfdan"}, {"Content": "Ok if you are on budget The room we stayed was clean and the place is sprawling with greenery. The staff are extremely friendly. We didn\u9225\u6a9b get to swim in the pools but they look clean. One of the pool near the breakfast area is bigger. Its near Hardy\u9225\u6a9a Supermarket (just 3-5 mins away) and the beach. Its a decent, no frill accommodation. But if you like the standards of at least a 3-4 star hotel or you'll like to spend most of your time in the accommodation, this is not the place. We find only 2 small bar soaps in the bathroom. The 1st room we stayed has no pole in the bathroom to hang our towels . The place is very quiet and dark at night. My boy was extremely uncomfortable with the masks on the wall. The water pressure was low. Breakfast is bread, juice and eggs. Only Indonesian channels are available on the TV. We went for massage and spa at Mandurah Spa (recommended by one of the staff) and they have fetch and send service. (Fetch is free, send is Rp15000). It was a pleasant place and our massage room has attached bath tub, big enough to sit a couple. The spa package with massage, scrub and aromatic flower bath is one of the cheapest we can find. Rp 100,000 for Milk Bath Package, 115,000 for Herbal Bath, 125,000 for Fruit Bath Package, Facial 75,000, Mani  Pedicure @ 50,000 each. Its about 5 mins by taxi from Swastika. [--]. We stayed in Sanur  Jimbaran and found food choices is wider and cheaper in Sanur. We ate at Bonsai Caf\u8305 by the beach and enjoyed the good food there. Nice beef steak at Rp40,000, lobster with yellow rice at about Rp 155,000.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR107062286", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "May-Tong"}, {"Content": "Gorgeous Place!!! I visited this lovely hotel in June 2006. It's in a really nice, relaxed setting and all the rooms are spread among the gardens so you feel like you're on your own. We were a group of 4 so had two double rooms which were located beside each other with a lovely private porch/balcony. The porch/balcony was really big with nice chairs and places to hang wet clothes and whatnot. The rooms were really big as well, each double room with 2 double beds in it! Service in the hotel was really good, everyone was really friendly and helpful. The pool area was goegeous as well, and not busy at all with more of an authentic feel to it. There was a massage area beside the pool as well. Overall i LOVED this hotel, it was so calm and relaxed and just beautiful.

The weather was perfect and one of the things that I really enjoyed this year was sitting on the balcony overlooking the pool, both first thing in the morning and late at night. It is sooooo restful and serene. The breeze was cool and refreshing.The standard of cleaning was good, the bathroom, while not pristine, is ok once you get the hang of where to stand- it is a shower over deep bath and the hose points at the wall- so get the angle right and its good! The water was always hot (beware hot and cold symbols have been reversed). You need to ask for an extra towel to act as bath mat- given angle of water spray you get a pretty wet floor. Towels were v good- 2 fluffy white ones. Sheets changed and clean daily.Pool was clean and cool, lots of deckchairs and no-one reserves them!!!!!!!Staff friendly and accommodating. Rate very good- same as last year.Location is great- half way along Jl Tamblingan,I highly recommend the place", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR536708043", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gillg"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70b9\u5117\u9289\u7b3a\u5137   showReview(20752832, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR212289369", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7ed4\u5b2a\u6e74\u93c9\u2032\u6b22\u9287\ue1ba\u501b\u9287\u52e9\u5136\u9289\u7b3a\u5064\u9289\u5a3f\u5122\u9289\ue0a0\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137   showReview(19171273, 'full');", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR372696290", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gut,preiswert!
