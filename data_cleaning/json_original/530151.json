{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely My husband and I arrived late in the night approx 1am for 8 nights. We were welcomed with a cool drink and smiling faces. Our bags were carried to our room and we settled in.Both room and bathroom were large which allowed us plenty of space to move around. The air conditioner worked effectively and was welcomed after a day out.All linen was changed daily. I wish I could make a bed as crisp and fresh.There was a variety of food for breakfast with, cereal, yoghurt, noodles, omelettes, sausages, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon and great coffee.The ants are tiny and small lizards run up the walls but caused no inconvenience, actually found them to be entertaining and were everywhere even in restaurants.There were monkeys that would wonder through, but were never a nuisance, there was no trouble with them in dining areas. Champlung Sari is right next to the monkey forrest so you have to expect to see a few.The pool is small but deep and was always clean.The Spa room is great I had a 3hr treatment and felt fabulous after.Staff acted promptly with any request which were only minor ie; hairdryer, charger outlet for phone.Staff even though they were limited in their english and understanding, were always pleasant and eager to please. Staff would offer to drive you around the sites or could organise someone for you. We found it easier dealing with staff than the hundreds of drivers on the street.Champlung Sari is in a great position at the bottom of Monkey Forrest road near the monkey forrest. There is a small steep hill but then a good walk along the road which is filled with many shops and restaurants. The markets are approx 10 to 15 min walk depending if you browse.The staffOver all our stay was quiet and pleasant, with the bad reviews that have been printed we were greatly surprised.", "Date": "Jan 9, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR933814680", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "link61"}, {"Content": "Nice place, some items need attention.

They even suggested that we could stay our whole trip at this other place, we said no we wanted to come back here. The other hotel was most definitely substandard to what we had booked and the room was locked with an outside padlock. The bathroom was third world to say the least. The only saving grace was the fact that the bed was comfortable. Next day back to the Champlung Sari where we made it known we expected a room. Staff not overly friendly or helpful but we got there in the end. Room was clean, bathroom a vast improvement on other place. Didn't expect too much knowing it was a heritage place. Breakfast was ok but not a lot of choice. Central location was good and the monkey forest was not a problem even though the monkeys came over every day. Got ripped off by our guide who was a worker at the hotel, didn't take us to the Elephant Park at Taro that I really wanted to visit, instead took us to the Bakas Elephant Park which was a major disappointment. He tried to tell me the one I wanted to go to was not good. I was too trusting and believed he was taking me to the one I wanted to see. A$85 later felt totally cheated and ripped off. Loved Ubud but will definitely look for a different hotel after reading other peoples similar reviews about so called water problems.

We consider this hotel because:1st It is near The Monkey Forest (that latter we realized this point should not be consider as an advantage at all) they monkeys overthere are aggressive and rude compare to the monkeys in Bedugul Forest and 2nd From the hotel pictures in the internet their room seems to be bigger than the other hotel of the same class. We look for a bigger room because we will travel with two grown up kids.At the time when we checked in, the front Manager said we had to add one extra bed for our child (12 yrs Old) at Rp. 150.000,- (which is twice the normal price at average hotel).At first we question why the price of their extra bed is so expensive. Then after we have no choice and we are about to fill in the guest form and pay the deposit, suddently they make another reason that the room for us are having problem with the water utilities so they will transfer us to another hotel nearby. Well, it is no use for us to urguing with them to insist to have room in their hotel, since It seems that actually they have no room available (what a poor management).Latter they transfer us to another hotel nearby that gave us a standard room which is much smaller than their deluxe room.We would like to advice fellow traveller not to consider booking this hotel if you don't want to be upsetted like us.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR452646978", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Samajivikata"}, {"Content": "NEVER again I was at the same wedding as the previous person, and must say that the admin staff is absolutely shocking. The duty manager obviously has never worked in hospitality, as he does not know the meaning of the word nor practice it.Not only were the rooms over booked for over 15 guests of the wedding, but a party of 8 germans that just flew in after a 16 hr flight were told to go elsewhere because their rooms are not available.There was NO offer of consolation, and the alternative hotel offered was worse than the dingiest hostels i've seen. (One of the rooms had to be locked by padlock... from the outside!) I think this is unacceptable of any establishment and by a matter of principle i would strongly recommend NO one to stay here. I would lrave Ubud before having to stay here again.The rooms were dated and the floors needed sweeping as they were quite dirty.

The trip was booked and paid for some 6 months in advance.We were greeted by a rather grumpy front desk manager who had a bad attitude. The manager was extremely unhelpful and rude. One wonders why the Champlungl should employ him. When the group arrived, 4 rooms were arbitrary cancelled and dumped to nearby [--] holes half the price. The Hotel was over booked.The following day another 5 couples had no rooms. The keys of one couple were given to us the previous day but we handed it back for safe keeping as they would arrive the next day. After threatening we would report this to the authorities because they had no right to give away the room, mysteriously the key was given to us.Otherwise the staff were very polite and friendly.

I agree with the other reviewers. The location is excellent - in the middle of Ubud. The gardens are beautiful, albeit small. There is a nice pool, also small. The rooms are large, situated in attractive Balinese-style houses. The towels had obviously been washed but did not seem to have been replaced with new ones since the Dutch occupation. They were tattered and had an awful smell of dirty feet. The bedsheets had also been washed but had indellible yellow stains.Breakfast was just about OK, not much selection. Each time there were at least one or two male monkeys sitting on the beams above the open-air breakfast hall, ready to jump on somebody's table and snatch food. I witnessed two real occurences of that: monkeys jumping smack bang into people's plates and fleeing with their croissants. Some tourists think that this is funny. There are also those who think that getting bitten by a monkey at the nearby Monkey Forest Temple is a laughing matter. During a 1 hour vist there, I saw two women (one English, one Scottish) getting bitten. They laughed. Had those ignorant people never heard of rabies, tetanus, AIDS, and all the other lethal or potentially lethal conditions you can contract from a monkey's bite? And, boy, are they aggressive! I saw a man being attacked by a male monkey for no reason at all.However, the hotel and temple staff do practically nothing about that, because in Bali the monkeys are venerated as gods, so how can you chase a god away with a stick? No way. There are more reasons not to go to that hotel. Nearby hotels offer similar-to-better conditions, without aggressive monkeys, for less money. You can get a very decent double room (I saw some) in a hotel with a nice garden, located on the same street, for 180,000 rupiahs a night for the whole room = about 23 EUR. For Champlung Sari we paid 32 EUR for two adults + 6 EUR for a child = 38 EUR a night. A real rip-off considerign what the competition offers.

Thought the hotel itself and its gardens were lovely, as were perhaps the majority of the staff also.Hotel literally a stone's throw from the Monkey Forest and subject to a horde of monkeys using it as a playground. May not be to everyone's taste but the ensuing chaos is quite amusing and a highlight if a) you don't mind being woken up first thing in the morning by them banging on the roof and b) don't happen to lose anything to them.Only downside is the attitude of hotel's front office staff, by whom I was treated with undisguised contempt - one manifestation of which was being required to pay my accommodation up front to a sneering receptionist. This does not constitute hospitality and one sincerely hopes they either develop a degree of humility or are replaced by more professional staff in the future.", "Date": "Jun 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR642914015", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tweeterandthe"}, {"Content": "Pleasant and charming hotel I stayed at the Champlung Sari for 4 nights in April 2008. This is a small hotel with charming architecture and is conveniently located on Monkey Forest Road (the main tourist street in Ubud). There are many restaurants and shops close by. I had booked a Standard room which was very disappointing and was in an original state (approximately 30 years old). After the first night, I changed to a Deluxe room which had recently been fully renovated and was well worth the extra expense. The tour brochures advise that all rooms have been renovated - this is not the case. The Deluxe room was spacious and much more comfortable. It also included a large semi outdoor bathroom with very modern fittings. The restaurant served average food with the breakfast being quite bland. Take care at this hotel as it is located very close to the monkey forest and early in the morning and late in the afternoon the monkeys make their way through the resort (ie. to and from the monkey forest). Even at other times of the day, there are plenty of monkeys in the hotel area. Sunbaking at the pool can be difficult as the monkeys will steal everything including sunscreen! The hotel staff do their best to keep the monkeys away but if you do not like monkeys, maybe best to avoid this location. Overall, I would rate this hotel as a pleasant 3.5 star hotel. I recommend the Deluxe rooms but not the Standard rooms.I would be happy to stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR943229378", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lucy071"}, {"Content": "Basic but OK and friendly Had wanted to stay in Ubud and was booked into this hotel by our travel company. Its at the lower end of Monkey Forest Road and hence a 15 minute stroll uphill to the main centre of Ubud. The walk is easily broken by the many shops, restaurants and cafes along Monkey Forest Road! Overall this is 3* hotel (no bathrobes etc) and our room had been renovated in the not too distant past: large but rather stark - big bathroom with huge separate shower. No in-room safes, but safety deposit boxes behind reception. Breakfast buffet OK but their local coffee was awful. Staff were very friendly and helpful - its surprising how many waiters mentioned their brother/cousin who had a car to hire for sightseeing...The hotel is mainly used by tour groups who only stay for 1 or 2 nights and thus has a fairly transient atmosphere. It was our wedding anniversary during our stay and the manager got the chef to do us a special Balinese dinner for two by the pool which was lovely: they put tea lights round the pool and decorated everywhere with flowers just for us. I think they were happy to have something special to do and we really appreciated their efforts.Overall, its fairly basic although the renovated rooms are simple but fine. Ubud does have some swanky hotels (Amandari and Pita Maha etc) so this 3* hotel does fill a niche and they have a new manager who is trying hard.Would we stay there again? Maybe for value, but we spotted some other places along Monkey Forest that might be worth a try on our next visit.
