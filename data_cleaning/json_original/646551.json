Our rooms were not ready when we arrived so they did one room quickly to allow us to have a place to freshen up whilst they finished the other room. Having heard about the noise from the nightclub i requested rooms on the 3rd/4th floors and they were happy to oblige. The rooms were spacious and clean, and we found that the hotel staff were happy to supply us with additional towels and pillows as we requested - strangely they only ever put half a roll of toilet paper in the bathrooms but we rang housekeeping and they rectified this! Upon checking in, the hotel did request that we leave our passports with them so they could photocopy the necessary pages. I would urge you to ensure you get your passports back the same day; I went down to collect our parties' passports a couple of hours after check-in and they had to search a bit for them which was rather worrying. The breakfast did include many items you would not normally expect to see in a buffet (e.g. stir-fried fish!) but there was an omelette bar and a good selection of breads and fresh fruit. The staff were helpful and attentive - its amazing how much they appreciate a \"thankyou\". whilst our party did not make use of the services, there was a free bus service by the hotel to several malls and beaches - we just found that the departure times of these buses were far to early for us considering we were on holiday. On our first night we dined in the Thai restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. the soups were exceptional. We also booked the desert safari, and if you do so please note that we managed to haggle a bit and get the hotel to drop 10UAD off each person! definitely worth a try! all in all, i was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Having been lucky enough to stay in some excellent hotels previously, this was better service than i expected considering the price. the location is rather central to the Deira district, and whilst it isnt actually on Al Riqqa road, rather it is on a side road, the bonus of this is that there was minimal traffic noise late at night.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised after reading the reviews.\u201d", "Author": "gina_wilder", "ReviewID": "UR33143411", "Content": "My daughter, 24, and I got a cheap deal out there for 5 nights in June.

They had very little knowledge of the local area and knew even less about sites for travellers to go and visit. Another common problem was the poor English of the hotel staff. They misunderstood what one was asking them and so they would guess the answers and consequently we were given misleading information about the beach shuttles for example, so we ended up missing the trips to the beach!

My family and I wore Muslim swimming costume attire yet the manager of hotel was v v rude and insulting stating that we were wearing normal attire and were liars and demanded us to come out of the pool. The women receptionists were very arrogant, rude and judgmental. There is loud music coming from upstairs and downstairs rooms. Unknown as to what they are. Assumption that they are brothels. Not a gd place to stay if you wish for peace and quiet as the music shakes floor boards until 2/3am. The trip was fantastic as we were only ever in New dubai and Jumeriah Madina. The hotel was only a place to sleep and get ready!! If you want a v budgted room and can put up with the above then you will enjoy.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for Money but !!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "theashers", "ReviewID": "UR21472934", "Content": "We stayed four nights, a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews.

The Grand Moov caught my eye as it had really good reviews and the price was so reasonalble for a 4 star hotel.. Arriving at the hotel I was not disappointed. The room was really spacious and super clean. We were a bit disppointed we didnt get to spend another night here.. I cant comment on the location, but did notice that it was in the old Dubai, where there are a lot of older buildings. Its was very close to the airport which was a bonus for us..

We were not disappointed with the move. The Grand Moov is a much nicer hotel. However it was not quite so central as the K Porte. Nevertheless it was only a few minutes walk to shops and restaurants. Our room was fine. It was large and newly furnished and had most modern amenities you would expect. Everything was clean and well cared for. The swimming pool was on the top floor and was perfect when you needed to cool off. It is only open from 9-6 but I think this is because the hotel are security conscious and have a lifeguard on duty during these hours. It was ramadam so the nightclub was closed therefore we were never disturbed at night. If I could change one thing it would be for the hotel to be placed nearer to the centre or the beach. One thing that really was helpful was the hotel shuttles which were free and ran everyday to the beach, the airport and different malls so this made up for the suburban location.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Whereshallwego2next?", "ReviewID": "UR19296766", "Content": "We stopped at the Grand Moov for a one night stopover.

Our stay at the hotel was a pleasant surprise, based on my expectations from trip advisor reviews. We paid about 40 pounds per room, and this was great value for what we got. Full size bathrooms, plenty of space and good decor. Communal areas pleasant. There was a good range of food for breakfast, although supplies were running quite low and we were hanging around for clean cups etc. Having said that there was an surge of guests as we arrived, we did not turn up until 10 and breakfast closed at 10.30, and staff were still bringing food out, so I wouldn't let that put you off.

While there was no internet in the room (4th level, away from lifts), I only needed to be online for a short while, so I went down to the lobby. I had to have dinner anyway, so ordered food there and it was OK and inexpensive. There's a Thai restaurant on the ground floor where you can drink alcohol, but since I live in Bangkok, the western menu in the lobby was fine for me. In regard to the noise, I was so tired I wasn't bothered by the nightclub at all. I heard the base, but it just didn't bother me. I woke up once to someone yelling REALLY loudly in Arabic right outside my door, but that was it. The lifts I couldn't hear, either. I always sleep with an eyeshade on, but I felt the curtains were adequate. The bed was really comfy and the water hot, there was shampoo and moisturiser (handy, since all my stuff was checked in and I didn't bring anything) and my wake-up call came twice, so I really have no complaints.

Loved previous hotels including Fairmont, Al Bustan Rotana, Deira City Centre and even two star Pearl Residence; But this one is in a very different category. Please stay away from this place unless you really want these guys to spoil your stay. Pros: 1. Clean room. 2. You are actually provided with a toothbrush and toothpaste Cons: 1. Very bad location: residential area, you have to walk a bit to get taxis but only the 15th one will stop as you are in no man's land. 2.Not a four star hotel: don't believe all the blurb on the website and yes, the photos in there have been photoshopped! 3. Hard bed and not so comfy pillows 4. Rather thin walls: I did hear the couple next door! 5. Poor TV channels available, no video on demand, and even then some channels do not work. 6. Rude guys at reception: they certainly won't go out of their way to help you. 7. Over-the-top security: it's like an obsession with bouncers everywhere. 8. Very very limited breakfast: same stuffs everyday and you just don't have choice. Oh, and there's no one who will do your omelette, it's all pre-cooked. 9. There's no iron in the room and they won't even give you one, forcing you to pay to have your clothes ironed. And even then, they insist on being told hours in advance. 10. Just 500ml complimentary water for your whole stay. 11. Minibar remains empty. But the fridge works though. 12. No visitor allowed even if you have paid for a double room, no upgrades allowed either. 13. Beware of the location of your room. Mine was about ten metres from lifts and these must be the noisiest I've ever heard. They are new all-right but they just \"ting\" at each level and you can hear them go up and down all night. Aaaargh! 14. They have a nightclub downstairs (filipino on top of that) but you'll have to pay to get in. And make sure you don't meet anyone there (or anywhere else) because you won't be able to taker her/him to your room. 15. Staff can be unhelpful with wrong directions and no sense of time. 16. No response to written feedback given when I left. 17. No newspapers in the morning. 18. No value for money at all. 19. Restaurant on rooftop but there are no windows to see the city. Probably because it was badly built but also because there is nothing to see in the neighbourhood apart from clothes hanging from windows of nearby flats. 20.
