{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Mardi Gras location Loved the location. Stayed here a couple of days after three days Uptown and I really liked the Marigny/French Quarter locale. Walk to everywhere! Bad news is that St. Claude street is nearby and it's the divider between good and bad areas so beware. Room was very large!!", "Date": "Jun 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR300779766", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ChicagoCris"}, {"Content": "Great location, nice  We recently stayed for 2 nights at the Kerlerec House run by a really nice guy named Scott. It is a complex of apartments, large  small, about a block away from the French Quarter. We stayed in the Jazz Suite - a nice bedroom with a four-poster bed,well equipped kitchen, and great bathroom with a huge stained glass window over the tub! We had our own porch in a really nice garden area, many fountains and tables also a huge hot tub which we didn't use. The place is just a 5-min walk from Frenchman Street,with great food  jazz. Very comfortable and affordable place to stay in interesting residential neighborhood. We bought fruit  croissants and had breakfast on our porch every morning - coffee was provided. It was very private,  we felt more comfortable than we would have in a bb with going back and hanging out on the porch mid-day when our feet were tired  we wanted to just sit in the sun with a coffee or cold beer. I recommend this place to couples or larger groups and families - there is a 2 bedroom and I believe you can rent the whole historic house out if you have a large party.", "Date": "Mar 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR192841973", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "shurl"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d609601-r8030835-The_Kerlerec_House-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "609601", "Price": "$237"}}
