We ask the receptionist on evening before we leave, to call us a taxi in the next morning the day when we left the hotel and he book us a ....somme private car. I belive it was a friend of him.

We had a family room right next to reception which was clean and well fitted - the decor is on the old side but i dont plan on living in the place so we didnt mind and despite the fact we were very close to the main door we werent disturbed.

The best you can say about this place is that it is located in a great neighbourhood with lots of hotels, shops and restaurants nearby, and within walking distance to Paddington Station (very convenient for the trains to Heathrow Airport). But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it. When checking in at about 2pm, we asked the young man at the reception if they had given us a quiet room as we had requested in our reservation. He said, he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure but the room \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be quiet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we arrived at the room, we noticed two things: firstly, the receptionist had lied to us as the room was facing the main street and not quiet at all. Secondly, and far more unpleasant, the room hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned yet and was still dirty from its former inhabitant. Really gross! In my opinion, this is an absolute no-go! This is the 21st century after all, and some form of communication between the chambermaids and the reception should be possible! And we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only guests with this problem! When we returned to the reception to ask for another room, we met some people again, whom we had seen upon arrival and they all had the same problem, too! The rooms they wanted to give us as an alternative were not acceptable, either, so we decided to just drop our luggage in the first, still dirty room, and head out for London instead! The unpleasant discoveries about this hotel continued upon our return to this place later in the evening: as none of us had ever seen such a filthy bathroom! Although we were yearning for a shower, a closer inspection of the mouldy shower curtain and the scale-infested shower head convinced us otherwise! The toilet brush was beyond words! We were all very disgusted with this bathroom and tried to touch as little as possible (which was made easy by the fact that there was virtually no shelf or anything where you could put your toiletries). The water tap in the washing-basin was also full of limescale! The entire bathroom was a serious risk to your health! Breakfast held more very unpleasant surprises. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still not sure what the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orange water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was meant to be.

The cheese and ham didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look very fresh, every time you needed something you had to get up and get it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an idea: just put a small tablecloth on every table, with plates, cups and cutlery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and teach your people what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cleaning a room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd actually means\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! We definitely won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at this horrible place again and cannot recommend it to anyone else either!

The hotel is basic but serviceable; we booked through a 'compare the market' type website and were pleased to see that the hotel had a lift which would help as I have a bad back. However the room we were allocated was on the second floor of a section of the hotel which did not have lift access, leaving us to scale 4 flights of stairs to reach the room which made returning back after an evening out similar to scaling Mount Kilimanjaro! The room was small (twin room) but servicable, however it was not up to my level of cleanliness as under the beds had not been cleaned thoroughly as I discovered when storing my case there until I needed to re-pack to leave. Our en-suite bathroom was tiny however, as its design was like a 'pod' wetroom where despite having a showering area with a curtain everything got wet regardless of how much I tried to avoid this happening. The shower area is pathetically small and it is impossible to sit on the toilet without your knees touching the door, once ensconced inside the shower room (which is no mean feat in itself!) it is very difficult to manouvre from the toilet to wash your hands without falling into the shower area, a particular nuisance when every surface is still wet after someone has a shower. The breakfast is stated as 'continental' - the breakfast we received is not one I would class in this manner. There are two cereals (corn flakes or rice crispies), slices of reconstituted ham, cheese and chicken, white bread toast, tea or coffee and very very cheap tasting orange juice with two yogurt pots at each table. The staff on hand in the basement restaurant (which is reached by a very steep staircase with low headroom) were very rude when asked a question, and would only answer any question with a yes or no. I questioned whether it was possible to have some brown bread as I am unable to each white bread but was given a monosyllabic 'no'. I must admit that by our last day we skipped the breakfast altogether and ate at a steakhouse restaurant opposite to Paddington station which offered a full english breakfast which was delicious - I feel that the hotel should take heed of this and offer such a service instead of their current meagre offering. Would I stay here again? No. However the location is very convenient and there are many, many other hotels along Sussex Gardens to chose from so I would recommend looking into those before considering the Alexandra Hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grimsby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOk if it's just a bed you want - no comforts\u201d", "Author": "Elderlybrother", "ReviewID": "UR76057172", "Content": "The place was adequate, just.

On the blocks between the hotel and the train station are numerous restaurants, cafes, and sandwich shops offering varying types of cuisine, plus convenience stores galore, and at least one Internet cafe. In the other direction, it's just a few blocks to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. A 15-minute walk through nearby Hyde Park will get you to the Royal Albert Hall. Unfortunately, the hotel itself is an abomination. You know you're in trouble when you realize that it's the only hotel on Sussex Place (the street is not Sussex Gardens, by the way, no matter what they say!) completely encased in scaffolding. And not just the main building, but the annex down the block, too. The scaffolding does facilitate recognition of the hotel from a distance, but there doesn't seem to be any actual construction or remodeling going on... except in a room off the lobby, next to where the only pay phone is. So if you need to use the pay phone during working hours, you won't be able to actually carry on a conversation with the person on the other end. The reason you will need a pay phone is that the room phones (at least the ones in the annex) can't be used to make outside calls! I don't mean that outside calls are prohibited, but that the phones just can't do it. Something to do with the wiring, or perhaps the nonexistent construction. You can call the front desk, and the clerk is always pleasant, and will even arrange for you to get additional pillows, but if you need a wake-up call, the reliability rating goes way down. Two mornings in a row, we had to wake up early for bus tours. The first morning, we got our call. The second morning, we didn't. Through some quirk of fate, I woke up with a half an hour to spare; we rolled out of bed, ran down the street and miraculously met up with our bus. The third time we needed a wake-up call, the clerk promised to knock on our door, because he suspected that there was something wrong with our phone. He knocked on our door 21 minutes late. Speaking of our door, it was one flight up in the annex. The room was very small, and so was the bathroom. The weather? Unseasonably warm. The air conditioning? What air conditioning? The window (without screen) opened onto some sort of concrete veranda, access to which could only be gained through a locked door on the stairway landing, so I supposed we were safe from an intrusion through the window if we needed to leave it open at night. Thankfully, I was right, even though an occasional construction worker did spend time during the day, including early morning hours, out on the veranda to smoke, guzzle a soft drink, and eat a bag of chips. The beds were quite comfortable. Remarkably, the room offered cabinet and closet space that was a notch above deficient. As for amenities, no facial tissues could be found (we had to buy our own), and, while the TV was an attractive flat screen sort that worked very nicely, we would have had to pay the hotel 10 pounds for a remote! So we didn't. A hair drier was hooked up to the wall, though- one of the few \"perks,\" if you will, that the hotel provided. We decided to skip the advertised free breakfast, which consisted of a few slices of cheese and ham (not good if you're a vegetarian), bread, and cold cereal. But since there were so many places to eat within a couple of blocks of the hotel, this didn't really matter. No, I don't recommend this hotel.

Here are some of the issues: 1. Shower in room smashed 2. Got stuck in the lift (Looks like a frequent occurence) 3. Staff do not care at all, totally disinterested in customers and treat you like vermin 4. Charged me for a simple tourist map of the area (Cheap) 5. The food at breakfast was the cheapest quality I have seen. 6. Bathroom dirty, actually had slime in it 7. Linen stained, bed worn out, sagging and lumpy 8. Furniture just old, dirty and dusty 9. Rooms noisy from either road or other guests (No sound proofing of any sort) 10. I could go on and on, this was a truly terrible experience Arrived from Hong Kong Jet lagged and found that the shower head in the room was smashed. Offered to move us but we were too tired, they agreed to shift us to a new room the next day which we did. Refused to fix the shower (No bath in the room) because no one to fix it on a sunday (rubbish, they were too cheap to get a plumber in the weekend) Hotel was full so they cleaned the room and gave it to another unsuspecting customer on Sunday night knowing the room had no washing facilities. When stuck in lift we pried the door open and climbed up and out and onto the floor above. Staff not even interested, when I went to the front desk the sole charge staff member just said oh...ok, I have re set it. (clearly knew how to reset the lift which implies to me that it is a common occurence and was not interested in customers experience.) Staff argue with customers eg. The lift and moving rooms. Another example was when I tried to enter the hotel via the front door on Sunday but it was blocked by someone on the front steps smoking and I had to sqeeze past him to get in. Turned out it was the front desk receptionist outside, smoking and making customers sqeeze past whilst he blew smoke at them. Charged me 1 pound for a simple map... I was jet lagged and too tired to argue but any other hotel would give it to you. Breakfast was a self serve affair. Available was: tastless white bread to toast, Jam, butter, pre sliced cheese that tasted nothing like cheese (must be the cheapest on the market) sliced ham (Real cheap stuff), cornflakes type cereal that was like chipped cardboard pieces (cheapest on market type of stuff), Heavily watered down orange juice..... need I say more??? Fantastic location but owners are cutting corners on maintenance, staff training, food quality and every other thing. Cutting costs to to a ludicrious level to maximise profit at customers expense.

I had stayed at another 2 star hotel for one night of my trip and that hotel was a bit cleaner and had a fridge (helpful for saving money on food and drink) but the location was worse.

We didn''t expect much given that it was a \"freebie\" and given some of the reviews we'd read, but the location was good and we had a fairly good idea what 2-star London hotels were like. Actually, it was fairly good. It is in a great location - a few minutes walk from Paddington (where Heathrow train arrives) and good bus routes , and close enough to walk to Hyde Park . The area also felt reasonably safe to us. Our room was very small - there were two single beds in it and barely enough room to walk between them to get to the (also very small) bathroom. But the beds were extremely comfortable, the shower was good, and there was basic tea/coffee making equipment. Breakfast was adequate, with plentiful cereal and toast. The staff didn't particularly go out of their way, but they weren't unhelpful. When we arrived at 8am they let us put our bags into the vacated but not yet cleaned room. I think others' comments about staff could be explained by the fact that this is certainly not a hotel with modern communications etc . We asked to leave our passports in the safe and handed over an envelope with them in ; when we retrieved them on the morning we left, the hotel receptionist appeared to lean under the counter and pick the envelope up off an open shelf , so we assume that's where they had been stored! The other incident occured when we decided we'd like to stay another couple of nights. We were due to leave on Monday morning and asked on the Saturday if there was a vacancy for the Mon & Tues nights . The reception staff couldn't tell us because the \"office\" was closed for the weekend - it seemed they had no way of knowing what bookings they had for the next few days. Their only suggestion was that we find an internet cafe and try to book online. (They apologised for the fact they didn't have any internet access at all in the hotel - not even for staff. ) All in all, we thought this was good value for money - providing you paid the hotel rate ... and here's where I'd add a word of warning. Singapore Air provided 2 free nights at the hotel as part of their airfare deal. But at this hotel, if you stay on a Friday or Saturday, you have to stay for 3 nights in total, so we had to pay for the 3rd night. The agency that managed the booking charged us the equivalent of 100 English pounds for one night for 2 people - but when we arrived at the hotel we found they would have charged us only 70 pounds (for either internet bookings or \"walk ins\") !
