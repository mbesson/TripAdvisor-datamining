The resort is outstanding! The grounds and pools are very well kept-up. The flowers all along the balconies of most of the second floor rooms were lovely. The Ambassador pool is huge, with a large shallow area, nice if you have little kids. You do have to get up early to save your chairs. Kind of a pain, but worth it if you plan on being there most of the day like we were. The pool servers were always checking if you need a drink, some food, whatever. The beach is \"eh\" - rocky like others have said. Ok for sandcastles, though. We stayed in the Ambassador section in an oceanfront pool suite, which was very spacious. We brought in a rollaway bed for our kids (6 and 2) and still had plenty of room. We didn't use the plunge pool very much, but it was fun when we did. Minibar was well stocked and replenished daily. A nice touch was that the man who restocked the room each day remembered that my kids liked the chocolate milk and banana chips, so he made sure we had extra. The bathroom is SO nice - huge walk-in shower with rain shower overhead (I have to have one of these now!), double sinks, vanity and huge Jacuzzi tub. All of the resturants are excellent. The food is fresh and local wherever possible. The stand alone restaurants: Sen Lin (asian-inspired), Frida (Traditional Mexican), Cocina de Autor (fine cuisine and wines), Lucca (Italian), and Piaf (French), are all are fantastic. Cocina de Autor was spectacular- we had the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Our server and sommelier were professional and gracious, spent time explaining each course and answering questions. Piaf and Cocina are adults-only, but children are welcomed in the others. We brought ours to Frida and Lucca, where they were nicely accommodated. Azul is the buffet restaurant in the Ambassaor section. It has a wide variety of options, all fresh and freshly prepared. We had breakfast there every day, offerings were fresh and yummy. We have to also point out that you get very very good service in all of the restaurants -friendly and always there. We also want to recognize the outstanding employees we had the pleasure of meeting. Rogelio, our concierge, was fantastic. My husband had some problems connecting to the Internet, and Rogelio was more than helpful in making it happen. He got us tickets and transportation for an excursion last minute and got our dinner reservations for us. Jose is a server at Azul who went above and beyond for us every time we sat in his section. He was super nice to our kids, and was on it whenever we needed more coffee, etc. He is very thorough and attentive - an asset to the resort! Yocelin babysat my 2 year old, and she was vey sweet with my daughter - she still talks about her! So beautiful and relaxing - it is far above most all-inclusives and has spoiled us for future vacations anywhere else!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cLUXURY AND PEACE\u201d", "Author": "gorgeousmomToronto", "ReviewID": "UR126622604", "Content": "I stayed at this glorious resort with my husband for 5 days and it was breathtaking!

My wife and 2 kids stayed here in Feb 2012 and our initial impressions were very positive. The rooms and grounds are beautiful. The service by most of the staff is exceptional. The pools are nice. The sand on the beach is really nice but the Caribbean water is unswimmable here due to an unfriendly sea bottom and the roughness of the water. The restaurants were fairly impressive - the food is gourmet and impressive. But these unfortunately are not the things that first come to mind when I look back or talk to others about my experience. My son is like Jerry Seinfeld - he never throws up. However, during the night after eating at the Asian restaurant, Sen Lin, he threw up several times. Call me ignorant but I'm skeptical about the quality of the medical assistance that might be available at a resort so we were hesitant to call for help. Besides, every time he threw up he would claim he felt better. Of course that went on repeatedly and ruined a night's sleep and half a day of recovery for him and my wife. I would never expect a hotel to confess to food poisoning but we know that's what he got. The other incident is even more scarier for us. My daughter is allergic to sesame seeds and tree nuts. Despite telling our waiter about this my daughter suffered from an attack during dinner at the Italian restaurant, Lucca, that was severe enough for her to throw up a few times immediately (which is actually good in this kind of situation). Between the barfing and the Benadryl she managed to avert a potentially very serious medical emergency. Yes, \"barfing\" was a central theme of our stay. So in total, we had 2 nights and half a day out of our 6 night stay that was ruined by 2 food related issues that were the fault of the hotel. This is not a cheap vacation. We splurged for what should have been an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Some friends of ours have been here before and that's pretty much what they got. We informed the concierge of both incidents but that resulted in a \"we'll look into it\" and nothing else. I asked to see the hotel manager who came to see us in our room. You would think that having the hotel manager of a \"premium\" hotel who claims service is of the utmost concern, blah, blah, blah, stand in front of my whole family listening to our unfortunate story would result in something. Anything! But no! He said he would take care of it which just like the concierge translated into nothing. I believed his sincerity and concern, so I was really shocked that he actually did nothing about it - no attempt to make up for it, no discount given at check out time, no gesture at all that says \"sorry we ruined your trip but here is how we are going to try to make up for it...\". From reading other reviews it seems their policy with complaints is to deny and deflect so I continue to expect nothing from them and perhaps even a response to this claiming that it's my fault somehow. The message to you is this: if nothing goes wrong you should have a pleasant stay. But if there is an issue, don't expect the hotel manager or concierge to do anything at all about it. I say you don\u2019t take that risk and go elsewhere. Oh one last thing - I don\u2019t understand the idea of having a heavy comforter on the bed. I don\u2019t even have something this warm in Toronto during the winter. Also all the pillows sink to virtually no thickness which I also don't understand.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cOne of the World's Best All Inclusive\u201d", "Author": "SpaPete", "ReviewID": "UR126304744", "Content": "There are so many superlatives regarding this resort, that it would almost be easier to start with perfection, and site some very few critical points. However, that may not be of much help to fellow travelers, so in the spirit of reviews, let me start with service. When you walk about, if you count the number of hotel employees, it has to number the same as the guests. Between the upkeep of the grounds, the room attendants, the transportation, the concierge staff, and endless waitstaff, and to mention the backhouse personnel, if one values immersion by attention, you will get it here. Equally importantly, is the generally cheery disposition of the staff. Not one person has an attitude, and not one person expects a tip beyond what they are being paid by the hotel. The food is remarkable. Naturally, there are critics of the food, because it might be compared to a person's favorite restaurant at home, but Grand Velas is attempting to present gastronomic experiences in Asian, Mexican, French, Continental, and Italian cuisines, all at one resort, and with a few exceptions, a person would be hard pressed to find better food unless they were to visit those countries and pay through the nose, or root out a few of the better places in Manhattan or San Francisco. In the spirit of overview and brevity, I would rank the resort in the following manner: Grounds - 9; Service - 9; Friendliness - 10; Food Quality - 9; Food Quantity - 10; Professionalism - 9; Drink Quality - 6; Food at Beach - 6; Beach itself - 9 (huge and well combed); Ocean area for swimming - 4 (very rocky - no one swims in the ocean there) - Pools - 8. (Nice pools, but no public hot tubs); Activities for kids - 8, organized activity for adults - 3 (who cares, right?), Rooms - 8.5 (large, tall ceilings, great bedding), Room Service - 9 (included and very good), Spa - 8 (Nicest spa I have been in, average massage, and fiendishly expensive). All-in-all, Grand Velas is an incredible place, and it is worth the slightly swollen price of entry. It is not perfect, but you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "westchester, ny", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "gooseontheroad", "ReviewID": "UR126132504", "Content": "Okay, let me begin my telling you how hesitant I was to do an all inclusive and then let me tell you just how wrong I was!!!! First of all the resort is beautiful - from the minute you arrive there is chic European sophistication to the design of the property and the minute you step foot on it, you already know you are going to enjoy it. The rooms are beautiful and spacious. We have a 13 year old and an eight year old and they were thrilled that they actually brought in roll away beds - they have had it with uncomfortable pull out sofas. This fact, along with the fact that even the mini bar was included, meant that they too knew that they would instantly enjoy it. The property itself is gorgeous, we all loved the pool and the beach. There was adequate seating, lots of attendants and my little one absolutely loved the swim up bar for her lunch with the floating menu! The food was excellent in all of the restaurants and we so enjoyed the different cuisine and ambience. I was skeptical too thinking we would not have good wine to enjoy with our dinner, but the wine too was excellent. I liked too that there was a dress code for dinner - not over the top, but enough that you spend time getting ready and in my opinion it adds to the experience. Another perk of the all inclusive was that we did not have to rush to breakfast, but could order room service and enjoy it out on our balcony - heaven!!!!! The weather was spectacular, with a beautiful breeze our entire stay. The sun is strong, but because of the breeze, you never felt hot. My little one, enjoyed the kids club, not for long periods but rather as a break from the sun and to relax after all the swimming. We did two excursions, one to the dolphin swim and the other sailing. Both were wonderful. My girls were hell bent on getting their hair braided and while there was nothing on the property but we walked down the beach for a bit and came across an area where they had little huts with different things, including hair braiding. While they did this, I had a wonderful ocean front massage! I heard rave reviews about the spa from every guest I spoke with - since we were having a family trip, I did not go but its sounded divine. All in all, it was my favorite vacation spot I have been in a very long time - I truly was able to rest and relax in this beautiful setting - it helped to know that we were not racking up huge bills on food and drinks too!! but most of all the effort and attention to detail in the food and service made for an exceptional trip!!! You will most certainly enjoy this spot!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island, new york", "Title": "\u201cLuxury,relaxation,class\u201d", "Author": "jsmd", "ReviewID": "UR126062612", "Content": "The rooms are spectacular with large walk in showers, Jacuzzi tub.

Ask the locals and they will tell you that this and Mayakoba are the two best resorts in Playa del Carmen, the only real difference is the all inclusive at Grand Velas. The food is worth every penny. Each meal tastes better than the last, all of the restaurants are delicious. We traveled with an 8 year old that learned to scuba in the pool thru the daily beach/pool activities and loved it. The guys in charge of the activites are great, especially Alfredo. Take the eco tour- it's about an hour and you will be able to see their gardens and taste the mint they grow as the garnish in their cocktails. The kids club at Zen is small and quiet- perfect for kids who like to play x-box,do crafts, lego's or watch a movie- Ambassador kids club is crazier with lots of kids. As for the rooms, we had the plunge pool which looks nice but is freezing and not worth the x-tra money because you cannot get in it. The \"jungle\" view is quite pretty, with lots of nice birds to view and very quiet. Mini bar is stocked daily with your favorites from beer to oreo's, just a nice touch. The Spa is one of the best in the world. The only draw back, there are not a ton of activities if the weather is not good for beach/pool- I would suggest and excersion for that day - downtown Playa del Carmen is very nice, totally safe- cute cafe's and kitchy shops.

The hotel has two blocks and in both you have swimming pools and restaurant(s). One at the beach and the other one in the middle of the forest (where is located the spa).

The hotel provide these vans in a way that there is always one waiting for you.The caracteristics of each block: - At the beach: - you have the beach close to you and the rooms have a view of the ocean; - there are more people lodged; if you want contact with other guests, thats the place; - there is the restaurant that is everyday working (Azul), specially for breakfast; - I don\u00b4t know if it is so quiet as the other one; - In the forest: - it\u00b4s a very calm place; - not everyday the restaurants are open to breakfast what means that you can be obligated to go to the other block (what is very easy) - if you stay in an apartment at the ground floor you have a small lake with fishes at the backyard of the apartment. My doughters had good moments feeding the fishes; What was not perfect: I was lodged in the ground floor and got some sounds from the apartment at the first floor over me. Also, the temperature of the shower ocilates. But the other things was so good that I didn\u00b4t complain about these two points to the staff.

We stayed at the Zen suites which have more of a rainforest, rustic theme than the hotel rooms closer to the beach.

Keeping that in mind, our reservations first: 1. they are VERY RIGID ABOUT RULES - dress code for one. When americans are on vacation in mexico (or wherever tropical), they are NOT interested in dressing up - putting on pants and collared long sleeve (yes, long sleeve) shirts at night! Everyone wants to wear shorts. It makes you feel like you are on vacation.They actually wouldn't seat us at night if my husband/son weren't dressed appropriately. It was easier for the women/girls. 2. CHECK OUT TIME WAS INFLEXIBLE and then they had the nerve to charge us for lunch! Lunch, apparently, on the day of checkout is not included. $48/person!! Crazy, but true. (I will note that they did give us a hospitality suite to change/shower in, but was surprised when no one helped us move our things. In fact, my butler concierge contact - 2 of them, actually watched my 8 yr old and I walking down the hall moving our things from one suite to another.) 3. WIFI IS NOT INCLUDED. Not only not included but they want $75 for the week per device - or so they say. We paid for 5 days ($64) and the wifi was AWFUL. Completely unreliable. Kept knocking us off and we couldn't get it in the room. NOTE you could actually use one username/pw for all your devices - they weren't advertising this or they were just clueless. Either way, not good. 4. Ocean was very rocky so you couldn't really go into the water without water shoes and being extremely not to step on a rock. BIG ROCKS, not just pebbles. That's why my location rating is low below. 5. TIPPING -- this is supposed to be an all inclusive hotel but for some weird reason they have you sign for every meal and there is a space for a tip. Just annoying to have to leave tips at every meal. Adds a few hundred dollars by the end to your stay. You shouldn't have to sign for anything at an all inclusive resort and you shouldn't have to tip except at the end to your concierge if you think they did a good job. The POSITIVES - kids activities were excellent. Beach newcombe/volleyball, beach soccer/football and water polo were offered daily and often depending on the needs of the kids there at the time. My kids loved this! Kids club was fantastic for my 6 and 8 year old. Tons of crafts and the counselors were really nice. Even my 11 year old enjoyed it when she finally went. Food and presentation was excellent. They had good kids menus at all the restaurants except sen lin (the asian place). Again, just the dress code at night was frustrating.

The sea is warm and had quite a lot of seaweed (not the slimy kind, though) and every morning a mini tractor would clear the beach so it remained pristine white. A taxi to/from the airport costs US$45 if needed, and a US$20 taxi will take you to Playa del Carmen, where you can wander down 5th Avenue and look at the endless shops (ranging from touristy to US chains!)We were only disturbed by two men with a tiger and lion cub (yes, real) with whom you could pose for photos in an alleyway. When we checked into into this, it is indeed illegal, besides being completely wrong in our books. We opted for a tour to the ruins at Coba from 9-3pm one day, which was fabulous, as it gave us a sense of the Maya culture. This can be booked directly with universmaya.com or through the hotel for an additional charge -- the lovely Helene took us around. Just be really careful if you choose to climb the temple: you need to be wearing shoes (not flip flops) and hold the rope -- it's much steeper at the top than you think. The final days saw the hotel jump to 80% capacity as the US Presidents Weekend came, and suddenly lounge chairs were being reserved from 7:30am by families on their way to breakfast. This wasn't a problem at the beach at all. All in all we loved this hotel and can't recommend it highly enough.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite hotel *anywhere*\u201d", "Author": "nyctraveljunkies", "ReviewID": "UR124546247", "Content": "This is our favorite resort. We have stayed here twice in two years and will be back again this year. The quality of the hotel and the service are impeccable; it is guaranteed to spoil you for nearly every other place you stay! The hotel is just a few years old and the rooms are incredibly spacious and comfortable. The pool and beach area are breathtaking and unmatched. If you tire of lounging by the pool or beach, then there are many excursions available, which the hotel can easily arrange. We have done swimming with dolphins (amazing!!!), snorkeling, touring Tulum, repelling, ziplining, and swimming in an underwater cave near Tulum. There are enough restaurants on-site (between the 3 hotels at the resort), so that you don't have to leave. We are NYC foodies and were very pleased with the quality and creativity of the food at all the restaurants. In fact, we got engaged during our trip--over a candlelight dinner at their French restaurant, Piaf. We have stayed in rooms in both the Zen class and the Ambassador class; both are excellent, although the Ambassador class offers views of the ocean. We were initially hesitant about the all-inclusive, but it is worth it at this resort since the food is excellent and the waiters will bring you food or drinks at any time while you lounge by the pool or beach. My only advice is to make sure you bring enough sunscreen to last your entire trip, since buying sunscreen at the resort gift shop will cost you over $20 a bottle. If you stay at the Grand Velas, you will leave feeling relaxed and pampered in luxury.

Apparently it was full when I left, but I never felt the sense of its being crowded whilst I was there. Despite a lengthy stay (1 week) I was still finding new pools and restaurants by the time I left. The two stand out features of the resort for me are the quality of the food (uniformly in all the restaurants I tried) plus the friendliness of the staff. I was part of a group using the conference facilities which were also well appointed and efficient. No real gripes. The rooms (I was in the Zen suites - jungle side) are huge, well appointed and tastefully decorated in a resort chic stylee (i.e. nothing to object to but also nothing to get wildly excited about). Suits me just fine. And the wifi worked perfectly through the resort which is more of a deal for me.

We have travelled to the Riviera Maya several times, but this was the first time we took our daughter (5 yoa) with us. In searching for a resort that could accommodate children but still live up to our expectations for a luxurious and relaxing vacation, I came across the Grand Velas. The pictures were gorgeous, the reviews were phenomomenal, but could it really live up to all of they hype? In a word --- YES! From the moment we arrived to the time we checked out, the hotel met and/or exceeded all of our expectations. At Grand Velas, you don't have to sacrifice luxury for family friendly. They have managed to seemlessly combine both. Staff -- The staff was friendly, but not intrusive. Each day, whatever pool attendant was assigned to our area came over to introduce himself and made sure that we were well taken care of the entire day. Housekeeping was timely and did an excellent job. Restaurant servers were knowledgeable about the menus and attentive. Every staff member we encountered was well trained in their area and hospitable. Food - The food was scrumptious. Many all inclusives focus on presentation and fall short in preparation. At Grand Velas, the food was as delicious as it was beautifully presented. Rooms -- You've seen the pictures. The rooms are spacious, luxurious and comfortable. Pool -- We were in the Ambassador section so most of our pool time was spent there. We never had trouble finding a pool lounger and there were pool attendants to help if you needed anything. The pools in the Ambassador section are huge. They do not provide floats by the pool for the guests. We brought a inflatable ring and an inflatable lounger from home which was a good idea. They also sold them in the gift shop at the hotel. Many families were using inflatable rings or floats in the pool, but it was never crowded. Also of note is that there is no jacuzzi/hot tub by the pools. Spa -- Amazing facility and service. I was concerned about having to take transportation to/from the spa, but we never waited more than a minute for a van to arrive. Most times that we headed to the Jungle side, a van was waiting at the lobby area. On site activities -- We took advantage of the professional photo shoot available on property. It was pricier than at other resorts, but we did get some nice shots. The photo company is not owned/managed by Grand Velas, but since it is on property, I thought I would include it.

To all your trip advsior members reading this post, I'd like to fill them in on all the reasons why they should visit your paradise in Riviera Maya. This was our fourth visit to Riviera Maya for vacation, second vist (although unexpected) to Grand Velas. My husband and I were invited to a destination wedding at a resort two miles south of Grand Velas. The resort and arrangements for the wedding were out of our control and booked by the bride and groom's agent, but we agreed to go and have a good time particularly because most of our experiences in Riviera Maya were very good to Excellent, excellent being our first visit to Grand Velas. When we got to the resort for the wedding, we knew immediately it was not at all what we expected. It did not reflect relaxation, comfort, or a vacation to us in any way. When we finally were taken to our room, I was so disappointed with the conditions of it, I exclaimed that I could not, would not stay there. I said I will sleep in the airport if I have to, but not there. If you want details on where it was you can email me, but all I want to do here is tell you how the Grand Velas staff saved us. THANK GOODNESS we had been there before, knew where it was, and how FANTASTIC it is. Immediately, we left the room and the rejected resort, ran to the lobby, caught a cab, and took it to Grand Velas--two miles north. All the time, we were praying they had rooms. We got to the gate and the smiling, friendly keeper listened to our dilemma, called the front desk, turned back to us and said, \"Welcome home Mr. ----------.\" The gate opened and I was so happy I began to cry because at that moment I knew our vacation was going to be perfect, and it was. Grand Velas is worth EVERY PENNY you spend there. I haven't seen or been anywhere to compare. I was so happy, I couldn't stop telling my husband how much I loved him. Everyone treated us like we came home. The pool is heated to perfection, the grounds are gorgeous and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN, the rooms and beds are Clean and COMFORTABLE. Every room in the ambassador section has an ocean view at the very least and you sleep to the sounds of the gentle waves. THE FOOD IS THE BEST OF ANY RESORT I HAVE EVER VISITED, bar NONE! Bear in mind you need to wear closed toe shoes and long pants to dinner, and you do get a receipt because restaurants can be utilized by patrons from other resorts, but IT IS WORTH IT, TRUST ME. The waiters are so,so kind and explain the entrees to you. They bend over backwards to please. I wish I could remember all their names because I want them to know how much we appreciate them. This resort is quiet, peaceful, not like a water park or amusement resort. The background music is classy, zen, spa-like, just perfect. The fragrances are like a spa all over the resort. The cleanliness throughout is just perfection. The food, the settings where you eat the food are the best in the world. I love this place, and I can't wait to get back there. We did get to the wedding, and had to pretend to be staying at the other resort every day because we didn't want to upset anyone. It ended up being funny to us that my husband had to take a cab to the other resort every morning to run into the other wedding guests so that the bride and groom wouldn't know we left. He actually walked there one day by way of the beach, but couldn't wait to get back to Grand Velas.

At check in, the RUDE woman supervisor at the front desk indicated that her manager was on lunch break but that \"everything would be worked out\". When NYE came along, however, we were surprised to learn that our concierge booked us in one of the casual restaurants rather than allowing us to attend the gala dinner without charging us an additional amount - again, this was the additional amount mentioned NOWHERE in the trip confirmation from the hotel. So, I spent close to an hour at the front desk (with my kids upstairs crying because they wanted to go to the \"special dinner\"), trying to find a solution with the concierge. In fairness, they did indicate they could get us into the gala dinner as a last minute addition. However, if we did want to attend we would have to pay the additional $100 per person. Moreover, even if we didn't attend, the hotel intended to charge us this amount simply because we were staying at the hotel over NYE! I am a frequent business traveller and have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world. To think that an (alleged) five star hotel would screw a guest over $200 is appalling - particularly when that guest is paying north of $1000/night for his room. What they did was no different than saying to us on New Years Day \"We have a nicer than usual brunch today so unfortunately before we can let you in you will need to pay us an additional $200\". After multiple requests to meet with the manager, all of which were denied (he always seemed to be in a meeting), the hotel finally caved and removed the $200 charge. However, the damage was done and a terrible taste was left in our mouths. Further, we were clearly \"persona non grata\" in the hotel. Upon check out, we weren't asked how our stay was or asked to please come back - both hallmarks of a fine hotel. To add insult to injury, after forgetting my child's car seat in the room as we were getting the airport van loaded up, not a single employee offered to go back and get it. I can assure you that this would not have happened at a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. Given our experience, I was not surprised to see that none of the poor reviews have been responded to with a simple \"I'm sorry\". There are excuses, the individual responding is often defensive and attempts are made to discredit the guest providing the review. GRAND VELAS - YOU ARE IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE BUSINESS WHERE RULE #1 IS THAT THE CUSTOMER (HERE, YOUR GUEST) IS ALWAYS RIGHT! It is a shame that such a beautiful resort, with so many hard working, kind people providing the day to day service, has been marred by the individuals running the hotel. All over $200 ... pathetic. AAA, Virtuoso and Leading Hotels of the World are going to be disappointed to hear about this guest's experience.

This resort was top notch. This is our first all-inclusive resort, and judging by the amenities, dining selection and service, this one will be hard to beat. Our family spent most days at the large pool by the beach. Our room was on the top floor with ocean views, which were amazing. The bathrooms were spectacular, and my boys looked forward to playing in the large tub each night. Upon arrival we had a mix up with rooms, we reserved two queens, but all they had was a king or two queens in the jungle section of the resort. While the jungle section is beautiful as well, we opted for the king room and they brought two full sized twin roll away beds for my boys. The service was excellent, the personal butler was great, and I would recommend using them to make dinner reservations as soon as you arrive. Piaf was our favorite, and we used the babysitting service which was great. We also loved Sen Lin, and should have dined at both twice. Breakfast buffet was good, and the breakfast next to the adults only pool was also excellent, but it's adults only. This resort had lots of space, we were part of a large corporate group of 300. It never felt crowded. My regret was not spending more time on the beach. Also, there is an on-site professional photographer that will take your photos. It is pricey, but if you use him for just 1-2 great photos, it is well worth it. I regret not using his services. There are some beautiful palm trees to take photos of if you walk down the beach about 10 mins (to the left of resort if you are facing the beach). The trunks of the palms are crooked and make for spectacular photos. Most hated feature if the resort- wearing dress pants and closed toed shoes for men and children in most restaurants. When it's 90 degrees the last thing you want is to put on long pants. I suggest linen shirts and khaki pants. We've traveled to other 4-5 star resorts in tropical areas and it is still possible to look nice at dinner in shorts. Excursion- we only left resort once, and we went to the Rio Secreto. It is newly discovered underwater freshwater cavern system with stalactites and stalagmites. You wear wetsuits and helmets with lights. Words can't describe how beautiful it was. Even our boys liked it, although we had to help our 6 yr old a few times. The guides were amazing. Overall we will visit this resort again and plan to visit the grand velas in puerto vallarto. Great all-inclusive if you are not the \"buffet style\" traveler and don't mind paying a little extra...well worth it.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sugar Land, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThird Time was a Charm, but so were the 1st and 2nd!\u201d", "Author": "Jericho50", "ReviewID": "UR122475321", "Content": "Gran Velas may just be my favorite place on earth.

It was our first all inclusive trip which included our two children (8 and 5). We stayed in the Ambassador (ocean front) area in a first floor room a bit off the pool area. It was quiet and convenient to be able to run from the pool to the room in seconds. Resort: This may be one of the most beautiful resorts we have ever been to. The grounds, hallways, lobby and rooms were meticulously kept. There were no trash cans available outside your room and every time you put down an empty water bottle or piece of trash, someone was there to pick it up off the table. Unlike most if not all other resorts in the Riviera Maya area, this ocean front resort is truly on the ocean. There is an area called Zen (Master) class which is in the jungle and requires a shuttle to the beach/pool of Ambassador. If you look at the Fairmount, Banyan Tree, etc. they have some beach front villas, but most of the resort in way inland and require boats or shuttles to the beach. Here you have an entire resort on the beach. Food: The food was all in all very good. We ordered poorly a few times but chanced our mind on second visits. Best of the kid friendly restaurants was Frieda (in Ambassador) which is upscale Mexican (no Taco Bell here). Had amazing sea bass, muscles, steak, etc. Next was Sen Lin which is Aisan and I recommend ordering many appetizers instead of an entree (appies were better). These are gorgeous restaurants you would see in NYC or Phila. You forget you are in Mexico. Lucca, the Italian restaurant, is a converted buffet (Chaka) in the Zen suites. The food was decent, but the service not nearly as good as Frieda and Sen Lin. Azul is the family buffet restaurant in the Ambassador. It was fab for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner. The breakfasts are amazing! I recommend ordering by the pool during the day - the pool food outweighed most other restaurants all together. Ceviche, deconstructed caesar, wraps, fancy tacos, etc. We only ate inside once for lunch at Azul. Our kids went to the kids club one night and we went to Cocina de Autur with was an experience and amazing. If you have an adventuresome pallet, you must try. If you are steak and potatoes then skip. Best restaurant we tried. We did not try Piaf which is equally beautiful and people said amazing, but kids ate with us most nights. Bistro in the adult section is supposed to be great for lunch (so said friends we made at the pool). We did room service once for breakfast but easier to go to Azul. It was just alright. IMPORTANT DIETARY ISSUE: WE HAVE A CHILD WHO IS GLUTEN FREE AND THE RESORT 100% MADE SURE SHE WAS ACCOMMODATED. SHE NEVER GOT SICK (WHICH HAPPENS ASAP IF INGESTING GLUTEN). THERE WAS RICE PASTA, FRESH MADE CORN CHIPS IN FRESH NON-CONTAMINATED OIL, ETC. THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO BRING AND THEY TOLD US THIS AHEAD OF TIME WAS BREAKFAST CEREAL. WE TOTED OUR CEREAL TO AZUL EACH MORNING AS THEY MADE US GLUTEN FREE PANCAKES AND WAFFLES. FOR THIS REASON ALONE (WITH TEARS OF JOY IN MY EYES) WE WILL RETURN NEXT YEAR. This all said, we do know of a family who ate at Piaf who had a 16 yo with a peanut allergy. The wait staff knew this and still served bread which had walnuts. The child immediately had a reaction, the doctor was called and he had an epi pen and Benedryl in his room. He turned out to be fine, but parents need to keep on top of everything, ask the chef to come out and speak with them, don't rely on the wait staff, etc. Basically everything you would do in the U.S. when eating out. If our we have any question something may contain gluten, we pass. We ask how things are prepared. Do they cook rice pasta in clean water or in water where wheat pasta has been cooked, etc. Gym: surprisingly, as I am an early riser, i actually worked out daily. The gym in Zen is much larger than that in Ambassador (does not make sense) so if you are not there at 6:30 or 7, you will wait for a machine. I ran on the beach when this happened. Everyone around you was fit and working out which was an inspiration to get my butt moving. It was necessary given the all inclusive nature of the resort - you certainly eat more than you would at home even if you are careful (i.e. I don't typically eat breakfast) Service: OMG what can I say. Our concierge was great - because we had restaurant res's coming into the trip, he was not as important as I thought, but made sure everything was taken care of asap. Now the pool staff - these guys are the most important and best on service. We sat in the same area each day and the same people took care of us. Honorable mention - RODRIGO and JOSE - they did everything and anything to make sure we were taken care of - from food, to towels, to lounge chairs and the kids were as important to them (if not more so) than we were. Kid: we were there the busiest week of the year and kids were abundant however we never felt the resort was too crowded (they clearly control the number of guests allowed) and the kids were all well behaved. No nuisances and this includes our two. The kids' club was a little skimpy to my eyes, but the kids loved it. My son spent a morning making Mexican dream catchers instead of hanging at the pool - go figure! We had planned to eat with the kids most nights but we should have fed them early at Azul and then dropped them at the kids club. It was never overcrowded. At night (need to be 5 and up to leave your child) they watched movies and played wii and Xbox games. There was a puppet show they loved and face painting. So I must say they are dying to go back to the kids club - nuff said! Golf: my husband played 2 days at Mayakoba El Camelon and went one morning to its driving range at 6:30 am. Its close and a $10 taxi or they have a shuttle to pick you up. Make these reservations before you go. I played one day and we got a babysitter. The sitter was great ($23/hr for 2 kids which is not out of the norm of large city rates) and the kids said she was wonderful. Husband said golf was great - I am not the golfer in the family. The course however is beautiful with 2 holes on the beach. Spa: OMG again. The massage I got was good, but the water treatment which comes with any 50 min+ spa treatment was the most incredible spa experience I have had. Don't want to ruin it for you! People were getting a pedicure where fish eat the dead skin off your feet (minnows not sharks) and loved it but I could not get over the visual! Tipping: yes, this is what I wanted to know about before coming into the trip. No advice from anyone who had previously visited so we were on our own. We tried two ways - big tip up front to get good service during the week and then moderate tips each day for steady service. I would say both worked. Tipping the pool peeps is by far the most important. And they deserve it - they work HARD! Tipping at meals was also an interesting experience. We added a tip to the \"check\" and at the end of the trip found out most people did not. However, we did get AMAZING service at restaurants we returned to during the week. I would say throw cash in if you want to tip. You don't have to. Also, at the spa they told me tip was included. Recommendations: There are 2 large infinity pools at Ambassador. The one farther from the ocean is heated (just enough you are not shocked by going in). The other pool closer to the beach with a swim up bar is not heated. It was rarely used by any guests. Heat BOTH pools and you will have happier and more spread out guests!!!! (Pools are 100% tiled and are spectacular). We did not use pools at Zen. Drinks were a weak which I did not understand - if you are going to serve up 2-3 drinks using the same amount of alcohol, I was just wasting calories you and the resort used the same amount of alcohol. Just suggesting. This strategy probably keeps everyone nice and sober or bloated and tipsy. Biggest safety recommendation - I sat at the end of the wooden bridge between the two pools and watched child and adult after child and adult slip and fall. Some cuts here and there that lifeguards took care of, but WHY not put some type of non-slip abrasive coating or make it a pebbled concrete to prevent these minor injuries which could easily result in broken limbs or brain injury! Its the shortest distance from the far side of the pool and the bathrooms, so its the most attractive nuisance on the property. Bottom line - we will go back and cannot wait. I give the resort 10 stars!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, California", "Title": "\u201cIf this place is good enough for the President of Mexico, it's good enough for us!\u201d", "Author": "Melinca99", "ReviewID": "UR122379284", "Content": "We went the first week of December 2010.

At one point in time, we were at the pool and left a book in our room. A staff member happened to over hear we were going to leave to get the book. He stopped us, called our private concierge, and he came back with the book. Now that's service!! This is just one example of how spoiled we were. Made it hard to go back home! We had a fun, unexpected treat while we were there. There happened to be a convention in Mexico and one evening a party was held at the resort on the beach for the President of Mexico and various Heads of States from around the world. It was quite fun identifying people from a distance. Well, I digress.... Anyway, we stayed on the jungle side and thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and sounds alike. It was lush and beautiful. The pool in the jungle area was a bit chilly so we headed over to the main pool located on the beach (a two minute drive by shuttle). We've been to the Grand Velas in Nuevo Vallarta and knew what to expect of the food at this resort. It was not a disappointment! Cocina de Autor is a must for gourmet food lovers! What an incredible treat! Piaf, Sen Lin, and Frida were fabulous as well. By the third day of our visit, we felt like we couldn't possibly eat anymore food. The five to seven course meals were too much for our little tummys! :-) We left the resort on a few day trips. One to Playa del Carmen (really enjoyed it), and another to Coba and Tulum (another must see).

I did A LOT of reserach online, so I was comfortable knowing this place would be fantastic. It definitely is! We have never stayed at an all inclusive before because we were nervous about the quality of food. There is NO worry about that here at Grand Velas. The food everywhere we ate was simply fantastic. The french restaurant has a filet I will forever dream about. Even the food by the pool is wonderful. We wouldn't have tried Azul (the buffet for breakfast or lunch) had the swiss couple next to us at the pool not insisted on it. Boy am I glad they did. The presentation and selections of food are unbelievable, and the food is all so fresh, so original. The service is still wonderful at the buffet, as they take your plate for you back to your seat. You can sit outside too right next to the ocean if it's not too windy. Our only disappointment with Grand Velas was that the occupancy was only 10% and it was like pulling teeth to get an updgrade to the Ambassador area from the Zen suites. This made no sense to us, as we were on our honeymoon, and asked politely for 3 days, until finally some awesome staff member must've felt sorry for us and made it happen. The rooms in the Ambassador section are equally as nice as the Zen suites in the jungle, BUT the view is worth the price upgrade in my opinion. Just to die for! The turndown service at night with chocolates and rose petals in our bath was so lovely, as well. We did try room service a few times and were not nearly as impressed as the other fresh restaurants, but that's pretty much to be expected anywhere. When we were at Zen, the shuttle was always there quickly to take us over to the main section, so that wasn't an issue at all. The workout facilities are clean and quite lovely as well, with water and towels all ready at each piece of equipment. They are even staffed at all times in case you need anything. If you are looking for a hopping place with loads of people, this is not the place. But, we were happy to give that up for the quality and service. At times the pool service was slow, but I think it's just because they are more laid back than us rude americans :) Sometimes it would take 20-25 min. to get a drink, which was odd given there were all of 10 other people at the pool. But, they just weren't in a hurry, and maybe this is a reminder that we should all operate more like this! My husband had a blast playing ping pong with the staff (they are GOOD)! We didn't partake in the spa, but those who did, raved about it. Sen Lin and the french restaurant are the two best in our opinions, but you honestly cannot go wrong anywhere. Even the wine selection for an all inclusive was extensive. We wanted to watch the University of North Carolina/Kentucky b-ball game one saturday afternoon and there was only one tv in the whole place which apparently had it on. They wouldn't let us watch it, because they were getting ready for a wedding (in 6 hours). I understand that, but we were looking everywhere to watch this game. Maybe have a sports bar for us americans open during the day this time of year for b-ball and football fanatics. They said the kareoke bar would have it on, but it didn't open until 6pm. We would go back here in a heartbeat, but would just make sure we were in the ambassador or grand class section to begin with. The zen suites in the jungle are very cool themselves and the environment is so unique, but it is a bit of a hassle to always be taking a shuttle everywhere. Oh, and they did call us for some presentation on the 2nd day we were there, but we declined. We said we would attend if we could get our room upgraded and they said they would \"call us back\" (like a few folks mentioned on here). Of all the times they said this, they never called back. I would've preferred they just say \"no\" upfront rather than have you think they will actually call you back. I don't know who the incredible employee is who finally got us upgraded when I said it was the last two days of our honeymoon, my husband had the flu for the first two days, etc., but we owe that man our sincere thanks!! :) We saw him and tried to give him a tip but he refused, until we absolutely insisted. Oh, and it is confusing about the tips. They do bring a \"bill\" at the end of each meal (but not at the pool we noticed), and you have to sign. It has a place for tip to be entered and so you really feel obligated to do that given they probably make a decent wage just on tips. But, I wish it was just more clear. We probably spent $300 in tips over our 5 day stay, which was fine, but we just wish we knew what was appropriate. Thankyou to the awesome employee again who took the time to care and upgrade us.

The food at the various restaurants were spectacular. World class meals. You want time to enjoy all their restaurants for dinner, and then return to your favorite one for the last night. And then there is the SPA. OMG...!!!We went twice on each trip. I found my favorite masseuses outside of Thailand. The entire atmosphere of the spa is something. I did the water journey every time, and after my massage returned to redo parts of the water journey. Spent decadent hours just relaxing in the spa and again, their staff was amazing. If I was a billionaire, I would recreate some of what they have, and have them train all my staff. This hotel is not cheap, but for what you get, its tremendous value and a travel experience you must encounter. Mexico is getting a bum rap with its drug violence problems. None of that is affected in this area.

I did the hydrotherapy at the spa- it was very relaxing. Some people have complained about having to sign a check. I did not think that was a big deal.

Our second time at Grand Velas Riviera Maya proved this resort to be very nice for any occasion. We were there July 4th week of 2010, and it turned out to be a slow week for GV. Apparently the local Mexican vacationers do not start their travels until later in July. The down side of a slow week is that the Buffet restaurant does not serve dinner buffet. Everything has to be ordered a la carte. This takes away from our enjoyment as a family, since most of the specialty restaurants do not allow kids under 16. Our children of 6 and 11 enjoy the convenience of nice buffet setups where they can choose what they want to eat easily. Paying a premium for such a nice resort in Cancun, and be limited to the choice of restaurants at night is not a good thing if you have children under 16. The weather is humid and rain is unpredictable in July, but the heat makes the ocean water luke warm and spending time in the pool is a lot of fun. There was a previous post about the staff being spoiled with only wanting to serve people who tip well. We concur with this impression, because some staff members were unfriendly for one reason or another. Some pool attendants also seemed less attentive to our needs. Finally... When we arrived the rooms seemed unoccupied in a lot of good sections of the ocean view area. However, when we asked to change room when we were shown a room that was not great, we had to wait until the next day to convince the day time Suite Concierge manager to help us. We even told them that we have been to GV Puerto Vallarta 4 times, and this is was our second time to GV Riviera Maya...but they didn't care. This review points out some negative aspects of service which need attention from the managements. These little issues really make a difference in creating a completely hassle free vacation for families with young children like ours.

I have been twice in 2 year and will come back for sure. This is a brand new hotel (2-3 years old) so it's decorated with modernity and taste and luxury. They have put all the package building this gorgeous hotel. You will feel like a star and they treat you like one. Accommodation: They only have suites, so the rooms are REALLY big, with king size bed (very comfortable). The bathroom are very luxurious and spacious with a big jacuzzi and separate raining shower. Big flat screen, mini-bar, room service 24h. You have the choice to stay in the jungle or near the ocean. I always stayed in the jungle (cheaper) but it's just amazing too. You have a nice terrace giving on a little river... It's very cute and you don't see or heard the neighbor, it is very private. Anyways the beach is like 3 minutes from the rooms, and there is always a mini-van to bring you to the restaurant/beach/other part of hotel and you NEVER wait. There is alway a car waiting for you:) Beach/pools: You have 3 beautiful pools in the complex. 1 private for the hotel part only adults, one in the jungle part, and (the best) main pool near the beach. The main one is enormous, infiniti pool, you have a lot of long chairs and gazebo and parasol. The jungle one is pretty spectacular too. You need to see to understand. The beach is the best beach in Riviera Maya. They are the only hotel who, each morning, come clean and flatten the sand. White pure sand and turquoise sea. They have put a little sea wall in the ocean so the water is calm like a pool. You can actually sit in the water without waves coming after you. They have waiters that come take your order very often. You can also order food at the beach or the pool outside (very good food like angus hamburger, excellent fresh sushi, etc... and everything is included!) It is quite rare they have that service in all inclusive hotels... Restaurant: For me eat well in vacation is a must, and sometimes in the Caribbean you can be disappointed... but not in Grand Velas! They have 8 restaurants \u00e0 la carte. (2 buffets, 1 italian, 1 french, 1 spanish, asian, mexican, international) They are all excellent. Where else in an all inclusive hotel can you have a filet mignon angus for dinner? Nowhere... The buffet are spectacular and the service is the best. Good selection of wines... We were amazed all the time by the delicious food. I could speak about it for hours but I think you understood my point... That this is an more than excellent hotel and you won't be disappointed at all. Usually I go in the Spring or low season, because in the winter is so expensive. Last May I paid 1900$, and that's very cheap for this 5 stars hotel. But the winter I know the price can go up more than 5000$. It's still worth it I think.

Restaurants are great for dinner particualary Cocina de Autor For Bad: service is good compared to other Hotels but.... Grand Velas is not average so... service for a Grand Velas Hotel is poor, compared to my last visit to the other resort this one made me felt dissapointed. By the pool it took some time to find someone between drink and drink. The best service I got was from a Trainee. Karaoke bar is ok, but again I had a bad expierence with the service when I say that one song requested was not played corectly (because of the computer file was damaged) and the waiter told me that's not his problem :0 One last thing. Giving you the bill each time you finish in every restaurant is clearly a strategy for supporting the waiters to look for tips. So I would recommend the Hotel 2 options: One) stop saying tips are included or Two) Make an effort with exit polls and training for your staff for not relay on tips for offer a great service (Riviera Nayarit does it very good) I think I will go back just because I believe in Grand Velas and I am sure they will fix this service issues over time.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful stay\u201d", "Author": "oxana_jes", "ReviewID": "UR118316797", "Content": "Grand Velas is a great hotel with an exceptional service.

It was one of 3 hotels we stayed in (the others were La Amada and Rosewood Mayacoba - see separate reviews) and was all inclusive. the hotel itself is absolutely huge, with about 1500 suites but when we stayed most of the hotel was closed as there were only about 10% occupancy. We were supposed to stay in a spa villa but because that area of the hotel was closed, we were put into an Ambassador suite instead, which according to the website is slightly larger. This room also had a sea view which was lovely so we were probably better off where we were. The hotel was very attractive with long corridors decked out with natural thatched roofing and beautiful flowers everywhere. Our suite was very spacious, with a balcony and the beds were very comfortable. However, compared to the other hotels we stayed in, the Grand Velas was lacking some charm and didn't wow us. The restaurants were open on a rotation system as the occupancy was so low and usually when we dined we were the only people there which meant the atmosphere was a little sterile. Because we were travelling with our children, (aged 3 and 5) we did not dine at the adult only restaurants. Of those we tried, Sin Lin, the Asian restaurant located near the spa, was our favourite. The food here was the best, the decor was lovely, the service excellent and the cocktails delicious. The staff here were very attentive to our kids too and that goes a long way to making a family meal a success. We also tried Frida, the Mexican restaurant twice. on our first visit we loved it, perhaps because it was full so the atmosphere was good, and our food was lovely. The second time the food was not good (my duck was almost inedible) and again we were the only people there. We also ate at the Italian Lucca, because we didn't have any other choice on that particular evening, but it we were not impressed by either the food or the service. It was very empty and the staff stood next to our table the entire time which was very unnerving. The breakfast in the beach restaurant was great, with a huge buffet of hot and cold dishes and a vast choice of fruit and juices. Again, we found the service a little intrusive. Every time we collected something from the buffet, a waiter took the plate to your table, even if it was only 2 steps away. The best thing we like about the hotel was the main swimming pool (which was the only one open at the time we stayed) which was absolutely huge and very beautiful. Probably the most beautiful pool of the 3 hotels we stayed in. It also had a very big kids pool next to the main pool and a swim up bar near the beach end. The only negative was that the drinks served at this bar were all neon in colour and full of artificial syrop and virtually undrinkable. The cocktails in La Amada and Rosewood were all made with fresh ingredients and were vastly superior in quality, so after a few mistakes, we stuck to beer and water. The beach itself is lovely with white sand and crystal clear water - in fact if you walk along the beach from the Grand Velas, you can easily walk within 15 minutes to several other hotels including the Rosewood. So all the beaches along this stretch are beautiful. There was also beach football and volley ball which the kids and my husband enjoyed. We used the kids club which was nice and the ladies working there were lovely. The only problem was that it was indoor only with no outdoor activities. This may have been due to low season, although there were usually a few kids there apart from ours. Overall, we thought the property was very beautiful but lacked charm, the service was hit and miss and a little invasive and the food was erratic.

We traveled at the GV for 10 days in early August. The rooms were roomy and clean with a nice view of the Ocean and pool at room 4041. The beach was very nice. It is true that there are ** some rocky areas** but 80% of the beach was pure white sand in and out of the water. The beach itself is cleaned by the maintenance crew each morning so kelp is collected and disposed of each morning. Note: The beach service does not provide snorkle gear. They do offer a daily *free* snorkle tour via the hotel\u2019s lifeguard where you kayak to a snorkle spot roughly 15 minutes away and snorkel gear is then provided. Outside of this tour, you are on your own finding gear. I would recommend bringing your own as Playa Del Carmen sells them for about $30US. My recommendation to the hotel, go all out and provide the snorkel gear. Beach service also only provides kayaks at no fee. The hotel website stated no-fee for non-motorized equipment but was quickly told by the vendors that this is old news. No boogie boards, sailboats or paddleboards for free. Hotel Restaurants were very good. We dined at all of the restaurants and some of the hits were Frieda and Lucca for the family. For couples night, we dined at Piaf which stood out as far as food and service. The fine dining restaurants were very accommodating in terms of kid food. You can pretty much request items not listed on the kid menu. For example,at Sen Lin, the kid menu is limited. We requsted grilled shrimp for my son who is hooked on shrimp at the moment. The signing of checks at the restaurant is no big deal. I do not know what the issue is. Sign the check, leave a tip (if you wish) and then thats that. One advice on tipping though. If your waiter was outstanding and most of them were, leave a $2 US tip. I would note on the check 25 mp (Mexican Pesos). It helps the Front of the house staff on calculating your tab - if any. Other notables were the \u201cButler Service\u201d. It was good but we did not experience the \u201canticipating-ones-needs\u201d as being reported on tripadvisor when we were there although service was good nontheless. I would recommend to the hotel to ensure that communication is tight or crisp between the service teams. The Concierge informed us that our shuttle to Playa Del Carmen has been arranged and to drop us off at a certain spot. The lobby service seemed confused and unaware of the arrangement. Again, overall good service but need to be more seamless. On our last day, we arranged for a shuttle to the airport and almost missed our flight as the same experience happened where our Concierge arranged for pickup at 6AM. At 630, we were waiting for the shuttle and had to opt for a taxi to ensure we do not miss our flight. Again, service need to be seamless and tightened up between teams. Our kids space experience also was good. I was expecting a scheduled set of activities for the kids when at the kidspace- Nature walks, water and outdoor activities with a set of kids from the hotel. The space was more come as you please and do what you want at the space. They do offer scheduled activities that one can take advantage of such as puppet shows, magic tricks,etc... For the most part, kids come to kidspace to play video games, do crafts, watch movies and hang out. Regardless of the miss on our expectation, things worked out and our kids visited every night. A special recognition to Emma who made our kids experience outstanding. She was accommodating, hospitable and made everyone feel welcome. Our twins celebrated their Birthday at the resort and they were treated to a pinata party, balloons and cake. I rate this crew a five star in service for their effort. Pool Service was good as well and especially at the Master Pool section. The crew there was outstanding. I hope that they take the advice above and will sure to give this property a 5 star once we see the improvements.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cIF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE YOU HAVE NOT SEEN AMAZING!\u201d", "Author": "TravelForlife087", "ReviewID": "UR116952268", "Content": "This is the type of Property that attracts travelers of all ages and walks of life.

Just for reference, I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, i.e. The Danieli in Venice, the Dorchester in London, the Plaza in NYC, and this hotel has them all TRUMPED! The rooms are fantastic. We stayed in the Ambassador section and I requested a room with a great view (upper floor). We could not have received a more beautiful spot, suite #4051. We were at the very end of the Ambassador's section- ocean front. On the fourth floor, not only do you have a spectacular view, but GORGEOUS cathedral ceilings in the room! We were celebrating our anniversary, and the hotel surprised us with a jacuzzi filled with rose petals, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries after dinner one night. I thought the beach was fantastic. Yes, there are some rocks, but there are plenty of intermittent places with perfect, smooth, white sand. For my family, the rocks provided places for some ocean life to congregate. My husband and daughter snorkelled right off the beach every day. I won't go on and on about the spectacular food. We loved everything. Sen Lin and Frida were our favorites. We did not try Lucca's. Each and every staff member is at the top of the game. Our server at Frida, ugh, I waited too long to write this and I'm afraid I will get his name wrong! I think it was Barcielo.... He was just starting at GVRM and he told us that, while he has worked at several other places around Playa (he named several) GV is his favorite. I think everyone must feel that way, and it SHOWS.

We left all of our stuff (ebooks, iphones, a camera) because we did not want to have to take it back to the room and then go back and get it. NO PROBLEM!

We spent a lot of time reading reviews and searching for a new resort in Mexico/Carribean - but could not seem to find a resort that we thought would be equally perfect for us... I am sure they are out there, but when you travel all the way from Stockholm, Sweden in Northern Europe, and spend quite a lot of money on an 11 night stay, you want to be sure that everything will be just perfect. So we ended up going back to Grand Velas in late February 2011 (combined with DisneyWorld this time). We still were a bit nervous that we would be disappointed, that the amazing quality of food and service would have gone down, that the very new resort would start to show signs of \"wear and tear\" - but no. Everything was just as excellent as we remembered - and the feeling of coming back to Grand Velas was fantastic! Quite a few of the staff from last time were still there, which I think is a sign of quality too. Service is really amazing in this place, and staff very friendly and attentive. We stayed at Ambassadeur again (with children aged 4 and 8). Last time we had a 4th floor suite ocean front with an extra large shower, this time a 3rd floor one with main view of the pool but also sea view and slightly different floorplan - equally lovely! In this resort, I think all suites (at least in Ambassadeur) are great - no suites have a bad view, are much smaller or have older furniture. It is just a question of preferences - and they really do try to accomodate your preferences if you communicate them in advance. Even if our children of 4 and 8 do not speak English, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kids Club, since the staff took very good care of them. They did not go there very much, but it was great to be able to go for an hour or two now and then, when they wanted to get away from the sun and do something else. And a couple of nights, we ordered dinner for them from room service, and they then went to Kids Club for a few hours while we went to have dinner at the adults only restaurants. They much preferred this to having a babysitter in the room, and the youngest one actually looked forward to falling asleep on the pillows/matresses in Kids Club in front of a movie! They do get tired of sitting through restaurant dinners after a while, and it was great for us to be able for a few nights to really take advantage of the fantastic restaurants in GV. Food there is really amazing - but other people have described this in very much detail, so I will not... Some more PROS: - Suites are very large and beautiful! We were initially looking for a 2-room suite, but you can comfortably fit in 2 rollaways/extrabeds for children, and still have a lot of space. - Balconies are huge, and have a large \"bed\" with matress and cushions, plus table/chairs. Perfect for hanging out in the afternoon, or having room service breakfasts at. - Beds - very comfortable, with down filled duvets (like we have at home in Sweden...) - iPod docking station, DVD-player, Nespresso machine, really nice selection of drinks and snacks in the minibar (included, of course) - small details, but really nice when travelling with children - Laundry service is extra cost but the cost is very reasonable, we find, so we used it a lot - The Concierge Service, works perfectly. Our concierges have been very good both visits, they will seek you up regularly to see if you have anything at all they can help you with - extra hangers, more chairs for the balcony, particular requests for timing of housekeeping/turn-down service (handy, since we are always jet-lagged and go to dinner and to bed early). - The grounds are LOVELY - it is just a delight to be there. So airy, so lush, so well kept and clean*, such beautiful flowers everywhere... The design of the whole resort, including restaurants, are just to our taste. *) Apart from the little ponds with goldfish outside the piano- and karaoke bars. This second time they were really dirty and the fish did not seem very happy - which was a bit sad... Everything else was so nice - but I am sure these ponds have now been taken care of. The only thing making our stay this time less than 100 % perfect, was something that we cannot really blame Grand Velas for: Being Europeans, we did not know what \"President's Week\" was about, and were unlucky enough to book our 11 night stay so that it partly coincided with this US holiday. Meaning that after a few days of the peaceful bliss that GV usually offers and we love, followed a week where the resort was completely full, and felt a little too crowded and noisy for us. But it must be said that the staff did all they possibly could to accomodate everyone, moving sunbeds from the beach to the pool so everyone could have one, running around to serve snacks by the pool for all of those who seemed to want this (we much prefer moving to the little snack/pool bar with lovely view of the ocean and a nice breeze and shadow for lunch...), cleaning up, getting extra towels, etc. We had no issues getting tables in the restaurants, even if service might have been slightly slower for a few days - and housekeeping was late a few times. But they seemed to have called in quite a lot of extra staff, and really managed this full occupancy week very well. Luckily, we had a few days of peaceful bliss again after President's Week was over. Now we have started planning our next holiday - late Feb to early March 2012, and even though we will for sure be going back to GV again, we have decided to find somewhere else this time (in the Carribean probably) - to experience something new. But we are having a hard time finding our next resort - so any tips that anyone might have, are greatly appreciated!

We truly appreciated the service everywhere, but I'm sure we looked like jerks our first day there when we realized there were people tipping at the pool. Who brings cash to the pool at an all inclusive??? \u00a0 \u00a0But apparently people do. Our waiter at the ambassador pool picked up our empty drink cups and we noticed he had cash in his hand. My husband remarked that he thought other people were tipping at the pool, and we felt awful because our cash was in the safe at the other resort. So as not to seem unappreciative, I left, took the shuttle back to our room in the jungle area and grabbed some cash from our safe. \u00a0 Another thing I want to note. I read almost every review here and every response by management, and clearly they are not aware of what goes on at the restaurants. You get your bill, you sign it, and before you get up, the waiter opens the bill AND LOOKS TO SEE IF YOU TIPPED. WHILE YOU ARE STILL SITTING THERE. And it happened at every restaurant, even the breakfast buffet at Azul. \u00a0 \u00a0At Sen Lin, our waiter told us \"this is the line to sign your name, this is the line to tip\".\u00a0 I never ever mind tipping but I do mind an all inclusive not being a 'true' all inclusive. An all-inclusive usually means food, drinks and tips are included. \u00a0 And believe me, \u00a0those who choose an all inclusive because they have a budget they would like to stay on, \u00a0will be in for a surprise when they see how much even a 10% tip at every meal can add up. We treated our parents, and had our kids with us, so it really added alot to our final trip cost. Also, if the reason a bill is presented is because of the diners who choose to come from other resorts, why do we have to sign a bill for room service? Why is there a bill at all?\u00a0 Eliminating the tipping in general \u00a0would make this place just about perfect. I'm sorry to highlight that as a negative aspect of this beautiful place, but I'm hoping that the management reads this and makes a few changes so the people with upcoming trips here don't have to feel the way we did.\u00a0 Now onto the good stuff! \u00a0We stayed in the Master 'Jungle' section. It was lush, amazing and reminded me very much of Costa Rica. The shuttles were a non-issue. They were instant. I \u00a0never felt that we weren't a part of things because we weren't staying in the Ambassador section. \u00a0I actually preferred the jungle section over the Ambassador section because of the seclusion and the ambience. It is truly beautiful there. I will agree that the jungle section is not very well lit at night and I agree with the reviewer who said it could be jazzed up a bit with some more tasteful lighting. \u00a0But it was still beautiful!!! The Ambassador section was nice and the pool area had a nicer breeze because of the beach, but I much preferred the Master pool. The food was delicious at both but I feel the drinks at the Master pool bar were just a bit better. We traveled with our three children. They loved the kids club. A suggestion might be to train the staff to accommodate babies because if your child is under 5, they cannot be left alone there. Most resorts are like that though so I am not complaining. The food quality exceeded every expectation. Even room service food!!!! I am a huge foodie and was still blown away by the food here. The restaurant decor, selection and quality of food was amazing. Azul was my least favorite, both for breakfast and dinner. Actually, the only real problem I had with food was the breakfast buffet. In order to eat buffet style for breakfast you must travel to the other resort, to Azul. (Bistro was closed for our stay). Chaka, in the jungle section, was set up for a buffet but they did not have it. The staff told me there is only a buffet at Chaka if there is a convention. We love a good breakfast buffet but didn't care for taking the shuttle to Ambassador for their breakfast.\u00a0 We did it once and it was just OK. The rest of the mornings were spent eating breakfast in the master section restaurant (Chaka) and ordering from the menu. It was very nice, but it took much longer to finish breakfast than if we were able to grab food from the buffet. Also, this may have been my oversight, but I was under the impression that only the two 'adults only' restaurants had a strict dress code. Apparently all of the restaurants have a strict dress code. No shorts allowed! (except at Azul). So my husband and father wore the same pants/shoes to dinner every night. It was no bother, but I don't remember any reviews specifying that. We just returned from a similar all -inclusive at the Beaches Resort in Turks and Caicos. \u00a0Including Airfare, we paid $4000 more for our butler suite there. \u00a0One of the areas where Beaches excelled over GV was the Butler service. The butlers here are very very nice! But the Butlers there are over-the-top. They escort you to dinner everynight, they are available via cell phone for anything you desire. For example, my husband enjoyed the Sangria at one of the restaurants, and the waiter apparently told our butler who, the very next day, \u00a0had our cabana cooler stocked with a pitcher of Sangria daily. The butlers at GV are very very nice, and would probably do anything you would want, but you don't see them as much. \u00a0We are pretty low maintenance vacationers, and do not usually require butler service. Even at Beaches we wouldn't specifically ask them for anything, they just seemed to anticipate your desires. I am not complaining, just noting. Also, while the beach at GV is very beautiful, (powder soft white sand, clean beautiful water) the beach at Beaches is much better. Beaches kids club was far superior to GV, and they accommodated babies as well. This is because Beaches is an all- family resort but GV is more of an adult resort which caters to children very well. Beaches has a waterpark, a nightclub, and overall, more to do. That being said, I'd STILL bring my children back to GV over Beaches because it is just that wonderful. The cost saving \u00a0is huge compared to Beaches, and the food quality at GV is absolutely without a doubt, the very best food you will ever have on a vacation in this part of the world. Most of our vacations consist of mediocre meals with maybe one or two good/great meals scattered within, At GV, every dinner is a great experience (and you don't have to leave the kids to enjoy it either!) I completely understand why people from other resorts would come to eat at GV. Another point well worth mentioning, is there are no bugs. I was flabbergasted. In the states, any light fixture on a hot summer night would be covered with swarms of bugs. I am not exaggerating when I say this, but I don't think I saw a single bug at this resort. We did get a few mosquito bites but where they were hiding is anybody's guess. \u00a0They do have those \u00a0little salamanders that run across the walls up high in the outside areas. \u00a0 What else can I say? There is just 'something' about this resort. Did I mention the spa? Wowwwwwwww!\u00a0 We stayed for a week and I truly truly did not want to leave.\u00a0 My recommendations?\u00a0 1) Piaf!!! (adults only) the very best restaurant here. Order the filet.\u00a0 2) Lucca - the lobster risotto was delicious. As were the cannolis! And the bread! Yum. And the dipping oils were so good!\u00a0 3) Frida- delicious!!! Everything was very good here! 4) Sen Lin- had the best 'kids menu' food- my kids devoured the teriyaki chicken. \u00a0Try the 'Spring' dessert. And bring a camera to take a picture of it!\u00a0 5) wifi access was non-existent in our room the first few days, and the last two days we were able to access wifi. There is a very nice business center in the lobby for guest use. 6) if you have a baby, bring an easily collapsible stroller. Some people brought Bugaboos, which were a royal PIA to fold everytime they needed the shuttle service. JMO 7) bring one outfit to wear between pool/beach time and dinner, and save the rest of the room in your suitcase for your dinner clothes. They were strict with the dress code. I brought 2 dresses that I thought were only for the two adult restaurants, but ended up wearing each every other night. Had I known shorts were not allowed in the restaurants I would have packed less casual clothes. 8) apply \u00a0and reapply block. My kids wore 50 SPF and burned the first day. After that I was sure to reapply the block every few hours. 9) bring waterproof bags to the pool. The rain showers can be heavy at times and we were glad our items (books, iPhones) stayed dry. 10) Master pool has no wifi access. Ambassador pool does.\u00a0 11) if you have a baby or toddler, and are staying in the master area, be sure to request a second floor balcony. The first floor balconies have no barrier and the children could easily fall into the water.\u00a0 The second floor balconies don't offer much of a view, but for the safety of small children, it's much better. 12) the water journey at the spa is included if you pay for a treatment that is 50 minutes or longer. Otherwise, to just try the water journey alone, the cost is $60. It is well worth it to just try that and spend a few hours lounging on the chairs. 13) \u00a0the spa has one of those services where you soak your feet in a water tank and little fish eat the dead skin off your feet. The spa employee said it 'tickles'. 14) I have the most sensitive stomach ever. Every vacation, I spend at least one night with stomach pains and or diarrhea, or nausea from something I ate. This happens at home too. I can honestly say I didn't have one single GI issue at this resort. \u00a0My son told me he was thirsty at the kids club and drank from the bathroom faucet one day. He was fine. So definitely no worries about food/water...\u00a0 You will not regret your decision if you stay here.

We went to Grand Velas in Puerto Vallarta for our Honeymoon, which was wonderful. For our second anniversary, we went to Royal Hideaway in Playa Del Carmen to see blue waters, but we missed Grand Velas. For our fifth anniversary, Grand Velas has opened this resort in Playa Del Carmen so we decided to treat ourselves. We stayed in the Grand Class rooms (adults only, on the Ocean). Food: The food was delicious, and the restaurants were beautiful. We aren't the type to make a fuss over meal ingredients; however, when I asked if an entree was spicy, they offered to make it any way I liked and kept track of my preferences for the other courses- including a custom amuse bouche. Also, room service was generous and superb. Service: The best way to describe the service is that it felt like the hotel staff genuinely cared about our vacation instead of just looking for tips. We received everything we asked for, and then some. Room: The Grand Class room was large and open, with a wall of sliding windows overlooking the ocean. We spent a great deal of time relaxing on the balcony listening to the waves. The motorized blackout curtains were a nice attempt to block out the morning sun, but bring eye-shades if you are a light sleeper as there are gaps between the shades and the walls. As other reviewers have mentioned there are two other sections of the hotel: The Ambassador Class area (Family friendly, on the ocean) is essentially a duplicate of the Puerto Vallarta resort, while the Master area (Family friendly, in the jungle) felt like a completely different resort for Spa guests. Spa: The water journey was a wonderful experience, and makes up for the high prices of services. I typically pay $60 for occasional massages at home, so I was unsure of the $350 price tag for a couple's massage at the spa. However, the massage included an hour and a half of relaxation activities before hand- including sauna, clay room, pools, etc. We highly recommend it. Other: On several of the nights, there were events with music on the beach between the Grand Class pool and the Ambassador pool. It was tasteful and not too loud at the Grand Class rooms, but I would have been upset if I was in one of the Ambassador rooms right next to the stages. In Grand Velas's defense, the events were over by 11:00. Recommendations: - If money is tight, stay in the Jungle suites and enjoy the spa or take the shuttle to the beach during the day. If you can afford it, the Grand Class rooms are worth every penny. - Have the hotel schedule your airport transportation. It's a competitive rate and much safer. - Bring eye-shades/ear-plugs if you are a light, early or later sleeper. - Mention any issues to the staff. They are eager to please and very capable.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWanted to love it , but the experience fell short for me.\u201d", "Author": "seasandlvrs", "ReviewID": "UR110582642", "Content": "This is a beautiful property as are many upscale resorts in this area. The room, food and level of service were similar to those other resorts as well. We are beach people and planned to spend most of our days at the adult beach. Unfortunately for us, this was a peaceful and relaxing experience for only one day of our trip. Large groups of people (twelve to twenty people per group) arrived day two and surrounded us (no matter where we moved on the beach). They were loud, drank heavily, tossed footballs, frizbees, baseballs and played paddle tennis all day. I felt like I was kid at the jersey shore, which I loved when I was kid. A lot of these folks were very vocal that unless the company had paid for their trip, they could have never afforded it . We moved to the pool and found a quiet spot. Guess who found our new haven the next day. This was the first beach vacation where neither us us truly relaxed and rested. We felt frustrated. Not what I expected. The dining experience was good for us. Really enjoyed my lunches at Bistro. I would have loved to try dinner there, but it was open only to corporate groups four of our five nights. Dinner at the signature restaurant was exceptional. Two of our other fine dining experiences were drowned out by the large groups. I couldn't hear the servers or my husband during the entire dinner. Not enjoyable. The third fine dining experience was just O.K. The spa was lovely and the services very good. The day we left we encountered 150 people in the lobby registering for a conference. Our luggage got lost from the room to the lobby that morning and I was told (politely) I would need to wait for checkout service because they were so busy and the group needed all their attention.

I stayed at the Ambassador section that overlooks the pool area and has that amazing ocean view that cannot be beat. We were located on the 3rd floor, which I recommend. When we arrived I was surprised to see that the main entrance was located on a very busy highway and my first thought was that the pictures had not been accurate and then once you pass through the main secured gates and drive the 7-8 minute drive it is as if the place literally unfolds in a green lush jungle and you are transported to another world. When you arrive at the main lobby for your section they open the vehichle door and place stairs for you to exit the van and they escort you to the main heck in area and I was offered a kiwi/strawberry drink that had a floating Jasmine flower. You are then escorted to your room and the concierge that is assigned to your floor gives you a tour of your suite and walks you through all of the switches for the lighting, etc. Within minutes your luggage will arrive. In previous reviews I always wondered what amenities were in the room. In the mini bar section we had an expresso machine that made individual cups, think Keurig. We also had a supply of many flavors of expresso. There was a 0.5 liter bottle of Milagro tequila accompanied with a little jar of salt, a jar with fresh lime and 2 shot glasses. I put the tequila in myh luggage to bring home to my son and it was not replaced so I believe you get one bottle per booking. The mini frige also had a small bottle of both red and white wine. There were 8 cans of beer with names such as Corona, Modello, etc. There was some candy bars and snack size bags of chips, canned nuts and pretzels that were all replaced daily. The room listed as a suite is really a very large hotel room with a very large balcony that has a bed/chaise lounge for 2 in the shade and a small table and 2 chairs. I really enjoyed not being on the ground floor as the balcony provides a lot of privacy. The jacuzzi tub is a very large 2 person tub and the walk in shower with the rain water head is very large with a shelf to sit on. The only thing lacking in the room was a full lengh mirror so that you could get ready while someone was in the bathroom. Some of the room amenities included 2 umbrellas, a roomy wicker beach basket, a can of Raid for bugs which we never needed and a small spray bottle of mosquito which I wished I had used before I fell asleep on the balcony while reading at night. Shoeshine service is provided free of charge. The is a very small compact blow dryer that is more powerful than the full size unit I brought with me, so leave yours at home. Internet service is fast, wireless and free especially while poolside. There was never a lack of waiters ready to bring you a drink or the poolside food menu. Try the quesadias (sP?), they are very good. Room service never took more than 30 minutes and the food is very good and the menu is extensive and includes items such as rib eye steaks. The restaurant Chaka was a very lovely place but the menu was a little different than most upper end restaurants as you only order your main course and they choose the salad, appetizer and the dessert which are all chef's choice. I am a very fussy eater and this did not work out well for me. My favorite place to eat was the Bistro as it opens up to the beach and remains open until midnight. The atmosphere there was true ambiance!!! I hope that these details help to wet your appetite because you will have the most relaxing trip with some of the best and most attentive staff I have ever had the pleasure to interact with.

All of us from ages 72 to 4 1/2! First things first, we stayed in the Ambassador section of the resort which is the beach front family friendly area. The other family friendly area is far from the beach, in a jungle setting. The third area is the adults only beach front area. We booked a suite, which was a little misleading since it really was not a true suite with a separate sleeping area. It was a HUGE room with a equally HUGE bathroom. I thought it did have sort of a musty odor, but my family told me it was fine..must have been my imagination. I would suggest asking for a higher floor so you are insured more privacy. Not that we were ever intruded upon, but through out the day there were maintenance men busy maintaining the lush plantings surrounding the property right in front of us. We were on the first floor suite #1003, with our own private dipping pool. Honestly, paying for the upgraded room with the pool was not worth it for us. We didn't use it once the whole trip. The main pool was so nice, we were there all day every day. We were there for spring break and not once did we need to venture out at 7am to put down our towels and pool toys to hold our seats. The pool concierge staff was great and very attentive. They always greeted us by name and with a kind smile. The beach was very clean and had plenty of chairs and service to make the day a great one. The food simply put was NOT your typical all inclusive quality. We are used to very fine dining and can be considered \"foodies\" so getting a thumbs up from us is really a true thumbs up. Of all the restaurants Piaf was our hands down favorite. French with a Spanish twist, and immaculate service. Sen Lin is the asian fusion place, with a great ambiance and great food. Everyone but my husband loved it..he wasn't overly impressed with the menu choice, but the food quality was great. Azul was where we wound up eating breakfast and lunch each day, due to its proximity to our room and the pool. It is a great buffet with something for everyone. The service there was fantastic as well. The staff actually carried your plates from the buffet area to your table for you. Now to the only slightly disappointing/annoying things.....first is the fact that the maid service leaves the room door open with the cart in front of it while she's cleaning your room. In a normal hotel setup where the corridor is indoors this is not a problem. When there is no corridor only a covered walkway, leaving the door open invites the mosquitos into your room to set up shop during the day and bite you all night. They do give you a can of Raid and some organic natural insect repellent, but should you really need to spray yourself down with bug spray before you crawl into bed for the night? The only other thing was the kids club is really just a group babysitting area. It is very clean and the girls were great, but there was no organized activities or themed days as there are in the other kids clubs we are used to, like a Pirate/Circus/ kind of day with themed activities and crafts. That being said, toward the end of our 6 day trip it still was a very pleasant way to get the kids out of the sun for a few hours each day. Bottom line is the adults can't wait to go back and the littlest member of our family cried all morning long because we were leaving...", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201can awesome resort\u201d", "Author": "HamSandwich", "ReviewID": "UR105319086", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Grand Velas this April for a work President's Club - overall the experience was awesome and I would highly recommend this resort. I was a bit skeptical due to the fact that the Grand Velas is all inclusive but this place is really nice - the only drawback is that the resort is huge. We stayed in the Grand Class Suites - these are right on the beach and are over 1300 square feet. Great location since the room was close to both pools and the beach and the plunge pool was a great way to unwind after a day in the sun. The service was spectacular - we stayed at the Esperanza in Cabo last year and thought that the service was as good. Because the place was crowded, there were some times that the service was a bit slow but this wasn't a big deal. Food - had breakfast at Bistro every morning - standard buffet with good assortment of fresh juices and fruit. Lunch was at the pool or at the pool bar - good but nothing spectacular - think tacos, ceviche, nachos, etc. Since we had work activities at night, only had dinner at Piaf which was pretty good but again, nothing to write home about. There are unlimited drinks due to the all inclusive nature and the servers are not shy about serving up whatever you desire. We ordered room service a couple of times and were pleased with how quick we were served. Overall, a very nice vacation spot. Definitely would go back even though the rooms are over $1K night.

(Room 4043, Ambassador) The beginning of our stay was a pleasure. The rooms are nice, the grounds are pretty and the food is good. I had a few bad appetizers but, mostly the food was good. There is a lot to choose from and if you don't like something, the just order something else. The beach is just ok, but I think they did the best they could with the rocky beach and constant beach erosion that area is subjected to. I could have done without the slimy stuffed bags of whatever, which they use to help keep the beach from eroding away. There were quite a lot of children at this hotel but it is possible to find quiet areas. That said, if you have lots of children with you, then they will love it. The adult pool was small, not so impressive, but it was quiet there. The Masters pool was my favorite, since it was so peaceful and spacious. You are able to take a shuttle to any pool but if the hotel is at full capacity then it will be a wait. The Mexican people work harder than any I have seen on any vacation and many of them take such a wonderful pride in their work. It is a shame that one, bad, thieving apple spoiled it for me and took my clothing. They were expensive clothes and I am pissed off! We were on vacation with our 5 yr. old girl and she is not perfect but mostly a well behaved child. We were situated next to a conjoined room of what seemed like 4 children (later, we saw it was only 2) and we heard them whenever they were in their room- it was as if they were in the same room with us. They left after 2 days and we got a reprieve for another couple of days until the room was occupied by another family with more kids. I can't say that the rooms are very soundproof, because it was mostly just regular family noise coming through the door, but it really stunk when we couldn't take after noon naps because of the constant sounds in the room. You can also hear people talking as they walk past your room, so make your room selection carefully if you choose to stay here. I will not stay at this hotel again because I realized when I arrived home that I was missing all of my gym and yoga clothing. I (very idiotically) forgot to pack the middle dresser drawer which contained these things, in the rush to the airport. I never worked out on this trip and they were still sitting in the dresser drawer clean, along with a pair of shorts, a tee shirt and probably some other things, which I will be missing, as soon as summer comes along. I immediately called the hotel to let them know and they said they would e-mail me that evening. I never got any e-mail. I called again the next day, and the same thing. I started to get worried because HOW COULD SOMEONE NOT NOTICE A WHOLE DRAWER OF CLOTHING HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND??? I called again and they connected me to Carl Diaz, who said he would call me back in 15 minutes. About an hour later he called to tell me the house keeper found nothing. -DUH. He acted like I was lying and then told me how the employees get searched before they leave, etc. He was non- apologetic and left me feeling kind of violated. I feel really stupid for leaving my clothing- I never check luggage and so I know it was not in there. Some of my things were brand new, and it really bothers me that they are gone and some one is lying. I even realized my bag was not as full as when I arrived (when I thought I was fully packed to go home) and I gave myself a pat on the back for becoming an efficient suitcase packer. I guess the joke is on me!! I am just a busy mom, I work hard, I came on vacation to relax and I was so busy taking care of my husband and daughter and checking their drawers that I forgot my own! What a dummy I am. But, the reason I am even more stupid, was to think I could go to the Grand Velas in Mexico and save a few dollars coming to Mexico, when I should have been thinking about the well fare and safety of myself and my family. If I had stayed at The Four Seasons I have no doubt that my clothing would have already been in a box, on it's way to my home. If you can be sure that no one will be hurt, injured, lost, and that your valuables are looked after, then go ahead and make a reservation here. Do not pack expensive jewels or clothing. I love Mexico, but it's still Mexico!!!

I was a bit apprehensive of the all inclusive package since the horror stories of having to rush to meals and wait for food is not what I think of when I want a vacation. I can say that this did not happen at all here. As a matter of fact when we were running late I never had a problem changing the time. As far as the food quality goes, I agree it was excellent , I will have a slightly different opinion on the restaurants than the previous reviewers. My favorite was Chaka and Bistro. These two were the ones that I found fresh local food prepared just as you would ask. And because Chaka is in the jungle section, it was always empty and with Bistro in the adult section ,it seemed only to have a crowd at breakfast. All the restaurants were good. My least favorite was Piaf as I didnt think the French food was great...(I do live in Manhattan so I think my idea of French may be skewed) but still nothing to complain about. I also liked Cuccina ,but again I think I liked the fact that since it was adults only it had a different vibe and that was fun for us. I also will say the pools were warm in all 3 sections I visited. The beach as everyone has said is beautiful but the ocean has rocks ,so bring water shoes if you want to swim. We stayed in the jungle section and will confirm that as mentioned it is no problem getting back and forth to the ocean..As a matter of fact I would go to my room to change after the morning swim and return back with no wait. This hotel had plenty of staff which makes it really 5 star. The only thing I would say that was negative is that all butler/concierges are not equal. We wanted to go on some day trips (to see ruins) and perhaps snorkel out...He not only did not know anything but gave incorrect information which is a huge pet peeve of mine. I always would rather they say I will look into it. But I really dont think he cared and it didnt matter since from that point on , I simply asked the lobby concierge and got directed correctly. thanks to the reviewers before me who warned me about the timeshare and other sales events......skip it....

There are so many positives about this hotel: the ambience, the wonderful staff, the high quality food, and the location. The Spa was truly a treat and while a treatment may look pricey by Canadian standards, it is worth every penny to try, because the experience given one hour before your service is simply wonderful! The food was wonderful; however, I would have appreciated a simple dish in each restaurant (such as grilled fish and vegetables or salad) that did not have a complicated sauce or accompaniments). The richness of the food day after day became a bit too much for myself and my partner...not that any of the food was bad at all! Another surprise was the tipping. I had read on Trip Advisor that tipping, while some say not required, I would say it was certainly expected and felt some pressure at the end of each meal to make sure we did tip. The prices of the food, when converted from Pesos to Canadian/American, were ridiculously priced. We calculated some lunches at over $250.00 and some dinners at over $500.00...while the meals are excellent, they are not of this value, especially considering that house wine is served with these meals (you have to pay substantially more for imported bottles of wine). We are in Toronto and have dined in the city's best restaurants, and would be hard pressed to spend this kind of money on a meal even with a decent bottle of wine. So I felt that the prices were inflated to encourage inflated tipping. Once we figured out the Pesos to Canadian dollar ratio, we tipped based on what we felt we would tip in Toronto. On the topic of wines available, there was a wide selection of house wines and you could always find a decent red or white among the bunch. The selection of drinks at the pool was excellent, however. With regard to the rooms, they were very clean, well appointed and spacious. The bathroom was particularly nice, with attractive faucets and fixtures. The paintings in our room were fallng out of their frames (note to management). We met our \"butler\" Gregory on the first day. It is interesting that they use the term \"butler\" because I think we only saw him twice the entire time we were there. The room is supposed to be stocked with a mini bar which had soda, one small bottle of house white/red wine, a few beers and snacks. Several times I had to ask for the mini bar to be restocked. Near the end of our stay, I asked for the small bottle of white wine to be replenished twice, and was then advised that they didn't restock...and the wine never appeared. Yet Gregory advised us the mini bar was part of the \"all inclusive\" and would be stocked daily. I thought that was a cheap kind of response for a hotel of this quality.

The only thing that's left for you is to enjoy the royal blue skies that sink into the warm turquoise sea water right in front of you; it's so beautiful that you don't want to close your eyes even for a nap. But you do eventually. After everyone showers and dresses for dinner in an extra large suite you are ready to take the kids to the fabulous kids club. They absolutely love it!!! The caretakers there are truly wonderful to the kids, they are always playing games or doing a fun activity with them, my kids 4, 10 and 12 would not want leave every time I picked them up. On some occasions they were fast asleep in the nap area already wearing their pjs ready to head to bed. And while my children were happily playing the night away, my husband and I were enjoying the elegant and superb restaurants this hotel has to offer. I could write a million thing about them but I wont; I will leave you to discover how wonderful the food truly is but not without telling you it is first rate and even exotic. Around the second day I walked the morning beach I started to wonder as I crossed into the neighboring hotel Banyan Tree Mayakoba's beach; why was our hotel's sand so clean of seaweeds and rocks, all even and manicured? Well, every early morning they bring in a crew with special equipment that removes the uncomfortable stuff from your beach and it leaves the purest and most softest sand I have ever seen. It felt so good on my bare feet. I also wondered how it was that being surrounded by so many fuchsia bugambilias shrubs you didn't see one single petal on the pathways....I kept thinking the hotel had a pact with mother nature until I later saw there were many people assigned just to a specific portion of the hotel with their sweepers on hand at all times. This is what I mean when I talk about excellence in all aspects, they look into all the minor little details not just the big ones like when you are greeted by your names every time you enter a restaurant or when they follow you on your morning jog through the hotels jungle with a golf cart packed with iced water and cool towels for your refreshment. They are preventing you from getting lost in the many acres and they even have a first aid kit in case you get bitten by a bug. By this time in your vacation you start believing \"you are\" royalty. I don't want to tell you more and ruin the many wonderful surprises you will find there if you go, but I will say you can't miss the spa. It is well worth the extra money. Give yourself the time to stay there about four hours. You wont be able to wipe that smile of your face for many days. So I deeply recommend this hotel to all. If you have tons of money go!! if you don't; save up and go!! because this is the vacation you want to remember all your life. It is well worth every single penny. And if you are unsure as I was as to get a jungle room or an ocean view room; get the ocean view. I still think of those early mornings when I had a freshly brewed cappuccino on the balcony while feeling the ocean breeze against me and watching that sunrise bring in the transparency of that beautiful turquoise ocean.

We have stayed at many 5 star properties in our travels and usually opt for the best suite catagory possible. We were not sure about staying in the ambassador section ( family) but ended up loving every minute of it. There were not many children and we never mind if there a just a few. The children we did see were very well behaved. The best part of our stay was the service, the room which was an ambassador pool suite with ocean frront. The food was outstanding. From the minute we arrived we could tell why this property was a bit more pricey than our usual mexico all inclusive. Last year we stayed at the Royal Cancun in the presential suite and why we loved that also, the grand velas was even better. The only down side of our trip was not the resorts fault or mexico in general. My husband had a chest infection and cold the day before we left, and I caught it from him on our first day there. I hestitated starting antibiodics without seeing a doctor first due to other health concerns. We called down to the front desk and the doctor appeared in our suite within minutes, which we did not expect. I was given a shot as the doctor gave me a choice saying that I would feel better a bit faster if I did that. I was told that the hotel would get the medication for me, but we opted to go to town to get some other items as we didnt think we would feel good enough to spend a lot of time there on this trip. We tried to be repectful to other guests by washing our hands quite often and enjoyed room service for a couple of nights until we felt better. I was so pleased to be able to get chicken soup a few times, which was very good. So it ended up being a very relaxing vacation for us and not a shabby place to have to be if one does not feel well. We did love the food in all of the resturants we tried. I do not usually eat meat very often but an exeption had to be made here. I dont know where they get their beef from but if was out of this world as was the seafood. All of our room requests were were taken care of before we arrived and this was confirmed by email. Often times while traveling to mexico or the caribbean we have found that we have had to either move the next day to get the room we wanted or upgrade. Not so at the Grand Velas. One thing I hate on most vacations is fighting for chairs at the pool or ocean. This was never a problem once. They have changed there system, a pool/beach asssistant would find you a spot of your preference and we found that there were tons of choices as to where we would park ourselves for the day. We were catered to on the beach daily in the adult section. Our waiter would check on us constantly to see if we wanted anything. I loved eating lunch on the beach everyday. I know we were there during high season but you would not know, we had all the privacy we could have wanted. I always recommend asking for what you want while traveling. I sometimes wonder if people who complain about service dont speak up politely. If I find I cant get an answer the first time I ask I also ask someone else, but this time there was no reason to repeat myself and my spanish is very poor. If I wanted something from housekeeping it was there right away. I would leave notes in english and our maid must of checked with someone as to what we were asking for at times with someone who spoke better english because we always recieved what we wanted. I have never wanted to go back to a property so fast in the same year. Grand Veles, we will be looking for deals in the off season this year to be able to return so we can also enjoy another trip feeling much better and to be able to do more of the activities that are offerred. We are in our early 50's and feel no need for lots of night life, but I know you could set us up to do a pub crawl if we ever wanted to. If I had felt better I would have remembered some of the names of people who made our trip outstanding. I found that most of the employees seemed to be happy to work there and were proud to be a part of Grand Velas. Lets talk deals for early November. lol. We are blessed to be able to stay at a resort as wonderful as yours. And for the beach goers, Grand Velas beach is huge. We also loved the heated pool in the Grand Class Section. On occasion, we have not known who to ask about reservations, etc. Sometimes its the floor attendant and sometimes it is someone else. Since we slept in late most days we never saw our floor guy, but one quick call to the front desk and all answers and matters were answered quickly. Also, you can check your hotel bill on your tv. One night we ate at Lucca Lucca, (which was very good ) we left 200 pesos for a tip and didnt cross out the tip section on the bill. We saw that a 350 peso amount was added to our bill, we also tip in cash. We dont know what happened that night but one quick call to the front desk and this was taken care of immediately and never had to be brought up again.

This review is going to sound totally padded, but honestly we cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. First of all, whoever trains the staff should do so for hotels and restaurants around the world. Every single person we met - whether it was the busboy, the concierge, the cabana staff, the front desk or the cleaning staff - was smiling and friendly. We were constantly asked if we needed something to better our stay and were never empty handed at the pool or beach (who doesn't love a cold beverage while enjoying a view unlike any other?!). As if the staff excellence wasn't enough, the hotel itself is breathtaking. Our room overlooked the pool and ocean, and the room layout was so awesome you could see the view from the jacuzzi in the bathroom! Our beds were incredibly comfortable (a first for me, who usually tosses and turns in hotels), and because it was all-inclusive we were never without enough snacks, bottles of water or other items. The pool and beach were both fantastic, but those who want to body surf or go swimming should know this is not that type of beach. Waves were small (perfect for my young kids but not for older ones who want more of a challenge) and the water was a bit rocky and rough. However, the sand is white and felt like flour between our toes. Just beautiful for long walks or jogs along the beach. Now for the restaurants - each and every one felt like a gourmet meal. I kid you not - the food was fantastic and delicious at every restaurant. No worries about getting ill from food here - each place was clean and even the water/ice was filtered. (We all gained weight from eating and drinking so well!) If you have young kids, the Kids Club is great, too. I felt very safe leaving my kids with the staff because they entertained them well and were so friendly and polite. It was nice to have some time alone with my husband without worrying about my children's well being. Honestly there is not enough I can say about this place.

I've been to Cancun before and stayed at Le Blanc Sport, which I also really liked (see my few-years-old review). Compared to Le Blanc, I liked Grand Velas even more. Grand Velas is what I can only describe as Mexican luxury. The ambience was in tune with what I would imagine is the \"Mexican Riviera\" while still having our modern day luxuries. The resort itself is set on lush grounds and a had a \"jungle-ish feel\". My friend and I stayed in the Master area which, as you can tell from the website, has a more jungle vibe to it. Getting to and from the room, you walked through a wooden path set above and overlooking lush trees and jungle. It may sound a little \"rustic\" but it was not at all and actually quite pretty. Although, I must say, it was a bit dark at night. However, I always felt safe throughout the resort. Whereever you stay throughout the resort, you have access to all restaurants and pools. They always had cars waiting to take you anywhere throughout the property so you never had to worry about walking. My friend and I went to the pool at the Grand Class everyday. We loved the Bistro that was there which brings me to the topic of food. The food was very good for an all-inclusve. Those who complained about the food probably either never stayed at an all-inclusive before and/or expected too much. In my viewpoint, when food is included in your stay, your ideals of \"gourmet\" cannot be the same as going to a 4 or 5 star restaurant in NYC (which is where I am from). Compared with other all-inclusives, however, the food here WAS gourmet. The food was fresh and they used good ingredients. I was really impressed with the fresh squeezed juice combinations at the Bistro (very similar to Naked brand juices you buy at the grocery store). Neither breakfast nor lunch was run-of-the mill, but you could choose the usual bacon eggs, if you like. Being a New Yorker, I like my coffee...and, in my perspective, the coffee was excellent. And, for lunch, you did not only have the option of eating at the lunch buffet but had, at least, 2 a la carte restaurants (the one by the master class and the one by grand class). The restaurants for dinner were all pretty good. A few of the restaurants even had lobster on the menu, which was included! Each meal I had was good; no complaints. Now, getting to the amenities. The room itself was exactly as it appears on their website. Pretty standard-looking. However, the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. May be the best I've experienced at a hotel (and I've stayed at the W, Ritz Carltons, Gansevoort, etc). They provided very cute straw slippers for your stay as well as a nice straw bag to carry your towel, magazines, sunscreen, etc. to the pool or beach. I loved this cute extra! Plus, they used all molten brown products. The bathroom was very nice (porcelanosa and kohler and other luxury brand fixtures). Even the china at the restaurants was name-brand...not restaurant brand (villeroy and boch, rosenthal). Ok, we were a bit bored at times to actually pay that much attention. Which brings me to my last point...while we were there, the resort was not full so that is something to consider when you read my review....maybe we received good service, etc., because the resort was only 30% full. I do not know. But, the service was excellent. Fully staffed and very friendly. Almost always saw someone at random points of the resort to ask a question, if necessary and I observed continuous cleaning throughout the resort as well...even saw someone cleaning the wooden path. There is much more to say but I am trying to keep this review as short as possible. I was impressed. The website photos do not lie. It was great and I will be going back for some R&R. (it is not a party place, guys.)

The hotel and property are beautiful and you are warmly greeted when you arrive. But aside from the warm greeting we received upon arrival, we did not find the staff and service to be anywhere close to the level that you find at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun or the Four Seasons in Punta Mita. The reosrt is all inclusive; however, we found that the staff happily took tips when offfered and in some cases seemed to expect them. Our bellman took $ as a tip without trying to refuse it or even thank us. Disappointing. We stayed in the \"Master\" Class, which basically means you are in the jungle about a 5 minute drive from the beach/ocean. If you stay in this section of the hotel, you can't even see the beach. Shuttles are readily available to drive you there, but if you are planning a beach vacation, be sure to book a room in the Ambassador or Grand class. The rooms in the jungle are certainly lovely, but it would be nice to at least have the option of walking to the beach/other sections of the resort. The big benefit of being in the Master section is that it's very quiet. The food was disappointing, but in fairness, we did not get to try most of the restaurants because of the event and being there only a couple of days. We ate at Frida and Chaka and didn't think either one was exceptional. The food served poolside is nearly inedible and the service staff around the pool was borderline rude. I'm not sure if it was because we were part of a large group that had some children. Also, as an all inclusive, the mini bar is included in your rate; however while we were there our minibar was not restocked once. The best food we had was delivered by room service, which is available 24 hours a day. The service was good but not exceptional; Upon check in we had to call service three times because we didn't have hot water and the jets in our jacuzzi tub kept going on and off inexplicably. It seemed to take a long time for someone to come help. Two doors down from us, the fire suppression system went off in another guest's room, flooding the entire room and ruining everything that was not in the bathroom or closet. On the plus side, at least 20 staff members rushed up to help and clean their room...but still unsettling. The gym in the Master class is nice, but again, no exceptional service. No cold towels are available during your workout and the staff didn't even greet me as I walked in. PROS - Beautiful property, lots of restaurants to choose from, 24 hour room service if that's your thing, nice rooms, Master class is private/quiet CONS - Mediocre service and food, mediocre value (you feel like you need to eat and drink constantly to get your $s worth), Master class too far from the ocean/beach, terrible food at the pool, staff doesn't greet you as you pass Overall, for the cost, our family much prefers the Ritz Carlton in Cancun if you are going to that area.

We stayed there for a few days in March and could not have been more thrilled. The grounds are outstanding and the service is beyond compare. There seemed to be at least one person working at Grand Velas for every guest. The staff goes out of their way to speak to you by name and make sure that you know that they know you personally. Pretty much anything we requested was delviered. We had our own \"butler\" - a great guy named Orion - who took care of everything for us including getting dinner reservations set up, making sure our shuttle to airport was scheduled properly and making recommendations on what to do. The restaurants were all outstanding and the service was fast. the food at each restaurant we visitied was outstanding. We really liked Piaf, the french restaurant on the third floor overlooking the ocean. But all the restaurants, including the buffet style Azul, really met our needs. We did not go hungry. If you go there, a must is a trip to the spa. The spa at grand velas is one of the nicest that i have been to in my travels. I would say it is second only to the spa at the Grand Wailea in Maui. Be sure to go early and do the recommended hydotherapy session which includes steam rooms, saunas, whirlpools, etc. The locaiton is close to shopping in Playa and to excursions like Xcaret and Xplor. I recommend you just get a cab to those locations as you will save both time and money. You can take a cab there and when you are done for the day there are plenty of taxis available to take you home. Same with the shopping in playa - taxiis at every street corner. The main pool in the ambassador section is perfect for laying around and getting some sun. We did not get up and \"mark our turf\" early on any of the days but still were able to get some lounge chairs by the pool unlike some places where you have to lay our towels out early. And during the day, the wait staff was constantly bringing us waters without asking and there when we needed anything. The best thing was that the resort, while all inclusive, did not try to nickel and dime us for everything. The cost we paid to get there truly seemed to cover everything and we never felt pestered to buy something or sign up for something. It really is a place that allows you to go at your own pace. We travelled with two kids (ages 14,12) and there was enough for them to do without getting bored. I wish we would have done more but spent too much time simply relaxing.

Negatives: Don't know what they wash the sheets and towels with, but the fabric has a weird smell. I do not doubt the cleanliness but would prefer detergent with a more pleasant smell, or none at all. The other negative is the rain shower, man when it rained, it poured. Literally the water overflowed onto the rest of the bathroom floor, so the floor was a wet and slippery mess after using the rain shower. So we didn't dare to use the rain shower unless we were heading out right afterwards so it will be taken care of by the cleaning lady by the time we get back.

We were in the Ambassador section on the 3rd floor. Our balconies were tremendous and overlooked the beach and if you looked over to the left, the pool. The rooms are huge and immaculate. The amenities are Molton Brown. The mini-bar (which I never touched but my boys loved) was filled with goodies and drinks. The food was spectacular. We all loved Piaf he best (the brioche with the rocquefort cheese OMG!). Great steaks and desserts and service. Sen Lin was a little slow but the Peking duck was great. Lucca was good and the lobster was divine. My husband and I renewed our vows while we were there and went to Cocina d Autor for our romantic dinner. Everything was magnificent. Frida was great and I wish we could have gone again. The buffets for breakfast and lunch were lovely with a stress on quality over quantity, My 14 year old preferred he buffet at Club Med. But you could also order a la carte if you wanted to so you could get almost anything you wanted. We loved The Bistro for a peaceful a la carte breakfast My only real disappointment was the main pool. The resort was overrun with young kids. I think almost every family there had kids under the age of 7 because it was Presidents week. So sitting by the main pool was not very relaxing. Also ALL the chairs were gone by 7:30 AM which should not happen since they have pool concierges who are supposed to get you chairs. So rather than deal with the little kids screaming Mommy every 6 seconds, we went to either the beach or the Jungle pool area. The beach is fabulous and you can always get chairs. The sand is like talcum powder. But the real surprise was how AMAZING the jungle pol area was. We had it virtually all to ourselves. It was quiet and very Zen. There was food and drink service and double sleeper like sunning beds. Its was delightful. The spa was literally THE BEST spa experience of my life and I have been to some extraordinary spas. Its very expensive but my friend and I wound up staying there for 3 hours. I recommend doing the water journey AFTER your service to totally immerse yourself in it. With the exception of the main pool, the resort never felt crowded. True there is no night life. But dinner was a wonderful experience each night and we were happy to go back to the room and relax or just have a drink. Even our teenagers loved it. They work hard in school and this was a great chance for them ot relax and take it down a notch. We spent one day at Xplor (I already posted my review). WE loved it. Worth mentioning: we loved our concierge, Santiago, the Pilates classes were surprisingly good, gym is way more crowded in the morning than at night, order dessert first at Piaf, good quality drinks, if you want something just ask This was way more expensive than any other resort we have stayed at with the boys.

We were traveling with our 4 year old and 5 month old daughters. Everyone in our group enjoyed every aspect of this resort. On our first visit, we stayed in the Ambassador (oceanfront) section; this time we were in the Master (jungle) section. We enjoyed the ambassador section more because of the proximity to the main pool and beautiful views, but the master section was quite satisfactory. We just didn't use the balcony/patio very much because there were more insects and a less satisfying view. I was concerned about the potential inconvenience of taking a shuttle to the ambassador section to access the beach/main pool; we, however, never had to wait more than 30 seconds for shuttle, and most times, there was already a shuttle waiting when we arrived. Our suite was spacious, well appointed and very clean. The bathroom had a very nice rain shower and jetted tub. Water pressure was excellent. Beds were very comfortable. As was the case in the first visit, the food was outstanding. The food at all the restaurants was innovative and well prepared. The food on the room service menu and poolside was not near the quality or variety of that at the restaurants but was satisfactory. Service by the pool was prompt and friendly on all but one of the days we were there. I did not mind that we had to sign itemized bills after every meal; I did tip after meals (less than I normally would given that this is an all inclusive) but certainly did not feel obligated. The beach and pool was great, as mentioned by other reviewers. 2 out of the 3 sections of the large beach pool were heated. The beach was rocky in most areas but there were areas with a sandy bottom that allowed for some wading. I would recommend water shoes if you want to go into the water. One great addition to the hotel was the on-site dive operation. Daniel the divemaster was very knowledgeable and cordial. It was extremely convenient being able to leave for a dive directly from the hotel beach rather than having to leave from PDC. My four year old really enjoyed the kids club. There is one at both the master section and ambassador section. The staff were very nice and great with the kids. The clubs were also very well equipped with video games, movies, board games and art projects. One word of caution: the website implies that kids 4 or older can be left at a kids club, but once there, it seemed that kids need to be at least 5 to be left without parents.

Here's what you should know before you go: - The best rate on the Grand Velas website was $895. I booked on Hotels.com for $661 - I arrived with my 8 year old daughter. Everyone in the lobby was sitting with drinks and towls. We were not and shuffled to a couch. - We arrived at the room and we immediately asked to book dinner. All the restaurants were fully booked and my daughter and I were told we could order room service. After complaining, we got into a restaurant but had to rush their fast. Since my daughter was soaking wet from a drink getting spilled on her during the flight, we needed to get her changed. It took an hour to get our luggage. We missed the appointment. - at 9pm we finaly had a reservation. We rushed over, only to find out we could not get in because i was wearing open-toed shoes. We've stayed at a few Four Seasons and nice hotels in tropical locations. I thought a nice pair of pants and shirt with sandals was fine when eating dinner by a beach. Not here. They were nice enough to offer to get my shoes out of my room... but got irritated when it took 45 minutes. - BEWARE: it says all inclusive, but they still have prices on the menu. DINNER FOR MY 8 YEARL OLD DAUGHTER WAS $240! she drank water and I had three vodka tonics. - Here's where they get you: tipping is not inlcuded. 15% of $240 is more than the dinner was worth. And I'm sure the hotel gets most of that and not the server. To make matters worse, employees here acted like they could care less.

We payed a considerable amount more to stay in this section, which is oceanfront and is adults only (ages 16 and up). The view was great, room was very roomy, had a huge bathroom, and we had a plunge pool in the balcony. Our arrival at this resort was amazing, everyone went out of their way to welcome us, and give information about the property. Our butler concierge Alejandra was great. She showed us to our suite, and asked us if we had any special needs or requests for our stay. The resort itself and the beach were spotless, and were constantly being cleaned. The beach and pool were great. We spent most of our time at the ambassador and grand class pools. Service at the pools was very attentive...especially Jose. The food here was fantastic. My favorite by far was the french restaurant Piaf. We ate there the first night, and had Emilio as our server. We had such a great meal, and the service was so good that we made reservations there for our last night and requested Emilio. Had room service several times, and the selection and quality of the food was good, and was served promptly. Our only complaint about our dning experience during our stay was at their signature restaurant Cocina de Autor. I will say that the food we had here was well prepared and tasty. The problem was that the menu did not provide a description at all for any of the items, which I thought to be strange. And when we asked the waiter to give us a better description he wasn't much help either, so we just gave up, and ordered whatever we thought was the safest bet. Not a big deal, but another thing that surprised us was when we were at the restaurant Bistro, which is in the adult only section, there was a table next to us with two very young children that were constantly screaming. Many previous reviewers have complained about a lack of nightlife at the resort, I found it to be adequate enough, and enjoyed that there were several different options as far as bars go. Last year we stayed at the Iberostar Grand just down the street, and had a great time there. I would say that the food is better here, but I would return to both resorts again in the future...I just don't know if I would splurge and pay all the extra money for the Grand Class rooms.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cLike no other!\u201d", "Author": "gfife", "ReviewID": "UR96633676", "Content": "Just returned from the most amazing trip ever. Stayed in the Grand suites and they were amazing. The view from our room was outstanding. Loved the private hot tub on the balcany, the huge bathroom, the indoor jacuzzi, the comfy bed, the walk in closet, the hotel staff and excellent service. Best experience ever. The hotel arranged several outtings for us, which were great. The food was so good. Especially loved Sen Lin and Freda (my most favorite). Lucca was good but didn't overwhelm me as much as the other two. We ate at the Bistro just about every morning. Loved the Omlete and fresh OJ. The staff was all amazing and very friendly. The Spa.. Let me just say that the water experience prior to my avacado wrap was the most amazing spa experience ever. A must do if staying here. I also got a pedicure, which I was a bit disappointed in, and probably wouldn't recommend. I thought it was a bit pricey at $75. I spend $25 at home, which takes an hour and includes a full massage from the knee down. Compared to what I get done at home I didn't think it was good value for money. They did a good job though. My only complaint during the entire stay would be our experience at Frida. We were on a company trip and paid to stay an extra night since it was right before Valentines Day. We went to Freda which was listed as \"Fine Dining\" for a quite romatic dinner and several people showed up in t-shirts with screaming children and were allowed in. In addition we were seated near the water feature so all the kids wanted to come over and play in the water, next to us while we were trying to enjoy our meal. Kind of ruined the romantic part for us. We choose to eat there because we thought it would be kid free. I didn't understand why the people didn't take advantage of the day care center which always seemed to be empty when we walked by it.

We were 4 friends celebrating our birthday's and were lucky enough to stay 7 wonderful nights. We originanly were booked to stay in the Master Suites but decided to upgrade to the Ambassador Suites. It is well worth spending the money to upgrade. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The sunbed on the balcony was a great idea and morning breakfast on the balcony was a treat. We made bookings for the restaurants online before our arrival. Not sure this was necessary as the resort was only about 15% occupied. Th restaurants were absolutely outstanding. After reading the menu we were hesitant to try the signature restaurant, Cocina De Autor, but as we were already booked we decided to try it anyway. WOW. what a mistake if we had missed out going to this restaurant.The chefs sampler menu was terrific and food exquisite. They had even made individual chocolate lava cakes with \"happy birthday\" piped on the plates. Delicious !! Also had fabulous food at Piaf, Sen Lin and Lucca. Try the souffles at Piaf. Well worth the wait. Sometimes we just went there for dessert. Not sure if many people do this but they had no objections. We still talk about the food at the restaurants and comment we have not had meals which match the standard at Grand Velas since our return. Also try the food from the pool bar. The kebabs and nachos are delicious. The drinks are plentiful and cocktails beautiful. Try the Caribbean tea if you dare !! The pool guys were great but not as attentive as other staff. However this was due to a wedding party staying at the resort at the same time. The groom was a demanding , obnoxious and loud American who treated the staff as servants. Always demanding the best tablesat the restaurants and moving sun lounges to accomodate his guests and constantly calling over the pool waiters to attend to his and his guests needs. He gave no consideration to other guests staying at the resort. The pool was beautiful and looked gorgeous against the backdrop of the Caribbean sea. The fitness centre also looked like it had great facilities. Unfortunately I didn't partake in the fitness regime ( and paying for it now!!) Maybe I should have used it to burn off all those calories in delicious coktails. !! Accolades to Gregory, our concierge. He was a very willing, pleasant and courteos employee always willing to help if required. The only negative which is metioned by most other reviewers is signing the bill at the end of a meal. It is not really necessary and makes people feel awkward.

Although we have both stayed at many 5 star hotels/resorts-- including the other 5 star resort in Playa del Carmen (Royal Hideaway Playacar) -- nothing can come close to the experience we had at Grand Velas. Service The first time we stayed at Grand Velas was the week after the swine flu first broke-out. We contemplated canceling our trip but were SO GLAD we didn't. Although the resort had only recently opened, the service was impeccable from the moment we arrived. The staff was well-trained and incredibly attentive (without being annoying) and the waitstaff at all of the various restaurants were consummate professionals. The concierge was wonderful as well. She helped us with everything from booking restaurants, spa appointments, and even noticed which kind of beverages we preferred from the mini-bar and made sure we were always constantly stocked with extra espresso pods! Dining I was simply blown-away by the caliber of restaurants at this resort. We are both foodies and love to visit the best restaurants in New York and Boston and I can honestly say that just about every meal we had while at Grand Velas rivaled the best restaurants we have ever visited. Our favorite restaurant had to be Cucina de Autor (their signature). Make sure if you go that you order the chef's tasting menu. Unbelievable! We both also really enjoyed Piaf and Sen Lin. You can't go wrong with any of them. Rooms The first time we visited we were in the Ambassador Class with an oceanfront view that was to die for. We joked that the photo that was taken of the pools/beach on their website was probably taken from our room. Again, what can I say other than the rooms are exquisite! No detail was overlooked from the bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and separate rain shower and Molton Brown soaps, to the sliding door that opens up the bathroom to the bedroom/living area, to the balcony with delicate purple flowers dripping off of a trellis above you that provide the perfect shade to sit on the chaise while you sip your espresso in your organic cotton robe. We also really liked the iPod doc clock radio and flat-screen TV/DVD player. Turn-down service came every night and put a chocolate mint on my pillow and positioned slippers on a mat next to each side of our bed! Even the closets were fabulous. Plenty of drawers and hangers and they even provide you with a beach tote you can use during your stay. Brilliant! Spa Wow. This place is un-be-lieve-a-ble. All I can say is that you definitely have to go while you're there and don't forget to plan for extra time to do the water journey. I promise you, you have never seen anything like it. My only complaint is that they have separate sides for men and women so my husband and I couldn't do the water journey together (which would have been nice) but still it was well worth the experience. Resort Overall It is abundantly clear that a lot of time and attention went into the execution of this resort. Everything from the breathtakingly beautiful pools, restaurants, beaches (groomed daily), to the quality of materials and workmanship that is evident each and every place you turn. And I think it's this attention to detail that really sets it above the rest. Cons My only complaints are things others have mentioned: 1.) I really wish they didn't make you sign a bill after every meal. I just find it awkward and somewhat pressuring. No other all-inclusive resort makes you do this. Having said that I do believe in tipping for great service and I would recommend to others that they do tip generously. However, I think they could do without the billing charade. 2.) The second time we visited (last May) we stayed at the Master Class which is basically out in the jungle. Although the rooms were just as nice as in the Ambassador (minus the view), I did feel rather disconnected from the rest of the resort. I didn't like that you had to take a van to get to the main part of the resort and it was a hike just to get to the van. 3.) Like others have reported, our last trip we were asked if we wanted to hear about their vacation club/time share thing in exchange for a 3 night voucher to return at anytime. This seemed like a great deal so we agreed. Word of advice: DON'T BOTHER. The voucher is basically useless. They told us we would only have to pay a small \"all-inclusive fee\". Shame on us for not recognizing that if it seems too good to be true... there is probably a catch. And there was. It turns out when I went to book my third stay (my mom and I are going back Feb 9th-14th), that \"all-inclusive fee\" was more expensive than booking the room normally. Frankly I was disappointed that a resort of this caliber would engage in such a blatant bait and switch tactic. Also the guy who tried to sell us the timeshare was really pompous and annoying too. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Having said that, I would still HIGHLY recommend this resort to anyone and I am very much looking forward to my 3rd visit in just a little over a week with my mom! I will definitely update my review if there are any surprises but I suspect that the experience will be just as memorable and wonderful as my first 2 trips.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithtown, New York", "Title": "\u201cover the top pampering\u201d", "Author": "jantres", "ReviewID": "UR93429493", "Content": "What an amazing experience we had at this beautiful resort. The service was over the top, starting with the check-in all the way to check-out. We were greeted by our concierge, Ceasar. He escorted us to our room with a huge smile. He helped us to make dinner reservations. Whatever we needed, Ceasar was more than willing to help us. We enjoyed the restaurants. The food at the French restaurant was delicious. The wait staff went over board to serve us. My personal favorite was the Italian restaurant, because I really enjoyed the service and the personalities of the waiters. Every diner in your party was served dinner at the same exact moment. If their was a group of six then six waiters would arrive at the table to deliver the food. One of our waiters was Mayan and he spoke a bit about his beautiful culture with us. My husband and I enjoyed massages at the spa. Totally incredible experience. The spa is wonderful. I left feeling totally relaxed and refreshed. I also enjoyed the gym. Daniel was more than willing to help me with the treadmill, bicycle, etc. The wait staff at the beach constantly asked if we wanted drinks, towels, what more could he do for us. We liked to hang out at the beach in front of the bistro. The wait staff at the beach was extremely attentive. We were always able to get a premier seat at the beach. The only thing I would change, which would be a huge undertaking, would be to have a path so that visitors could walk from one section of the resort to the other. For example, I would have a path from the Ambassador to the spa area.

We checked in around 6:30pm. We stayed for 9 lovely nights but were told that after 12 noon on the date of check out, we would be responsible for all of our extra food and drink charges. Our flight out was also late in the day so our private transfer was not set to pick us up until 2:30pm. They did agree to allow us use of the room beyond 12noon but insisted that we had to pay for our food/drink after noon. I disputed this with the front desk manager and told him that we have never had to pay extra charges at an all-inclusive before. Especially since we paid ALOT more for this premium hotel and I felt we were being nickel and dimed. He did agree to make an exception for us - but being that we did not check in until late on the day we arrived, I felt like this was a bit unreasonable. #2) I really HATED that every meal required you to sign a check. I have no idea why they do this. I'm not sure if it's to guilt trip you into tipping more or why this is done but most times we would have to wait around for our check etc. I'd really like to see a system like other AI's that you can just give your room # and they can confirm your name on their lists. Either that or else maybe they need to look into a wrist band system (which I dislike too but it's still much better than waiting around for a check). #3) We got really tired of being pushed to complete their surveys at every meal. While I can appreciated why this is important for their quality and service control, I hope management understands that it is very difficult/awkward to write any negative comments/reviews when you know darn well that you will likely have to confront those same employees several more times during the course of your stay. It would be nice if there was maybe a drop box at each restaurant where you could leave your comments annonomously. #4) We had such wonderful service one night at the restaurant Piaf. Our waiters were Jorge and Arturo. I happen to be a vegetarian and Jorge was so awesome that he made special arrangements with the chef for me and also gave us awesome recommendations to both my husband and myself. He also went out of his way to find us a bottle of wine that was not part of their \"house\" wine selection that night - so he went over to the bar next to the restaurant and got our requested wine for us. Also he recommended the \"cucumber martini's\" which don't sound so appealing but ended up being our favorite drink. Long story short Jorge and Arturo were the most special waiters we had thru our entire visit !! We asked how we could get them again next time and Jorge said all we had to do was specifically request them to the hostess when we arrive. We made this special request again the next time we went to Piaf but were very disappointed when we were walked right past them to another waiter. We didn't want to make a big deal about it because we didn't feel it was fair to pre-judge the other waiter but our experience was not nearly as special. We were actually really frustrated and asked the hostess why we weren't put with our requested waiters and no response was ever given to that question, it was simply ignored. Too bad. #5) Our two \"butlers/concierges\" Cesar and I think the other one was Fernando (in the Master Section) were pretty much useless!! Cesar made such a point of telling us that anything that we needed arranged or taken care of he would help us with and that he could be found at his \"concierge\" desk in our section at any time. Well - he was never really there at this desk when we had a question or concern. My husband and I try to remain low maintenance so although we could have called the concierge we didn't bother. Fernando was SO pushy requesting us to write a review for him. He honestly must have asked us about 6 or more times (no exaggeration) on the day before we left. He even left a \"blank\" sheet of paper on 3 different occasions trying to get us to write a review for him before we left. Again, when our review would not have been so positive, it would have been very awkward for us to write these negative comments and then have to face him afterwards. The funny thing about it is that his service was SO poor that on our last day he never made any arrangements with us to pick up our luggage from our room or anything like that. When we left our room my husband and I actually walked right in front of him carrying all of our luggage and had to walk about 5 minutes from our room to the Master suites lobby. We walked right in front of him (suspiciously this was the only time we ever saw him at his desk) and he waved goodbye to us but never even offered to take our luggage for us or assist us or anything!! Very strange for a hotel that is so concerned about service and a concierge that was so concerned about us writing a review for him... #6) I agree with the last reviewers comments that this hotel does not sufficiently light the resort at night. We love to take walks around a resort in the evenings (especially in this case because there is nothing by way of entertainment here). We like to stroll around after dinner and if the weather is nice go sit on a beach chair and star-gaze and chat a bit. The walkways are so poorly lit and especially the stairs that lead down to the beach that it was very difficult to see where you were going. Also the covered walkways in the Master section were also so poorly lit that you had to be almost directly in front of the signs before you could read them to get your directions. Would love to see a \"classy\" string of white lights around the palm trees too. Overall, despite how negative this review seems - this resort was truly spectacular and we would highly recommend it. I just wanted an opportunity to express some of our concerns because I know that the hotel management reads these reviews on a regular basis. Oh yes, one more thing. For some strange reason I could not find any Candian Tour Operator that offered this hotel as a pre-packaged vacation. I hope that this hotel can market itself to some of the Canadian Tour operators because it is a shame that more people don't know about this gorgeous resort! When I show pictures to our friends and family, they ask where all the people are... I know that the price point puts this out of reach for many but there are still discerning travellers that are willing to pay for luxury. Is it more expensive that most all inclusives - yes. Is it worth it?? YES!! Please consider that this is still MUCH cheaper than a European or Hawaiian vacation and the food and luxury are far superior than anything you've likely experienced before. This is better than the Ritz Carlton in Maui if you want to compare apples to apples - but you're still paying less!

When the folks from the convention left I think Mom and I were the only ones in the place. Seriously. On the last day of our trip i was sitting on the beach and a couple from the resort next door (where the explosion was) approached me and asked if this resort was a time share which I told them it was infact not. They then asked where everyone was as they have been staying next door for the past week and had been admiring how beautiful this place was but never saw anyone around. And they were right. It has to be the price. It is very very expansive to stay here. We paid $4000.00 per person. But I must say you do get what you pay for. I have been to many all inclusives and this has by far been the best as far as service and food goes. I did however miss the entertainment and people watching on the beach. After dark it becomes a ghost town. There is a piano bar although no one ever played the piano in it and a Kareokee bar that was fun one night while the convention was there. Other then that, forget it. We did however throughly enjoy our stay there. This was a vacation all about R&R and we laid on the beach everyday and read. They have great chairs and beach beds. The poolside and beach service is great. Marco was always right there brining bottles of water, bar drinks or lunch/snacks at your request. The rooms are huge, the beds are super comfy.

I want to relate our check out. As the last couple of the group to leave, I stopped at the concierge at about noon the day before our departure to confirm the car service our friends set up for us as a gift to all their guests, the same car service that we had all been using all week, coming and going from the resort. The concierge, at first saying he was unaware of our friends wedding party, they had checked out that morning, or knowing the car service, after I texted the groom luckily still in the airport for the contact name and showing the concierge the name and # on our phone, he suddenly knew the service. At that point he instructed me that he will call the service and confirm the pickup and then leave a message in my room with the pickup time. Spending the day in Playa del Carmen and Cozumel, I returned to the room at 9 pm to a note saying \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information about your check out, please if you need help with your transportation call the lobby and quoting me two prices for a cab or a limo and signed by a woman. Clearly I was passed off to someone else during the day and telling me that I have no pre-arranged transportation through the groom. The next morning my wife went to the lobby and arranged a taxi, curiously, now even more then the note quoted, as the hotel couldn\u2019t confirm our prearranged outside service, for noon. At 11:30 am, the car service that our friend arranged arrived. In the lobby, we asked the concierge, another women, to cancel our taxi. She spent a couple of minutes on the phone and related to us that the car was canceled, but we would have to pay for it, a charge of $39, even though it was a half hour early and no taxi came. All that was repeated to us was we were responsible for the unwanted taxi. There was no ownership or acknowledgment of how the resort made the mistake of not confirming our car thru the prearranged service. Needing to leave for the airport, we refused to sign the credit card slip, told them we were going to dispute the charge with American Express anyway, and chose to leave. At this point, we attempted to get in the car the groom arranged, but the front desk radioed across the lobby to the valet, in Spanish. Here it gets amazing as a sudden new rule for the resort was created. The valet told us we need to get an exit paper from the desk to give at the gate, and thus need to sign for the taxi. I was outraged, I had been traveling in out of the resort, for wedding errands and trips at all hours and never had we been stopped for exiting the resort. Upon return it was confirmed that not one other wedding party member had to give an exit paper to leave. At this point, 4 to 5 other employees gathered around our luggage and a blue shirted manager individual stepped forward and feigned attempting to calm the situation. He heard us out once on the hotel confirming our car service, and then continued to repeat that we could not leave without an exit paper and we had to sign for the taxi. He repeated the mantra, \u2018you chose an outside service and now you have to pay for ours.\u2019 He never acknowledged that I had used the hotel to broach a language barrier in helping to confirm our prearranged car to get to the airport. We attempted to leave and even got in the car, but our driver was instructed not to leave. I demanded to leave, he said he could not let me leave until I signed and then would receive my exiting paper. He said if we didn\u2019t sign for the taxi, then they would not let us out of the gate. I told him the resort has my contact information and credit card authorization on file, so signing for the taxi was an empty gesture. The resort had one goal, for us to sign the credit card receipt. At this point there had to be 10 employees, many encircling the car, several had now moved in between the luggage and the car, and the blue shirted individual in the van\u2019s sliding door, forcing me to sign a credit card receipt. At this point, cornered in my car and starting to fear for my life, I exploded; I started to curse and yell to leave, and was told I could not. Here I was in a 5 star resort and being told I couldn\u2019t leave over what we viewed as a simple mistake, was in my opinion now tantamount to extortion as well, being forced to pay to leave the resort. I finally, under duress, crossed the lobby and signed the credit card receipt, an empty gesture and got back in the car. No one moved, not one employee, the blue shirted individual then came forward to the car and accused me of not signing my \u2018proper\u2019 name, and I would have to sign again. As if this is going to calm the situation down at all? At this point, my wife signed another copy and wrote disputed on it, the blue shirted manager said we could not leave until we signed a clean copy and only our name, to his liking! I finally, in fear, signed a copy. We were handed no \u2018exiting paper\u2019 and drove out of the resort, we could not calm down until safe at the gate in the airport to ease what amounted to being held detained by the resort until I satisfied their needs.

We were contacted over a month later to refund the taxi charge, but it was too soon too late and we now repeat this story about the Grand Velas when we talk about traveling to Playa del Carmen.

Yes, I am really writing a very positive review of a beach resort, one to which we will return. We stayed in the Jungle side of the resort which was nice and quiet and home to several of the resorts restaurants. The suites are pretty large although they do not seem to be 1800 square feet as advertised. Seems more like 1300 which is VERY nice sized. They are new and clean with smooth concrete floors. The best are comfortable with real down pillows (at least they feel that way). Bathroom is well-appointed with a large jacuzzi and separate shower. Flat screen tv and large patio complete the setup. It is truly amazing how many people you pass with mops and brooms in their hands continually cleaning the complex. IT is extremely well maintained. The pool area is nice at both sides of the property although it is much more open and conducive to children at the beach side. The jungle side pools are fairly spread out and more represent a number of wading pools as opposed to two very large pools on the beach side. Additionally, the jungle side pools were not heated and only one of the beach pools were heated. I understand that mgmt probably wants to provide both heated and unheated pools for the guests but the unheated pool was almost always empty and the heated pool well used. Perhaps they should take note of this and heat the second pool. After all, I suspect that not many people on vacation want to spend much time in an unheated pool (at least as evidenced during our entire 8 day visit). One small note - there is a bridge between the pools on the beach side that is very slippery. Mgmt should place strips of textured material on the wood to ensure that no one slips as this WILL happen and someone will get hurt - an easy fix). Service at the pool was top-notch. There were plenty of staff available to assist with chairs, drinks and food. It was not uncommon to see a staff member holding a towel for our son as he exited the pool so that he would not have to walk to his chair to get one. One minor issue that seems to affect many resorts is the issue of chairs by the pool. There should be a limit as to how many chairs can be \"saved\" by one individual. Several times we saw one person holding 10+ chairs by the pool when their families didn't appear until after 11am. Also holding chairs for every 3 year-old in your party just shouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately there is no easy way to solve this problem. The beach is excellent with very soft, fine white sand. There was a daily beach BBQ buffet and seating area with a full bar. There were always games of football, soccer and volleyball going on so the kids always had activities if desired. Water sports are available and the shallow snorkeling was great. Restaurants were generally very good with one disappointment. The resort is trying to be too sophisticated. Every restaurant, even the buffet, has a well-developed menu but each dish seems as though it could have been designed at a fine NYC restaurant. The resort is missing 1-2 casual eateries (i.e. a teppan yaki grill, a fajita-type casual Mexican rest). While it is nice to enjoy fine dining, it is also nice to have a more laid-back option (not the dress code but the actual food). Sen Lin, the asian eatery would be much more appealing as a sushi and teppan place and add a casual Mexican place and the food would be perfect. Waiters always addressed by name, a very nice Four Seasons touch and servers were very professional. The kids club was truly top-notch and rivaled many more expensive competitors. We did not take much advantage but our kids did make t-shirts, attend a puppet show and a magic show. These were outside professionals brought in to entertain the kids (ok, and the adults). The kids staff was young, attentive, friendly, helpful and professional. We had no concerns about leaving our kids in their capable care. One missing amenity is a \"tween\" club. There is a kids club for younger children, a teen club for those a little older but nothing in between. Those children from about 8 or 9 to 14 or so may feel somewhat left out. We had one minor glitch during our stay as our flight was canceled and we needed to stay another night. Instead of making some accommodation to allow us to remain in our room, we were required to move to another. The explanation was that each room had been assigned and to change one assignment would affect the entire resort. In the day of fully computerized hotel management systems, I found this very hard to believe. A room juggle should be possible at the touch of a button. We were appreciative that a room was made available to us but there should have been some way for us to remain in our room. After all, it was on the first floor of the jungle side, perhaps the least desirable room category. Finally, I was very surprised for a hotel that offers fractional ownership, it was a very light sell, if it can be called a sale at all. We had to affirmatively request information, there were no signs and no phone calls offering a purchase alternative. This is a refreshing break from the hard sell of most other \"timeshare\" operators.

We did a tour one day with Edventure Tours and let me tell you, they are AWESOME. We did SO many things in one day for half the price of what the other tours cost. They know what they are doing too. For example, they had us go to Tulum in the morning (at 9am) BEFORE the HUGE crowd got there. If not for them, we would've been standing in a mile long wait. Btw, definitely see TULUM and snorkel the caves. Those were the highlights of our trip : ) Best memories.

This was my first time in Riviera Maya, but I have been to Cancun in the past. I took this vacation with my parents and younger sister as my father was sponsoring an event there. As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel is phenomenal and among the top hotels I have ever stayed in and definitely #1 for all inclusive hotels I have been to. As an aside, we were there during the unfortunate and frightening gas explosion which occurred on the property next door. Despite such an event, the hotel ran as normal and never made anyone feel they were unsafe or at risk. First Impression and Rooms The entry way is beyond impressive, with massive walls, blue water, and overall beautiful and eye- catching curb appeal. Upon arrival to the lobby, you are greeted by name and I had a quick and effortless check- in. The rooms are all suites, and quite sizeable. Our rooms have 2 queen size beds and a couch, desk, television, etc. The balconies are large and comfortable, with ocean views. There is a well stocked mini- fridge and snacks basket, and the bathroom has both a stand up shower, as well as a separate whirlpool bathtub. There is 24 hour butler and suite service that is thorough and polite, albeit a little bit slow (30-35 minutes to get a pot of tea and milk on average); this however, may be expected given the size of the resort. Pool and Beach I did not use the pool, however my family and many acquaintances did. The pool is a beautiful, infinity pool the color of the ocean; however I believe it is a bit cold. The beach is incredible. The sand is white and absolutely spotless. The staff make an effort to give stellar service and maintain the beach altogether. Javier was always great to deal with, bringing towels, drinks, and setting up umbrellas daily for us, always with a smile. The water is out of this world\u2026. The blue is indescribable, and even after visiting many beaches throughout Latin America, nothing has topped this yet. Restaurants Azul (Buffet): The buffet restaurant near the pool is where I had every breakfast and lunch. The food is great, and there was a pretty thorough variety in hot dishes. In the cold plates, there was the typical- cold cuts, cheeses, ceviches, sushi, desserts, and various types of bread. Behind the hot plates, the chef can make items like omelettes, quesadillas, etc. if requested. Be sure to ask about the made to order desserts. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 is out of this world (but will take about 20 minutes). Piaf (French): By far the best restaurant of the trip. I loved the food, the ambiance, and the service, both were incredible. I wish I could remember the names of our waitstaff, because they made the whole experience wonderful (if it helps- we went 7 PM on Saturday, Nov. 13th). A must- visit! At 6-7 PM, children 12+ are allowed, afterwards it is adult only. Frida (Mexican): This was my parent\u2019s favorite and they visited twice. The food was great, as was the service. This restaurant allowed all age groups. Sin Lin (Asian): The food and ambience here was exceptional, I really enjoyed it. This restaurant allowed all age groups. Bistro (French): This restaurant is also ages 12+ for 6-7 PM reservations, after which it is adults only EXCEPT when Azul is closed for dinner (see below), at which time they are open for all ages. The food and service was good. Luka (Italian): I am not a fan of Italian food in general, but the service style at this restaurant was quite nice. This restaurant allowed all age groups. Weather I live in a tropical country myself, which is much warmer than Mexico, but despite that, the weather was beautiful. Temperatures were ranging from 23- 30\u00b0C/ 70-85\u00b0F, and most days were blue skies. We had on emorning with rain that lasted just an hour or so, and back to perfect sunny weather. Outside Activities From the resort, I personally did the catamaran and the parasailing. I believe my family did snorkeling after I left as well, but unfortunately I cannot comment on that. The catamaran was great, we had a lot of fun. Six of us went with the guide for $110 for the hour, and he took us through the waves and even stopped in the middle of the ocean so we could take a swim in the awesome blue water. The parasailing was also a great experience. The cost was $85, or if 2 go together $125 (3 can also go, but I am not sure of the cost). It was fun and definitely a must do at least once, somewhere. Outside the resort, we visited Tulum by the Sea (ruins), deep sea fishing from Puerta Aventuras, and did some shopping in \u201c5th Avenue\u201d. The ruins were INCREDIBLE and a must do! The history is quite rich, but I recommend getting a guide book rather than a guide, as ours talked a lot and about the same things, and frankly was a bit boring. The book was way more fascinating. Take your bathing suites, the beach there is stunning. I am unsure what the cost for this trip was. The fishing was honestly a waste of money. We did not catch anything which is fine, and can\u2019t be expected for every trip, but the staff of the boat we were on (\u201cTop Gun\u201d) did not even make an effort to talk with us. When we asked questions about the process, the bait, what we were doing, etc. we did not get any answer. We basically just went along for the ride. I believe the cost was $500, and totally not worth it. Had we caught a fish, it may have made up for it\u2026 but had we had a learning experience about fishing, despite catching a fish or not, it would have been wonderful. Finally, the shopping was your typical souvenir shopping. I speak Spanish which helped a bit, but really everyone speaks English, some pushy, some let you be. Pretty typical. The hotel provided a taxi there, and we were to find a taxi back which was very simple as there are many. Concerns 1) Azul restaurant did not seem to be open any nights for dinner. This was apparently abnormal, but it did put a damper one night for us in which we planned to keep it low key and do buffet dinner. We showed up at Azul, but it was closed. We tried to make reservations afterwards, however as it was quite late by then (6ish) and as we had a 12 year old with us, we weren\u2019t able to find anything. The only option was suite service. It seems strange that there was no walk- in option for dinners. This happened to friends of ours on a different night as well (who also had children with them). 2) Again, the hours of the Azul restaurant seemed a little strange, as they did not open until 7 AM, however some excursions (such as deep sea fishing) needs you to be out before then. The suite service breakfast\u2019s first delivery is also 7 AM. That being said, the hotel is so accommodating, that I am sure if you told them this predicament, they would ensure you receive breakfast at the hour needed. 3) As I mentioned before, I speak Spanish. I am however, raised in North America and my family does not speak Spanish, so we were speaking in English during the trip. In 2 incidence, once on the beach and once in Azul restaurant, I caught some waitstaff saying some not so nice things about us in Spanish. Both times, this was brought to their attention and they apologized profusely. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I was a bit disappointed by the occurrence. This is no reflection of the hotel in general, as the overall service was superb, but the 2 incidences were upsetting. Overall, the hotel was extraordinary.

When we exited to the van we were greeted with cold water and cold towels. We checked into the Grand Class facility, which includes 24-hour concierge service and floor butler service. Our floor butler offered to unpack for us and provided us with everything we needed. Our floor butler asked what we wanted in the mini bar and for the rest of the week our mini bar was always stocked with our requests. The rooms: We had the top tier room, an Ocean Front Grand Class. The room was truly oceanfront with a complete unobstructed view of the ocean. The terrace was very large with super comfortable furniture and a private plunge pool. The bathrooms were luxurious, the rain shower was awesome and the Jacuzzi bathtub was plenty big for two and with lots of jet action. The Morton Brown amenities were very nice and there was a wide array of products including lip balm and an all natural mosquito repellent. Room Service: The room service menu was very extensive, room service was timely and accurate. The food quality from room service was very good, but there is simply no way that room service can ever match the quality of food at the gourmet restaurants on the property. However, if you are tired or just want to eat room service, it is extremely good! We only had room service twice because the restaurants are simply amazing! The Restaurants: The Bistro was our favorite restaurant for breakfast. If you like Mexican food, you will love the Bistro's breakfast menu! If you like really spicy DO NOT miss the house Habanero salsa, it's just so GOOD! Just about everything we ordered in any of the restaurants was served with a gourmet twist and an artful presentation; even the bagel at the Bistro was a work of art! Piaf, the French restaurant, is perhaps the best restaurant I have ever experienced. The food, the service and the ambience were all equal to the finest restaurants in the world! I have had $1000.00 dinners in New York City that weren\u2019t half as good as Pilaf! The strangest dessert that I have ever heard of turned out to be one of favorite; a chocolate tart with black pepper and veal stock and homemade ice cream, what a concept, but it was just extraordinary. Fortunately all of the desserts are served in very small portions, so try several. Azul is an all day buffet located by the main pool. There were a multitude of food choices that changed daily. We ate lunch at Azuls five times, and at various times of the day, the food was always fresh and hot. Although I am not a buffet lover, the food at Azul was extremely high quality with plenty of great choices. The first day we ate at Azul, I had lobster and filet, which were both extremely good. Like room service, I don\u2019t believe a buffet can equal freshly prepared and served food, but Azul comes close. I won\u2019t waste time reviewing all of the restaurants, just in closing on the restaurants, overall the service was exceptional, the presentation was artful, and the food quality was fantastic! The Pools: The main pool in the Grand Class facility is extremely large, the water temperature was wonderful, and the service around the pool was really good. There is a swim up bar on one side and a walk-up bar on the other side, so getting a drink was never a problem. In addition, there were a multitude of servers always willing to serve! There were plenty of chairs, but the hotel was only 40% occupied, so I don\u2019t know what it would be like during peak season. The pool was extremely clean, the view was fantastic, and the drinks were readily available. The pool in front of the Grand Class area was smaller and is adults only. This pool was virtually empty during our entire stay. The service was even better than the main pool due to the fact that there were very few people lying out around the pool. I got up to move an umbrella and one of the pool boys literally raced to my side and told me he was there to do what ever I needed and took over the task. The Beach: The beach is literally so clean you could eat off the sand; I have travelled the world but I have never seen a beach kept so clean. We were told that the beach is one of only 5 government certified beaches in Mexico. Every morning there was an entire crew cleaning the beach, and I am not exaggerating, cleaning the ocean water as well. Even the sand was special; the sand had a talcum powder consistency and seemed to always be cool to the touch. The Spa: If you like spas, you will love this spa! The Spa at the Grand Velas is one of the top rated in the world. The treatments, although pricey, are well worth it. If you can\u2019t afford a treatment or simply don\u2019t like massages, you MUST do the water experience for $60.00!!!! The spa is not only stunningly beautiful; it is just so refreshing and relaxing! Allow yourself at least 90 minutes to enjoy this area of the spa; I promise you it is well worth it! The Staff: I couldn\u2019t say enough about the level of service and the incredible attitude by every single staff member we met. Out of all the extraordinary staff members, Alexandro who works in resort activities by the pool really made our trip fun! He organized great volley ball games everyday, and is just a great guy! Although tips are not necessary as they are technically included, I still felt compelled to tip at every meal and to special staff members like our butler, and the pool guys! These people work so hard and are paid less than $30.00 per day. This hotel treats their employees better than many other employers in Mexico, but still the wages, although competitive, are extremely low. It was the staff that made our trip so wonderful; so again, I simply went out of my way to tip these great people. Some of the reviews speak about the difference between the \u201cJungle area\u201d and the beach area. The Jungle area is stunning in it\u2019s own light and is only a two-minute ride to the main hotel. Conversely, we had to take a two-minute ride to access the Jungle area, a few of the restaurants and the spa. The Jungle area is so unique; we might stay in that area on our next visit. It is definitely like two different hotels from the standpoint of ambience, but the service and the facilities are top notch. No matter where you stay on the property, you have access to all restaurants and services. If you want beachfront, you need to stay in the Grand Class area, but if you don\u2019t mind a short and readily available van ride to the ocean, then you might actually like the Jungle area better. The Jungle area has some cool walking trails, a better gym, a great pool, and a completely unique ambience! I thought this part of the hotel was just as amazing as the beach area! The Nightlife: If you are looking for night time activities, you will have to take a ten minute taxi ride into Playa. However, for us, we were happy to enjoy our days and take it easy at night. This resort is simply not for everyone, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that doesn't appreciate great service and food, or for anyone that is looking for a \"party\" atmosphere. This is a relatively quite and laid back resort that seems to cater to those with discerning tastes and a certain amount of refinement. In summary, if you can afford this hotel and are not looking for wild times, you will love it! I have stayed at a multitude of Five Diamond properties; this one was of the best yet! I still can\u2019t believe the quality of the food, particularly because it was an all-inclusive! All things considered, this hotel is a great value for the money. I can't wait to return!

My partner and I stayed for seven nights in early October and we will definitely be going back. First, we are in our 40's and tend to like small, quiet, boutique hotels, but due to the great reviews and all-inclusive value we decided to try Grand Velas. This was our first experience with all-inclusive, and now I doubt any other will be able to measure up to Velas. We compared with the Mandarin, Fairmont, and Banyon Tree all in Riviera Maya, and the all inclusive made this the better value (not to mention that after walking up and down the beach, Velas has by far the best beach in the area). After a week at Velas and seeing the others from the El Cameleon golf course, we know we made the right decision. We stayed in the Ambassador section and had a gorgeous view of the beach and ocean. The bedroom and bathrooms were very large and luxurious, marble and granite everywhere. The entire resort was extremely clean and quiet, and everyday workers were seen everywhere cleaning floors and windows, spraying for insects, painting, and repairing. We toured the Master class section and Grand Class, and those rooms were also large, it just depends on if you want to be in a quieter (Master-less expensive and not on the ocean) or more upscale (Grand Class-expensive) atmosphere. The pool and beach were beautiful and extremely well maintained. The beach was groomed every morning. We went at low season so it wasn't crowded, but there seemed to be plenty of loungers spaced well apart, and lots of activities available. The service at the pool/beach was fantastic. Always someone immediately providing an iced bucket of bottled water, and frequent checks for drinks, food, and raising the umbrella. The fitness center was fine, modern, new elipse and treadmills. Could be a little larger, it wasn't crowded when we were there but I could see having to wait for a machine in peak season. The food here is gourmet and outstanding. We ate at Freda (twice), Lucca, Sen Men, Cocina de Autor, and Azul for breakfast and lunch. Outstanding breakfast buffet at Azul. These resturants combined to make the best and most varied food of any resort we have been too. Try them all for different experiences. We couldn't pick a favorite because all were so good. The spa was excellent. Very expensive, but it has been rated as one of the best in world and lived up to the billing. There are almost too many choices in treatments, so ask at the spa desk to find out what would be best for you. We are active travelers who generally like to get off the resort and hike, tour, etc. But this time we really wanted to just have a \"read on the beach\" vacation, and Velas was perfect. We did play golf twice at El Cameleon Mayakoba golf course, which was a very nice course, not spectacular, but certainly I would play it again (twilight rate $135 per player). I would definitely recommend this course because of it's location to Velas, it's right next door and ony a 5 min. shuttle ride. We rented a car and visited Tulum, which was worth the time, but be warned, it's become very touristy outside it's entrance. Drove through playa del Carmen, but didn't stop because getting back to the resort was so much more inviting. The service at this resort is what REALLY makes it standout. From the minute we arrived the concierges, bellman, etc. were super friendly and nice. The waiters/waitresses at the pool and beach were so sweet and fun to talk to, while providing great service. We would give them a nice tip in pesos at the start of the day and be very well taken care for the duration of our time at the pool/beach. Even the maid service and repair guys who we saw everyday greeted us with \"hola\" and a warm smile. The resturant service was impeccible. The waiters and their assistants were always at attention and ready to serve. Room service was good, but the best food was in the resturants. All inclusive mini bar in the room was adequate, one day they didn't come by to re-fill it, but otherwise it was fine. The in room coffee was very good, we enjoyed it while relaxing in the morning watching the sun rise over the ocean from our balcony. The only two drawbacks to the resort were the in-room wireless service and the mosquitos in the evenings.. The wireless service was ok in the morning and at night, but spotty during the day. The resort seems to do everything they can about the mosquitos, even providing repellent in each room, but it's just a fact of life in that area. I'm sure every other resort in Riviera Maya has the same problem. It certainly would not deter us from visiting this wonderful resort again soon. We also sat through a sales presentation for time shares in order to get $150 off at the spa, but we certainly wouldn't do it again and thought it was presented a little bit misleadingly, as we were told it wasn't a timeshare sell, but it turned out it really was and we wasted 2 hours on it. Also, if you are into nightlife and partying this isn't the place for you. It has a couple of nice bars, but this is not an all inclusive for singles and partiers. Great place for families and travelers who want a quieter atmosphere. Grand Velas is a fantastic resort, I would highly recommend it, and we will certainly be returning there in the future.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sicklerville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAbsoluley Perfect Vacation~Thank you!\u201d", "Author": "BellalunaNJ", "ReviewID": "UR84123590", "Content": "I recenlty stayed at Grand Velas! It was an absolutely lovely time! We have stayed all over Mexico and the Caribbean and this was by far our best experience. I have to say that this hotel was top notch in all respects! We stayed in a Master Suite and it was magnificent. The staff at this resort was amazing! Everyone was on board with what was going on throughout the whole property. I have never stayed at a resort where the staff at the pool as well as the concierge and front desk knew what was happening at the resort.They carried a sheet around and they were all well informed with each days happenings. Excellent. No matter who you asked, they were able to help. We even made a reservation for a restaurant by one at the pool! AMAZING. Our suite was cleaned at our desired times and everything was always set up for us perfectly. Room service was ALWAYS on time and with a smile :) The service in the restaurants was excellent and the food was incredible. The service was OVER THE TOP our entire stay and the place was METICULOUS. Even the sidewalks were scrubbed down daily in the a.m. to keep them fresh and white. Even the restrooms off the pool area were delightful. ANGEL at the pool was a doll! as was the rest of the pool staff !There was never a time when they didn't go out of their way to make sure we had what we needed. We spent most of our day by the pool and beach and this was very important to us. CARLOS also made sure my selected location was all set and comfy and looking beautiful every day! All with a smile!

We had the most amazing experience, and we would love to share with you the reasons why the Grand Velas was so special to us. We booked the Grand Class section, seeing as it was a special occasion for us. Upon arrival (we recommend having the hotel book transport for you - it was $130 round trip, and we had our own private van with water and cold towels), we were immediately checked in and brought up to our room. They had arranged for fresh flowers in the room and rose petals in the tub, and it was absolutely gorgeous. We stayed on the 4th floor and highly recommend it as the rooms there have amazing views and vaulted ceilings. The room was very spacious, and we loved the bathroom, complete with a HUGE shower and jacuzzi for 2. There's also a walk-in closet, full of amenities like bathrobes, sandals, bug spray and a woven beach bag that we used every day. The resort itself is immaculate. There are gardeners who keep the gorgeous landscaping looking perfect, and there always seemed to be someone sweeping or cleaning as we walked around the resort. The pools are pristine, and HUGE! The main pool was probably our favorite, but if it ever got \"splashy\" from kids playing we'd head over to the adults only pool. We found the master pool on our second day and absolutely loved it. It's a whole other experience swimming around a pool in the lush jungle, rather than on the beach. The pool service was amazing - we never had to lay out our own towel, and they brought ice water and plenty of cocktails all day long. There are literally hundreds of lounges, double lounges, and beach beds for 2 to choose from. The service was probably our favorite part of staying at the Grand Velas. We were always greeted by name, everyone always says \"buenos dias\" or \"buenas noches\" to you, and the dining service was 5 star all the way. Some of our favorite \"friends\" at Grand Velas were Emmanuel, Diego and Alejandro at the main pool, Santos at the master pool, and Israel, Damian and Rufino at Frida restaurant. We really considered them friends by the end of our trip and were so happy to get to know them over the week we spent there. The next best part of Grand Velas has to be the food. This was our first all-inclusive experience, and we were SHOCKED at how gourmet the choices were. We ate at every restaurant once, and returned to Frida for a second visit because it was THAT good. :) Our favorites were probably Frida, Sen Lin and Piaf, and I say probably because it's really that hard to choose. Frida was the best Mexican food we've ever had, and the best service as well. Sen Lin was top-notch Asian cuisine, and I know what you're thinking - Asian in Mexico? Trust us, just go there. The tuna tartare and Peking duck were SUPERB. The food by the pool is great as well, we had ceviche nearly every day and loved the taco trilogy as well. They bring out several toppings for the tacos and you get to \"build your own\" right there by the pool. The drinks were fabulous as well - everything is top shelf. We drank Don Julio margaritas, Grey Goose martinis etc everyday. We thoroughly enjoyed the mango margs with Tajin (chili salt) on the rim. What a treat! A word on the spa: GO! We were a little wary of the spa prices after spending what we spent on the Grand Class...but we went anyway. It was our honeymoon for goodness sakes. We arrived and were whisked away to separate spas for the hour long water journey. We were a little disappointed that we couldn't do that together, and I have to say I was lonely being the only woman in the female spa, but I do understand why they separate those areas. Anyway, we spent an hour in steam rooms, ice rooms, clay rooms, whirlpools and bubble baths and then met up in our massage suite. The couples massage was to die for. It started with a foot bath ritual, a hand massage, and we got to select our own aromatherapy balms. The massage was amazing and I definitely recommend requesting Coral if you do visit. It was worth every penny and the facilities were just fabulous. There are a few things we'd like you to know about GV before booking: 1. Please bring cash to tip the employees. We found that they all worked so hard, and although they don't EXPECT you to tip, please do - they really earn it. We were under the impression you could always charge tips to the room, but if you want to tip the pool boys (who are awesome!), you need cash. 2. The restaurants are fine dining and therefore have dress codes. Please don't be \"shocked\" when a 5 star restaurant tells you you can't eat there in shorts, a tee shirt, and flip flops. We actually ENJOYED dressing up - so give it a shot and bring some fancy clothes with you. You have all day to lay around in your bathing suit, and dressing up for dinner can be fun. 3. Don't bring shampoo, body wash, a beach bag, bug spray, lotion or lip balm. They provide these in the room and they are all top-notch. Wish I would have known that - there would have been more room in our suitcase. 4. This hotel has little to no nightlife. We were fine with that - we were there to relax. If you're looking for a guy blowing a whistle in your ear while he pours tequila down your throat, try down the road at the Princess resort. On the other hand, if you are wanting to unwind while sipping fine tequila on a 2 person bed on a fantastic beach, and enjoy the sounds of crashing waves...this place is for you. 5. Do your research. I read a lot of reviews from disgruntled travelers who somehow \"didn't know\" that the master section is in the jungle. Um, hello, it says it all over the website. Not to worry, it's just a 2 minute air-conditioned shuttle ride away from the rest of the resort. And, it's really, really nice over there! We'll probably stay there next time since it's cheaper than staying beach-side, and you still get to use all the pools, restaurants and amenities that everyone else does. Why complain when you're saving money and get to experience the entire resort anyway? I'm sure there are a million other things I could mention, like the welcome bottle of Don Julio in our room, or the fabulous turndown service....but I'll stop here. If you have ANY questions about our trip I'd be happy to answer them. This place is worth every penny and then some, and I really do hope you'll check it out. We will be back for many anniversaries in the future, that's for sure.

The beach was closed off so the only people allowed in the vicinity of the hotel were hotels guests.

Our 14 year old was pretty bored and spent most of her time on the computers talking to her friends but she still loved the holiday.

Don't expect to carry your tray - they are right there to serve up the food and carry your tray to your table. The choices of wines and champaign were fantastic.

I chose this hotel after reading countless reviews on this hotel as well as many others: let me say this- it was fantastic and we can't wait to get back 1. we stayed in the masters section (the jungle section). the rooms were large, with tall ceilings (we were on the second floor), well appointed bathrooms and even our own nespresso machine. we were oriented to the room with our own concierge Arendy who was professional and super courteous. when we wanted to go to the beach, we would wait no less than 2 minutes to get the shuttle for the 2 minute ride. walking on the \"tiki\" style paths to get to our rooms was a nice touch to the whole tropical setting thing. 2. The beach was beautiful and normally, i would always chose a beach to hang out on rather than the pool. However, despite the beauty of the beach, the pool was even more spectacular so we camped out poolside during our stay. nonetheless, there were attendants on the beach who would set up chaises loungers and towels for you and bring you iced water. 3. the pool- the most beautiful pool i have seen. the water was cool enough to be refreshing yet you didn't get that \"shock\" factor when you went in. it is also the largest pool i've ever seen with plenty of little inlets to just hang out in. again, great service with the staff often walking by asking if you need anything. one day, we decided to order lunch poolside and had a great meal brought to us- a good alternative to dining at their poolside restaurant. 4. the food- plenty of offerings for the breakfast and lunch buffets. good combination of fruits, salads, (the ceviches were great), 8 different fruit juices and also more heavier entrees as well. the waitstaff will take your filled plate to your table for you...great and very attentive service. Lucca was our first dinner- good, not great but the service was wonderful . Frida- a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service and we found the food there to be more refined and consistent. 5. the service- overall phenomenal. water brought to us frequently at the pool (almost too much as i felt guilty drinking and not finishing all the water and found myself worrying about all those plastic water bottles being wasted). the \"tiki\" style paths leading to your rooms in the master's section were always clean without any debris, making you think someone was sweeping constantly where you weren't looking. we had mentioned to our concierge at checkin that we were going to a wedding the next day. well, that afternoon while we were getting ready, she called to find out exactly what time we needed to be at the wedding so that she could arrange for a cab for our family. i was impressed that she remembered that detail on her own ..... the rooms were very spacious and very clean and the wait staff everywhere were polite and courteous. in conclusion, a wonderful experience and we are all dying to go back. i went with my family (kids aged 20,12,and 9) and although there was a kids' club, they prefered to hang with us. it was a great place to regroup and be together. i know there is not much entertainment after dinner- it's quite quiet so this is NOT the place if you're looking for social activities or a partying atmosphere but if you want a tranquil, serene resort with high end amenities, this is it. we will certainly go back.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMost fabulous food, service, location, ever, for anyone!\u201d", "Author": "BackBayGrrl", "ReviewID": "UR77028320", "Content": "We travelled with our 18 month old and two grandparents, and I can't say which of us had the best time.

More relaxed, quieter, and looking out onto a jungle-fabulous river chock full of fish and colorful jungle flowers was much more romantic/fun than looking out at other people on the beach or pool. The pool and pool service were great, and there were shallow areas for kids. The kids club always had cute activities and shows going on. We did Zumba classes (a blast!) and used the gym. No problem with internet. Having room service as part of \"all inclusive\" was the best, when our little one would wake up early, or if we just wanted to relax \"at home\" with 4 star dinners.

Worth the crazy price of a massage because it includes an extra 1 1/2 hours of the most relaxing yet intense, beautiful water experience you could ever imagine in a spa. Run, don't walk there. I would go back as a romantic couple's vacation, would go again w/ the whole family, and our little one had the time of her life just running down the tiki-style walkways between room, restaurant, pool, and practicing her \"hola\"s with all the friendly staff.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING BETTER THAN I EXPECTED\u201d", "Author": "eog21", "ReviewID": "UR76694979", "Content": "The trip was a family trip we where celebrating a birthday.

While I liked the resort, I wish that I had read up more on the resort. The hotel complex is divided into two main areas, Master (jungle) and Ambassador (ocean). The two are not walking distance and require a 3 minute shuttle ride. When I booked my room with a jungle view, I thought I was in the same area as everyone but in a room that didn't face the ocean. If you are part of a group and want to be near each other, plan ahead. As a result, those of us in one area often opted out of events in the other area. The ocean and the best pool are on the Ambassador side. It would have been worth it to pay the extra $60 a night to stay over here. Also on Ambassador is a third area for adults only that if you are going on a romantic trip, stay here and away from the families. Speaking of, it didn't seem as if there was much for children to do if they didn't like the water. There are Kid's Club areas but the water is the place to be. Internet - I had a great wired connection 3 out of the 4 nights. People in the room next to me had zero connection. Others had weak wireless and we were all in the same building so my experience was good but others on the work trip were frustrated not being able to work. Our Blackberry's could receive but not send until the last day. If this is important to you, check your room or ask when checking in. Business Center - remember, you are not at a business hotel. A co-worker was frustrated when she needed to print and make copies of a presentation. If possible, bring everything you need with you. I noticed there was a Staples (or Staples-like) place in Playa Del Carmen if needed for business back-up. I had no mosquito bites from the jungle side but at an evening poolside reception, I ended up with quite a few bites so use the repellent that is provided in the room. (look in closet). I never saw bugs in my room or in the restaurants with the exception of the outdoor area where one table seemed to attract insects. The warning in the room says don't leave your door open but even with leaving it closed, a gecko managed to find its way into my room (and I assume back out again). All food is included so you have your choice of buffet in the morning, other restaurants in the evening, room service, and the mini-bar. I ordered room service coffee twice for breakfast and both times it showed up right on time, hot and tasty. A Nespresso machine is also in the room with several choices of pods. The room itself was quiet and comfortable. I loved the large size of the room. If I had more time, I would have used the jacuzzi tub, which a co-worker assured me was wonderful. As with everything, your experience is what you make it. This resort is quiet and secluded. If you are looking for a party scene and wanting to make new friends, this probably is not the place. If you want time alone with loved ones or family and want to stay on the property with the great pool and ocean and not think about meal choices, then you'll enjoy Grand Velas. My \"No\" on the recommend to a friend is simply because my friends will be looking for a more lively place where they can party and meet people.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding from start to finish!\u201d", "Author": "baszav", "ReviewID": "UR76277213", "Content": "My family (spouse / 3 children under 11 years old) recently stayed at the property for 8 days. We stay often at Ritz-Carlton and Regent type quality properties. Without hesitation, our vacation was outstanding due to the format, quality and execution of services at the Grand Velas. The combination of the decor, cleanliness, friendly service, terrific pools / beach location and high quality food puts this resort easily with other 5 star properties. We stayed in the Master section which is in the jungle area of the property. Although we typically prefer to stay near the beach (Ambassador rooms), we much preferred this location. Primarily due to the feeling of having two separate resorts within one property. The Master section restaurants and pools had a very quiet / zen like, intimate atmosphere. Shuttle service between the Master and Ambassador sections was painless. Our kids enjoyed the Master section pools as it was typically less crowded. I liked the drinks better at Master section pool (thanks Santos!!) as the pool bar bartender made it a point of introducing himself and offering us his signature drinks. Even my kids much preferred his fruit smoothies and chocolate ice milk. The Ambassador section pools were outstanding. Large, diverse with beautiful views of the ocean. And we could easily watch the kids play in the three-tiered pools from our lounge chair. Beach was beautiful and relaxing. When you go to the Grand Velas, take a walk on the beach and pass another hotel property. You will quickly want to return to the groomed sand and beach at the Grand Velas. Also, take advantage of the Coral Reef tour via sea kayaks with the life guard. Roman took very good care of our family. But the surprising highlight to the trip were the restaurants. Every meal was 5 star quality. After our first night dinner at Frida, we started looking forward to every meal experience. Even our young children enjoyed dressing up and going to the more formal restaurants. We live in the NY area and we frequent many fine restaurants in NY / NY area.

We enjoyed Spa treatments and gym and played golf at nearby Playacar. Transportation was organised very well and to our surprise we were not charged to be driven to Playa del Carmen in the evening.

We were struck by so many things, from the spacious suites to the lilly pads blooming outside them, but the sheer number of humans dedicated to perfecting our experience is the most remarkable. If there is one image that sticks with me it is the older gentleman stationed on one of the boardwalks constantly hand polishing the tree rinks that serve as pillars to suspend the thatched roof. To be fair he also hand-polishes the tree-branch hand rails and buffs the smooth hewn floor boards. I have to assume that as these structure wind in places through the jungle canopy they would soon be covered in spider webs and stray leaves were they deprived of his attention. His younger colleagues take on the tasks of grooming the lilly ponds and netting unsightly leaves from the cenote so we can better appreciate their natural beauty. I was perhaps most surprised when I strapped on my running shoes to take a jog on foot around the property, hoping to see some or the wildlife that flees from the ubiquitous passenger vans that shuttle us back and forth. As I stretched and set my GPS watch by the spa entrance a concierge stopped me and confirmed my intent to run. \"You must await your escort,\" he said. Really? Seriously? Oh, yeah. \"For your safety, sir.\" And so it was I ran my 5K through the property five to ten yards ahead of a pleasant young man on an ATV who handed me a water bottle and a towel when I looked on the verge of heat stroke. He even radioed ahead to the Ambassador bell station so that a bellman stepped forward with water as I rounded the driveway. It was like being the front runner at a marathon, but just me. The driver even fell back so I could try to run up on a family of coati mundi crossing the path. As a single dad I'm finding the Kids' Club critical to my mental health Nd my Children's continued survival. The staff there is tremendously attentive, functioing in two languages to provide children up to youn teens with an array of crafts, movies, video games, and live shows that appeal to all. My three children, ages five, eight, and ten, are no quite up to our two-to-three hour multiple-course meals in the hushed international dining rooms. They much prefer to order room service and retire to the Kids' Club for the duration. Were I to nit-pick I would have to do so with the eye of a chronic ingrate. The wireless phones in the room seem not to work. The food quality in some o the restaurants has been spotty, worse when the facilities were stressed last night by the arrival of a convention of computer manufacturers. But really I could not in good faith ask for a more holistically amazing experience, one which repeatedly leaves my children breathless with awe. From the endless breakfast buffet to the iguana-like lizards that take off running on their hind legs, the kids have found amazement everywhere they turn.

Only thing I would add is a little nighttime entertainment. Once dinner is over, there's nothing to do except go to the bar, which is not an option when you have kids. The kids play area is fine for younger kids, but my 11 year old wouldn't go anywhere near it. So, it was early bedtime for all of us.

We have been searching for a resort that offered outstanding service at a similar level to that offered by the Ritz-Carlton Resort at Rose Hall (Jamiaca). We finally found one! The service offered by the complete and entire staff here at the Grand Velas was unbelievably outstanding - from your very own Butler Concierge (made dinner reservations and changes, found a shoulder bag to use for an outing, made confirmation phone calls with our shuttle and tour companies, etc.) to the poolside staff, to the restaurant staff (top of the line), to the Spa staff......shuttle drivers....everyone! We were greeted by name all the time. Even the room service and housekeeping staffs were excellent. The resort has 3 \"sections\" - 2 on the beach and one \"inland\" (approx. 2 minute shuttle drive). We stayed at the \"Master\" location (inland, \"jungle/forest\" oriented rooms and pools). It was beautiful!! Each suite has its own \"private\" balcony area (ground floors have a \"moat\" and an optional plunge pool (extra pay)). The rooms are immaculate. The air conditioning in the suites works better/more consistent than any resort we've visited in Mexico or the Carribean. The restaurants are completely outstanding! Except for one restaurant dinner experience, they were all kept at comfortable temperatures considering the long pants requirement for men. The servings are small (as is with most high quality food restaurants) but it allows you to order more than one appetizer and still get dessert too :). The shuttle service on the resort is second to none. We took the shuttle almost every morning to the breakfast buffet, located at the beach, as well as to numerous dinner reservations, the sea-side pools (all infinity pools) and the beach. We were there for 9 nights - and never, once, did we wait more than 1-2 minutes for a shuttle. Most of the time they were \"right around the corner\" as we arrived at the pick-up locations (5 different spots on the resort). If you're a fine food and wine lover, this would be \"extra-expensive\" if you decided to \"pay as you go\" rather than using the all-inclusive package. The SPA - oh my gosh, the SPA. It IS expensive. At first, we weren't going to pay for massages as we normally do when visiting a resort but then we talked to another couple who had used the spa. After hearing about the 90-minute \"water journey\" PRIOR to the 80-minute massage therapy (and included in the higher-than-normal cost), we decided to try it. IT WAS AWESOME! Three hours of splendid relaxation and pampering. It was worth every penny (ALL of them....). We suggest that you stay at the Master section of the resort. It's a little less expensive, but it's quieter, the pools (all infinity pools) are not buffeted by the sometimes rough ocean winds, and it just seems a little more relaxed than the neighboring beach accommodations. Fave restaurants? Frida (awesome lamb chops) and Piaf (amazing venison dish) - (Mexican and French, respectively) Have a blast! We did. What DIDN'T we like? Wow....ummm...these are minor, but something that we discussed.... 1) if you're looking for \"nightlife\" ON the resort, there doesn't seem to be any, other than the great restaurants, a small piano bar (never actually heard one playing) and a Karaoke bar (except for the very first night, never actually saw someone performing Karaoke); last year, in Punta Cana, we had fireworks on the beach celebrating July 4th. This year? Not even a hint that it existed. Maybe it's because it's Mexico and not the Dominican Republic? 2) there is no daily \"resort newsletter\" describing the activities available for the day, nor did we actually SEE an activities \"board\", and was not even made aware of the availability of resort activities, until the very last morning we were there. 3) there is no PRINTED list of the wines that are inclusive with the meals; we don't like to choose our wines by the color (red or white) but prefer to look at labels and the kinds of wines that are available. This was made MORE difficult by not having a list from which to choose; 4) this is REALLY picky, but....for as great as the restaurant food is, the bread actually is not very good at all...with ONE exception - the awesome \"stuffed\" dinner rolls at Piaf that had Roquefort (bleu) cheese and walnuts baked inside the rolls; That all being said?

When we went (early March 2010) there were pretty much NO one in the pools (not a good sign). Water was COLD! This is where its sister property, Grand Velas in Puerto Vallarta has them beat (PV's location has perfect pool water temps!). 2. Massages, while nice, are way overpriced (nearly $300 for a massage...PV's location isn't even half the cost!) 3. This is a biggie- customer service/treating guests like valued clients in this area. This is the only thing that stopped us from booking our next trip w/ them. Why oh why would they do this? NO OTHER RESORT has ever done this to their valued guests....and everything was PERFECT (would've given them beyond 5* had it not been for this) until the last day. So, normally (they all do this: Sandals, Secrets Excellence, Grand Velas PV) when you check out & you have an afternoon flight, you just hang out at the resort, have lunch then go to the airport. At this location, THEY CHARGE YOU FOR YOUR LAST MEAL. REALLY??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? After spending $4-5K for a week's stay, you're going to nickel & dime your guests this way? Holy crap! We fought it and got our last lunch free (it was the principal)- but you should know that unless you have a flight first thing in the morning, either expect to pay for your last meal...or fight management to get it included. I'm sorry that is just plain obnoxious. We've done lots of travelling w/ all inclusives and I've never heard of this. Everyone I've told/asked who've done this type of travelling were outraged as well. On our shuttle ride to the airport (where we, as well as other guests were dropped off at the wrong terminal- another area they need to improve!), we asked the other couples in the van and they said they thought it was obnoxious to be nickel & dimed that way and they wouldn't return b/c of it....so I know we weren't the only ones who thought it was bad that the resort did this. I don't think it's fair to rate them 1* b/c of this (but b/c of this I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, as there are many other resorts that won't do this...so hope they change this lame policy), as everything else was great...but I do think that in all fairness to other travellers, you should know about this policy before booking your vacation so that you can either: 1. Book early departure flight 2. Be prepared to pay for your last meal 3. Be prepared to argue to get your last meal included 4. Choose a different resort that won't do this (and there are PLENTY out there!) 5. Not care about being nickel & dimed I heard that management reads these reviews....Please change this ridiculous policy of yours! What you'll find is that loyal travellers/guests will return...but hate to be nickel & dimed and we like feeling like you value our patronage. Is it worth it to alienate potential repeat customers over a $20-$30 lunch???? If they changed this policy, we'd return again. I'm a gal who's big on principals, so if they kept it same, that's the management's perogative, but I'd rather give my money to resorts that wouldn't do that, especially when I'm spending $4-$5k on their resort (not counting massages, excursions, gift shop, etc.). Don't be penny wise & pound foolish- Don't skip over $1,000 to save $1 today!! Another side note: they overcharged me on my hotel bill, and when I emailed them they didn't respond...and they didn't respond to my credit card company's attempt at contacting them either. Fortunately, the over charge wasn't that much so my credit card company gave me a \"good will credit\". This still reflects poorly on the resort. So just make sure you get your copy of your bill (like I did), b/c if you get overcharged, good luck getting them to respond to you....hopefully you'll get good service from your credit card co :) So now that you know this, here are all the nice things: Restaurant Workers/Housekeeping: very friendly, treat guests very well. Never had any problems w/ anything. Best service was at Sen Lin with Berto :) A++++ I will say, they do train their \"service\" workers very well (it's the management that needs to be trained better). A+/5* Rooms: Every suite is pretty much an ocean view (some partial). These rooms are very, very nice and it will spoil you! Loved our walk in closet...wonderful views. Very clean. Definitely first class. One of the best things about the resort (rooms are comparable to its sister resort in Puerto Vallarta, which we've been to multiple times as well. Sandals Resort rooms don't even compare). Nice amenities (slippers, bathrobes, bath salts, sea sponge, etc.). A+/5* Restaurants: Gourmet like- most of the restaurants are great. You won't be disappointed w/ anything. But warning: some of the restaurants do require long pants for men so pack a pair for your hubby. Also, even though the brochure said otherwise, the French restaurant will NOT allow men with (nice) sandals in. Totally dumb, they would rather have men wear nice slacks w/ white workout tennis shoes (yuck!)- so that's what my hubby had to do. The wait there for service is really long as well. For us the THREE BEST restaurants are Azul (ocean front for lunch & dinner), Chaka (for lunch) Sen Lin (for dinner OH MY GOD YUM is all I can say!). These 3 restaurants were all A+/5* The weakest was the french restaurant- slow/bland food. be prepared to sit there for 3 hours! Room service for breakfast was great too A-/4* Note: they make you sign (kind of like credit card slip) for each meal, and we heard a lot of people complaining that they felt it was like fishing for tips, which are supposed to be included. Personally, it didn't bother us. We didn't tip extra except there were a few workers that did do extra special things for us, so we'd give extra $20 at the end of the week as a special thank you (this goes a long way w/ them and they're so appreciative). But we never, at any time, felt like they \"expected\" anything from us. And we got pretty great service for the most part. TIP: during lunch/dinner at Azul, instead (or in addition to :) of eating the buffet they offer, request a menu and order from that. It's way better quality food! Also, they do have 24 hr room service, and you can request b'fast be served from your ocean-view terrace. Highly recommended! Pool: Very pretty, but horrible temperature. It's never a good sign when a resort's pools are empty! HEAT it!! C-/2.5* Beach: Pretty, but NOT as good as other Caribbean waters. C/2.5-3* Fitness room: They have 2- but smaller ones. They need more cardio machines. It's A/C w/ water bottles. Advice: do pre-dinner w/o when everyone's getting ready for dinner, it won't be crowded. Avoid mornings- you won't get a machine. C+/3.5* Grounds: Clean, well maintained. Didn't really see any bugs, etc. A-/4.5* Outside of the hotel...nasty, poverty stricken, etc. I also DO NOT recommend this as a place where you bring kids. Yes, they're allowed and the resort has some \"kid stuff\" (but hardly), but the restaurants are pretty much adult-themed- very nice, gourmet like. There were very few kids there; and they stood out (and not in a good way). I like kids, but for family trips, go to \"Beaches Turks & Caicos\" or something like that. The Spa: Very nice. But waaaaaay overpriced. If I ever went back, I wouldn't pay $300 for their massage. And it's ridiculous that if you want to use the spa w/o massage, they want to charge you $100 (other resorts let us use sauna/steam bath for free). Again, enough with the nickel & diming! B-/3.5-4* If I were managing this resort, I would: 1. Heat the pools 2. Not charge the lame \"entrance fee\" $100 for the spa (uuuh, that's why you're charging $4-5k/week 3. Not nickel & dime guests by charging them for the last meal 4. Make the nice restaurants adults only for dinner - ummm, screaming kids in an echo-y, gourmet restaurant doesn't make for nice romance! There are plenty of restaurants on site that can accomodate those w/ 'lil ones (buffet style, room service, casual). Please for the love of God, let adults who pay big bucks for a romantic get away enjoy a nice, quiet dinner. There were LOTS of annoyed looks on diners faces when the 1-2 families there brought unruly, bratty, screaming kids and ruined everyone else's meals. The resort itself is one of the prettier ones we've been to, but b/c we've been to several AI resorts & cruises, when we look at it from a value standpoint, overall I'd give it B/4*. Again, I think as long as you have this info. you can make an informed decision in booking your trip and not be disappointed. If you have any ?'s feel free to ask.

From breakfast buffets to dinner in the French restaurant, everything was excellent. There were a couple of mix ups on room service and the food was not quite as good as in the restaurants but it was still good. The rooms are large, clean, and have all the amenities you would need. The kids club was perfect for our kids. They loved going there and wanted to stay just about as long as we woud let them. There are tons of video games, movies, board games and the girls there did crafts with the kids too. We spent almost all of our time at the pool, on the beach or eating. The pool was great. Very large, nice swim up pool bar with great food and drinks. We played ping pong, water basketball, went kayaking and snorkeling (all included). Oh yea, and one night at the Kareoke bar after a few too many drinks. I am used to some other beaches with water that is more crystal clear. This water was fine but did have it's share of rocks and not so clear areas. I guess the only other thing to mention is the service. Let's just say if you like people at your side constantly then you will think the service is great. For me it was almost to the point of overdoing it.

Since that's an adults only resort we opted for GV to bring the teens. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are modern. The hotel has a lot of ocean frontage which allows all rooms an ocean view. We had booked a \"jungle\" room because I thought it was within walking distance to the beach, it is not. There are no trails to walk on so you have to take the bus, it is a short ride, but not worth it, so I changed to a room in the Ambassador or main building. There was an upgrade charge but it was my fault. First the pluses. Beach is very nice, ocean view rooms, modern rooms. The restaurants are beautifully designed and decorated. I felt like I was in a high end restaurant in New York each night, that nice. The food was consistently delicious in all the restaurants. Well prepared, presented and innovative. The service in the restaurants is very good. Now the minuses. Mexico is known for the friendlyness and service of its people. Last year in Le Blanc the service was so good that I recommended it to six friends that went that summer and they all loved it. I felt this time that people were not putting any effort. There was hardly a smile. There was little service on the beach. If someone would come and take a drink order they would never come back. Ice melts in seconds under the hot sun, after a few minutes the water bottles were hot and the ice was never replenished. Twice I ordered a drink in the pool after flagging someone down (no one offered) and once I was told that the bar had just closed and the other time the guy never came back and I walked to the bar and got it myself. Now, this may sound like nick picking but I am comparing this 5 star resort to another 5 star resort. And I want to emphasize that I tip everytime something is done for me (towl set up, drinks brought, taxi, etc) and I speak spanish so there is no excuse. Although there was a snorkeling class and a snorkeling tour offered by the hotel there was no snorkeling equipment available outside of these two activities so if you want to snorkle at any other time you have to have your own equipment. For a beach front hotel to not have snorkeling gear, even for rental, is ridiculous.

First let me state the resort looks just like it does on the internet, absolutely beautiful. The entrance from the street builds your anticipation, then you enter thelobby and it's refined, contemporary and comfortable. We were greeted with iced teas and cold towels, which was great. We stayed in the Ambassador section which is the \"Family area,\" however it was very relaxing. The poolside service was excellent most days (only 2 days I would rate average, where we had to flag down an attendant or wait an excessive amount for our order), the beach service was good as well. The planned activities such as trivia or snorkeling were not well attended by the resorts guests. My husband and I went to the kareoke bar one night and had fun (it was just the 2 of us in the place). I have to admit I did not want to be very active this vacation, I just wanted to rest and relax. My husband suggested a function in which the vacationer could observe versus being actively involved would be a nice touch. The maid service was very good along with the turn down service. We worked out several days and the class instructor, well let me just say, I was sore and aching for days (but that's exactly what I wanted-a good workout). We went into town one day, exhausting and hot (not for the weary). It was nice that the hotel pays for your taxi fare to town and you just have to pay for your return fare. Now for the most important part food and drinks: My restaraunt rankings: 1) Frida, 2) Cocina de Author, 3) Sen Lin, 4) Piaf, 5) Azul, 6) Luca and 7) Bistro. The food was comparable to any 4 star restaraunt for #1 - #5. The wine selection included in the all inclusive package was far more extensive than any other all inclusive I have visited. The coconut martini, guava marghretti and strawberry dacquiri were my absolute favorite cocktails. Luca was disappointing but only because the others were so good, it would compare to a Ramano's Macarroni or Olive Garden, not bad just average. The breakfast and lunch buffets at Azul exceeded my expectactions with taste, variety and appearance (better than any buffet I've been to).

After doing a ton of research we decided to book the Grand Velas and are so glad we chose this for our honeymoon destination. We did take advantage of the airport shuttle that the hotel can arrange for you, and our driver was waiting for us as we arrived. We were greeted at the gates to the hotel and were blown away by the entrance to this stunning resort, only to be more awed when we got to the lobby. We were greeted by name by the staff, handed a refreshing towel and a tropical drink. We were ushered to comfy sofa\u2019s to complete our check-in process \u2013 no standing in line at a counter here! We were shown to our room (320) which had stunning views overlooking the main pool and the ocean. The room was also beyond our expectations. Tasteful and cozy with a fantastic bathroom complete with Jacuzzi tub and Molten Brown products no less! I will comment that while we were at the resort (25th Jan \u2013 3rd Feb) the resort was very quiet \u2013 maybe 15% full so we had impeccable service and access to sun beds, beach cabana\u2019s etc with no problems at all, there was hardly anybody on the beach the entire time we were there! There was possibly more staff than guests which was very fortunate for us on our honeymoon to not be crowded by other people. Each floor has a concierge who can make dinner reservations for you and tend to any need you might have, this was a wonderful \u201cfeature\u201d that we took advantage of. We had never stayed at an all inclusive before, and were worried about only getting \"local\" drinks or only having food buffet style at certain times - not at the Grand Velas. You could order any food or any drink no matter where you were in the hotel, and no matter the time. If you want a midnight snack, they brought it to you. The mini bar snacks/drinks were also included in the price. All food and drink was \u201ctop shelf\u201d. Humberto the waiter round the adult infinity pool is a rock star! NOTE: We packed clothes that would have been fine in Hawaii, but frankly were a little bit informal for this place. My husband only brought one pair of khaki trousers and wishes he would have taken more slacks with him. Definitely slacks and shirt for men at dinner (not jeans), and a cute little cocktail/summer dress with wrap for ladies. More formal than cotton dress/flip flops. Our favorite restaurant was Freda \u2013 my goodness it was amazing. Gormet! The staff pour you custom cocktails at your table. The food was just fantastic (try the duck tacos and the bean cappuccino). The food around the pool was also very good and there are lots of options which don\u2019t\u2019 include French fries. The beach outside of this resort is nothing short of amazing. A huge expanse of soft white sand (that they wash down and clear every morning at 6am) that is peaceful and tranquil. We walked down the beach and boy, this was by far the best beach along the stretch (beware, crowds of boozy topless people down the beach to the right - about a mile away though so you couldn't see them unless you walked down the beach). We made friends with a travel agent from Chicago and asked her opinion on Grand Velas vs some of the other hotels and she said this was one of her top three she\u2019s been to. This is class all the way. One slightly disappointing note was that the hotel was empty and it would have been great to have gotten an upgrade \u2013 not expected, but when we found out it was so quite, what harm could that have done? Also, we had two pretty loud guys in the room next to us for a couple of nights, then a family with a noisy toddler for the rest of the stay \u2013 again, with the hotel being empty and knowing that we are a couple on our honeymoon, why would you put two single guys and a family with a small child in the room next to us? The staff is beyond friendly, nothing was too much trouble for anyone here and even though it was quite, I think you would get the same level of attention and service at any time.

We had a fantastic time, this resort is so luxurious! We had a 4th floor room in the Ambassador section which was great for the view and the high ceilings. The rooms were outstanding, lots of space, loved the jacuzzi tub! Our concierge, Monica, was very attentive and helped us make all our spa and dinner reservations. She also wrote us a note every evening to touch base about how our stay was going, very nice touch. Food was amazing! We tried every restaurant at least once, and made a second trip to Piaf and Sen Lin. Beautiful presentation of all the food, and outstanding, creative menus. We didn't have any trouble getting reservations. The dress code for the restaurants did cause us a little problem - they state \"no flip-flops\" but we were turned away from the restaurant one evening when my husband was wearing leather sandals that covered almost his entire foot (other than the toes). When he switched them out for sneakers there was no problem, but would have been helpful to have the dress code more clearly communicated. Our only other problem with the restaurants was during our second trip to Sen Lin. A huge group of people who all knew each other (they were there for a wedding) had made reservations (taking up 7 or 8 tables) and were all wandering around, shouting from table to table, and generally creating an atmosphere that was not appropriate for a fine dining experience. We found ourselves in the center of all of these people and it was a disappointment, especially since this was our last evening there. Perhaps the resort should discuss scenarios like this with large groups ahead of time, and offer to seat them in a separate area of the restaurant if many of them want to make reservations for the same restaurant. The pool was gorgeous. We spent four days lounging poolside at the large ambassador pool. The service was for the most part excellent, although some days we did have some trouble flagging down waiters. Loved the poolside food menu! We never had any trouble finding lounges. We didn't discover the Grand Class pool until our final day, but we would have spent some time there if we had! The Ambassador class pool did have some large groups there who got a bit boisterous! We made two trips to the spa, both for massages. The first trip we did the water journey which was really amazing. The service there was great, just like everywhere else in the resort.

I stayed at Grand Velas with my husband at a big event of the company he works for. We were amazed of the quality of everything there: the suites, the restaurants, the service, the spa, the landmark, the construction, the whole place .Grand Velas is a fine-exquisite all inclusive and consists of three thought-of buildings ( distributed in a huge landmark) and all of them are suites only. Master building is for families - including a \"children\u00b4s place\" with attention and amenities for them. It has beautiful swimming pools but no beach ( no problem as there are hotel vans just at every building lobby if you want to be transported anywhere through the property). Ambassador building is for families but not with small children, has beautiful enormous swimming pool and beach too. The third building is Grand Class, very exclusive ,for adults only ( guess it has at most 70 suites all facing the best beach of the Riviera)with a very nice swimming pool. Every buiding has its own boutique ( very fine things there), gym ,bars (there\u00b4s even a karaoke bar )and restaurant Specialty restaurants are also available besides the regular restaurants:. These are:french, chinesse, spanish, mexican. All of them are guided by the best in each speciality. For example, the spanish ( called cocina de autor) is directed by Mexic\u00f3 City\u00b4s chefs of Bico, a famous ( expensive) and delicious spanish restaurant. . Not a franchise, menus are designed by these chefs . We stayed at Grand Class and suites were really suites; a jacuzzi on the huge terrace where you can also have a nice breakfast through room service or just lay in the outside bed, a big big bathroom with a splendid shower,a jacuzzi and a dressing room too !. The room itself has a sofa and a 360\u00b0 TV so you can watch it from every spot ( the bed, the sofa, the bathroom).Amenities? you name them: great organic soaps, shampoo,conditioner, body lotion, great bathrobes, bed slippers etc and for the bathroom jacuzzi: bubble gel, bath salts, natural loaf.. And that\u00b4s not all: you have an espresso machine with 3 kinds of coffee, a bottle of tequila, apples and a very well equipped mini bar ( if you dare to have a snack after all the good snacks and food of the hotel). At the pool you have the in-pool bar where drinks and snacks are offered at your delight ( snacks are almost full meals !). . About the spa, someone mentioned it is ranked one of the 10 best and I have NO doubt about it. It is a separate buiding, to start with. Divided into men\u00b4s and women\u00b4s sides , each has a huge pool ( more than 40 meters large) with all kinds of hidrotherapy issues in it, from the strong back water massage to the \"water bed\" where you lay down and lots of water flows come from the base as to have a full body massage. Of course you have also a complete ritual of sauna, icetherapy, special showers(cold-hot) etc etc. On the upper part there are the massage rooms: beautiful rooms attended by true experts on the matter, with different kinds of body and face treatments . Just a delight for senses and body. The beach is a dream. This hotel has half a kilometer long beach with that caribbean esmerald water that goes to you waist after a long walk through Don\u00b4t forget that there are also many activities to do in the sorroundings: explore Xel-ha. Tulum, Xcaret, swim with dolphins, Xplor etc etc . better stay for a whole week if you decide to go. I am proud to be mexican and have this kind of hotel owned and ran by mexicans.

The property is beautiful and meticulously kept. We were very happy with our Ambassador suite (#2202), which was large and comfortable in addition to having an ocean and pool view. If you plan on staying at the Grand Velas, I would recommend staying on the 2nd floor of the Ambassador suite complex, since the rooms are larger than on floors 3-4, and you have more privacy than on the 1st floor. Moreover, the corner suites have a wonderfully large shower. Nonetheless, I do not recommend staying at the resort, having been disappointed by too many service issues. The resort did not live up to the standard of elusive luxury that one would expect based on how it presents itself and its prices. Simply put, you do not get your money\u2019s worth. 1. Months prior to arrival, we were told by the wedding planner that since we are part of the wedding party (my sister-in-law was the bride), we will be getting an upgrade to the Ambassador suites. Upon our arrival, my sister-in-law reaffirmed the upgrade. Nonetheless the front desk had no record of the upgrade. Despite the fact that my sister-in-law had told us in the presence of the clerk not two minutes earlier that we are getting an upgrade, the clerk insisted that we are not registered at the much nicer Ambassador suites and claimed that we would have to pay the difference if we wanted to move. It took the administration an hour and a half to sort this mess, despite the fact that both my sister-in-law and the wedding planner had print outs of the wedding guest accommodations that were sent by the hotel, clearly showing that we were to receive the upgrade. We were bound to the lobby this entire time, and by the time we were shown to our room and were able to change, the pool was closed, as were the pool-side bar and restaurant. When I went to complain to the shift supervisor about the whole check-in process (or lack thereof, to be precise), all she saw fit to offer as compensation was to help me make a reservation at one of the hotel restaurants. I found this offer to be absolutely ridiculous since (a) it didn\u2019t address my compliant, (b) I doubt I would have had any problems making a reservation at any of the restaurants as the resort was not full and (c) I had already told her that my sister-in-law had made reservations for us for that evening. As a side note, it would later turn out that we were far from the only wedding guests who would have some problem with checking in \u2013 with either their upgrade not appearing on file or with their reservation not appearing altogether. I would note that all mistakes at check-in were one-directional, namely nobody received an upgrade that they shouldn\u2019t have, or a better than agreed upon rate\u2026 2. We were told that each floor at the Ambassador suites had a butler that would tend to our needs. I never saw the butler throughout our stay, though to be fair, I didn\u2019t need his/her services. 3. Not a single item in our minibar was ever replenished throughout our stay. 4. I was very excited to use the beautiful and very large shower in our room, only to encounter barely lukewarm water during our stay. 5. The hotel runs on generators and the switch from one generator to the other is not seamless, resulting in at least two short black-outs per night (one around 8 pm and the other at 10:20 pm), which can be disruptive. 6. Pool-side service was hit-or-miss. There were numerous times that I had to remind a waiter of an outstanding order, and during our last day, I had to chase a waiter down to get his attention after being ignored for half an hour. All this despite the fact that the resort was not nearly at capacity and there were relatively few guests around the pool. Nonetheless, the staff always provided service with a smile and the food and drinks were excellent. 7. Food at restaurants \u2013 let me start by stating that the chefs and staff were very accommodating to our unusual requests and made sure that our customized needs were met. My one disappointment was that plain yoghurt was nowhere to be found. I recognize that this is a minor issue, but I do love my plain, unsweetened yoghurt for breakfast and would have really enjoyed mixing in all the spectacular and delicious fruit that was offered. 8. The ocean view is beautiful, but unfortunately, the ocean is not really conducive to swimming. The water protected by the barriers is roughly knee-deep, and much of it is covered with pointy rocks. Of course this is not a Grand Velas-specific issue, but if you go to close-by Cancun, you do not have this problem. 9. The gym at the Ambassador suite complex was ok, but nothing to write home about. The master suite section had a larger gym, but I did not want to take a sweaty ride to and from my work out. 10. While the resort is advertized as an all-inclusive, we were brought a bill at the end of each meal at the restaurants. We had the feeling that this was meant as a way to ask/pressure for tips, since the bill always had a line-item with the price of the meal followed by another line item showing a 100% discount for the meal and then a line item for tips. However, the wait staff continued to be gracious and accommodating despite the fact that we did not leave a tip after any of our meals.

Second, we were here for a wedding. The reception was at the same location as the Master Suites in the Jungle about a mile from the main resort. We found it to be just as amazing and would have been very happy to have stayed at that part of the resort. The shuttle was not a issue at all unless you are the most impatient of people. Literally no wait what so ever. Things we LOVED: Service was the best I have ever encountered and I travel every week for work all over the US. We ordered room service often and it generally took about 30 mins. Our room was always clean and neat. The resort was kept impeccable. Feel free to check out our many photos. My wife is studying photography and we thought there are some great ones of the property. Restaurants were good to great. This is our first all inclusive resort so I don\u2019t have a lot to compare it to. If I was paying for the high end \u201cFRIDA\u201d restaurant separately I may have been disappointed but never felt cheated. All the other restaurants we felt were above average to great, especially COCINA DE AUTOR! I wish there (included) wine choices were in line with the meals. The wines were crap that came with the meals. Our room service meals were way above par and I will save you some time. If you have had too much to drink from a long day at the pool, the skirt steak was perfect pre-hangover meal. The pool is exactly like what is on the website if not better. Amazing photos of all our friends and family were taken. The afterhours spots (karaoke bar, piano bar, etc) were ok but it may have been better if there were lots of other people at the resort. We actually liked having it to ourselves and when we did really want to blow it out, we headed to 5th street in playa. A great time was had by all that were with us. Finally, my only points to improve upon (and I am nit-picking here) are that the toilet paper could use an upgrade to some top shelf Charmin and the towels were not that soft. Especially if you were slightly sunburned. Outside of those two things, a truly amazing trip and I will not give another perfect rating to another hotel until they can top it! We will probrably return in the near future.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA tremendous resort, but........\u201d", "Author": "walkersjct", "ReviewID": "UR62707554", "Content": "We spent 5 nights at the Grand Velas (mid April), our first time anywhere in Mexico. We seemed to hit a low week shortly after Easter and the weather was very mixed with three days of high wind and rain.

Having travelled extensively throughout the world I have to say the Grand Velas resort is really up there with the best of them. As many others have commented on the food quality I won't go into detail, but I feel it fair to say many of the restaurants are on a par with close to the best Manhattan can offer. A tip on rooms. If staying in Ambassador class, ask for a 3rd or 4th floor room for the wonderful view. The main pool in the Ambassador area, by the beach is stunning, and the beach itself is lovely. Just wish we could have got more use out of it. The staff everywhere were extremely professional and seemed to hit the right balance between friendly yet not overbearing. Slight drawback - if you have teenagers, or are yourself younger adults looking for more nightlife, bear in mind, this a high end luxury resort. Once dinner is over it gets pretty quiet, or at least it did whilst we were there during a low occupancy week. I would strongly recommend this resort for couples or groups looking for a high end vacation with outstanding dining.

This hotel was a full one to two stars above even the nicest places we've stayed in Riviera Maya (Play Del Carmen). The service was simply spectacular. ALL employees were warm, kind, and helpful. When you get to the pool or beach, within 2 minutes tops you are greeted with towels (no towel cards!), assistance in getting them placed on chairs, getting your umbrella positioned, a bucket of iced bottles of water, and Evian spritzers. We used the 24 hour room service often as we were with two toddlers who have early bedtimes. Early breakfasts in the morning, and always a bucket of Coronas or whatever we chose for an evening on the deck relaxing. The Kids Club was excellent for our 4 year old. We return to Mexico every year for the beach and weather. Our mantra is always \"Mexico - it's not about the food.\" Well this resort was an exception to that. The food was just excellent. Service outstanding. I am a connisseur of spas. This spa was WORLD CLASS. The best massage ever, the water treatments and aesthetics specatcular. A word on the \"Master Class\" vs. Ambassador Class. Yes the Master class is a full mile away from the beach. But for about $800-1000 a person less, I felt Master Class was the way to go. The Master class is very peaceful, with a different ambience of wooden boardwalks surrounded by gorgeous foliage. The Master class has amazing infinity pool area which is smaller, but luxurious and quieter than the main pool and beach -- and the service was even better there than at Ambassador (perhaps because there were far less people). The Master class had a Kids' Club. And of course the spa! But any time you are only one minute ride away from Ambassador, and we enjoyed both facilities. We never waited more than 2 minutes (if we had to wait at all) for the transportation. And if you are traveling with small children, it's actually kind of nice to get a ride to the beach so you don't have to haul your stuff.

It is not the place if you are looking for constant entertainment or any kind of nightlife. Among the highlights were: - We stayed on a 4th floor room overlooking the pool and ocean. Beds are comfortable, bathroom was spacious, nice terrace with an outside bed, and amenities such as ipod dock, free wi-fi, and a large wall TV. - The pools are large, heated / non-heated, swim-up bar, and with great lighting at night. The procedure for chairs is to find one of the pool attendants (Guillermo and Carlos were great), ask them where you want to set up, wait for them to place the towels, and just leave a few personal belongings like shoes or magazines. After the second day, the attendants will know who you are and just ask for the same or different location. Same method applies to the beach. - The beach has very fine white sand and it is long, but it is rocky as you walk into the ocean. There are some sandbars that you can walk to and just hang there. If you want a bigger beach where the kids can use boogie boards walk south to the Princess Hotel beach and it is definitely less rocky and they get waves - but the crowd and vibe is different than the Grand Velas'. - The food is just great. Following tips from other TA reviewers, we reserved online a different restaurant every night. You will get a confirmation number by email and if not just give them a call. They are all good restaurants and they each have their specialties - try them all. You will be amazed about the decorations and ambiance of some of these restaurants, including the bathrooms!! But believe it or not, my favorite restaurant was Azul which serves breakfast and lunch w/o reservations. The choices and quality of the food were just stupendous; don't forget you can also order a-la-carte (try the garlic grouper and ask for Omar as a server). Another pleasant surprise was that the mini-bar and room service are very good too. - If you want to have a different spa experience, you must go to their spa. Their \"water experience\" is unique and wait until you see their pool and steam room - truly world class. As a side note, we went to the \"time-sharing\" presentation which lasted an hour and got a $150 spa gift certificate and a voucher to go back for 3 days and 4 nights w/o food. Of course, there are a few things that could improve in this idyllic place: - After check-in, nobody really told us about the resort layout, daily activities, or any information that could have been helpful. The \"butler\" probably worked behind the scenes but we only saw him smile when we came out of the elevator and he filled out the mini-bar. - They need to improve on their water activities: the scuba boat was borrowed and old (but the scuba equipment was new and dive masters were great), their jet skis are from an outside vendor and are always late or no-shows, and the water activities desk is a couple of guys sitting under a shaded tent. - The boutique is nice but way overpriced. Don't forget your sunscreen because it will cost you at least $20. This resort is definitely one of the best that we have stayed in. It has been open since late 2008 and it is receiving accolades by the minute.

At the recommendation of all of the reviews here, we decided to give it a whirl. We were NOT disappointed, and even incredibly impressed. First, let it be stated: someone at the Grand Velas did their homework: you are acknowledged by EACH employee as you see them, and the employees are extremely conscientious about ensuring that your needs are totally met. Very reminiscent of the 4 Seasons mentality. The employees are also extremely hard-working; always smiling and incredibly gracious. A nice departure from some of the attitudes we've experiences in the Caribbean. They seem genuinely interested in ensuring that you have an enjoyable experience. Secondly, the food is truly consistently delicious and beautifully prepared. From the (gasp!) buffet, Azul to the adults-only restaurants, our party of 8 was never disappointed in our meals. They were diverse and exceptional. Frida, Sen Lin, and Bistro getting raves from all of us. Lastly, the rooms and grounds are immaculately kept. It is a constant delight to the senses; the landscaping alone is amazing. The one and only criticism we would have would relate to the timeliness of dinner service. While the feel is distinctly European,when you are dining with small children, time is most definitely of the essence. We love to be pampered and savor our experience, but less enjoyed with young ones who are literally falling asleep at the table (at 8:30!) We ALL thoroughly enjoyed our stay and immediately discussed when we could come back. A tip to others: take a day to go hang out at the Master Class pool...we literally had the entire pool to ourselves until lunch.

We've never stayed in an all inclusive (except a private island) because we've been skeptical of the quality of food etc. at any of them. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised. Generally, the service was outstanding, but in the last paragraph, I have a couple of suggestions that could make it even better. These would not be difficult to implement, but management has to want to. First the strengths: This resort is world class at the fundamentals. The room, resort layout, service, attitude of employees and even the food were outstanding. The Spa was second to none. For the most part, the \"attitude\" of the employees was one of, \"what can I do to make you feel like you are in a luxury resort.\" I could go on and on about these, but others have so I'll just give a couple of examples: During all services, they \"hand you off\" by introducing you by name to the next person. Even checking in, at the gate, they notify the reception you are coming so they are ready for you when you arrive. Hostesses, introduce you to waiters, the Locker guy introduces you to the masseuse, etc. At dinner (at the fancy french place), my wife was having difficulty choosing between two appetizers and two main courses, so the waiter suggested making it 4 courses with 2 half portions of each or as many of anything we wanted. And, this was with well prepared french food with a very nice ambience. Not what I expected. Note: The food is not quite what you would find in a true world class restaurant with a renowned chef, but you feel like you are in a place like that. The improvement opportunities or recommendations: Overall, the \"activities\" function at the resort is the one area that could use some work. My first \"let down\" was when I asked to use snorkeling fins for my children. They had a box of them in the activities area by the pool. They told me no, not unless I take a (paid) snorkeling tour. We travel with our kids mask and snorkel but the fins are too bulky to travel and they always seem easy to find. In this case, they would not loan, rent or sell me a pair and they had a whole cabinet full. So, I tried the gift ship where there were none their size. My only option was to get a cab, and go to town to buy some and lose half a day, so my kids swam around the pool and on the beach without fins. After all the great service we had had, to be held hostage to a snorkel tour to use fins was frustrating. The second time came when I tried to get a hobie cat. First, many if not most all inclusive advertise free non-motorized water sports, but here you must rent them. I'm pretty sure the water sports outside are run by an outside firm, but for a resort like this to out-souce beach activities causes them to lose control over the quality. My issue was I wanted to \"rent\" a sailboat and there was one on the beach but there was not a skipper to check me out. I've been sailing all my life, but I understand that they wanted to have someone check out a renter. However, if that's the policy, have someone there to do it. I understand that most All inclusives offer non-motorized water toys as part of the package...Not here. They implied on the phone that they don't have sailboats but you can get them \"down the beach\". In fact the rental company is located at the bottom of the steps out of the resort to the beach. The third Issue we had was just around communications about activities. We just happened to find out there was a magician and dinner on the beach because my wife went up to the front of the resort for something. We didn't even know until the 5th day that they post things up front. As it turns out the magician didn't show up or the time was wrong or something but we did see a band on the beach that we enjoyed. As far as I know, that was the only real outside entertainment the whole week we were there, but we didn't know where to look so there could have been other things. So, in a nutshell, the recommendations are: 1) Benchmark other resorts water activities and I think you will find that investing in some hobies and other non-motorized water toys would improve the experience. 2) Try to book some more activities, and even more importantly, find a better way to notify guests when something is going on. The \"activities\" board by the pool, has the same things on it every day ( e.g. ping pong at 3). We assumed that since there was nothing added there was nothing going on. Summary: This is a very good resort and with a little focus on improving the quality and communication around activities and water-sports, it could be a great resort. Sorry that the length of the negative is longer than the positive, that is not proportional to the experience, but I believe you need this feedback to get even better!", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Gibson, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cRelaxation Paradise\u201d", "Author": "soonerservant", "ReviewID": "UR60199512", "Content": "My wife and I recently travelled with a large group to Grand Velas Riviera Maya. We had also stayed at the Grand Velas Nuevo Vallarta last year, and had enjoyed it so much we were anxious to stay at this property. In both cases arrival was very pleasant. You receive a moist scented towel for freshening up after your journey and a delicious glass of flavored tea. We were escorted to our room by Ariana, our coincerge. From reading the website, I was under the impression she would serve as a type of butler. She was very pleasant, but we never saw her again during the week. However, I did speak to her on the phone and she arranged a change of time for a restaurant for me, and I was grateful for that. On another evening, she could not get the time changed. We were very hungry after not eating lunch on the plane, so we ordered room service. We decided a shrimp cocktail would tide us over until supper. The shrimp were huge and delicious! Typical of Grand Velas, but not many other all inclusives. Service is always terrific, although on occasion there are a few miscommunications because of language differences. The check presentation is, as discussed in many reviews, an inconvenience. Since they ask for your room number when entering a restaurant, or at the pool, there is no need for a check. At the pool, we did not receive a check every time, but everywhere else we did. I am always glad to tip exceptional service, but it is supposed to be included in the price, and part of the all inclusive concept is that, well, it's all inclusive. But, this is a small distraction, and obviously we enjoyed it so much that we returned to a Grand Velas property. The vast majority of the staff is over the top outstanding! You run into a rare server, we had only one, who never returned with our drink order, who doesn't give it their all. The most common experience is that every server takes tremendous pride in their work and work extremely hard to please in every way. \"Is okay Senor?\" \"Can I do anything else for you Senor?\". Just tremendous! And the food? I can only say that the critics of the food, talking about eating in Manhattan, etc. are in my opinion, people who just can't be pleased or are overly full of themselves. I've eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, and Grand Velas is world class! We enjoyed them all but especially loved the food at Piaf and Lucca. Cochina de Autor is also one of the most creative cuisines that we have enjoyed and ate there on my birthday. The chef made a special dessert for that occassion and the guitar player played \"Happy Birthday\". We were in desperate need of some relaxation, and this resort is perfect for that. We were delighted that there was not a lot of loud nightlife going on. We could relax on our balcony looking at the lights of Cozumel listening to the waves and enjoying room service and the fully stocked mini bar.

Both families have visited Mexico on prior occasions, and for us, this was our 5th opportunity to stay in an all-inclusive in the Playa del Carmen area. Since we like to try new resorts on each stay, we spent much time researching various resorts and frequently reading and relying on the prior posts of past visitors to the Grand Velas Resort & Spa. While we all had a wonderful time, there are some specific experiences of our stay that are worthy of comment. First of all, the resort is absolutely breathtaking - from the moment you approach the resort off the main highway, to the beautiful and spacious rooms, to the pools, restaurants, and grounds. We were amazed at the cleanliness of every area of the property - great care is obviously taken to ensure the best upkeep. We had rooms in the Master Class section, and check-in was smooth and efficient. At first we were considering possibly upgrading to the Ambassador Suites, but we came to appreciate the quiet solitude of the Master Class section. True, you need to catch a van for the 2-3 minute ride to the main, Ambassador Class building, but the vans were always prompt, never waiting more than a 2-3 minutes at most. One problem we noticed with this separateness in facilities is the lack of a walking or jogging path between the buildings. This distance makes for a perfect walk or run, but the roadways are only wide enough for the 2-way traffic of the vans, and if one chooses to walk or jog between the two buildings, they must be followed the entire way by an ATV for safety purposes. This essentially backs up traffic on the road, and can take travelling from one building to the next much longer, as passing isn't always possible. Poor design. The Master Class rooms were spacious and clean, and we enjoyed the quiet beauty off our patio overlooking the lush flowers, foliage and small stream. We would rate the food at both the buffets (Chaka and Azul) and the restaurants as absolutely amazing. From the moment we arrived, we were shocked at the selection, freshness and quality of the food and beverage in the buffet areas. Dining at Frida, Piaf, and Cocina de Autor were all wonderful experiences, with a tremendous variety in food and decor. Service was very friendly and prompt. As the dining experience and quality of the food was probably highest on our list of positive experiences for this resort, this area of the Grand Velas also provided us the most disturbing experience throughout our stay. Others on this site have also negatively commented on this issue as well, and it is the fact that at EVERY meal, whether at the buffet, poolside, in a bar/lounge, or in the restaurants, you are presented with a \"check\" at the completion of your service. Management's response on this issue on other posts has described this as \"internal control\" and presents an \"opportunity for guests to leave a tip.\" Having visited a number of other quality all-inclusive resorts in the area in the past, we have simply never run into this practice. Here's the situation - upon entering a restaurant or buffet, you are greated by the hostess who records your room number and number of guests dining (which should suffice for \"internal control.\") You are then are seated and formally \"introduced\" to your server. Since many of our meals were breakfast or lunch in the buffets, we required little in the way of wait staff assistance. However, before you may leave, you are presented with a check, indicating the \"hypothetical\" charge for the meal, a line for the inclusion of a tip, and a signature space. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, at first we were a bit confused to see a charge presented. Quickly, however, we figured out the rub - this is beyond \"an opportunity for guests to leave a tip;\" in our opinion, it was downright distasteful. Guests at any all-inclusive resort may always choose to leave a tip for good service (and we typically do), but being presented with \"hypothetical\" and often exagerated charges was unnecessary. I would strongly recommend the resort management revisit this practice, as it makes for an uncomfortable all-inclusive experience. Other visitors have commented on the lack of nightlife at the Grand Velas, and this was unfortunately true. Not only is there no nightlife, it's challenging even finding one of the bars that remains open past 10:30 pm. Each of the bars begins closing down around 10:00 - 10:30, and as we found out the hard way, the only lounge remaining open past 11:00 was the Karaoke Bar. Not very pleasant if you're looking for a nice bar or lounge area to sit and relax or carry on a conversation. Would be nice if there was a casual lounge that stayed open later in the evening.

The spa is as superior as everyone has rated previously - enjoy the water journey ahead of your treatment, relax and enjoy the moment. Best spa I'ver ever experienced!

What an incredible experience. This was our first time staying at an All-Inclusive. We were a little concerned about the all-inclusive part!

The spa was the most amazing spas I have visited, the spa staff were second to none! The restaurants were all fantastic, Sen Lin and Piaf being our favorites. The activities for the boys were great, they loved the soccer on the beach, the volleyball, ping pong and the water polo - they did it all! All our concerns were very quickly wiped away and we had a wonderful family holiday. We will for sure recommend this hotel to everyone! We stayed in the jungle section and really enjoyed it but next we would like to try the beach side! Even the pool restrooms were impeccable! Thank you to all for a lovely holiday! We will be back!

The room service may forget the hot milk or something, but honestly, all that is right is so perfect that the little stuff is irrelevant. We had a wonderful time for a week and I cannot imagine a better value for the fabulous quality you get there. And the kids club is so awesome, its run by caring ladies, they do arts/crafts (really good stuff like sewing and making bouncy balls), my kids watched a magic show, a puppet show, a circus, a competition ... and they had the option to watch tv or play the wii, but chose not too!!!! I wanted to bring the women home with me. And the fact that for an all inclusive price they will watch your kids from 9am to 11pm is just ridiculously great... we went out for fancy dinners every evening without a hassle, when the kids had a question, they located us and asked us, it was wonderful. The suites are nice sized, the only thing I wished for was a suite with two rooms, not one big one, but that worked out fine too. I was waking my kids up at 6am to go to the beach with me, the beach was so fabulous and nearby and clean, the pools intelligently laid out, the service was great with somethings missing, but overall very good. Bottomline, it was absolutely not a cheesy all-inclusive one would have imagined ... my only issue was that many people expected tips, the checks all had a column for tipping and I was a bit unhappy because being jaded NYker, I was already tired of every single human being in NY asking for a tip, I thought the tips and taxes were all included, but in the end, we tipped some exceptional people and didn't the others ....

First, the rooms, pools, restaurants, and spa are immaculately decorated with great attention to detail. I especially appreciated the d\u00e9cor in all of the restaurants. They compare to any nice restaurant in which I've eaten all over the world. The resort is truly lovely and a step above all of the resorts in Mexico that I have visited to date. Second, the food and drinks were delicious. The entire meal at Sin Lin was my favorite, but the mango margaritas at Frida were also hard to beat. I especially appreciated the attention to detail in all of the restaurants from beginning with the amuse bouche to ending with the cordial and desert wine cart. Third, our visit at the spa was the best spa experience I've had to date. The water journey with the saunas, steam room, and journey pool are a wonderful addition to any spa treatment and really take the spa experience to the next level. Finally, the staff was incredible. Every person we interacted with was friendly, professional, and very attentive. I especially want to mention Humberto who served us at the pool every day. Humberto was by far one of the most attentive and friendly servers I've ever had. He constantly checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed and made our stay that much better. I especially appreciated that he found out it was my birthday and had a cake delivered to the pool for a celebration. Humberto was amazing and we were very thankful to have him. I also very much appreciated Guillermo for letting Humberto wait on us and for waiting on us when Humberto was not around. Guillermo was also very friendly and attentive.

Our family visited in February and it was our first time visiting Mexico. Honestly, I never felt the desire to visit ,however, we had friends that stayed in the Rivera Maya and raved about. it. So, after much research we deciced on Grand Velas. We don't have a negative word to say about the resort. We were so happy that we chose this resort as it was so beautiful. Every inch of the property is kept immaculate. The pools are not only gorgeous and beautifully designed but they are placed so the sea view is exceptional in the Ambassador and Grand section. The pool at the Master section was so gorgeous and relaxing as well. With wonderful views of the jungle trees, shubs, flowers and wild life. I get annoyed when anyone says the food is not good. I feel it is an injustice to Grand Velas ,the chefs and waiters who put their pride and joy into serving each and every guest. The food was more than upscale and delecious. Maybe it sutied my families taste more then some people but we had every choice in the world. So anyone who cites it wasn't good really mystifies me. When I told my kids age 9, 13, 14 there was some neagative reviews about the food they thought it was crazy. The fish prestentaion of sushi and cerviche every lunch was out of this world. The variety was out of control. The service in each restaurants and food was so enjoyable. We stayed for 6 nights and never ever had one meal we did not like. You are drawn to smile when each time you approach a restaurant the staff makes sure they open the door for you. If you carry a plate back from the buffet at lunch or breakfast the staff makes sure they carry it for you back to your table.(If you dont want to have buffet at breakfast or lunch there is a full ment to order a-la-carte). Incredible because at times we ordered from the menu and still had the buffet to choose from whether it was salad to dessert. At each meal to start a waiter made sure you were given a cloth napkin and placed in on your lap .They never touched it with their hand but used a tong so they would never get it dirty by their hands. It goes on and on. The pool service was spectacular . They work so hard and have every guest in mind to please. We even loved room service because the rooms were so gorgeous you didn't mind staying in for a meal! The meals were served with white table cloths and napkins and were superb! Our concierge Ana was more then exceptional. She was there for us every day and made sure she found us to confirm golf tee times, spa and dinner reservations. She made our stay easy and relaxing even changing jet skiing times for us due to rain!! Awesone job! We loved Grand Velas on every scale. Rooms, service, food and beautiful grounds. Everyone should go into Playa Del Carmen town to shop, eat, drink or just walk around the town. Great shops, restaurants, bars, etc. We enjoyed the free service to town by Grand Velas and had to pay for a cab back but it was so inexpensive It is only 10 minutes away from the resort but a great place to see. You walk along the streets where there are palm trees and no cars. Every shop from jewelry , art, clothes, etc plus bars and restaurants and hotels. One block away from the beach. It is safe to visit and really fun. It is a must.! . We are going to return next February during our children's break.

The ambition of this hotel is to be the best of the best and they charge you for it. Service cannot be better, I even got medications in the middle of the night from the concierge directly to my room within 30 minutes for my sick kid. By the way I don't blame the hotel for this since this started before arrival. Once everyone was in shape we had a wonderful time. The place cannot be cleaner. Everyone is really trying to make you feel at ease. There is never a problem with kids anywhere including restaurant. By the way, if they like kids so much they should plan simple things like plastic instead of porcelain plates in restaurants. In the master suites it is true that the shuttle is always there and the ride is a matter of a few minutes. Not a bad choice with kids since the pool there is less windy and just as nice with interesting birds visiting regularly. Since it's all inclusive you don't look at billing but the prices are inflated on your bills so if you care for tipping perhaps 15% becomes too much. Because of those inflated prices a lunch at a buffet for two with one drink each is \"worth\" 108$! It is indeed a very good buffet but this price is not reasonable. Why care? Well, your stay ends at 12h. If you go for lunch at a restaurant after that time before you take the plane they will charge you just about that price. Besides it took 30 minutes to figure out how to use my visa to pay that bill, likely because they are used to bill on the room. After spending several thousands of dollars in the resort without noticing and feeling free to use anything available it does remind you that your trip is over. It is sad as it leaves a bad last impression after a good stay. Maybe it is similar to other hotels policy but this level of hotel could make it different or perhaps a warning? The other issue is to give written details about the all-inclusive package for consultation. I don't know if they exist but we did not have them. It's almost all-inclusive but there are some exceptions. They do explain somewhat but during the stay you keep questioning yourself. It causes unnecessary stress.

Our stay was quite enjoyable except for one glaring issue. First, the positive. The property was beautiful, especially the ambassador and grand class areas. The spa was unique and special. The service was consistently very friendly and accomodating. Our (master class) room was large and nice -- not spectacular. We liked the pool and beach along with the service at each. Shuttle service was excellent too. Nice fitness center. Molton Brown bath products. However, we had one MAJOR issue that nobody else seems to agree with on this site (which mystifies us). The food was flat out BAD. Granted, this was our first time ever at an all-inclusive resort, so its possible that our expectations were skewed, but we couldn't truly enjoy any meal -- and we tried all five reservation restaurants for dinner, snack bar and poolside for lunch, etc. Fancy presentation, poor quality was the common theme. Buffets didn't impress either. Bad (not hot) coffee, rock hard bread, \"fishy\" fish, strange preparations....we could go on and on and on. It was hard to find anything truly fresh and good. Cocina De Autor is award winning? Seriously? That said, I would still recommend this hotel to certain people - namely those that are looking for an all-inclusive, luxurious feel and look, and good, friendly service.

We have always been apprehensive because of the Spring Break/Party Zone stigma that comes with Cancun. We began looking into Grand Velas after a colleague had returned from the Riviera Nayarit/Puerto Vallarta property. He bragged about the food, the service and accomodations. We chose Riviera Maya over Puerto Vallarta purely upon flight availability and the newness of the Mayan property. We relied heavily on the comments and photos on TripAdvisor and because of this I feel compelled to return the favor since we looked at the reviews almost weekly until our departure. Actually, I still read them since I am DYING to return! Our vacation was fabulous and exceeded our expectations. We are travellers that don't require 5-star accomodations, but when given the opportunity, we usually prefer the high-end properties. We went not intending to partake in nightlife and partying...just relaxing and catching up with old friends that met us there. Upon check-in, we were greeted with cool towels and tea. We were seated on a nice sofa where our hostess went over our reservations. We then proceeded to our Ambassador room where we were greeted by Karla, our personal concierege/butler. Karla was great. She was present everyday. She handled our spa treatments, our dinner reservations, our return transportation to the airport, etc. The grounds were immaculate. The staff was very hospitable. The decor was sophisticated. The food was superb. The views were breath-taking. Our trip was relaxing, fun and all-around over-the-top. If you are on the fence about booking, don't hesitate. You will enjoy! Be prepared to spend extra money on spa treatments. An afternoon at the spa should not be missed. This is the best spa that I have visited....anywhere. And, yes, arrive 1.5 hours early for the water journey. It's amazing! The rooms were spacious. I personally wouldn't spend extra to be in the Grand Class section. The Ambassador section has great views of the water and the main pool. The Master section would be fine if you don't need to be close to the beach.

We went (NEVER have anywhere else but I LOVED this resort and actually was interested in buying in). It was exactly the hour they said it would be but I left confused. They wont give you anything in writing, they have no printed materials to carry with you and frankly dont seem that interested in closing.

This may be a bit long but I think there are some worthwhile details here that I would have liked to have known ahead of time. Bottom line - we loved our trip and this resort and certainly will be coming back. Arrival: Very easy 45 minute trip from the airport. We booked a private transfer through the hotel concierge ahead of time, which made it hassle-free. It was a van so if you're hoping for a limo or car you'll need to specify. Check in was very easy and our room was ready immediately even though we arrived at noon. Rooms: We were Grand Class in the adults-only section. The room was very large and spacious with a gigantic bathroom area, large shower, and huge jacuzzi tub. The walk-in closet was a nice touch. We loved the huge, very private patio - it had a table and chairs, two other lounge chairs, AND a full-size lounger bed. The view was absolutely amazing, straight onto the beach. Go for the third floor if possible - you get the high up view and I heard the patios are bigger than the fourth floor. We also appreciated the iPod dock and coffee machine. One thing to note - the minibar is stocked with beer, wine, water, and sodas. There is a complimentary bottle of Don Julio tequila and they let you order one additional bottle of liquor to have in your room at no charge (we had Grey Goose vodka) - but choose carefully, since they won't let you switch out if you change your mind or will have to charge you for another bottle. Just FYI. Resort/pool/beach: The grounds are beautiful, meticulously cleaned and maintained. The main pool is large and very nice, with both heated and unheated sections. The adult-only pool is heated. Some people complained about being able to find a spot but we never had a problem, probably because we spent most of our time on the beach. Speaking of the beach, we agree it was the finest we have visited - soft fine white sand and very big and wide. There is a little bit of coral here and there but what do you expect. The chairs were plentiful and very spaced out, so you never feel cramped. We were able to find an open cabana every time, and there were always loungers available. Just a wonderful quiet place to relax. We walked up the beach past a Princess resort and it was a zoo - it definitely made us appreciate how quiet and serene our beach was. As a matter of fact, the whole resort was very quiet - I don't know how full it was but we felt like we had the run of the place most of the time. Restaurants: We liked Cocina de Autor by far the best for dinner, but Sen Lin and Frida were also very good. Keep in mind they are very gourmet, so if you are a picky eater or like huge amounts of food you may be disappointed. We had room service for dinner one night and it was also very good. In general, all the food is great so don't be scared off by the all-inclusive aspect. Drinks are also plentiful and very high-quality. Take note, if you are a wine lover your selection will be limited - they have maybe 15-20 wines available by the glass for dinner, but you have to purchase any bottles off the wine list if that's what you want. Also, it pays to book your reservations ahead of time with the concierge - just get their email address off the web and email them. Tipping: This was a big point of confusion for us so I wanted to point it out. Yes, all tips are supposedly included - but you should be aware that some people, mostly the restaurant servers, expect more if they give you good service. You may have a different experience but here's what we settled on: we tipped 50 pesos (about $4) extra for lunch, 100 pesos for dinner, and 25-50 pesos for drinks at the bar or room service. We also gave our beach server Manuel (he is awesome!!) about $10/day since he was so nice and gave us great service. We left our housekeepers a little when we left nothing for our butler since he fell off the face of the earth after checking us in the first day. You may want to do more but this at least gives you an idea about the vibe we got and what we kind of felt was appropriate. Spa: Over the top nice. I'm not a spa guy but this place is so relaxing and awesome and huge that you have to do something. My hot stone massage was mind blowing and the water journey you do ahead of time (included with your treatment) is super relaxing. Keep in mind men and women are separated for the water journey so don't expect to hang out with your spouse. Timeshare: We got a phone call inviting us to hear the presentation and decided it was worth it to get the $150 spa gift certificate they offered. We met up with the very nice lady (Olga) and just sat down in one of the restaurants to talk. Over all it was mostly low pressure and only took a little over an hour so it was worth it to us. We simply said no thanks at the end and that was pretty much that. Still, it took some time so you can decide if it is worth it to you. Service: Overall, the service level was very high throughout the hotel and spa. The one exception we had was with housekeeping. Several times they left empty water bottles, other trash, and dirty cups lying around our room after they cleaned. One good example would be the espresso cups that we used in the morning that weren't replaced. The butler also forgot to bring us wine glasses that we asked for. These seem like relatively minor offenses but just stood out relative to the service level everywhere else. Some people also had great experiences with their butler, but ours was basically worthless since we didn't hear from him after the first day. With that said, response time for requests (ice, towels, etc) to our room was quite fast, room service was delivered quickly, and service everywhere else was very good, if not \"above and beyond\" extraordinary. Everybody was certainly friendly and accommodative and we loved our beach butler Manuel. So there it is. I hope this helps with your planning. I think most people will love this resort, particularly the Grand Class experience.

We spent 7 nights at the Grand Velas and found that the service was not nearly as good at the end of the week as it was our first 2 days. We had problems with reservations on more than one occasion and we had booked them online more than a month ahead of time. Also our room was not cleaned/mini bar not restocked 2 of the 7 days and the turn down service was not provided on 3 of the evenings. Upon check-in we learned that there was going to be Presidents from various entral and South American countries there later in the week. This became a problem when we had to put all our bags through screening devices and walk through metal detectors everytime we entered the hotel or traveled throughout the resort. Another problem we had was due to the Presidents were restaurants and bars were closed due to private events. One evening we traveled to Sen Lin to find we weren't allowed in for a drink because of private function. The next evening there was a private event in the Piano Bar and Karoke Bar. At no time was it posted or were we notified of these events. I feel for the money customers are paying they should be made aware of these things. The trip was not all bad...the food was great, especially room service for breakfast. We had great dining experiences at Cocina De Autor, Frida, and Sen Lin. The poolside service was great early in the week but come Thursday and Friday it was difficult to get service for a drink. The room was beautiful with an amazing view. We had a great time on a Mayan Tour and Snorkeling trip we booked through the resort, both were reasonably priced and worth the money. At times it was hard to find seating on the beach or poolside. People start placing items on chairs by 5:30am so if you wake-up after 8am chances are you won't be sitting poolside. One morning we placed a bag and books on a cabana on the beach before heading to breakfast and upon returning we found our belongings missing and a family sitting in that spot. The lifeguards answer was \"we moved your stuff because they have been sitting here all week.\" I found that answer to be unacceptable.

We have travelled to many resorts over the years and had high expectations given most of the reviews here as well as from information from friends who went to the one in PV. We have gone on many trips with high expectations, only to be disappointed. Our prior all-inclusive experiences left much to be desired. However, this was not one of those times. In general, with few exceptions, this surprised us and exceeded our expectations. First, we stayed in the Ambassador Class. Many who have given negative reviews here appear to have stayed in the Master Class section. I don't know what they were expecting as it clearly indicates that part of the resort is 'in the jungle'. You won't get the beach nearby or an ocean view, but you will get gorgeous rooms, a beautifully layed out resort with a terrific pool area, close access to the spa (it is in the Master Class section) and free, quick shuttle service to the beach area (Ambassador/Grand Class). So, knowing what you get is important and there is an appropriate price difference between the sections. You can go to any restaurant no matter what section you are staying in (though you need reservations for the 5 main dinner restaurants that don't have buffets). First, our arrival was smooth as silk. We checked in sitting on the couch/chairs in the main lobby around 1PM. We asked if our room was ready. We were ecstatic to find out that it was. Our section/room was absolutely gorgeous. The view from our room almost exactly mirrored the view on the Grand Velas site. WOW! What a view. The room was large, comfortable and well appointed. One comment I will make is that their website shows these rooms at 1270 square feet. That is extremely generous. My guess is the room is closer to 800 square feet. There also is a beautiful terrace or balcony depending on which floor your room is located (were were on the top floor which we had requested). The bathrooms are well done, with separate shower, tub, and commode areas. The shower has a ceiling based rainshower head as well as an optional wand. There are double sinks and a separate makeup area. There are sliding shutters so you can have privacy or look out to the ocean. There is a fully stocked minibar in each room (complimentary) as well as a nespresso coffee prep center. The room has a large flat screen tv and dvd player. Most importantly, there were a lot of storage drawers and a large walk-in closet with safe. The main room has a king or two queen beds (we had the queens with the kids) and a sitting area with couch and ottoman/table as well as a desk/chair. The deck had a lounge as well as a table and chairs. In general the room was very comfortable. The exception for us were the beds, which were harder than we usually like. They did seem to be of good quality and the linens were superior (including down comforters). The only suggestion I would make, is that as the beds need to be replaced, sleep number beds (or similar idea) may be a better option as they can accomodate the range of different customer preferences for mattress firmness. The ambassador pool area was spectacular. The infinity style layout is extremely large and never seemed crowded, even when the resort was at 100% occupancy. There is even the 'requisite' swim up bar. The only time finding a chair was not easy was when the resort was full near the end of our stay. Still, we managed to find chairs. The master pool area as I mentioned before looked beautiful and not busy. We didn't go to the Grand Class area except on the beach as we had children and that is the adults only section. The food was extremely good everywhere we went. Azul is the main, non-reservations restaurant in the Ambassador area. So, we pretty much has breakfast/lunch there each day. The food was exceptional for a buffet (we didnt use the a la carte option there but you can). The attentiveness was amazing. They wouldn't let food sit too long even if it wasn't used. Fresh trays were swapped in constantly. There was always a good selection of dishes. Breakfast had egg and quesadilla stations as well as a massive selection of top notch fresh fruits. Lunch had a large salad bar as well as ceviche and dessert/pastry options. Every meal had a wide variety of breads. And, the view from Azul was spectacular. The service was amazing. Waitstaff would meet you walking from the food area and offer to carry your plates to your table. The staff was amazingly attentive for most of our stay. As the resort reached full capacity, the service level slipped a slight bit, but was at that point very good instead of just amazing. {Note: there was more than just a 100% occupancy issue going on at the end of our stay. The resort was also preparing to host the Rio Summit being hosted by the Mexican President. That summit is going on as I write this. At the end of our stay they were installing security equipment for that event.) The 'a la carte' reservation requiring dinner restaurants are Lucca (Italian) and Sen Lin (Asian) in the Master area, Frida (gourmet Mexican) in the Ambassador, and Piaf (French) and Cocina de Autor (Spanish) in the Grand Class area. We did not go to the grand class restaurants as we dine with our children but heard they were terrific. That being said, we loved what we did go to. Each room was spectacular and much nicer than I expected. They were nicer than most restaurants I have been to in NYC and were just dramatic rooms. Bravo! They were all spaced nicely and staffed appropriately. The service, with minor exceptions was superior. We went to Sen Lin once and it was very good, but we have extremely good asian food where we live and the family just seemed to want to go to the other two restaurants. Lucca and Frida were the family favorites. My wife and I especially loved the risottos (lobster and mushroom) at Lucca. We tried a wide variety of dishes there and they were very good. There was a focus on seafood too, which was nice to see given the quality of local offerings. Frida was exceptional too. From the duck tacos with mole, the cactus ravioli, the soups and other appetizers to the meats (veal chop with cocoa, rack of lamb) and fishes, there was a terrific selection. My family loves mexican food and this was no exception. My wife loved the wine cart (many selections to say the least) though I uncharacteristically enjoyed the margaritas more. We never thought we would even use the Kid's Club, but the activities on the list interested the kids, so we let them try it. The ladies running the club at the ambassor section (Yax Paal) were unbelievably great with the kids. They kept asking to go back for an hour or two a day. My daughter loved the crafts and my son tended to either play with the WII or watch a movie. The rooms (we saw the one in master section too) are extremely nice and had multiple tv's/video game systems as well as multiple tables/chairs for projects and a soft area near the large tv. People who said their kids never go to these things were going and asking to go back and we found out why. Also, there were activities directors in the pool and beach areas. From ping pong, to soccer, and even horseshoes, they would run activities for kids and adults. The guys who worked with the kids were patient and terrific with them. In general, we would like to compliment the people who do the training here for the staff. Kudos, the effort sure shows. Each area of the Ambassdor section also had a butler/concierge in addition to the main concierge desk. The b/c would make dinner reservations for you and help with anything you needed for your room etc. She was terrific! She would make sure that things got done while we were out of our room and that what we liked in the minibar was stocked more heavily for our stay. This was great, especially with the kids. We used the tour desk to book a couple of offsite excursions to Dolphin Discovery and Rio Secreto (underground caves where my youngest go also go). Both trips were terrific. Evidently Rio Secreto has only been open for about a year, but it was spectacular and the kids loved it. It probably is a bit cheaper to do some of the excursions on your own, but not a lot and they give you the ability to charge it to your room, making for a cashless experience once you arrive. The spa was fabulous! It is located as I mentioned in the Master Class area. The pools are spectacular. Allow at least an hour before your treatment to use them as well as the sauna,steam, ice, and clay rooms! There were many options at the spa, but I opted for the Mayan Experience which was terrific. The spa area itself was amazing and I wish I had more time there. As with the entire resort, the design and decor was amazingly well done. The beach was beautiful, though as with most in the area, there is a fair amount of coral. The resort does have protective burms and rock walls in the ocean, so it is very easy to enjoy the beautiful waters and soft sands. The beach is kept immaculate by the staff and has a lot of chairs/umbrellas etc. The staff on the beach arranged for a parasailing ride and the people were there within 10 minutes to take my daughter and I on a waverunner to the waiting boat. What a view that gave us. My wife put it best, service at Grand Velas was more about hospitality which seems to be a lost art here in the US. You could see that many people were not used to the level of service that we experienced. We didn't go in to Playa Del Carmen, but they do provide shuttle service to town. You need to get your own taxi to return though. Check out was a breeze. The bill was as expected and the process completed in minutes. It was sad to have to say Adios. We do plan to return to Grand Velas and hopefully sooner than later. We would highly recommend this resort . As my wife and I both said, \"This is what an all-inclusive should be!\" Bravo Grand Velas!", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cThumbs up !\u201d", "Author": "Lana02", "ReviewID": "UR56763658", "Content": "Yes it is true !

SEN LIN 4. LUCCA 5. FRIDA Cocina de Autor, Piaf, Sen Lin wear absolute favorite. The only thing that was negative is the beach. Though sand area is beautifully kept the ocean is rocky.

Unlike some other high-end hotels in Playa del Carmen, the rooms in two of the three sections (Ambassador and Grand) were right on the beach. The facilities at Banyan Tree are probably a bit more posh, but you have to take a bus to the beach. IMO, a beachfront at Grand Velas is probably a better deal, depending on your priorities.

We are not regular \"all inclusive\" folks - and this stay did not make us more inclined to become ones. We missed the connection to place - we could have been anywhere on earth (it was even a little hard to find Mexican food!). Felt almost like Vegas in that way. The rooms were very spacious and nice. Though we didn't like having to take a shuttle to the beach, we preferred the pool near us rather than the main pool. Much nicer ambience. The \"all inclusive\" drink and food at the pool aspect was terrific, but overall, we did not love the food at the restaurants. If you are travelling from a real \"foodie\" place, the food here will not impress. Fitness facilities were okay, but not enough ellipticals! If you wanted to run outside, they followed you in a golf cart - a little strange. The spa was over the top - very nice, but a little cavernous. The service here is the one spot that is really problematic. They aspire to give you great personal concierge/butler service, but it seemed like every day we had a different \"butler,\" and he/she didn't necessarily know what the prior one had or had not done. Good intentions, not much follow-through. One really sour note -- even though we were assured that the \"introductory breakfast\" was NOT a timeshare sales pitch and would include breakfast, we did not actually get any food, and it WAS a timeshare presentation. When confronted, they claimed, \"this is not a timeshare, it's a fractional ownership - very different,\" but in fact, it was not different at all. Finally, I booked all our extra activities on the web, which was much cheaper than going through the resort. If you like adventure activities, definitely get to Xplor. Bottom line, if you want a huge resort that doesn't seem like it is in Mexico, Grand Velas is probably as good as any.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cFor our family with young children, it was absolutely perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Lillekitte", "ReviewID": "UR56362488", "Content": "We have been back home in Sweden again for 2 weeks, after our FANTASTIC holiday. We stayed first 1 week at the Grand Velas, and then 1 week at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun. Here are my notes on the Grand Velas: WE COULD NOT HAVE MADE A BETTER CHOICE! We were travelling with children aged 7 and 3, and were looking for a very high-end resort with large, beautiful room/suite, lovely surroundings, excellent service and gourmet food. And absolute relaxation. That is exactly what we got. I will try not to repeat what everyone else has said, but focus on what was especially good in our opinion. First - just the feeling of the resort is so lovely: It is all open-air, open spaces, high ceilings, breeze flowing through, light colours, tropical feeling with lots of flowers, bushes etc - and almost everywhere is ocean view. Elegant, but in a light, modern, cool way. We stayed at the Ambassador section, which I recommend if you have children and if you can afford it - because of the ocean view, and to be close to the main pool there (which is the nicest one in my opinion). (Although my oldest daughter said she would have loved to stay at Master and have the jungle view.) The pool area is so beautiful, and the whole family loved the fact that the pool is separated into 3 sections: One shallow for very little children and one slightly deeper - both nice and comfortably warm (heated) - and the third that is chillier and has an infinity-end where you look straight onto the beach. Had heard that pools can be very chilly this time of year - but not at GV. Lots of very nice loungers, cabanas and caf\u00e9 tables both around the pool and on the beach - you could always find a perfect spot. Staff also very helpful, friendly and always available. We don\u00b4t usually do all inclusive (worried that quality and choice will not meet our expectations) but had heard that at Grand Velas you can - and we were not disappointed! We tried most of the restaurants, and the food was so good, the menus so interesting, the presentation of the food so beautiful, the whole experience so perfect, that I cannot believe this standard is typical for other AI! No buffet-dinners or limited menus of any kind. And it really is ALL inclusive, minibar, room service, all snacks and drinks you take by the pool or in the bars, elaborate wine-lists, everything. I must also mention: - The kids club personell - wonderful. My 7 year old did not want to go because she speaks no English - but she agreed to go once to just sit and play her Nintendo while I was at the gym. When I return she was the center of attention of 5 staff members and loving it. She went again twice... - The gym - very large and nice and with very nice staff. I forgot my headphones once - no problem, they found some I could borrow. - The concierge system and our concierge Montserrat: BRILLIANT! Montserrat was always around to tend to our every need. We never really had to call her or look for her, she was always kind of around. Reminded us about reservations, made arrangements etc. Very effectively too - she wore a kind of \"walkie-talkie\"/headphone kind of thing, so as soon as we mentioned we were on our way to reception to go somewhere, she made arrangements so that a car was already waiting when we got there 30 seconds later... - We had a babysitter in the room one evening, so we could go to one of the adults-only restaurants. The babysitter was a concierge at Grand Class and it worked perfectly even if the children don't speak English - we ordered room-service for the children and then they could watch DVDs in the room. - In the water outside the beach, they have built \"wave-breakers\", to create a zone of calmer water inside where you can use cayaks etc. Great with little children, because there was strong wind the whole time we were there. - I have stayed at many beach resorts, but have NEVER experienced sand this perfect! Fine, powdery, clean, and never warm to step on. - Just little details that make a difference: iPod docking station in the room so we could play our own music. Zone-free DVD-player that played our own DVDs was good for the children. Huge shower-ROOM that fit the whole family. Nespresso-machine and no-limit access to \"pods\" for it - Montserrat made sure I never got any of the decaf-ones, just because I once mentioned I don't like decaf... Huge balcony with double-lounger and nice table/chairs. Lovely beds with real thick, down-filled duvets. Laundry service very quick and not expensive - practical with little children... The staff are all wonderful, very attentive, very serviceminded and friendly, and because there are so many of them you never had to wait for service. We went into Playa del Carmen once, and it just felt SO wonderful to return to Grand Velas afterwards and to be \"welcomed home\" (by name, of course). We actually stayed one night longer than planned. After 8 nights all of us were ready for somewhere new so we moved on to the Ritz in Cancun - but that is a different story. But just a short comparison: Although I like both, I much preferred the Grand Velas to the Ritz - for us, and for our needs. Service and food are of course equally wonderful at the Ritz and it is very high standard and elegant - but to me that felt darker and more \"inside\", with wall-to-wall carpeting and heavy furniture and air-conditioning. I prefer the brighter, more airy, luscious, modern Grand Velas - it feels more like holiday to me. (And my husband preferred the Ritz - so we were both happy!) On one area I preferred the Ritz though: The suites at Grand Velas are - although huge - one room only, whilst at the Ritz they had one-bedroom = 2-room suites. Better for us as a family to be able to close the door - but in terms of space the suite at Grand Velas was more than big enough for the 4 of us. I would strongly recommend GV if you are looking for this kind of resort and it is in your price range.

We have been to Cancun 20 times since 1987, however; this was our first time staying in an AI. We weren't sure what to expect. The staff was wonderful and always made sure to call us by name. Our only real glitch occurred at the beginning of our trip. After reading several reviews of the Grand Velas, we decided to change our reservation from the Master suites to the Ambassador Suites only because I wanted to be on the beach. I had a difficult time getting a response to my request to upgrade our reservation. I used the contact us link on the website several times, but got no reply. After calling the number on the website I was transferred to 4 different people before I finally got the e-mail address of Rodolpho who was able to help me with my request to change my reservation. Upon arrival they still had our reservation at the Master Suites and had no knowledge of our upgrade. Luckily I had printed out my e-mail correspondence with Rodolpho and after a while we were finally moved to the ambassador suites. I was pretty worried about the rough start but things got better quickly. Our room was immaculate and nicely decorated. Very spacious with a lot of attention paid to detail. My favorite part of the room was the patio. It had a great view of the pool and ocean and flower petals would scatter across the patio when the wind blew. The blow dryer was a full size dryer and not one of the mini hotel dryers. A nice lighted make- up mirror was in the bathroom. We loved choosing our pillows from the pillow menu. The beach bag that was provided was good sized and we used it every day to go to the pool and beach. I can't say enough of the service that was provided to us at the beach. We never had a problem getting a chair or bed at the beach and someone was always there to get us towels and drinks. The beach was large and well maintained. We walked up and down the beach on both sides and the Grand Velas definitely has the best beach of the surrounding resorts. The food was amazing. I followed the advice of others and made our reservations in advance. However; when we got there our concierge had no record of them, but again, I had printed out my e-mail correspondence and it was taken care of. Our favorite restaurant was Piaf. The atmosphere was most romantic and the food was fantastic. The lobster \" veloute\" in cognac soup was so good! We also enjoyed the Roquefort cheese rolls. Lucca was probaby our least favorite. The food was just ok and the staff seemed very stressed the night we were there. Cocina de Autor the signature restaurant, offered some very unique food dishes. If you are a foodie, you will love this restaurant. I loved the tea they brought at the beginning of the meal, and the grilled lobster with black corn was yummy. My husband is pretty much a meat and potatoes guy and not real adventurous at meal time, so this was not the restaurant for him. He loved the breakfast and lunch buffets at Azul. So many choices - You definitely won't go hungry. Relying again on the advice of trip adviser members, we booked a spa treatment. At first I was hesitant to book anything as it appeared a little pricey. My husband and I did the couples massage and it was worth the price! The river journey was such a nice , relaxing treat, we just wish we could have done that part together. The river journey at the spa is a must do! My husband and I went to the time -share presentation (I was seduced by the promise of a spa gift certificate). It was like no other time share presentation we have ever experienced. It was almost enjoyable and ended promptly when we said no thank you, we are not interested. No pressure at all!

My husband,myself, and three daughters 16,13, and 8 are from the New York area and have traveled extensively thru the US, Europe, and many islands. The Grand Velas is amazing! This being our first all inclusive ( my husband was very hesitant ) we were so very pleased with every meal and every drink. To start the property is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in the Ambassador Suite and I think it is a better choice for families since it is so close to the beach and pool. Our kids are old enough now to have the freedom of being on their own a little. They met some friends and could sit and have lunch at Azul and not be far away from us. We felt very secure letting them wander around and I hardly let my kids go to the mailbox on their own! This brings me to the friendliness of the staff, not one time in 8 days did anyone seem to be in a bad mood or annoyed about anything. Such kind professional employees truly happy to have you there! Tipping is included but these people deserve something extra!! I would love to give a shout out to a few by name but quite honestly they ALL stood out and deserve equal praise! Now to the restaurants- Sen Lin- very, very, good. Lucca- very good- seems to be having a hard time finding it's own idendtity. I think it is the spa restaurant during the day. Frieda- very good. Cocina du Artour- Excellent, but a little different. Piaf- Dark,romantic, and incrediable food. French chef, really amazing! Our favorite. Azul- breakfast buffet very good. All day casual dining , very good! Sky Bar- Between Piaf and Cocina. Great for drinks before or after dinner. Kareoke Bar- fun but a later crowd when people have enough liquid courage. The kids had room service a few times and everything was very good. The beach is beautiful and there were plenty of chairs and double chairs that tie closed if you want out of the sun. I think people need to realize when you travel to a large resort around Easter or Christmas break it going to be very crowded! The beach service was great, plenty of towels,beach toys, cold waters without even asking. We booked one tour thru the hotel ,Tulum ruins / Xel-ha with private transportation .We left at 9am and returned around 5, we enjoyed the day. Be sure to book a spa treatment.

Ok, my husband decided we should go on a trip to celebrate our anniversay to what I obviously agreed without much diffculty! Lacking time to research and prepare as I normally do for any of our trips, he mentioned we\u2019d be heading out to the Mexican Carribean for a second honeymoon\u2026 Then after a couple of days of suspicious quiteness after this big news, we were suddenly at the airport, luggage packed and tickets in hand, heading out to the super trendy \u201cPlaya Del Carmen\u201d! \u2026Two words of advise for all of you who haven\u2019t been to Playa del Carmen: MUST GO! What a paradise! I\u00b4m sure much of the great time we had had to do with the lovely place Mel took me to; he actually went overboard, and I had no idea he was capable of pulling such a treat together for me (since I\u00b4m the expert on travel planning matters, lol!). Apparently he realized how hot this destiantion was when he was doing his research online using search words like beach, mexico, dream vacation, etc.. and so he now tells me that the number one search for Mexico was \u201cPlaya del Carmen\u201d, and from there he was led to find luxury and an all inclusive resorts, which was an unknown concept for him. After some research, he ran into this very good looking new resort on the Riviera Maya which is actually closer to Playa del Carmen than it is to Cancun (short 40 min. drive to Cancun, though), so he figured that was the perfect honeymoon spot. I\u2019m not a woman of few words, so it\u00b4s hard to describe such a lovely place and be fair, but to make long story short (and since I guess this review must have a limited number of characters, lol!), Grand Velas is a dream come true! We were simply threated like royalty, and beign called by our first name at all times truly had some effect on me and my hole vacations as well\u2026 We stayed at the Master Area or \u201cZen Ambiance\u201d as the staff calls it. At first I had some strong feelings about the place for it was an \u201call inclusive\u201d and it sounded like we\u2019d be spending a fortune, but we actually didn\u2019t. However, the luxury component was a must and we got it. I was intrigued about the resort so I wanted to explore it all, but honestly, the very entrance to Grand Velas made it for me. I then knew I was completely sold! We were escorted by to the front desk where we were greeted with fresh towels, some interesting tropical (non-acoholic) drink, and then led to our huge sexy room (over 1,100 sqf)! We stayed at a romantic, warm toned posh decorated room, with modern tropical terraces overlooking a river and regional flora and fauna. Gotta metion this! First thing we saw as we opened our curtains: An Iguana on the rocks across our river view! Apparently waiting for us to arrive \u2013at first we thought it was a fake one and we even joked about such an interesting \u201cBienvenidos\u201d, well it ended up being that the iguana was real and decided to leave soon before we could get a picture with it... we missed the picture, but we wont forget the cute Iguana! So much to say! Really, staying at the most affordable room \u2013big, sexy, and techie(check out the touch screen smart phones) of the luxurious all inclusive Grand Velas made my year! The SPA was only a few steps away from my room, I had to give it a try! I got there wihtout an appointment and they still greeted me like a fine old friend. I was pampered like never before, I enjoyed a massage plus about an hour of a hidrotherapy journey and my session was wrapped up with a bubbles bed on which I actually fell sleep for a little while. I must say my husband has to be a very happy man for it was a delightful vacation for both of us, turns out that the exact same experience I was having on the ladies Spa area, was also available for gentlemen! Same area, same huge sensations pools; therefore, he decided to go for such dreamy ritual! As soon as we left the spa, we were confirmed by our concierge \u2013AKA the fixer, butler, call him/her however you want (she was amazing either way!), that our reseravtions for Cocina de Autor restaurant were ready and\u2026 double WOW here please! What a gift to the senses!!! Pure love is put into the creation of these dishes! Apaprently this is \u2018Molecular Cuisine\u2019 (kind of like TV Top Chefs), and as I see it now, these are dishes that didn\u2019t exist before, they are not only a mixture of elements, flavors, ingredients, but a recreation of food for the eyes and the soul\u2026 I refuse to let that feeling and that flavor go. I\u00b4m sorry did anyone mentioned the beach?!!! Well it was only here that it came to my attention that beign that we had chosen to stay in the the Zen Area, our suite was not right next to the beach \u2013although the property actually extended along their super sized beach and not toward the back of the highway like most other resorts do. We spent about half of our days at the beach, some nights at the fine Karaoke, had some drinks at the Sky Bar (overlooking Cozumel lights, loved it!), and we also spent some time just wondering around this beautiful property and its may restaurants, bars, pools (I counted 8?). I sure hope to go back sometime soon Like I said, both the place overall and our suite were aboslutely amazing, and cozy; it feelt like we were breathing a different air\u2026 perhaps it was this ambiance\u00b4s elements of wood, threes, leaves, iguanas, rivers, or the birds singing a serenade for us on the terrace while enjoying a midnight suite service we ordered\u2026 I\u2019m not sure but it was magical: moon, champagne, natural water features\u2026 I guess our next year anniversay is too far out for the memories of my senses to remain, and I guess anyday is good for traveling, loving and enjoying life\u00b4s little suprises.

Then look no further. My Stay: Very simply - traveled with my family. Celebrated my 40's birthday as well as one of my daughter's birthday. Wanted to be pampered a little, rest at the beach and have access to great food. As you have read - there are 3 buildings. The Master's (a distance from the beach) the Ambassador and the Grand Class (adults only). I had made reservations at the Master's not knowing that it was not at the beach. Once I understood how the hotel was distributed I moved to the Ambassador. Yes - the Master is more economical but with kids I found it a lot easier to be at the Ambassador for moving around. Last thing I wanted was to forget something the girls needed and board a car to get it. Once I got to the hotel and saw first hand the Master's area - I must admit, it was very nice. I would not hesitate to stay there if the budget was tighter. You still have access to all the amenities and the Master buildings were as nice as the rest. The only thing you are missing is the ocean view before going to sleep and early in the morning. As this was my birthday. That is another thing worth noting - there are few other resorts with ocean view in the area... I walked a long way both ways of the shoreline and unless you are willing to spend 5k a night - there are none. Only a handful of villas that for the price - you can get a much better luxury private serviced house outside a hotel environment. I also noticed (and you would too) that all beach goers from other resorts, while on their shore walk - stop and ask about the Grand Velas. I saw many of them walk into the hotel and request printed material to take back with them. The amenities that the hotel has - are fantastic. There is little that the photographs do not describe. Easy access, pleasant atmosphere - the halls, the rooms, the lobby etc. The service was excellent. Our concierges were fantastic. They arranged everything for us... surprised balloons and cakes for us, check, re-cheked and re-did our reservations, swiming with the dolphins and all sorts of questions and requests, baby sitter etc. I really appreciated their help. Our room was great... very large, comfortable. iPod dock with the stereo, nice size flat screen, nice bathroom etc. There was a large lounging bed and bistro table on the oversized balcony which overlooked the ocean. That saw a lot of use while we were at the room. Even at night you have a nice clear sky to watch the stars. The Spa - the spa was very, very nice. Book it... relax! It really is an experience and the service was like no other spa I have gone. I can see why there are so many comments praising it. Not booking the spa will be something you will regret if you knew what wonderful it was. The food... the food at Azul is unpretentious, fresh, accessible and full of flavour. Perfect for when you are at the pool and beach. Good selection of produce and prepared food. The restaurants - Chaka for lunch and Cocina del Autor are not to be missed. Frida was very, very good as well. I had no chance to go to Piaf (next trip). I did not encountered the problems with the reservations as many reported. The problem must of been resolved. The restaurant dress code, I liked it. Its a small thing to do to make the experience just a little nicer. There are no evening activities which I was happy they did not. The kids club is a must if you have kids and need a bit of time for yourself. The staff was very accomodating and they are equiped and prepared to stimulate the kids with other activities that are not watching TV or playing Wii (or you can let them do what they like). The Kids club at our building also prepared a surprise for our dauther on her birthday, which they did not have to and did it from their hearts anyways. Did not have a problem neither with the facilities nor with the service. In fact - the service is very, very good and it really made the trip. They understand that you came to relax and they do really want to panper you by helping or letting you be. If I had a suggestion, it would be one... in the rooms, near the internet ethernet jack - the two electrical outlets are taken by a desk lamp and the phone. There should be one left for the computer as that is the most logical place since the jack is located there. Don't add an extension cable or a multi-bar thing as the room looks nice without it... try to find a way to free one outlet somehow. That's it... that is my suggestion. Our stay was top notch. I could not had loved the Grand Velas hospitality more. I eat well, I was pampered to relaxation and I enjoyed the facilities they offered.

We ended up coming to the Grand Velas, Riviera Maya after having vacationed at the Grand Velas in Nuevo Vallarta a couple years prior. By comparison, the Riviera Maya resort has all the best features of the Nuevo Vallerta Resort, but it's twice the size and has twice the food options. Here's our take on a few different elements of the resort. Food - Cocina Del Autor is one of the best/most enjoyable meals we've ever had. We've been to top notch restaurants in a number of different places, but never have we had a meal where we liked every single thing put in front of us. We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing, and it was a great couple hours. We did Lucca the next night, which was good as well. We regret only not staying a couple more nights and trying some of the other restaurants, especially Sen Lin. Service - Great Service everywhere we went. Noone was stuffy, and the staff went out of its way to make sure you got everything you wanted and more. I would say the staff to guest ratio was at least 2 to 1. In terms of the other reviews where people complained about lounge chairs, we never even came close to experiencing to this as the resort was not full. Also, big shout out to our buddy Fernando who was the bartender at the adults only pool. He made us some great drinks off the menu and the tequilla tasting was great fun. Sometimes at a 5 star resort you get stuffy people and they look down upon younger travelers especially, but what we love about Grand Velas is that everyone is so friendly, laid back, good humored and want to make your vacation relaxing and fun. Room - We stayed in the Master Suites section. This section is a 5 star resort in itself. It's really neat how the covered outdoor hallways wind through the jungle. We never had an issue with the shuttle to the beach. The service folks would see you coming and have the shuttle on its way before you got to the end of the hall. Also, the rooms are really modern, yet reflect the relaxing environment of the jungle as well. Really nice job on the design. Overall - Great experience at the Grand Velas, Riviera Maya. Vacation is something my wife and I really covet and are willing to pay a little more if the resort is worth it, and this place is. We will return to this resort and any other that is under the Grand Velas Brand!", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cResort has potential, but underdelivered.\u201d", "Author": "Mestermenn", "ReviewID": "UR53637533", "Content": "My family and I took an eight day trip to the Grand Velas beginning the day after Christmas. This hotel is beautiful and full of potential. Unfortunately, they fell short in many areas. It was clearly obvious that they were grossly unprepared for the Christmas/New Years period. Their staff even admitted it several times. The Good: 1. The rooms are beautiful. The grounds are maintained at a beautiful level. They clearly take pride in the appearance of the resort. 2. The staff tries to take pride in their work. They were just overwhelmed by the full hotel status. Many told us they have never been close to full capacity and were unprepared by it. 3. The location of the master suites is not terrible as many have indicated. The shuttle ride is 2-3 minutes and we never waited longer than one minute for van. It was quick and easy. 4. The spa is absolutely world class... If you go to the Grand Velas and do not visit the spa, you are missing an unbelieveable experience. 5. The kids club was enjoyed by my seven year old daughter. The staff there was fantastic and she kept asking to go every night. 6. Francisco was incredible. He is a staff member who helps teach the kids how to build incredible sand castles. He was absolutely amazing. He made the most incredible sand sculptures. 6. The food in the adults only restaraunts was fabulous. The passion fruit sorbet at Piaf was incredible. However, getting reservations to eat in them was difficult and rare. 7. The pirate party bbq on the beach was great fun. Nice band and dancers, good food, great setup. The bad and ugly: 1. They were clearly unprepared for the Christmas and New Years rush. For the type of money we are spending, it is clearly unacceptable to run out of towels at the pool for hours and have no beach or pool chairs available. They also had a shortage of pool butlers and four times I had to get up and track one down to order drinks. 2. Our reservation when we arrived was incorrect. We had a suite with two queen beds booked for us with my two children. We had the confirmation in writing. Upon arrival, they had us in a room with one king bed. We presented the confirmation and they were clearly confused. They offered to shove two rollaways in the room for us. That would have been uncomfortable four our kids. We ended up having to rent another room. They should have discounted the rate more than they did, but being that it was Christmas week, I was in no postion to argue. This left a really bad taste in my mouth. They should have gotten it correct from the outset and we had to pay a price. Their staff was just overwhelmed. 3. For New Year's Eve they charged an additional fee of $75 per person. They said this was for the upgraded food. We wanted to eat at Sin Lin or Frida and tried to book eight days out. They said they were full. When we walked past them, there were many open tables. We were forced to eat at Lucca which was converted to a buffet meal that night. The food at Lucca was very poor that evening, much worse than a cheap Vegas buffet. I felt that they owed us much more. They basicly stole the $75 fee. A family near us really gave it to the manager on the way out. 4. They clearly try to force you to eat at the buffet restaraunts because they are cheaper to operate. They had many empty tables in the specialty restaraunts when we arrived at them, but we were told they were booked solid a week out. They should not say that they have these great restaraunts and then only let you eat in them four out of eight nights. Very disappointed. 5. They have an outside vendor called Sils Dive that sells activities by the pool. They are extremely pushy. We also booked a tour through them and they did not live up to the promises that were made. I understand the hotel has them as an outside vendor and that they cannot control them, but they should find another vendor who is reputable. 6. The teen club was a room in the convention center with a movie screen, ping pong, foosball table, and a couple of other games. It was set apart from the rest of the hotel and appeared thrown together. My daughter went four times trying to meet people her age and it was always empty. They need to put some though behind it. The kids club for younger kids was great. 7. The high speed internet was not available in our building in the master section. Our butler told us it was coming in about a month. They should have had it ready for the rush week. Bottom line: A beautiful hotel with great potential that was clearly unprepared for the Christmas rush. It will be interesting to see if make modifications to their service polices. Obviously a great hotel at 30-50 percent occupancy. A three star at full occupancy.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Destination For Being Pampered, Enjoy Fine Dining, and Making Memories!\u201d", "Author": "debhawk", "ReviewID": "UR53408222", "Content": "After searching every all-inclusive property in the Riviera Maya, the Grand Velas All Suites and Spa Resort emerged hands down the place for my family to vacation after the Christmas Holidays. We made reservations for the Master Suite location, not realizing it is located about 3/4 of a mile from the beach in a mangrove. However, we all decided we would check the location out and if it didn't meet our approval, upgrade to the Ambassador Suites which are beachfront property. We noticed that the Master Suites felt very peaceful and private and decided to go ahead and stay there. We don't feel any time at all was lost in going back and forth between the two locations as we never had to wait on transportation either way. In fact, it almost felt like 2 vacations in 1. The Ambassador location had wonderful views of the beach, but the people staying there had no privacy if they wanted to lounge on their balcony or go swimming in the beautiful infinity pools. Whereas when we were ready to leave the beach area, we returned to much more privacy in our little jungle setting. Much more intimate, I think. So, don't be afraid of staying at the Master Suites. We loved everything about it, including the beautiful pool that we had all to ourselves. You are also steps away from the spa too! Speaking of spa....the Grand Velas Spa has now become the standard for my future spa visits! The bar has definitely been raised. Treat yourself to a treatment, especially if you are not usually a \"spa\" person. Trust me, you will be converted. Be sure to go 1 1/2 hours before your scheduled treatment to experience the water journey, sauna, steam room, clay room, and everything else that's FREE with your paid-for treatment. Guaranteed to \"bubble\" your cares away! If you are a \"foodie\" this is the perfect place for you to indulge your various tastes and pleasures! Each restaurant has it's own ambiance but each one has at its heart the desire to serve you and see that you enjoy each and every dining experience. Our personal favorites at night were Piaf (French) and Sen Lin(Asian.) I highly recommend the tasting menu at Sen Lin. Such an enjoyable experience. Several of the restaurants serve this adorable tray of handmade chocolates that are to die for so save room after dessert to enjoy one...or two. The wait staff at each restaurant are so professional and courteous and eager to please. The Breakfast buffet at Azul's was wonderful and especially enjoyed the various juices. (Guabanaba and Soy and Mango and Soy. Wow!) The Bistro was also wonderful for breakfast or lunch. Room service is another treat and is so helpful for families with hungry children! The rooms are everything and more that other reviewers have said. I especially loved the Nespresso machines and hot tea selections provided. And the bathrooms? AMAZING! Loved loved loved the jacuzzi tub, each jet hitting just the right area to melt your troubles away. I thoroughly enjoyed the balcony also. At the Master Suites, the balconies are private as you are surrounded by the jungle and the chirping of the birds. The lounging beds on the patio are perfect for curling up with a great book. One thing we experienced that I haven't read anything about is the wonderful cribs and high chairs provided for the little ones. I wish I had taken a picture of them, but the cribs are 5 star quality with plush bedding like the adults. Because the resort was at a low occupancy during our stay, they allowed us to keep a highchair in the room which made feeding time of the toddler so much easier. The Kid Zone has 2 locations, one in the Ambassador and one at the Master Suites and is so bright colored and inviting, your child will definitely benefit from some play time there. The staff have a genuine love and understanding of children and their needs and enthusiastically greet each child and readily engage them in play. Another feature the resort offers is Babysitting. The babysitters will come stay in your room if desired or take them to the Kid Zone. This service is offered at $13 an hour which is very reasonable and well worth the \"alone\" time it provides for the adults. The Butler Concierge is another plus for the resort. These people work very hard to cater to your every whim and they make you feel their sole existence there is to make you comfortable and attended to. They do everything from booking your dinner reservations to filling your refrigerator and stocking the bar and do it all with warmth and friendliness. Just give them a list of what you want them to do, and it's done! Thank you Anna and Erika! Our experience at the Grand Velas was exceptional in every way but one. I feel I need to mention this as it left a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths after experiencing perfection in every other area. This is also why I'm leaving only 4 stars for service. Upon checkout, it was reported that one of the bathrobes provided for our use while there was missing from a room as well as the beach basket. They said we would be charged for those items should they not show up. The people from our group that stayed in that room verified they never even used the beach basket and only one of the robes was ever worn. The used robe was left on the bathtub. I fully understand the hotel's need to take inventory on each room as they have to replace anything that was \"removed\" and taken as a \"souvenir\" by guests. However, their method of checking needs very much to be changed as it is offensive. Perhaps the butler concierge can have a list of items inventoried that the guests can fill out and sign when the butler concierge comes to their suite the day of departure and bids them goodbye. I'm sure guests would not object to this if it is handled in a professional and courteous way. When professionalism is so highly valued in every other way throughout the resort, professionalism is required at checkout also.

Had breakfast and lunch one day at Bistro and it took so long that we ended up eating at the breakfast and lunch buffet at Azul everyday. The buffet breakfast was good but lunch left a lot to be desired. On Christmas Eve, each restaurant had a Christmas menu which was very limited. A choice of two entrees. There should have been more variety given the price people paid for their holiday stay. The Dinner Concierges need to be trained better. They kept giving wrong information out about the signature restaurant. They showed us a tasting menu and said it was the only menu available. Once we were seated at the restaurant, the waiter gave us the tasting menu plus another complete menu. The concierge never told us that men must wear CLOSED shoes in the adult restaurants. We thought it was only flip flops. One of our friends arrived in dress leather sandals and was asked to go back to his room to change his shoes. However, women were allowed in wearing sandals. Rediculous rule. Evening activities- None. Most of the guests were families with young children or teens. The resort really should have planned some family evening activities given that it was Christmas week and they knew that the bulk of their guests would be families.

We stayed in the Master Suites (jungle rooms). It is a very well maintained, aesthetically beautiful property. The beach is very long and wide, very pretty. Getting from the master suites to the Ambassador beach property is effortless as there was always an air conditioned van, 2 min. drive, ready to take you to the beach/restaurants. Many people complaigned about not being close to the beach if you stayed in the Master Suites, but you get what you pay for!! If you want to spend more then you can stay by the beach...we enjoyed the Master Suites b/c it seemed much quiter then the main property. (Ambassador Suites) The Master Suites pool was spectacular and quite! Great kids club! Love Alfredo... THE BEACH: There are beach butlers to assist with chair setups, drinks and food. There were never enough chairs and umbrellas. By 8 am every chair and umbrella at the pool AND on the beach was spoken for. Just ridiculous... ROOMS: The rooms/bathrooms/balconies were beautiful and spacious. The room exceeded all our expectations. Beautiful decor. While showering though I stumbled upon a Scorpion. Scared my daughter & I tremendously so in the morning I had them move us to an upstairs room. (which took almost 1/2 a day to inform us where our room would be) RESTAURANTS: Breakfast in Chaka (sp.?) was consistently good.

If that's what you are looking for this place is it. Every morning a large crew of employees rakes and cleans the beach of all seaweed so the beaches are pristine and huge (no rows of lounge chairs here). Powder white sand and blue,warm water make the view from your room a pleasure. The spa is a must! Set back in the jungle not only are the massage therapists amazing but they have all these different hot/cold water treatments with clay, creams and conditioners. It is truly an experience you must do while there. Each person at the spa has an ear piece so you are always guided where to go next. The grounds here are beautiful. Some negatives -- you must get up early to save a lounge chair--there are plenty but it seems people reserve a lot and some never show up and the staff could do a better job of monitoring the situation. The food is very good here. You must make reservations in advance at the fancier restaurants and the meals are French Laundry-like and you may tire of it after 2 or 3 (we did two and that was enough).

Also make sure you are aware of where you book at this resort. The Master Suites are not by the beach but in the lush jungle area which some people love--personally I go to Mexico to go to the beach but some people stayed there and loved the serenity. There are more mosquitoes in this area so beware if you are prone to being biten (I got bit about 5 times and we stayed by the beach in December--can't imagine what it would be like in the summer--bring some spray). There is an Adults only pool/hotel called the Ambassador Suites and a family pool/hotel called just Ambassador-all part of the Grand Velas.

(We're here, day 3 on a 7 day trip.) We spent a small fortune to stay here ($800/night), and I figure some of you are contemplating the same decision, so I'd like to share some insights on this hotel. The Good: The hotel itself is gorgeous. No detail has been spared; it is clean beyond clean. The pools are all infinity pools, the beach has fine white sand, and is long and wide. The food is terrific at every restaurant, as good as food in New York City, and certainly better than any food I've ever had at a resort in Mexico or the Caribbean. The beds are soft, the bathroom is top notch (plunge jacuzzi), the spa is one of the nicest and most plush I've ever seen.. We're staying in a Master Suite, which is not on the beach. The website does not explain this clearly, but in my opinion, this is not a major issue. We asked to be upgraded (back in November) and were told that beachfront rooms cost an additional $660/night. We're glad for the quiet and tranquility at the jungle annex of the hotel, and enjoy the proximity to the spa and the Asian restaurant. The pool here is also fantastic, although a bit buggy. Shuttle service is never ever a wait, and it takes about 4 minutes to go from the jungle hotel to the beach. Truthfully, it's not a big deal to stay at the Master Suites, and if you are not travelling with children, you may even enjoy it a bit more. Contrary to what you may have heard, men do not need jackets to eat in the restaurants. We were told that there is a dress code, but then saw men in t-shirts and flip flops at the fanciest of restaurants. The Bad: I hope you like Las Vegas (the high-end Vegas). The Velas brothers, developers of this resort, clearly visited the Wynn Hotel in Vegas and told their architects \"build us a Wynn, but call it the Velas.\" The scale of the spaces are massive, like they would be in Vegas. The decor is very tasteful, but very heavy. It is not a beachy place (away from the beach.) It's like the Wynn, but less rococo. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to be aware of. This hotel is large, feels large, and is very slick and new. If you're looking for an old money beach resort, this is not it. This is as nouveau as it gets. It doesn't bother me, but it might bother some. There are not enough beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach to accomodate all the guests, so you will have to wake at dawn to mark your territory. If you are less a beach person than a pool person, this will not be an issue. There is plenty of beach, so I'm not sure why management doesn't invest in more chairs and umbrellas. Seems like a cheap problem to fix. We heard many guests complaining about this. The Ugly: On check-in, we were immediately approached by a friendly enough looking staff member who tried to pitch us on the sale of a fractional interest in the hotel. After a long flight and taxi ride, the last thing I want to do is have to ward off somebody trying to sell me a timeshare (which she assured me was not a timeshare, but couldn't explain the difference.) This is tacky, and the hotel should stop this practice immediately. Here is one thing that you must absolutely be aware of, because we were not, and honestly, it has cast a shadow of annoyance and frustration of our whole trip. All the restaurants in the hotel require reservations. We did not make them in advance, but tried to make them our first day on checking in. This process is horrifying. Nothing is computerized, and the 10-12 different concierges that man the desk do not coordinate with each other at all. We've made countless calls to the concierge, nobody has any record of us, never made any reservations, etc. Needless to say, it's made us want to pull our hair out. (Management: I suggest you invest in a simple computer system to simplify the absolutely asinine reservation process.) None of that would be horrific, if it weren't for the absolutely horrendous reservation system. Invariably, upon asking to eat at specific restaurants we are told \"Sorry, we have bad news, the restaurant is full.\" Again, a person could swallow this annoyance if it were true. Unfortunately, it's a bald faced lie. The restaurants are no more than 25% full. The entire aggravating reservation \"game\" is little more than an attempt to funnel the vast majority of hotel guests into attending one of the hotel's nightly buffets. Every time we have asked for a dinner reservation, we have been told that the restaurants are full, but that they have seated us at a buffet instead. Again, the restaurants are all nearly empty. If we are paying as much money as we are, and are told prior to booking that a big draw at the hotel is the quality of the restaurants and the food, but then are given the bait and switch away from the restaurants to eat at a mass feeding trough, then I should be told that is the game from the beginning. I don't mind the truth; I really hate deception. The Velas brothers have attempted to build a world class resort, and to a certain extent they have done so. But this annoying restaurant issue and the lack of beach chairs have been a major buzzkill. These issues are going to deter repeat guests which are the bread and butter of any successful resort.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cBest place I have stayed, amazing service and amenities!\u201d", "Author": "GinDandy", "ReviewID": "UR51973113", "Content": "We were here for my best friend's wedding and were blown away by the property, the service, the food (out of this world, especially for an all-inclusive) and overall atmosphere.

It was supposed to be a week but this place was so enjoyable that I rearranged our return flights and stayed one more day. I have traveled 50% of the time for a living for nearly 30 years--including extensive international travel throughout Asia and Europe. This has given me the opportunity to stay at some of the world's great hotels. Our experience at Grand Velas compares very favorably to any hotel experience I have had--which is amazing considering Grand Velas is an all inclusive resort! My experience with all inclusives has not been so good but the reviews on this website and the recommendation of a friend convinced me to give the hotel a try. I am sure glad we did! The good things: 1. Service was outstanding. We arrived on 12/17 before the holiday rush. It almost felt like a private resort at that point with staff to cater to your every whim. However, I knew things were going to get more crowded as Christmas approached and was worried about the staff's ability to cope with the influx of families. Although I will admit that service was not as good as the week went on (by the time we left, I think the hotel was pretty much full) this is to be expected considering the rise in occupancy. That said, service remained at a VERY high standard. 2. The food was amazing. We dined in every restaurant except Bistro and found them all great. Our favorites were the the Italian, the Asian and the French. Even the breakfast and lunch buffets were excellent--with new choices every day. I was fascinated at their ability to put enough new items on the buffet to keep things interesting. Not once was there a repetitive meal. And, no weak/diluted liquor at Grand Velas. Top shelf brands with a pour as much as you would like. 3. The facility itself is really top classs. I will agree that the rooms are not suites but they are very big rooms and are extremely stylish and very classy. We had an ambassador suite on the ground level which allowed us to enter from the pool. We loved this and rarely even locked the sliding glass door during the day. The grounds are impeccable, the beach fantastic and the pools sublime. And, I almost never take a bath in a hotel tub--except I could not resist this one and used it almost daily. 4. The spa is something you really need to experience. Such a relaxing break in the day. I did a 50 minute sport massage 4 times which included the use of the full spa. Great massage--ask for Cora. When I did the massage during the morning, I would come back and use the spa in the late afternoon at no charge. 5. 2 great fitness centers are at the hotel--one in ambassador and one in master areas. They are full of assorted and brand new Lifefitness equipment and are both the best gyms I have ever used in a hotel. What could be improved: 1. We loved the Italian restaurant when we visited it early in the week. When we went back when the resort was more full, they had made it into a buffet without warning us. It wasn't bad but it was no where near what we experienced the first time and just wish we would have been warned. 2. You have to sign a check after every meal. I was told this was for inventory control but am not buying it. I have to believe this is to encourage tipping. And, to make it even more unattractive, the \"price\" they list on the bill (which of course you do not pay) is SKY high--thereby encouraging even greater tipping if we lived here at a % basis like at other hotels. Grand Velas, get rid of this system. Charge us more if you have to on the front end but please discontinue this unattractive practice. Encouraging tipping at a buffet restaurant at an all inclusive resort is crazy. And, it was such a negative experience for me that other tips for people that deserved them more were shorted. Don't get me wrong--I did tip what I thought was a bunch. It is hard not to considering the service and how hard the employees work. I just always felt uncomfortable doing so and never knew if I was tipping enough--which, I think, discourages tipping altogether. 3. Not much to do at night. We were a family of 6 with 4 kids from 7 to 17 that are used to doing something after dinner. For me, it was GREAT--long day golfing or beaching meant I was ready for bed early anyway. But for some people this could be a problem. 4. I love my wines and there are some really interesting wines on the wine lists. Unfortunately, most of them carry an additional charge. The good new is that there are acceptable wines included as all inclusive. The bad news is that if you wanted to celebrate or have something special, the prices for the wines that were not all inclusive are crazy high. I am talking mark ups of sometimes 400% or more. Seems to me they would do better financially by actually encouraging us to upgrade wines. Unfortunately, the prices on the wine list completely discourage doing so. Some tips: 1. Try to visit in the off season. Not sure exactly when that would be but surely between Thanksgiving and Christmas. It was great having the hotel without so many guests (but again, the staff's ability to adjust to the influx of more guests was very good). 2. If you golf, you are right next door to Mayakabo. This is an interesting Greg Norman course that will host the PGA in Feb. They have an attractive twilight rate after 1:00 and even gave me 15 year old son an additional discount. Book this in advance as we couldn't ge it later in the week when things got busy. Also played Iberostar golf course (which the hotel has an arragement with) and found the layout actually more attractive but the condition of the course and overall experience not nearly as first class as Mayakabo. Still a fun outing and good value (again twilight rate) but Mayakabo was superior. 3. If you are traveling during high season, they will make your dinner reservations for you in advance rather than showing up and taking what you can get. Remember to make sure there are no buffets at the speciality restaurants when you book. 4. I would not hesitate to book the master (jungle) suites. In fact, I kind of liked the ambiance better over there--extremely beautiful grounds, very elegant pool area and even a more impressive lobby. I had originally booked two connecting suites in master class but changed because I got nervous about the trip back and forth to the \"main\" hotel and the beach. Well, I made several trips to master area for the restaurants and spa and not once did I have to wait even one minute for a shuttle bus. There was always one waiting. And, it was only a 5 minute ride. With 4 kids like mine who love the beach and are always forgetting stuff, I guess the extra money was worth it to be close to the beach. But if you don't have that situation, I would consider spending the difference in money at the spa. Sorry for the length of the review but hope you found it helpful. I used tripadvisor.com constantly but have never felt strongly enough about a hotel to write something up. That should tell you just how great I found this resort to be. It certainly is not exactly cheap but they do have some great package rates at certain times of the year and in terms of VALUE, I think you get what you pay for with Grand Velas. I know I will be back first chance I get!

My travel agent knows how picky I am, and when she mentioned Grand Velas in Riviera Maya I was a little nervous about it, in fact I had never been at an all inclusive resort before. This place is a great resort. I would estimate that there are at least 1,000 to 2,000 employees at this property who are here to help you have a great stay. The suites are beautiful, and spacious. The pools and the beach are very well kept. Since it is an all inclusive, you can eat and drink all day long if you choose, and the service level at the beach and pool are outstanding, yesterday there was a beautiful barbecue set up on the beach all day long, this is in addition to the many restaurants on site. The restaurants are really first rate, better than most restaurants, and the service is exquisite. Our personal butler (everyone is assigned one) is named Amelia, and she is doing a great job for us, attending to our every need. As for the negatives, there are a few: 1. Wireless internet service is very weak at some parts of the hotel, so you have to plug in. The hotel supplies ethernet cable though. 2. I see the beach and pool are getting more and more crowded each day as we get closer to Christmas, and you have to go down to the beach or pool early in the morning to reserve chairs and umbrellas, or you may be out of luck. THIS IS SOMETHING THE HOTEL REALLY NEEDS TO ADDRESS, BECAUSE THAT IS A TREMENDOUS INCONVENIENCE WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING TO BE SEATED WITH AN UMBRELLA AND CHAISE. They just started selling fractional vacations here. That can be a little bit of a turn off. They will engage you in friendly conversation at the front desk lobby area and try to get you to go on a tour of the facility. If you say no thanks, they will back off though. On a cloudy day, we did it. At the end of the presentation, you are given a voucher for a $150 credit in the spa, and also a voucher for a 3 or 4 night stay at any one of the three Velas resorts (not including the all inclusive meal upcharge). In our view it was worth the 1 and 1/4 hour we spent to receive the vouchers. Tip- For some reason, our travel agent booked us on the family friendly side of the Ambassador suites, even though our kids are 20 and 24. It is a little noisier on this side of the hotel, so I would recommend that anyone traveling with just adults stay on the adult side of the property, which is simply a few hundred yards to the other side, but still with complete beach access, on this point our travel agent was confused.", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cDON'T BOOK A MASTER SUITE!\u201d", "Author": "ava1974", "ReviewID": "UR51697400", "Content": "We were very disappointed with our stay at the Grand Velas!

Funny you do not get reimbursed when the web site promises an all day buffet but was open only once in the evening during our 10 day stay. When we voiced our concern that the buffet wasn't open at night, we were told to use the kids' club and then go to the adult restaurants. This was offensive as we would have chosen an adult only resort if we wanted to dine without our child. Rooms are fantastic as long as you stay in an Ambassador suite. Don't get fooled into booking a Master suite as those rooms are literally in the jungle, have NO view of the ocean, and you have to take a shuttle bus to get to the beach. The beach is beautiful.

I had norrowed it down to Riviera Maya and about two hotels, Grand Velas was my first choice but something kept me from booking it. The reviews I was reading here seemed so exaggerated that I kind of thought the people writing them had never gone to a hotel. The descriptions were so fantastic that I hesitated, the pics looked nice so I took the risk. BOY was I wrong in thinking people had exaggerated. This place is simply spectacular! I live in Miami which is a pretty trendy and expensive place. The 6 day stay I had in Grand Velas all inclusive would have had a price tag of about $30,000 here in Miami. I wish there would be a trust meter on this website, but since there is none please take my word for it..... at least $30,000, no joke. I am a pretty normal person, I like good things and I dont want to pay a fortune. I know that this is one of the more costly hotels in the area but it is worth more than what you pay. Lets start by saying that they dont cut corners on anything. ALL INCLUSIVE means ALL INCLUSIVE of all the best brands of liquor....Grey Goose Vodka, Don Julio Tequila, Remy Martin, Bacardi rums, etc. The bathroom stuff, you know the little shampoo, conditioner, lotions, soap, etc. all are Molton Brown. I did stay in the Grand Class so I dont know if all the rooms have Molton Brown, but they probably do. One of my biggest concerns was the beach, I had read that it may be rocky or not as pretty. Wrong again, the sand is cleaned and tendered to every morning. White sand and plenty of spaces to lay out. They have placed artificial reefs further out that break the waves and create perfect clear water no rock areas all over. There are parts with rocks but there are plenty of parts without. You can order whatever you want at the beach or the pool, there is always someone there to serve you. If you go look for Humberto, amazing guy. I dont want to write a really long review because then people dont read it, but to \"kind\" of sum it all up... You will NOT regret this trip. Just Book it. Everything is immaculate, the spa is not included but it is also worth every penny. I have no doubt that the spa will come out as one of the Best in the World pretty soon. The restaurants are all 5 star restaurants, the food at the pool is better than most mexican restaurants here in Miami. GIVE NO IMPORTANCE TO THE BAD REVIEWS, there is a section where the spa is that is called the Master Suites. This is a different section, farther from the beach and in the jungle, extremely beautiful as well, a 2 minute max van ride to the main lobbies and the beach. So now you are warned. The service is trully second to none, everyone is as polite as people can be. A BIG Thanks to Rafael from the Grand Class Concierge, his attention to service is inspiring.

We were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday and looking for a romantic hotel offering five star amenities in a fun and gorgeous location. To cut to the chase, we were INCREDIBLY disappointed to arrive at the Grand Velas only to discover that jungle \"view\" actually meant, in literal terms, \"a separate hotel miles from the beach.\" I do not see how this hotel will survive at it's price range given that all the photographs and descriptions on virtually every travel site depict what I consider to be a completely separate hotel, no where near where the \"Master Suites\" are located. One doesn't fly all the way to the Riviera Maya to stay no less than 4 miles from any beach - no exageration, one could not phyically walk from the Master Suites to the beach, one MUST board a shuttle bus to ride from an isolated, separate albeit upscale hotel to get to the beach. There is NOTHING on the Grand Velas web site that makes it clear to the purchaser that the Master Suites are not merely facing the back side of the hotel as is the case with most \"beach hotels\" offering \"jungle view\" rooms/suits, but LITERALLY this was a separate building several miles away from the beach and completely buried on all sides by jungle vegetation and mosquitoes. Yes, the room descriptions indicate \"jungle views\" but that is a far cry from reality and the web site designers must have had the underhanded intent to mislead readers as to the actual layout and location of the Grand Velas Master Suite hotel. When we asked for a map of the grounds at the front desk upon check-in, which was after dark, even the map was so disjointed as to mislead us into thinking we were near the ocean and perhaps quick stroll through the grounds might lead us there to hear the waves - wrong! After wandering aimlessly for about an hour, we began to realize we'd been duped. So we stayed less than 12 hours before checking out and moving to a hotel that really is on the beach (Ritz Carlton in Cancun - granted, it's not the same idea that we were going for, but at least they had 5 star service, large, elegant suites available when we needed them and with an ocean view). So if you are looking for a nice beach experience but insistent on staying at the Grand Velas, beware - do not book a Master Suite, you will NOT get what you are paying for. You MUST book a room in the Grand or Ambassador hotels - which are indeed completely separate facilities and not the same hotel, regardless of what the web sites may say. The only connection is the brand name and the main guard gate entrance. Once behind the entrance wall, there is a separate road, separate lobbies and miles of jungle between the Master Suite facility and the ocean suite facilities. We did make several attempts to upgrade and move to be nearer the ocean, but due to a large wedding a corporate function, we were left with no choice but to check out of Grand Velas altogether before losing another day of our vacation. One more point to note, though the Master Suite hotel was virtually devoid of all human life (we only saw two other hotel guests during our 12 hour stay), at night it was actually quite loud. The few hotel guests that were there must have been huddled up in there suites and they all seem to order room service. The room service cart wheels sound like freight trains coming down the hall at all hours of the night (this began at midnight and continued past 3:00 am, despite the very limited \"after hours\" menu). Every cart that came by, and there were many, would surely \"wake the dead\" as they so rudely woke us from our restless slumber. So even if you are looking for quiet seclusion, the \"quiet' is a definitely let down in the Master suite hotel.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellence beyond words\u201d", "Author": "SMANDP", "ReviewID": "UR48752089", "Content": "We have just returned from our stay at the Grand Velas , and have not stopped thinking about how incredible our stay there was. The moment we stepped out of our transportation we were greeted with a cold towel and a warm smile. Our Room Ambassador Class - had all the amenities you could ask for. Large though not technically one bedroom suites with beautiful view of the ocean and the pool. Very comfortable king size bed with comfy bed coverings. Bathroom had a very large shower, Jacuzzi tub overlooking your room with a separate water closet. Large walk in closet was a great plus for us. Free wireless internet was great, we did hear from some of the staff that they will change that next year, and you will have to pay for it. Nice large patio with queen size lounger and bistro set. Mini bar was decent (as decent as you can expect a mini bar to be) with good snacks which were re-stocked daily. We liked the added touch of the tequila, wine and Champaign in our room, we did not drink any of them as we drank plenty outside of the room. So we are not sure if they get re-stocked. Beach-well groomed and actually had a few large areas that you can swim in without worrying about rocks, which is rare for this area. We stayed at other hotels in Mayan and found the waters to be very rocky. We even met some people from another resort swimming in what we liked to call \u201cour spot\u201d and we could not stop singing the praises about our resort. I think I was making the couple jealous by saying all the wonderful things we were experiencing. The beach service was incredible, the staff if on the ball the moment you finish a drink they are right there with another one. We spend most of our time at the beach and had lunch on the beach a few times with was delicious. Restaurants \u2013 Food is very important to us as we love to try new restaurant and we love to talk about food, think about food and more importantly eat it. Our favorites were Frida and Piaff with Luca coming in third, although we enjoyed all our meals very much. We stayed for 8 days and were lucky to try all the restaurants at least ones. We returned for the second time to Frida and Piaff and were greeted by our original waiter from Piaff saying that he was honored that we returned and wished us a wonderful evening. All the staff knew our names. The attention to detail is without a doubt, unparalleled. From changing your knife after you buttered your bread only once to placing a new napkin on the table after you leave to go to the restroom. The food presentation was beautiful the flavors remarkable and the service top notch. What blew us away is one night at the Frida restaurant my husband asked the waiter which dish the chef enjoyed cooking the most and which one he feels is his best and next thing we knew the chef was standing at our table waiting to give us a suggestion. We could not stop talking about it after he left. We also though it was brilliant when the chef from Piaff came over to each table after we finished our meal and asked personally how we enjoyed the food. This shows that the chef take great pride in what they do, and look for suggestions to make it better. Spa- I loved it so much that I had 3 treatments done. You must try the spa at least once you will not be disappointed. With each treatment I received a water journey which was very relaxing and something you must try . They take you through different rooms with include the sauna, steam room, ice room, different kinds of showers and last a nice vibrating water bed. Again, top notch service at the spa. We met some wonderful people during our stay. Lena who is part or the entertainment staff was always asking what we wanted to do that day. Karla our concierge was always friendly and ready book our restaurants reservations. She always had a smile on her face and asked us if there is anything we needed. Tipping \u2013 we tipped big time, more than we have ever tipped at other resort, and you can\u2019t help but tip here, everyone from beach service to room service, to restaurant service tries so hard to make your stay an enjoyable one. These people make very little and work so hard. I even wanted to give the grounds keeper a tip but felt weird just coming up to him and giving his a one, so we ask him to take a picture of us and tipped him for that. You get a bill after restaurant service this is just for inventory check; we tipped with cash and just signed the bill. Some people complained about this, but it\u2019s not a big deal. I would like to finish by saying that the management together with the entire staff at the Gran Velas are doing a phenomenal job that truly represents \u201cExcellence\u201d We have stayed in many hotels all over the world and were never floored with the service we received. This is the first and only place we without a doubt cannot wait to return to. We wish more people would find out about this hotel because it\u2019s so wonderful that we want to share it with everyone we know. We are planning our next trip as we speak this time we will bring our daughter with us she was the only thing that was missing. This place is truly a home away from home.

The overall service is beyond un-real...we have stayed at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties quite a bit and nothing compares to the service we received at Grand Velas....everybody knows your name, every person we came across couldn't do enough for you- we wanted to watch a football game and they put it on in a bar that closes at 3 PM so we could watch it....and our waiter from the pool came in (Ernesto- the best waiter in the world) and kept serving us drinks! The food is also outstanding; we loved Piaf and Frida- breakfast at Azul was amazing also- everything is fresh and delicous. Even simple food (like nachos) was great! The beach is great and the pools are outstanding. All of the liquor is top shelf and the beer is not tap, but right out of the bottle.....simply great in every aspect. Tipping: I tipped (you get a check to sign when you finish a meal / bar tab) even though tips are included....the level of service was simply too high not to tip the staff- just my opinion, but with how the economy is in Mexico I felt it was the least I could do.

The service is incredible, we felt like it was our own hotel and were catered to for our every whim. Everyone that we encountered was extremely polite and friendly. I have to say that the pool was great and the pool service was great. Two people that stand out are Orion ( a pool server) and Gaspar the pool bartender. Both went above and beyond our expectations. Orion brought us drinks before we new we needed another and was always there to give us a new towel. Gaspar made one great drink after another, and if we didn't like it he would give us a new one. (We liked every drink). Our kids loved the kids club, alot of video games and fun things to do. One suggestions would be to have an outside play area with sand so kids can play outdoors. The restaurants and room service are amazing. Frida had amazing margaritas and incredible mexican food. Piaf was gorgeous to be in and the food was great.

I live in the UK and travelled to Cancun to visit my sister who had booked 3 nights in this hotel for us for a bit of relaxation and rest. We arrived after travelling short distance from cancun (about 1 hour) and from the moment we stepped foot in the hotel all our stresses were gone. It is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed. I have travelled quite extensively to places such as Thailand, Singapore, Bali, USA, and Dubai and can quite simply say that Grand Velas is on parr with the likes of the Atlantis Palm Hotel in Dubai but as this is an all inclusive hotel in my opinion is better. We just could not simply believe it was all inclusive (as everything was so high quality) and after arriving and having lunch in the Azul restaurant had to check with receiption just to make sure. We quite simply thought we were in a dream. We stayed in the Grand Class room with private plunge pool and fantastic facilities. We both loved sitting on our balcony with a drink out of the mini bar, as the sun was going down and just listening to the sound of the ocean - a memory that will stay with us forever. The food, service, staff and general feel of this hotel exceed both of our expectations and we both had to keep pinching ourselves as we have never stayed in such an amazing peaceful place. The 3 nights we were there we tried the Frida Restaurant, Piaf Restaurant and the Lucas Restuarant. I am not a big fan of Mexican food but my sister persuaded me to go to the Frida and all I will say that this was by far our favourite restaurant but have to say the level of service and the gastronomic delight in all three did not disappoint us. We would both love to take our husband's back as no words can describe how amazing this place is and we both think it is something that has to be experienced at least once in a life time. The only thing that surprised me is that when trying to look for the hotel back in the UK I found it difficult to access. I guess if you from the UK and wanted to book then as no agents I have found in the UK offer this hotel you would have to book direct with the hotel.

The Grand Velas quite simply stood head and shoulders above every all-inclusive and compared favorably with the most exotic hotels and resorts. Comparatively, it was an amazing bargain. The service is something to rave about. At the pool, the beach, the front desk and in the restaurants everyone went out of their way to assure that we had everything we needed and more. They couldn't have been more gracious. We were in the adults only area and the suites were amazing from the private plunge pools to the wonderful bedding, the flat screen, the expansive bathroom and great products.

Our dream is of a luxurious beautiful resort with high quality accommodations, fine dining, professional service, and friendly staff. After staying at the Grand Velas for 10 nights we have found \u201cour\u201d place. Simply put, everything at the Grand Velas is of the highest quality, and in our opinion the Grand Velas is far superior to any of the Ritz Carlton / Four Seasons hotels we\u2019ve visited. Many of the reviews here discuss the layout of the hotel, the pool, etc. \u2013 so I wont repeat things other than to say that the entire resort is simply beautiful, with high quality furnishings inside and out. Everything is spotlessly clean inside and out. But what was very impressive to us is the level of attention to detail that is everywhere at Grand Velas. Never in ten days did we see so much as a spot on one of the glasses or table settings (confirmed with the staff they are each individually hand polished). The glasses are Riedel. The plates even in the casual restaurant Azul are Noritake china, the ones in the fine dining restaurants are Villeroy and Boch. All of the chaise loungers by the pool are made of high quality wood, outfitted with padded cushions (cleaned and changed nightly), and thick comfy cotton towels. High quality bed linens are crisp, white, and changed daily. Even pool side snacks are delivered in beautiful dark wooden boxes with linen napkins and fine silverware. The staff is constantly scrubbing, vacuuming, gardening, and maintaining this beautiful property. Everywhere, every member of the staff greets you with a smiling \"Buenos Dias, Buenos Tardes, or Buenos Noches\" Dining at the Grand Velas is a 5 star experience. Because we were there for 10 nights, we were able all of the restaurants, many multiple times, and each better than the next. Here\u2019s where the Grand Velas service really shines. To begin, as you approach the elevator or podium to the restaurant, a smiling attendant checks your reservation and greets you by name. You are then escorted to the restaurant hostess, who greets you by name and escorts you to your table, which has a little welcome card with your name. on it You are introduced to your server \u201cteam\u201d, which includes a head waiter, assistant waiter, and other runner type staff. You are always addressed by name (Senor and Senora ____). The experience starts with a cool scented towel (we had Jasmine, Violet, Anise, and others), presented and collected on a tray with silver tongs. All meals start with an \u201camuse bouche\u201d. At different restaurants some of the amuse bouche we enjoyed on different nights included carrot cappuccino, grilled shrimp, lobster wonton, pineapple snow. All meals are served by multiple servers with the plates presented to everyone at the table the same time, and with the server describing every component of the dish, including instructions from the chef on how to mix, construct, and eat everything tableside. Never is an empty glass or dirty dish, or so much as a straw wrapper allowed to sit on your table for more than a few minutes. In fact, dirty dishes are whisked away undercover, so they are not walked through the restaurant. Below I\u2019ll give a brief description of each restaurant: Piaf \u2013 We visited this restaurant once. Many people love it, but it wasn\u2019t my husband\u2019s favorite (not that he disliked it, he just found others more to his preference). At Piaf we enjoyed oysters, lobster veloute, lamb, and filet of sole and apple tart flamed tableside. SenLin \u2013 This restaurant was a favorite ours, and we at here three nights. We highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and especially the service. You must ask for the server Daniel, who is a true professional and can help you recommendations from the Asian fusion menu. We celebrated our anniversary night at SenLin, and the staff had our table strewn with rose petal flowers, and made a special anniversary dessert for us. Even the Chef came out at the end of our meal to wish us Happy Anniversary. We felt \u201cat home\u201d at Sen Lin, and saved it as our meal for the last night. Our favorite dishes at Sen Lin included the lobster appetizer under a glass of garam masala smoke, and the beef noodle dish. On the last night, as we approached the restaurant, Daniel and the dining room manager both held the doors wide open for us, greeting us warmly like old friends, and escorted us to our table with our favorite drinks (mai tais) waiting for us. My husband didn\u2019t feel well that night (nothing to do with dinner), and Daniel was truly concerned, and went out of his way to find him some chamomile tea. Frida \u2013 We ate at Frida once, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The restaurant is modern, with a huge wall water sculpture. It features a Margarita Trolley with margaritas made at the moment to order. We enjoyed delicious chilpachole seafood soup, red snapper, and filet, followed by tres leche cake and sweet potato flan. Lucca \u2013 The Italian restaurant I believe is in a temporary location in the Master Suites area (Jungle section). The restaurant is very nice (it would be the nicest d\u00e9cor of any restaurant where we live in Albany NY), but it is not at the same scale of d\u00e9cor as the other restaurants just yet. We ate at Lucca twice and enjoyed it very much. Our favorite items there were the steak, lasagna, and clam cream soup. A very special romantic touch at both Lucca and SenLin is that they are housed in the \u201cJungle\u201d section of the hotel, reachable by complimentary van ride. This jungle section is gorgeous, and in our opinion loses nothing by not being directly on the beach. It features many winding thatched covered walkways through mangroves and a cenote, all romantically lit. One of our favorite things to do was to have dinner at one of these places and go for an evening walk around the property. Cocina de Autor \u2013 This restaurant is simply one of the best we have experienced in our entire life. It amazes me that the Grand Velas is able to offer this type of food and experience at an all inclusive resort. We ate at Cocina 3 times, and if you appreciate trying different types of foods and molecular gastronomy, it is an absolute must do Damian, our server, helped guide us through the menu, and also selected wine pairings for us for each course. Damian told us \u201cthe rules\u201d. First, if there is something you don\u2019t like, they gladly take it away and bring you something else. Second, if there is something you like and want a larger portion, all you have to do is ask. This restaurant will literally bring you whatever you want. After our second night of dining there, they introduced us to the chefs \u2013 Mikel Alonso and Xavier. Chef Alonso is celebrity chef with a 3 star Michelin pedigree! What a treat it was to meet both him and Chef Xavier and talk to them about their menu. As we were talking, they invited us back the following night for a special menu they would prepare for us, based on them asking us questions about our likes and dislikes. Words cannot describe just how special the food and service was for that meal, we are truly grateful that we were honored with such an experience. We\u2019ve eaten in fine restaurants all over the world, and we cannot remember a meal better than the one we were served that might by Chef\u2019s Mikel Alonso and Xavier \u2013 the food and the service were that good. And if you eat at Cocina de Autor you must ask for Damian and Ramon. They are the best servers you will find anywhere in the world. I also recommend a special dessert, not on the menu, but served only by Damian and Ramon. They call it \u201cHelado Escondido\u201d, please make sure to ask one of them for it. Azul \u2013 Azul is the casual restaurant open during our stay for breakfast and lunch. Meals are offered either by the buffet or ala carte, or a mixture of both. The buffet items are rotated each day, and are always fresh. This buffet represents quality over quantity, although there is a very good variety of food. Breakfast features more types of fresh squeezed juices than I\u2019ve ever seen, as well as a huge selection of fruits, yogurts, cheeses, and American Breakfast items such as pancakes, French Toast, and bacon, as well as Mexican specialties such as Chilaqueles, tostadas, different types of eggs and salsas, as well as atoles and hot chocolate. Lunch offerings are of similar variety and quality. This buffet is immaculately clean. In fact, as soon as you use a serving spoon on a dish, it is replaced with a clean one. The staff will carry your plates to your table, and is \u201cover the top\u201d at serving you tableside. We met some special people here, and I hope they are all recognized by Grand Velas Management as being the best: Miguel, Reyes, Rosemary, Hector (Victor), Jose Luis, and Omar. Pool Service at the Grand Velas is also in a class by itself. The pool area is simply breath taking, and well thought out with its use of different types of sun and shade places to sit, including built in coves and lounge areas in the water for sunbathing. Our favorite spot was under a wooden structure that allowed in some dappled sunlight, but still provided some shelter from the sun and heat. Each area comes with its own pool butler, who will approach you and help you adjust your lounge chair and/or umbrella, and cover it with fresh towels for you. They immediately bring you bottles of water on ice, as well as offer you any type of bar drink or soft drink you want. Throughout the day these wonderful guys check on you, replenish your ice and water, and will bring your lunch if you want, from a bar menu. This isn\u2019t usual bar food \u2013 it\u2019s very fresh ceviches, salads, sandwiches, etc. My favorite was the Caribbean shrimp cocktail. Special thanks to Leandro (Ignacio), Marco, and Enrique for making our vacation so special. These guys were always there for us, providing us cold towels, drinks, or to just say hello. We very much enjoyed getting to know them and they are each an asset to the Grand Velas. With all the swimming and eating we did at the Grand Velas, we also did some relaxing in our room\u2026..and what a room it was! We had an Ambassador Suite, on the 4th floor. The room is huge, and so clean you could eat off the floor. The bathroom had a walk in rain shower, separate commode area, and jetted tub. It featured Molton Brown amenities and large quality towels. Our bed had high quality linens and a down comforter. The room also had a DVD and iPod player, and a 42 inch plasma TV. We also had a huge balcony with a bed. My only complaint is that we requested a nonsmoking room, as we are pretty bothered by cigarette smoke. Our room was fine, but our neighbors were constantly smoking on their balcony so we weren\u2019t able to use ours as much as I would have liked. Each suite comes with a butler concierge, and we were very fortunate to be assigned Karla. Karla was such a big part of our stay, she was always there for us, ready to help with any request. We didn\u2019t have to remember to make any reservations for dinners, because Karla would find us at the pool each day and ask what we wanted.. She searched us out and checked on us each day, arranged all of our transportation, and on the last day when we were running late and all the bellmen were busy, she herself helped carry some of our luggage (and she is a small girl). Our our ten night stay, Karla was not our concierge for the first three or four nights\u2013 and although I wouldn\u2019t say I was unhappy with the first concierge, I can say that he never came to find us, and we always had to call the front desk when we needed something. Karla turned everything around and we loved meeting her, and hope to stay with her again. Last but not least, I would like to mention the spa. We\u2019ve been to some of the most famous spas in the world, and none of them are better than the spa at the Grand Velas. While there, my husband had a massage and I had a facial, and both were excellent. I will try to describe my spa experience. Upon entering the spa, you are given a cool towel and herbal water drink. The lockers and changing rooms are top of the line, with wooden lockers, and high quality robes and slippers. The changing room also offers showers, blow dryers, and high quality Molten Brown washes and shampoos. Complimentary with each treatment of 50 minutes or more is the \u201cMayan Water Journey\u201d. It can also be purchased individually for $50. The journey lasts about an hour and takes you through different experience rooms, all designed to soothe, rest, or invigorate your mind body and spirit. An ever-present but noninvasive spa butler is there to guide you through the process. My water journey started with the sauna room. The butler suggested 5-10 minutes (I chose 5), and she handed me a cool mist bottle for the room. After about 5 minutes I heard her gentle knock on the door, and I smiled as I left the sauna and saw that she had laid a foot mat and flowers outside the door for me to step out on. She then led me to the Rain shower for a quick cooloff. After the rain shower, she gave me a bottled water and led me to the Eucalyptus scented steam room. This steam room is round, huge, and dark - except for the planetarium style colored lights on the ceiling which change color. As would become the case for each room, as I left the steam room, I had the mat and flowers laid at my feet again. From the steam room I was guided to the Ice Room, which was one of my favorites. The ice room was icy white with large windows open to the jungle. It had a big bin of crushed ice, with a crushed ice fountain continuously replenishing it. The bin had several scented wash cloth sized towels rolled in the ice, and the butler instructed me to rub them on my face and body to close my pores. Wheeeew! After the steam room it felt great! After the ice room I was led to the clay room \u2013 which is a slightly less steamy room with different kinds of clay (one for sunburn, one for moisture, and a hair conditioning solution). I was instructed to paint the clay on my body and wait about 5-10 minutes to rinse it off with the handheld showers. Nice! After the clay room I was led to more \u201cexperience showers\u201d \u2013 a variety of hot, warm, and cold water that is on an automatic program to turn on and off and to soak you in all different directions. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, I was then led to the hydropool area for soaking, and water massages of all angles and strengths. The journey ended with a quick dip in hot and cold plunge pools. And all this was BEFORE my treatment!! I see I\u2019m getting pretty lengthy here with my review, but I just cant say enough about so many aspects of the Grand Velas. Five stars is simply not enough for this resort, and we cannot wait to return. The entire experience, and especially the staff, is exceptional in so many ways. I think Ramon, the server from Cocina de Autor summed it up best for us one night. He said \u201cThis is your house, and we are here to serve you\u201d. Thank you, Ramon, everyone there did make us feel like Grand Velas is \u201cour place\u201d. We have found the place we were dreaming about.

I stayed at Grand Velas in an Ambassador Grand Class suite for 2 nights, in addition to Le Blanc. Grand Velas Resort and Sp, spread over a VAST area of 'manglar' (swamp), is incredibly beautiful and well-appointed. It is important to note, however, that one must be very diligent in knowing which category of suite to book for one's pleasure (and pocketbook). The resort rooms are literally over one mile apart from one another. The Ambassador and Ambassador Grand Class suites are oceanfront, and the Master Suites are over a mile from the other rooms AND THE BEACH! The Master Suites are built around various cenotes, waterways, streams, and lush with vegetation...but let's face it...they're built around a swamp...replete with swamp bugs and such. The convention center, which is quite extraordinary, is the focal point of the Master Suites section. Pay the extra money for the beachfront suites. They are a destination unto themselves. Also, in the remote and 'forested' areas far from the beach is their amazing spa. I've been to many spas around the world, but this one was a doozy! Water features and various bubbling sections in the main pool delighted all my fellow spa participants. (one small complaint, though, was that swimsuits were mandatory, and it's hard to get a full body cleansing and benefits from the various waters if you cannot be naked.) I liked the clay room, and the ice room, in particular. The therapists were gracious and began their treatments with a ceremonial foot cleansing ritual. They used high-quality brand-name products for their spa, massage and treatment areas. It's also important to note that the spa is two stories with NO elevator access. If you are wheelchair traveling, or cannot do stairs with ease, this is NOT the spa for you. Food was great, although I only ate one dinner and breakfast daily (via room servce) during my short stay. The room service was probably the best I've encountered on land (Regent has the best room service at sea). EVERY detail, and then some, was anticipated for the service, and the presentation, food and affect were top-shelf. The beach at the Grand Velas was wonderful, but do note they had a near-solid line of diesel-truck sized sand bags offshore to protect the pristine and expansive beach. Some people do not like to see those sand bags, but they have become a necessity in the Riviera Maya region to protect the shoreline. Please consider this resort as an option for you if you are a high-end vacationer. I had toured the Banyan Tree, Ritz Carlton Cancun, the Tides, and this product definitely has its niche. ...but watch your room category!!", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cShould be a 5 Diamond Hotel!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mrrivard", "ReviewID": "UR42290337", "Content": "My husband, 18 month old son and I recently stayed at the Grand Velas Riviera Maya from 9/5/09 - 9/12/09 and neither words, nor pictures can express how wonderful our stay was. But I'm going to try:) Check In: We arrived at the hotel at around 3:00pm by shuttle from the airport. From the moment we drove through the front gate, I could feel myself relax. We were greeted with scented cool towels and wonderful, fresh iced tea. We were all welcomed by name and were seated on comfortable furniture to check in. We were then brought to our room in the Ambassador Family section by our personal butler/concierge, Monserrat, and explained all of the features and how to use them. Monserrat was the most professional, detail oriented and kind person! So wonderful and sincerely enjoyed her job. She always had our reservations made, details planned, appointments confirmed and all the time with a gentle smile. Thank you so much Monse! We miss you. Room: The room was huge. It is a very large open area with a work station and sitting area. There was also a minibar as well as snacks and a pod style coffee maker with a coffee and tea selection. The bathroom was enormous with a walk in shower, separate camode, double sinks, vanity area and large jacuzzi. An array of Molten Brown products were provided for our use. They included such things as the usual shampoo and conditioner, soap and shower cap but also included a mending kit, vitamin lip balm and wonderful soaking products. I'm sure I'm forgetting many.... The closet is large and offers hanging room as well as drawers and a safe. This is where you will find your robes and slippers, beach bag with towels, iron and ironing board, hair dryer as well as bags for your laundry and shoe shine. They also provided umbrellas in case it rained, which we were so lucky that it did not during out stay. We had a king size bed with high quality sheets and duvet, comforter and pillows. There was also a pillow menu with several choices in case you found the need to change pillows. We found the bed extremely comfortable which I was so pleased about. Usually, we find the beds far too firm in the resorts we have stayed at in the past. Not so here... we did not want to get up in the morning! They also had a crib in the room with wonderfully soft sheets and blanket for my son. Oh, and did I mention the terrace? Enormous! A large built in bed and a table for two. Our room overlooked the infinity pool and the turquois sea. Such a treat to look at every day! Food: The food was phenomenal. We went to Cocina de Autor, Frida, Sen Lin, Lucca and Azul. We did not visit Piaf as we only used the babysitting service once (which I will get to). All of the restaurants were amazing with the most creative meals bursting with flavor. I literally thought I had died and gone to heaven. Food is very important to us on a vacation and this food was 5 diamond calibur every time. While I was never disappointed, I enjoyed Lucca and Sen Lin the most. Be sure to get the tasting menu at Sen Lin and the Trilogy dessert at Lucca. Mmmmm..... The staff at each restaurant wanted nothing more than to make your culinary exerience an unbelievable memory and the succeeded. The manager of each restaurant greeted us and introduced us to our waiters who took such good care of us, it felt like we were their family. Beach / Pool: The beach was wide and long and the water was so calm, clear and soft that even my son loved it. I noticed that some people say it was rocky. I only walked in in the very clear areas and had no problem. I never once wore water shoes. There were 3 pools that seemed to end in each other. The first was the kids pool... perfect for my son. He loved walking around while we held his hand. Then the next pool was deeper and the next pool ended at the pool bar area. The beach and pool areas are both lined with beds, paded loungers and tables and chairs in case you wanted to eat there instead of the restaurants. The beach and pool concierge were wonderful. A special thanks to Daniel who was always there to put up our umbrella or get us a cappaccino (or anything else we wanted)!!! Childcare: I originally picked this hotel because I wanted to find a place that would be good for my son as it is difficult to find fine hotels that welcome children. Especially his age... After a referral from another visitor to this hotel, I cancelled our reservations at the Azul Sensatori and booked here at the Grand Velas. Boy am I glad I did! Our son was always taken care of and pampered by every single staff member. We utilized the babysitting service (which is extremely professional) one night and went to Cocina de Aurtor and then into Playa Del Carmen. Toni (our babysitter) was so wonderful!! She contacted me twice by my request with updates on how he was. He actually felt so comfortable with her that he fell asleep early! It was such a treat to have an \"adult\" night out. Also, they do have a kids club for children ages 5-12. It is open from 9am to 10pm and has lots of cool stuff available for kids:) Nightlife: This resort is very quiet and if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of nightlife, then this probably isn't the place for you. The fact that the occupancy rate was low when we were there probably had something to do with it too. A convention came in at the end of our stay and I did notice more people in the bars at night when they were there. The fact that it is quiet at night in no way takes away from the appeal of this resort. Spa: I took advantage of the spa twice while we were there. Both times I experienced the water journey and then a massage. By far, the most relaxing experience I have ever had. I could write an entire book just on this... but I'll just say that if you visit the Grand Velas and skip the spa, you are TRULY missing out. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a treatment or two. They are actually quite cheap for the pampering you receive. Staff: While the Grand Velas Resort & Spa is an example of architecural genius, this hotel would only be a structure without the amazing staff that run it. It amazed me all week the calibur of staff that they have found for their team. We wanted for nothing and were made to feel like royalty the whole time we were there. There are far too many names to mention but our trip would not have been all it was if it were not for every one of them. We miss them and cannot wait to return (hopefully this winter)! Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for this resort. You will not be disappointed!

It was just incredible. Everything you read in the posted reviews is true. I really could not think of anything that could have been better \u2013 they really thought about all the little details. We\u2019ve travelled a number of times to Mexico and Cuba and stayed at all-inclusive resorts, and stayed at some nice high-end hotels elsewhere (Bowery Hotel, Gild Hall in New York). The Grand Velas is without question, the best hotel we\u2019ve ever visited. Check-in: Quick, easy and comfortable check-in. All the staff wear headsets and are in communication with one another. So, when we arrived at the entrance, the gate staff alerted the lobby staff that we were en route. At the lobby, we were seated in comfortable sofas, given cool scented cloths and a delicious, cold-tea beverage to enjoy, while the quick check-in was completed. Then, we were escorted to our room area by another staff member, given a quick tour and briefing on the amenities, and then met outside our room by our concierge. Note \u2013 our concierge changed a couple of times during our stay, but all were great and very helpful. It is true that they do not sit all day at their desk, but they are easily contacted by phone (Butler Concierge button) whenever you need anything. Room: Huge, clean, beautiful, luxurious! We stayed in an Ambassador Class room with a wonderful view of the pool and ocean. I really couldn\u2019t believe how nice the room was \u2013 it was just perfect. I loved the make-up vanity area particularly as well as the large walk-in closet. Our room was beautifully made up every day and our bed turned down every night. I loved walking in after dinner and hearing the music for the Grand Velas promotional channel that they would turn it to each night (I joked that it was their propaganda video that was unnecessary \u2013 we\u2019re already there! \u2013 they should actually post it on their website!). I can\u2019t tell you how well the room was cleaned every day. I think the staff actually wiped down and polished all of the furniture each day (I remember feeling badly about leaving some residual suntan lotion stickiness on an armrest, thinking I should wipe it off \u2013 next day \u2013 clean!). Pool / Beach: Awesome! The beach is so immaculately groomed \u2013 it was like walking on sugar. There are some rocks in the water, which we knew about in advance and so packed water shoes, but we also found very large clear areas of water that were rock-free. Our favourite spot for an ocean dip was at the end of the property on the Ambassador side \u2013 there was no need for water shoes in this area. I loved the pool and I am not normally a pool person. It was very big and clear with great little sitting areas built in (away from the swim up bar) where I would sit for long stretches enjoying a cocktail. The service around the pool and beach was incredible as noted by others. We always had ice bowls full of bottled water as soon as we sat down on a lounger; the staff would check on us regularly to offer drinks, food, cold towels and one day, mini-Evian spritzers which I loved! Food: Amazing \u2013 fine dining throughout. The food and service is on par with some of the finest restaurants we\u2019ve eaten at in our hometown (Toronto). Since we\u2019ve been home, not once have we been offered even some measly lobster salt when we\u2019ve eaten out! \uf04a We ate at all of the restaurants and loved all of them! The menus were extensive \u2013 there were so many things that I wanted to try \u2013 no shortage of selection. I think our favourite restaurant, if we had to pick one, was Lucca. Room service was a special treat here. The food is presented in an incredible manner. It felt like we were sitting at one of their restaurants when we ordered in and had our room service table set up. We ordered room service lunches 3 times over our stay and each time, it took less than 20 minutes. Gym: My husband said he fell in love when Victor showed him how to hook up his iPod on the treadmill to watch movies on the treadmill screen. I loved working out at this gym and I am normal and don\u2019t usually use \u201clove\u201d and \u201cgym\u201d in the same sentence. The equipment is top of the line, new, clean and a pleasure to use. Overall: We\u2019ve travelled a bit and are used to having to call a couple of times when you need something at a hotel (i.e. we had just stayed at the Thompson LES in NYC prior to coming to Grand Velas and had to call maintenance a few times to come and fix our TV). Obviously, not a big deal and you know that hotel staff are busy and sometimes requests are forgotten. At the Grand Velas, we first of all, had almost nothing to request because everything was taken care of, but we did have to call a few times about some minor things (problems with the safe; getting more bottled water in the room etc). Each time, there was someone at our door within minutes. This was just incredible to me. I mean \u2013 how did they even walk to our room so quickly?! I think this is a good example of the excellent service and professional staff that work here.

This resort is truly in a league of its own and we loved every aspect of our stay. Attention to detail is excellent and we were continually impressed with the quality of our experience. Grand Velas is Mexican owned and the d\u00e9cor reflects this. The architecture is open and the materials natural. Everything is done on a grand scale while still managing to be subtle and tropical. It is classy, elegant and overall, stunning. The staff here is among the best we have experienced in any hotel, anywhere. They spoke very good English, not always a given in this part of the world, but more importantly they were highly trained in areas of guest service and satisfaction, always going the extra mile and empowered to make things happen. The staff to guest ratio was very high and we were always greeted by name. Service was never rushed and we never waited for anything, anywhere. Every staff member we encountered was gracious and professional - Grand Velas has done an excellent job in selecting the staff members for this resort. On the first day, I realized I was going to run out of books and asked about a lending library. They have none and the butler/concierge recommended the gift shop. I tried there but the choices were very limited. Not to worry as 30 minutes later Amelia, our floor concierge, tracked us down at the pool and presented me with three paperbacks that I later learned she had gone to the other floor concierges to find. That extra level of service was an indication of what we could expect for the rest of our too short stay. We arrived at 10am and I had emailed ahead to request early check in. Immediately, we were escorted to our room and it was gorgeous, an Ambassador Suite with a huge terrace overlooking the main pool and the sea. It was totally private and there was a Bali bed in addition to a table and 2 chairs. The bathroom was large and lovely and Molten Brown toiletries and plush towels and bath sheets (and plenty of them) completed the luxury touches. I used the large Jacuzzi tub several times and the separate shower is very large and has both ceiling and wall mounted shower heads. The king bed was luxurious with the finest quality bedding, something we totally enjoy and appreciate. Soft cotton robes are provided along with a unique type of slipper. I liked mine so much I wore them to the pool and then took them home, a first for me. A beach bag for use while there is also provided. The closet is large and there are drawers everywhere for those that like lots of storage. We were settled in a Bali bed at the stunning main pool by 11am. Service was attentive and thoughtful. A bucket of water was delivered within minutes, and the ice in the bucket was constantly replaced. We decided to have lunch right there and ordered ceviche, which was fresh and delicious. We visited the swim up bar a few times and chatted with the bartender, Oliver, who took excellent care of us throughout our stay. Later in the afternoon, we took a long walk on the beach and enjoyed swimming in the ocean. It was 6pm before we knew it and we went back to the room to get ready for cocktails and dinner. First stop was the Sky Bar, designed like a bar in an Ian Schrager hotel - gorgeous with beautiful lighting and art work and a full wall of glass doors to the sea, done in wonderful textures and fabrics. Premium brands are stocked as well as a nice choice of wines. We enjoyed a martini and headed to dinner at Cocina de Autor. What a fabulous experience this was! Our waiter helped us choose a tasting menu based on our preferences and each and every course was perfectly prepared and delicious. The sommelier recommended a Reserve Syrah to accompany our choices and it was decanted for us without our having to ask. Service was outstanding and the meal memorable. It was in fact the best meal we have ever had at an AI resort and food at this resort was fine dining quality, consistently. We started day 2 with a pot of coffee from room service (they provide in room Nespresso coffee makers as well), requested the evening before by a card which we hung on the door. The choices were extensive and room service arrived at the designated time and rolled a table into our suite that was beautifully set with linens, china and crystal. At this point, we decided it could not get much better than this, sitting at a lovely table in our luxuriously soft robes with a gorgeous view of the sea and a table set just for us. Bliss! We stopped in at Azul for breakfast on the way to the pool and the buffet was elaborate with more fresh juices and fruits than I have ever seen as well as a wonderful selection of freshly baked goods that should satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth. There was a good selection of hot foods including Mexican specialties. Azul itself is a beautifully appointed restaurant with outdoor seating available, though it was way too hot for us to take advantage of it this trip. Day two was spent at the main pool for a bit then the adult pool \u2013 wonderful with its own swim up bar and several servers. Lunch was ceviche followed by another long walk and then back to get ready for the evening. We again chose the Sky Bar and were greeted like old friends by the wonderful staff there. Our server recommended a lovely 2006 Antis Malbec as she remembered our preference for red wine. We enjoyed a glass and had a delightful chat with her before heading to Piaf for dinner. What a stunning restaurant this is! Curtains of suspended crystals, beautiful chandeliers and soft lighting made for a first class ambiance to rival the loveliest restaurant. We chose Piaf solely because it was the only adult only option for that evening, as neither of us are fans of French cuisine \u2013 and we would have absolutely returned to Cocina de Autor if we had the opportunity to do so. Service and food were again perfectly executed and those who are fans of French cuisine would enjoy the extensive menu, including souffl\u00e9 for dessert. We dine late, 8:30 or so, so did not look for any after dinner entertainment. This is a quiet resort overall, which is just perfect for us but might disappoint someone looking for a social pool scene or nightlife. Also, things could be quite different when the resort is full. There is a piano bar and karaoke bar, neither of which was busy when we walked past after dinner. We had a very short stay at this gorgeous resort \u2013 it is truly the best AI we have ever stayed in and of the caliber of Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton hotels for overall service and quality. It never felt like an AI resort \u2013 and you are actually presented with a check for meals, etc, which you sign to your room and which can be confusing of one does not expect it. I suspect they allow EP bookings as well as AI. We did not check out the spa but I did use the well equipped gym. The beach at this resort is wide and lovely with soft sand and no rocks and it is luxuriously outfitted with lots of Bali beds, chairs and umbrellas. Water was clear in places, not so in others and prettier on our first day than the second. That said, my husband loved the ocean there and swam in it several times a day. In summary, I would recommend Grand Velas to those who want a true luxury experience with personal, attentive service, excellent quality cuisine matched with nice wines and served by a well trained staff in restaurants that are stunningly appointed all while enjoying spacious and lush suites and with no detail overlooked.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "yorba linda", "Title": "\u201cOur secound amaizing time\u201d", "Author": "lynneYorbaLinda", "ReviewID": "UR39972554", "Content": "Dear all we want to share with you our expirience during the stay at grand velas last week, all the service and the people since we arrived was impressive, we stayded at the resort for 4 nigths only, this is our secound vacations to the riviera maya and grand velas as well, food and beverages was the best part in my personal opinion we had dinner every nigth into a diferent fine dinnig restauant ,the service, the presentation, the food was absolutly amaizing even at the pool area, I loved the wood boxes they provided the food when we were under shade,my housbend and myselft had the oportunity to travell many times and visited several five dimons resort we are totaly sure grand velas is going to be very soon one of those, Amy is the best of the best my butler concierge she was all the time covering all my needs, we already made reservations for new year.

We are very seasoned travelers, and wanted only the best experiance possible. Last year we were at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun, and they loved it. I was very concerned about going to Mexico this year, mainly due to the crime problems and what the global economy is doing to all travel. Hawaii is too far to fly with them that young, and the Atlantis is a little over the top, so we felt we could not keep them under wing at their age. After reading the reviews on this property we really wanted to try it. I don't think I have ever seen as many people have so much good to say about a resort, and say it with such strong feelings. We booked six nights and just returned yesterday, so we are up to the moment on the Grand Velas. Let me say that my wife and I are very experianced travelers, and rarely does a property fully live up to, and almost never exceeds, the advertisement and \"hype\". The Grand Velas is simply everything they advertise and more, and with the exception of the very few people that found it below fantastic in the reviews (you can't please everyone), it was as good or better then the what we read and hoped for. In an almost perfect resort setting, one thing stands head and shoulders above everything else, the hotel staff. This hotel has hired at every level the best Mexico has to offer. From the time you enter the very nice (and secure) front gate, every employee you encounter exceeds anything you can imagine. As a businessman for many years, I don't know how they were able to assemble this many top quality people, again at every level, that are this professional and dedicated to making the customer happy. You simply have to go and experiance it to fully understand. The only time we have ever seen anything close to this was a mid-90s cruise on the Sea Goddess II, a small cruise ship with 51 cabins and more staff then guests. If you like to be pampered, visit this property. The rooms; exactly what they advertise. They exceed 1,100 sg ft each, and are spotless. While our room was one large room, (you can only imagine what they could make each room with a little thought) it was perfect for our needs. Big bathroom. Nice closet. Huge sleeping and sitting area with couch and desk, all stepping out onto a great patio with a double lounge built in, a table and chairs, and a view that is as good as it gets on this coastline. I give the rooms a 10 out of 10. The pool; we were in the family section at what is called the Ambassador section, and it is really three pools that fall off to the ocean. The first a childs pool, the next a large play pool, and the final a heated (surprised me) large pool that has a swim up bar and small restaurant. Just look at the pictures in the internet add and you will see. It is exactly as presented. The service by the pool is simply as good as you could ever ask for. Wet cool towels every hour or so, observant but not pushy pool attendents and waiters, and plenty of shade and sunny areas. Whoever designed this pool needs a bonus. I give the pool area a 10 of 10 score. Beach; ok, if you are looking for big waves, this is not the place. But the beach itself lays anything I have seen to shame. You have pure white sand that is about 50 yards from the pool end to the water, and then about 50 yards of shallow clear water out to an artificial reef that breaks any big waves. It is perfect for children of all ages to get a great beach experiance, and their parents to feel that they are safe. I would say the water at its deepest is four feet . It does have coral, so water shoes are needed. But if this is a problem to you, you should be back at the pool, not on a beach. The sand is white and clean, and we saw them working on it to clean and smooth it each morning. It is about 50 yards deep to the water and runs the length of the hotel, which is long. If you want big waves go to Hawaii, if you want calm and perfect, this is the place. Score 10 of 10. One night the staff had 72 baby turtles that were ready for release, so at 8pm everyone met on the beach, got their baby turtle, and made sure they safely made it into the water. They do this to protect them, and it was pretty neat. Restaurants, there are eight, plus room service. Three of the restaurants don't allow children under 19, and we are fine with that. We just didn't go to those three (and understand they are great) as we were there to be with our grandchildren. We ate at Frida, the beach bar, Lucca, and Azul. The service in each one we visited was as fine as any restaurant in any place anywhere in the world. The food was good to very good at each place. The breakfast buffet (you can also order from menue or get room service) was our choice each morning, and it was good. I give it like a 7 of 10, but it is only because I have had better and this can be better. Lunch buffet (again you have choices, and this was ours all but one day) was better then breakfast. Give it a 8 of 10. Dinner each evening was also 8 of 10, but we missed three places that two of which are said to be their best. We were very happy with the food , and again, the service is unmatched at each place we visited. The food could improve a little, but cetainly it is very acceptable. Nightlife: well, this is the one drawback to the hotel. There is none. Not that we were seeking much of that, but it would have been nice to have a place to go enjoy a drink before or after dinner and listen to some nice music. There were no cocktail hours, no roving Mexican band to entertain the kids (or adults), and frankly once dinner was over in the family section it was \"lights out\". So the one weak point is they need a social director that can feel the mood of the guests, and act accordingly. Its \"all inclusive\", so a 7:00pm social hour by the pool would be a welcome addition and cost nothing. I am not scoring it as it does not exist. Room Service is 24 hour and you can get far more then I have seen on most room service menues. This is also included in the price, as is the mini-bar. Kids Camp: 10 of 10. The staff was fantastic. Our boys did not want to go, but needed a little time out of the sun, so we got them to walk over and look, and they saw four big screen TV's set up with XBox and Wii, and would not leave. LOL. Clean, Big, Well Equipped, Great Staff. Can't ask for more. Check in and out; Great. 10 of 10 Transportation arrangements; Great 10 of 10. Now I could go on and on about this place, as others have. But hopefully you can read this and the other reviews and see that this place is special. It is a \"must go\" if you are looking for a first class experiance on the beach in Mexico. This hotel needs to have \"deep pockets\" to survive. They had to steal away every great employee from the housekeeper to the general manager in Mexico ( we know they bus eimployees in from Cancun, as we asked), and while we were there it was at best 30% occupied. And one entire section of the hotel was not open. Crime in Mexico, swine flu, and the global economy has this place empty. The town of Playa was empty, and we went in twice when cruise ships were in, so the area is hurting. You could not feel safer in this property. About half the employees have mic's and earphones on. I don't know why, nor did I ask, but it gives you a level of safety that I have not experianced in any travels since the \"world changed\". Finally I am once again going to comment on every employee I encountered. They were the best. You can't pick one or two, it was all of them. They lay any hotel staff I have ever seen to shame. The best of Hong Kong, Paris, New York, and the Las Vegas high roller suite floors don't match up to these people. We have \"been there - done that\" in our life, and this place will show you how a guest should be treated. We tipped well and hope that everyone does; the staff deserves it. This is a place we will return to, and soon. Next time we will leave the children at home, but if the hotel keeps up what we saw, it is a must place to go. Hopefully people will keep reviewing Grand Velas, so we can see that it maintains what it has done. We will read the reviews and plan our next trip in the fall.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medford MA", "Title": "\u201cI think it's the nicest resort I have ever stayed at....\u201d", "Author": "luger55", "ReviewID": "UR37100988", "Content": "I have stayed at numerous places in Mexico, but I have to say this was the most pampered I have ever been.

Impeccable Mexican fare with Chili's the main thread. Piaf, a delicatable ambianced fare with food so rich I just kept awwwwing and awwwwing. You must try the oysters. My room overlooked the infinity pool that went right into the ocean. The beds were soooo comfy, I had room service every morning, a special treat for a single mom, something I highly reccomend.. Always great service and great food. At the pool or beach, which you can walk forever on, the service never stopped. Fresh drinks constantly and food delivered right to your bed or chair at the pool or beach. The highlight I have to say was eating at the signature restaurant, Cocina de Autor. From the gracious warm smile of the hostess, the always attentitive wait staff, the wine steward aways pairing impeccibaly, Ceasar the manager and Xavier the not to be beaten Chef. I ate there four times as I could never get enough of the fine always exciting dining. Blended with textures abound, saltiness, sweetness, sour embedded with explosivies flavors always left me wondering what could top what I had just consumed. I met the General Manger on one night of dining, who welcomed me like I was lost family. Ceasar was kind enough to introduce me to Xavier, the chef, who highly recommened a dive in the Cenotes of the Dos Ojos Scuba shop. I am not a seasoned diver but have dove maybe 40 times.

He wanted to have it straight on. He got it. But he worked patiently with Amy to get what he wanted. It took a couple of days though. The RESTAURANTS were amazing! We loved Frida and SenLin. Men have to wear trousers and a collared shirt. So don't be a pain in the butt... just bring them so you get to eat in the nice places. Your wife will be happy. The little boys... they are more forgiving about their attire. My son wore nice shorts and a polo shirt and closed shoes and they let him in. My husband had the same kind of outfit the first night and they made him go back to the room and change. No flip-flops. We ate at Azul for breakfast. To me, it was okay. I should have looked at the menu but we just went to the buffet. It's not painful because you paid already. Activities: We went on a Hobie Cat. My husband worked on his sailing skills with one of the men helping him. You can take another Hobie Cat snorkeling as well. There is a fee for these. We rode kayaks around and there were peddle boats you can use. There is a barrier that keeps the shore calm and shallow, plus, you must wear a life vest. My son and husband played soccer with the kids and men. There is a volleyball net. We never saw anybody play this. There is a basketball set-up by the pool and a ping-pong table. There is the kids club. We only used it when my son wanted to play the Wii a couple of times. You can snorkel in the shallows on the beach. There's some transparent little fish and some needlenose-looking fish. We saw a little rey by the rocks. My son would not shut up about it! He was so excited. So bring snorkel gear. We stayed in the Ambassador Suites section. We did check out the Master suites area. This area looks amazing! It is about a mile from the Ambassador/beach area but there is always a shuttle to bring you wherever to want to go within the hotel grounds. The master suites area has the most beautiful lobby. SenLin and Lucca restaurants are located in this area. In three months Lucca will move to the Ambassador Suites area next to Frida. Chaca restaurant is a breakfast restaurant were Lucca is now. This restaurant was not open last week. I don't think they had anyone in the Master suite section. But it looks awesome. The pools here were amazing. It's like a bunch of \"infinity pools\" arrange with varying elevations. Totally cool, with the jungle surrounding you. What a beautiful place. It's a great place to be alone. If I just wanted to be alone, this is the place to go. The staff here are just begging to give you some attention but leave you alone if you want it. The only ones who won't leave you alone are the MOSQUITOS!!! I must be one juicy mama 'coz I was eaten alive!!!! Even in our room in the Ambassador section you are not safe from these little buggers. (There are mangroves surrounding the hotel.) The hotel provides organic/natural mosquito repellant. I don't think it was very effective on me. Then you have to bring benadryl spray 'coz you will be itchin' like a crazy person. They have insect repellant and itch relieve topical liquid at the Ambassador Grand Suite section boutique, if you forget. But it's gonna cost ya. THE SPA: I only had a pedicure here. They gave me a drink that made me relax and take a nap. I don't know what was in that drink. :) We got a tour of the place. It looks pretty awesome. They follow you around like a puppy. I don't know what that's about. ENTERTAINMENT: You entertain yourself, pretty much. There is Karaoke at the lounge. Kids can Karaoke from about 6pm to 8:30Pm. Then it's adults only after that. If you want an All-inclusive with mariachi and some guy with a microphone telling you to do the cha-cha, this is not your place. It's about relaxing and playing hard in the AM. PM's are quiet. If you want to party, I guess you can go to Playa del Carmen. SHOPPING: We went to Playa del Carmen for shopping. Nothing exciting there. If you've been to Mexico you've seen it before. Just the town's name has changed. I found the shopping at the boutique in the Ambassador Grand Suites area to be the best. They have lots of fun jewelry. The resort clothing for the ladies are way better here than at Playa del Carmen. If you are into those chunky rings, these ones here are really cool Some were only $13.00 each. Too bad my fingers are too fat! EXCURSIONS: We rented a boat at Puerto Aventuras(?) for fishing. We caught a baracuda and some mackarel. Then then we were done, we went to Gringo Dave's Restaurant for them to cook our catch. We used Capt Rick's but the man who helped us on the boat was shoving the little boys around. Not nice at all. We went to XPLOR. It's a new park )open only 2 weeks) that features swimming and rafting in rivers underground with stalagtites/stalagmites (? spelling). There's also a ride on the jeep-like car that goes above ground and underground. Then you can go on 12 zip-lines...if your stomach can stand it. Very exciting and different for us. This place was more high tech and organized. We went to XCARET. There you swim in the rivers and you can snorkel in the river and in the beach. That was the most fun there. They have animals too. But this park was really crowded and you better wear water shoes because you have to walk alot without regular shoes. Overall, the Grand Velas Resort is pretty top-of-line. It's lovely and the staff really makes this place well worth it.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service, beautiful resort.

Let\u2019s tell our story first\u2026We booked our wedding at a hotel that was recommended by a travel agency for our destination wedding. This hotel wasn\u2019t open yet, but our wedding was a year out and we really thought that would be plenty of time\u2026.NOT SO MUCH! About 5 months before our wedding, the hotel contacted me and said that they would not be open in time for our wedding. So the travel agent, myself, my husband, and our entire wedding party researched trip advisor day and night until we found the Grand Velas Puerto Vallarta. Our travel agent said that they had just opened a new resort in Playa Del Carmen, and since we had already booked our airfare, we decided this was a perfect fit. They gave us an incredible rate of $831 per person for 4 days and 3 nights in a double room in the Master Class section over the 4th of July weekend! It turned out to be the most magical wedding we could have ever imagined. This is a very very detailed review, so skip to the section you are interested in, or email me if you want more information. I don\u2019t discuss the wedding until the end. Let\u2019s talk hotel next. I have attached many many many photos for you die hard trip advisor seekers because my criteria was that the website photos had to match photos taken by the average traveler, otherwise it would not be what we wanted for our wedding. I have a link for photos sent to me by the hotel for anyone who is interested. The grounds we immaculate. They had grounds crew trimming bushes, cleaning the pools, buffing the floors and cleaning the tile with toothbrushes every morning and evening. Everything looked as though it was brand new all over again, but you hardly noticed they were there. We mainly stayed at the Ambassador pool because it had the Azul and a gorgeous bathroom right in the area. The pools were beautiful, the water in the infinity pool really seemed like it was running off into the ocean. There were plenty of chairs. The sand leading up to ocean was soft and not as hot as I expected. The ocean was a bit rocky, but just wear pool shoes and you will be fine. You can get the same pool side service by the ocean, so take your pick. There are 2 sections to the hotel. The Jungle section, called the Master Class section and the Beach section (which houses the Ambassador and Ambassador Grand Class sections). There are shuttles 24 hours a day to either section. You can run the road, but someone will follow you on an atv so that you are not running alone. They say it\u2019s because they want the shuttles to see you, but I think they are there to hand you water or a towel if you need! The spa was one of the most amazing spas I have ever been to. Do the water journey! Its worth it. Its guided, but you do most of it alone, a sauna, steam room, clay room, ice room, whirl pool and then they guide you through a hydro therapy pool with different jets and water pressure. This is free with a spa service. The staff were one of our most favorite things about the hotel. Though I am not sure of the official occupancy, it did get busier as the week went on, however, at any given time you had 2, if not more, staff members devoted to you, at the restaurants, poolside, or in your room. At the beginning of the trip I wrote down every waiters name at every restaurant so that I could tell you who to ask for because each was so attentive, but I noticed I was a pattern amongst all staff members to be kind, helpful and courteous, and to single someone out was just getting too hard. My mom dropped her knife at dinner and 3 waiters came rushing to her side, one to pick up the knife, one to give her a new one, and one to ask if she was ok. AMAZING. We said that staff members went out of their way not just to tell you where something was, but to say, \u201cthe pool, sure, let me take you there myself.\u201d Yes it is true, at Azul, they will ask you if you would like them to carry your plate from the buffet to the table. Feel free to say no if you feel its too overbearing for you, but we all said why not! We I think went a little tip crazy, but when I counted at the end of 7 days, it was less than 70 bucks I spent of my own money. My husband spent about the same. We tipped about 20 bucks one night at one of the restaurants, but we had 5 waiters, and there were 12 of us eating. The Food was on par with the service. Everyone in my party of 26 people and 1 toddler collaboratively ate at every restaurant. I personally ate at every restaurant but the Bistro (Ambassador Grand Class) Frida (Ambassador family section), and the Italian restaurant in the Master class section. There just wasn\u2019t enough time. What I did get to experience was the private banquet menu for the Azul (rehearsal dinner) and the Private reception menu which was served at our wedding reception on the beach. Lets start with Azul (by the Ambassador family friendly pool). Breakfast was wonderful. A full buffet of common items and huevos rancheros, traditional Mexican fare. They had smoked salmon, bagels, muffins, 10 kinds of fresh squeezed fruit juice (and if you don\u2019t see a juice you like ask for it. We tried fresh squeezed cantaloupe juice\u2026yum!) They had bacon, waffles, and an omelet station. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for something if you don\u2019t see it. For lunch it was the same story, with an amazing lunch buffet with sushi, ceviche, and hot dishes. BUT THE BIG SURPRISE\u2026order off the lunch menu too!!!! We ordered lobster quesadillas and grilled kabobs. They were huge portions and delicious. I\u2019ll talk about the rehearsal dinner when I discuss the wedding. Also, if you don\u2019t feel like going into the Azul, you can order poolside. The menu was quite full and had similar items to the Azul like sushi, kabobs, hamburgers, and shrimp cocktail. These were all things we tried and loved. There were also nachos, and chicken wraps that we ordered all the time. The same waiters that bring you your drinks at the pool bring out the food, and you can ask anyone for help. Just a quick note about the drinks. 1st, there only bottle water served, so no worries there. The ice is purified by a machine connected to the machine. I didn\u2019t ask for ice in my non alcoholic drinks, but for the alcoholic ones I did, and so did everyone else. No one got sick! The other option of course is room service. We ordered it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight food. Sometimes we ordered it just to order it because we could, or just to try something we hadn\u2019t tried. They wheel it into your room or carry it on a wooden try with white linen napkins. They set up your room as if it were a restaurant. The shrimp cocktail was different than the one served poolside, and I think it was better. The cocktail sauce is not traditional, but still wonderful. Breakfast could be ordered the night before and brought to your room as a wake-up call. This is what we did the morning we went to Tulum, the Mayan ruins Tulum was an extraordinary site. The ruins were located high on cliffs overlooking the water. Definitely worth seeing. It was a short tour compared to the amount of travel it took us to get there. It took so long because of all the other passengers we had to pick up along the way. That was the only downside. We were first to be picked up and last to be dropped off. Bring cash or credit cards with you to shop at the shops at the base of Tulum. A lot of fun things to buy. There is this great jewelry shop where they really really want to make a deal, so do be afraid to say no until it\u2019s a price you like. We also went into Playa del Carmen. The same thing applied there. There were a lot of silver shops to look at. Ok back to the hotel. Sen Lin was the Asian restaurant in the master class section of the hotel. We ate there on the first night with 10 of us, and it was so much fun. Ask for a sampler platter of appetizers. You should get cheese stick 2 kinds of shrimp and soft shell crab that was amazing. They had a crocodile dish that really did taste like chicken, and if you were still hungry you could order a whole second meal. There is a great bar area outside of the restaurant as well. Piaf was my favorite. This was an Adults only restaurant located in the Ambassador Grand class section on the same floor as the Sky Bar and the Spanish restaurant Cocina de Autor which was my husband\u2019s favorite. You can order an entire grilled lobster at Piaf, but it is additional so we opted not to get it. Instead we each had a different appetizer and main course. The oysters were huge and in a wine reduction sauce, the French onion soup was amazing and the apple tart was lit on fire table side. The filet was one of the best things there. Cocina de Autor was true elegant dining. The tasting menu had things I recognized and didn\u2019t, but I tried everything. The waiter even said that if we tried it and didn\u2019t like it he would bring us anything else we wanted. We were there for almost 3 hours eating. There were pre appetizers and after your dessert the chef sends out a try of chocolate desserts as if you hadn\u2019t stuffed yourselves already. Try everything! We stayed in the Ambassador Grand class section. Our room was on the second floor, room 6218. Every morning we would push a button and our shades would retract into the ceiling to expose the beautiful beach and the sun! our patio had a plunge pool that was covered in pink and white flowers every morning that had fallen on our deck from above. It was like someone had come to place them there before we woke up. Our tub was big enough for 3 people, and the shower could fit a small family. Our TV was in the center of our room and swiveled to face either the bed or the sofa. Every morning we would have fresh flowers, a new bottle of tequila, and a newspaper. Every night our beds would be turned down and chocolates on our pillows. True heaven! Now on to the wedding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First let me say that one name I will never forget is Tatiana. She was the most amazing wedding coordinator. She worked with me day and night over email and phone to make sure that when we arrived it was the wedding of our dreams. She thought of everything, and if you ask her what you might be forgetting, she will tell you. So thank you Tatiana. The wedding was on July 4th, but our events were on Friday too. We had the rehearsal and then went to the Azul, where it was just us, for dinner. I had picked a menu for the evening. I could have picked anything I wanted off of the Azul menu, so narrowing it down was hard, but we picked a tamale, quesadilla, a salad, beef or salmon, and then 2 types of dessert. The presentation was beautiful and I was worried that everyone wouldn\u2019t like the choices, but it was sooooo much food, there was something for everyone. The staff were wonderful. Finally the day of the wedding. My bridesmaids and I went for a morning Yoga class with Ivan (the fitness center personal trainer) before getting ready. It was so relaxing. We had asked Tatiana for a \u201cready room\u201d where all the girls could gather to get ready. We were given a room by the beach and we had a personal hair stylist and nail technician come to our room to do peoples hair and nails for those who wanted. My husband and all of the groomsmen got ready in our room. There were 7 bridesmaids, one bride 2 mothers, an aunt and some friends. It was a lot of people in the ready room, but we did just fine. The ceremony site was a four posted gazebo with two draperies of fabric covering the top. We had flowers at the top and bottoms of each post. It was beautiful. The minister was so lovely and nice. His speech was great and we really felt connected to him and the ceremony. It\u2019s not a private ceremony, so just make sure there are no stragglers in the back ground for your pictures. The photographer was great. Make sure you have a specific list of what you want and stick to it, because it\u2019s easy to lose track of what you have taken. The reception site changed every five minutes, but Tatiana kept up with all of the changes. We had a white dance floor under a tent with a large table, white linen clothes and napkins, and blue table runners. We used some of the flowers from the ceremony on the reception table. We had blue glass beads everywhere and blue and white lanterns from the ceiling. The food was also AMAZING!!! All served at the same time and delicious. The cake was extra per person, but the sparkling wine toast was included, and it was better than the champagne anyway. The DJ was extra, but he did a great job. About a week out, I emailed him a list of songs, and he found everything. Tatiana kept the events moving, and at the end of the night it was the most wonderful wedding we could have ever wanted!!!!! Thanks for being so patient with this review. Though you wouldn\u2019t think it, I left soooooo much out, so please email me if you have any questions.

We were there for 5 days/4 nights and had an incredible experience! Over New Year's, I went on a girls' trip to the Excellence Riviera Cancun, and of course my friends and I had a blast, but the Grand Velas blew that resort out of the water. I loved it so much, and its quality was so much better than the Excellence, that my same group of traveling girlfriends is headed to the Grand Velas in two weeks for another birthday getaway. It's only been two months since I left, and I cannot wait to go back! The food, which I will talk about in detail, was truly remarkable -- when you are eating it, you can hardly believe that it is included in the price. The resort itself is breathtaking, and the pools are exquisite. The service is impeccable. I can't say enough about it! FOOD Lucky for us, there were four fine dining restaurants open during our stay, so we were able to hit each one. Our favorite was the Spanish restaurant, Cocina de Autor. We like to eat late, so our reservation was at 10:00 p.m., and we were the only ones in the restaurant. They didn't care -- they treated us like it was our private restaurant and did not rush us out of there. Our server was a sweet, beautiful girl who was so knowledgeable about the food and wine (sorry I can't remember her name, but she was born in Texas!). We had the tasting menu, which was tailored to our palates and simply amazing. I did the wine pairing with each course (which was included), and the wines our server selected were perfectly paired with each course. The chef must have brought out 5-6 additional dessert tastings for us to try and gave us a tour of the kitchen. That dinner was such a treat! We also loved Piaf, the French restaurant. Once again the service was impeccable, but I've forgotten our server's name -- he was handsome, fun, and knew everything about the menu (I am filling this review out two months after my trip)! At Piaf, my cousin and I basically ordered the entire menu and shared each other's plates. I'm not a big fois gras fan, but we had the best fois gras I've ever had -- in fact, far better than the fois gras I had at The French Laundry. Everything was amazing -- from the trio of soups, to the filet, to the desserts. Speaking of desserts, our server could see that we were enjoying ourselves so much that he sent out a selection of 5 separate creme brulees, which were outstanding. It was a perfect way to cap off a fantastic stay at the Grand Velas. Frida, the Mexican restaurant, was the first fine dining restaurant we visited. They have all sorts of tequilas to choose from and make you a tailored margarita tableside. Mine was exceptional! The food at Frida was great -- we loved the soups and the entrees. There was some chocolate concoction that we had for dessert, which was fantastic. I would recommend going to Frida early in your stay because it is good but not as amazing as Piaf or Cocina de Autor. Sin Lin, the Asian restaurant, was great -- but our least favorite. I would also recommend going to Sin Lin early in your stay -- round out your stay with Piaf or Cocina de Autor, that way you'll save the best for last. Asian food is my favorite, so I was slightly disappointed that Sin Lin wasn't my favorite restaurant. That said, it was very good. There was a sushi/roe appetizer that had one of the most interesting flavors I'd ever tasted. The absolute best thing was the pecking duck -- you eat it like tacos, and thinking about the sauce is making my mouth water right now! Everything we had was good, but it just wasn't as amazing as Cocina de Autor or Piaf. As for casual dining, I preferred Azul to the Bistro. In my judgment, the Bistro was a full on situation for it to be classified as \"casual\" dining. The food was good, but during the day, I'd much prefer a buffet or poolside fare to fancy food. Azul was great -- the buffet had a wide variety of selections, and the sushi was very fresh. I felt a little over the top, though, because they wouldn't even let you carry your plate to the table...they carried it for you. It was sweet but a little uncomfortable -- my cousin and I still laugh about that. By far, the best casual dining was pool side. The ceviche was always fresh and tasty, and the quesadillas were simply outstanding! Room service -- especially at breakfast -- deserves special mention. Eating room service on our balcony was decadent but delightful. And the breakfast was so yummy! POOLS There is an adults-only pool and a family pool. My cousin and I immediately headed to the adults-only pool on our first day and spent the entire day there. We loved the ambiance but little did we know that we were missing out on the best lounge chairs. For some reason, they only have the cushioned lounge chairs on the family pool side -- and they are so comfortable! The lounge chairs on the adult side are fine but pale in comparison. So we sat on the family pool side the next day, but we were a little disappointed in the service as compared to the adult pool side. At the adult side -- mostly thanks to Humberto -- we had a new drink (with premium liquors) every time we turned around. If they had cushioned chairs on the adult side, it would be perfect! SPA We were a little disappointed with our spa experience. The spa itself was absolutely breathtaking -- one of the most beautiful spas I've seen, and I've been to many. But we were disappointed with our treatment -- we each got a body wrap/massage combo. Both of us felt like we could have massaged ourselves more intensely than our massage therapists. Granted, I think it was the service we got -- it was apparently designed to be gentle, but I only found that out after the fact and would certainly have chosen a different treatment had I known. I will go back to the spa but get a different treatment. SERVICE The Grand Velas' service was simply outstanding! Our butler, Tony, and our pool/beach server, Humberto made our trip so memorable. I've read some reviews complaining that the butler is never there -- I had a completely different experience. Maybe Tony wasn't physically at the desk 24/7, but she handled our every need. She even got us into a club in Play del Carmen that was sold out -- we even got to jump the line! She made all kinds of suggestions about restaurant choices, spa treatments, etc. and took care of all bookings. Most importantly, while extremely professional, she was so sweet and fun! Humberto is just such a sweetie! He makes each person feel like she is the only guest at the resort. He remembers your name, the food you like, and the drinks you like and suggests other things he thinks you would like based on your preferences. He is always available -- he even cut his lunch break in half on our last day because he wanted to come back to the pool in time to serve us our food! I truly cannot wait to see Tony & Humberto again in two weeks! ROOM We got the basic room in the Grand Suites area, although I think we must have gotten upgraded because we had a view of the pool and beach. The room was so nice! I've stayed in some very nice rooms, but this was definitely among the nicest. I couldn't believe it. I have read some reviews complaining about the price of the Ambassador class rooms -- I would say skip the extra money unless you are on a very romantic getaway. The basic room was great -- had the big tub, separate shower, comfortable beds, and a huge patio. My cousin said it was the best birthday ever and that she had the time of her life -- she loved the resort, and so did I.

For our first time in the Riviera Maya, the resort was an incredible and relaxing experience. We've stayed at 5 star resorts before, and this one was one of the best! Room Pros: The resort is gorgeous, the rooms were spacious and beautiful with amazing views. Room service was prompt and our room was spotlessly cleaned and restocked daily. Room Cons: You can hear everything outside the door. There was a group of teens staying that would run up & down the halls at 4 and 5 am and woke us up every night knocking on doors and screaming...it felt like they were in our room. Pool pros and cons: Pool Pros:The main (family) pool is FANTASTIC! It's basically 3 infinity pools in one each one making its way closer to the ocean. Truly breathtaking in it's design. Waiter service was pretty attentive and the food was great by the pool. Christine and Marco were the most attentive and friendly. Pool Cons: This was the biggest CON of the whole resort...there wasn't any music outside by the pool...none...silence. We saw a stereo system at the pool bar and asked if they'd turn it on. After hesitation, they did. It was just at the pool bar and the music was AWFUL! It was the same songs over and over (think \"Bye Bye Miss American Pie\" and \"Nothing compares to you\" by Sinead O'Conner). Definitely not the festive mexican music I heard at the Adult pool... I requested to several people if they could change the music and got NOWHERE! Finally after a few days of begging, Julio borrowed a cd from the adult pool and it played country music. They definitely need to improve the music to help improve the atmosphere at the family pool. I don't see why it was a problem when they had nice music around the rest of the resort and restaurants. Restaurants Pros and Cons: Great food, but didn't post which ones were open and closed each night. Wasn't until evening and we had to go see which were open b/c we were told different things by different people. One night only Sin Lin was open and all others were closed. Also, we dressed according to the dress codes only to have a group of people walk into Frida all wearing tshirts and shorts... Also, Chakra wasn't open yet...only Azul, Frida, and Sin Lin are open for families and not all on each night. Gym and Kids Club: Both great! It would be nice for the gym to open earlier for early birds, but it was great. My daughters LOVED the kids club. They went on our last day there and made pinatas. They're not big on kids clubs, but said they wished they had gone a little everyday. They LOVED Helma and said she was so nice! Butler Service: I know it's advertised as a great personal service, but the regular concierge could be just fine. We saw the \"butler\" as she opened our hotel door and then again 4 days later. She arranged for us to get reservations and a cab to Playa. She even gave us coupons for free drinks. Only, once we got to Playa, the restaurant was literally boarded up and closed! I was told we had reservations...I guess a miscommunication, but we made due eating somewhere else. Overall...AMAZING, with a few kinks to be worked out! We were told by other guests that the Grand Velas in Puerto Vallarta is fantastic and assume this one will continue to stay as great as it is and hopefully get even better!", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay! Some concerns....\u201d", "Author": "ilovefrenchbulldogs", "ReviewID": "UR32153657", "Content": "First, a little travel history and background to know where I am coming from. I'm in my mid-thirties and have traveled to Europe, French Polynesia, various Carribean islands, Dominican Republic, and extensively traveled in Mexico. My husband and I book a week's stay in the Mayan Riviera every year and have done so since 2001. We have stayed at everything from a 3 star all inclusive, to a 5 star Bora Bora over the water bungalow. We enjoy fine dining and ultra gourmet cuisine, to the occassional burger shack down the road. I have been searching and waiting for an all inclusive upscale resort to open in the Mayan Riviera for quite some time. We have stayed at others that promise this kind of experience yet greatly fail at it. We were looking forward to our stay at Grand Velas and we thank all the previous reviewers for such great reviews. Overall I would say he had a great time, but we have a few concerns which I will address at the end. FIRST IMPRESSIONS: First of all, the impact of the entrance to this facility is perfect. Understated, yet grand and modern, while relaying a beautiful beach experience. The massive white walls with fountains and turquoise water with sand made to look like a beach were impressive. The ride (about 2 miles) to the resort is winding and beautifully landscaped. Well taken care of and manicured. Half way to the resort is the \"Master\" area which is where a grouping of buildings make up the conference center, master suites area, spa, and Sen Lin restaurant. We booked our stay in a Grand Class suite. There is Grand class, Ambassador class, and Master class. The grand suites were on the south end of the complex, fronting the ocean. The whole resort was at 5% capacity while we were there so it was a bit strange that they located us at the very far end of the building, 3 suites from the end. It was a long walk. We were on the third floor and the view over the beach/ocean was fantastic. Maybe this is why we were placed so far down. ROOM: It was great and we really, really enjoyed it. I have to say, this is the first time I have ever wanted to stay in our room for much of the time. We ordered room services quite a few times because we didn't feel the need to go anywhere. The bed was nice (although the down comforter is a bit much for such warm weather). The 8 ft couch was very comfortable and I loved relaxing on it. The jetted tub for two actually fit both my husband and I (both 6 ft tall) with plenty of room to spare. The shower is very spacious (could use hotter water). Loved how the tv swiveled to be able to watch a movie from the tub, or from the bed, or from the couch, or from the patio. There was a fresh bouquet of Lillies, a nice coffee maker, a well stocked fridge, Don Julio Reposada tequila, some nice wines, umbrellas for any possible rain, bug repellant, robes, slippers, beach bag, always well stocked beach towels, q-tips, and plenty of Molton Brown ammenities. The hair dryer was high voltage and powerful. The patio was to die for. Oh if only I could have that kind of patio with that kind of view at home. (sigh) The 2 person lounge chair was very comfy and we had many meals at the outdoor dining table. We actually did use the plunge pool. It was about 6x8 and about 3 ft deep with a sitting bench in it. There were lots of tiny little ants around it, but it wasn't that much of a bother. The bougainvilla growing in the planter was beautiful, if a little messy. THE FOOD: 1. Cocina de Autor - The Best!! This food, presentation, service, and decor was so perfect it hurts! Loved the heavenly white setting. Ramon was such an excellent server and his helpers were so kind, genuine, and friendly. The \"Taster's Menu\" was perfect. We were able to try almost everything on the menu in tiny portions and everything was paired with a suitable wine. I think we ended up having 6 or 7 different wines with the platings. The chocolate molten cake was.........heaven. 2. Piaf - Loved it! Gorgeous dark, red, decor. The beads and chandeliers were beautiful. Very seductive and romantic. So was the food. The chocolate soufle and creme brule (4 different flavors) were great. The service was outstanding! 3. Bistro and Azul - These are the 2 main breakfast/lunch venues. Bistro at Grand, and Azul at Ambassador. The food from the Bistro was tasty. The buffet at Azul was plentiful and tasty. Freshly squeezed tangerine juice was yummy. 4. Frida - Ok. I ordered the filet medium well and it was a bit too cooked, a little dry, and completely brown througout so they cooked it again and it was fine the second time. I was very disappointed in the desserts. Having spent a lot of time in Mexico, I am very fond of well made flan and tres leches cake. Since this was a gourmet Mexican food specialty restaurant, I was looking forward to good desserts. The flan was very sub par (I get better at Abuelo's in Texas) and the tres leches cake I can make better myself. Dinner took almost 3 hours and there were only 3 tables being served. The seats were very uncomfortable. 5. Sen Lin - What can I say? Hmm.... My husband and I eat a lot of oriental food, a lot of sushi, tai food, etc. The amuse-bouche was the best part of the meal (salmon sushi, great flavor). The soups were also well done. Heavy lemongrass use though. The main courses however, were crazy. I had tempura battered sea bass in some sort of sauce. I took 2 bites and could not continue. It was so overwhelming with a sort of dirty dish water taste...igh. On to the desserts....more tempura. Tempura fried banana with ice cream....it was ok. Coffee gelatin with ice cream....weird and could not eat more than 2 bites. The room service breakfasts were always on time and great! The beach side ordering of anything we wanted, mainly ceviche, chicken tacos, and quesadillas were very tasty and fresh. I ate ceviche every day and loved every minute of it. A NOTE ABOUT DRESS: I really can't believe anyone would complain about not being able to wear shorts and flip flops at the gourmet restaurants. Chandeliers and shorts just don't go together. I'm very glad they have a dress code as the ambiance would have been ruined by such casualness. I loved the formality and being treated like royalty. THE POOLS: The pool at the Grand side, in front of the Bistro restaurant, was always lonely. We enjoyed the quiet though. The pools at the Ambassador side were large, clean, and well kept. All premium liquors (VSOP, Anejo, etc) There were always tons of workers everywhere trimming the plants and cleaning. The restrooms by the pools were lovely. The restroom outside of the Bistro restaurant was gorgeous. I enjoyed that there were only adults at the grand side of the resort. It was very peaceful, quiet, and secluded. Sidenote: I believe they must use UV filtration as there was no chlorine nor salt in the water. THE SPA: In our stay, it included two 30 minute massages, free of charge. We took the shuttle to the Master part of the complex and the spa was stunning in beauty. Wow....what an exhorbent amount of money must have been spent on the spa. I was stunned at the beauty and saddened that we were not given a tour, or shown a menu of available services, or shown the thalasso part of the spa for the \"water journey\". I would have booked more spa services, had the staff been willing or wanting to spend any time with us. The actual massage staff was great and the massages were perfect, but the 6 or more front staff/hostess staff, were unfriendly and aloof. A bit pretentious. We walked around the Master complex and were stunned at all the staff, yet ghost town of a place. There was no one at this area of the resort except tons of staff. The only thing open were the spa and the Sen Lin at night. The Suite area is a bit odd. It is not really in a jungle per say, as it is more of a winderness type of thing. Lots of dead trees/limbs and stagnant cenotes or ponds. Very overgrown and wild....purposefully I'm sure. But it didn't create a zen type of feeling in my opinion. More of a \"watch for the mosquitos and giant bugs\" type of feeling. THE BEACH: Wow!!!!!!! Anyone who complains about this beach is in serious need of a reality check. It's beautiful! Expansive! Clean! Secluded! The water is gorgeous! Beautiful shades of turquoise. There are no rocks in the ocean. It's dead coral. But it's not everywhere and it's very clear to tell where it's located as it's dark. The clear turquoise water is above soft sand. You just have to find a path over the coral in places. You can either tread softly....or like we did, just float over it until you get to the turquoise. There was no sea weed when we were there so I imagine that is just a seasonal thing. It was lovely! They have Hobie Cats, Paddle Boats, and Kayaking for the guests to partake in. It was fun and exhausting! THE NEGATIVES AND CONCERNS: - Signing at the end of each meal, food service to the room, food service to the pool, food service to the beach, etc. It was VERY ANNOYING! There is no such thing as needing the guests to sign for inventory purposes, as they even have you sign at the buffet with a receipt showing an outrageous total. This has to be strictly for tipping purposes and I found it rude and imposing. I like tipping and we take cash for this very purpose, but it was ridiculous to have us signing a check for chicken tacos, ceviche, and coke that showed a total of more than $50 when I know all too well that meal didn't even come close to that! Particularly when you are getting your own food at a buffet and have to sign a check which is telling you, that you just ate $50. Most of the time, it was taking longer to get the stupid check than it took to actually eat the meal and we just walked out a few times. But boy oh boy.....they would run you down to get your signature, so I'm assuming they are in big trouble if they don't get it, or are wanting to make sure you are leaving a tip. Either way, it's rude and tasteless. Totally unacceptable for this type of establishment. We always tip in cash and I am certain that the resort wants to know how much the employees are getting tipped and do this for these purposes. Particularly when they only pay the staff .80 cents per hour!!!!!!!!! It's a good way for them to ease their conscience probably. I refuse to do it that way. Those employees should be able to get their tips....keep their tips....and not have the company reduce the impact of how much they actually pay them with a smoke screen. - The wood used for the decking, steps to the beach, and area surround the pools gets so hot by 10am that you MUST WEAR SHOES. This is the same wood at your patio. BE CAREFUL. - The giant jetted tub should have a step to get into it. It's far too deep and slippery to manage otherwise. I busted my knee trying to get in. - There were a few times while we were at our little cabana on the beach that we were lacking a drink and I had to go to the pool bar and ask for water. One of these times there were 5 pool/drink boys standing around chatting and since we were the only people out at the pool/beach it should have been easy to get an attendant. - When we checked in we were told by our butler that we could either present a credit card at the beginning or present it at check out for any incidentals. We elected to present it at check out. During our time, some KaoPec was signed for.....a few tips were signed for......and then my husband went to the gift shop to buy me some aloe spray ($22.00) and he was told it could not be charged to the room and we would need to bring our credit card down. He explained that we had already charged several things to the room and didn't understand why we couldn't charge the aloe. She directed us to a supervisor. The supervisor said she was sorry but we needed to give a credit card for this purpose. This was annoying and felt a bit like we weren't being trusted. Not a good feeling. - 11 oz bottles of water are used for everything. At the pool, the beach, in room fridge, in the buffet and bistro.....I found that to be wasteful. Bigger bottles would mean much less plastic and waste. - The day we were due to leave, I went to take a shower after being out at the beach, and there was no hot water. After an hour of staff trying to get hot water, we were told it was not a problem at the building, but rather a problem with the huge water tanks somewhere. I had to take a cold shower and wash my hair that way. It was......fun! lol - I took a bath in the jetted tub one night. The next day when we came in after lunch, after maid service, I noticed something new next to the restocked shower gel....a knob. After looking it over really well we figured out it was the knob for the on/off of the jets in the tub. How strange....it was fine the night before. We looked around the tub....in the tub....and some sort of piece that hold the knob on was missing. Also the drain plug was not in the drain and was lying next to it. I found it very odd that the knob was broken and there was a piece missing and obviously the maid had cleaned the tub but not callen for repair on the knob? We called the butler and within the hour there was a new knob and not a word about it. Weird. STAFF: A big thank you to LILI.....HUMBERTO.....RAMON......and MARIA JOSE. Lili and Maria Jose are butlers on the grand side and were lovely people. Humberto is one of the pool/beach drink guys....what a sweetheart! Ramon is a waiter who worked in Manhattan and he was so nice and genuine. THE BIG CONCERN: All in all we loved this resort and would go back in a heartbeat. However, I left this concern till last because it played such a huge part in our vacation and in our feelings about whether we feel comfortable coming back. Our second day at the resort, we had lunch at the Bistro. Up until that point we had both shared every meal and ate/drank the same things. That day at lunch, my husband ordered a salad and I had soup. Three hours later he began vomiting and having diarrhea. It was mild at first and turned into a horrible experience by midnight. I called and asked to speak with management but was told only a butler was available. I explained what was happening and that my husband was trembling and vomiting/diarrhea every 15 minutes. We spoke about getting a doctor and I was told it might take awhile. My husband said he could wait until the morning and if he could just some medicine that might help him it would be great. The butler said she would send someone to town to get something. About 2 hours later, she brought some Kao Pectate (liquid). She had a bill for me to sign. I was concerned about my husband, but later I thought about it and even though I signed it, I did not get a copy and did not even realize what I had signed for. I had taken meclizine with me for motion sickness on the plane and my husband was able to take that. The vomiting subsided but he continued to have diarrhea all night and all next day. I again went and spoke with someone and asked for our regular butler. It was her day off. Someone else came and spoke with me and I relayed my concern about the bill and also the concern for any other guests' health. I wanted them to know what my husband ate and since we had to sign for all the meals, they could look back over what he had eaten and try to figure out what had happened. I have had salmonella poisoning before and know exactly what food poisoning is like. It sure seemed like food poisoning even though I was told that Americans sometimes get upset stomaches when eating new food. I explained that we travel a lot and eat tons of different foods. I was assured the general manager of the resort would be made aware. I was also apologized to by a staff member who seemed very caring so I will not complain about that. I will however, say that we have been home for 2 days now and still have not heard a word from Grand Velas in regards to this. My husband's loose stool finally subsided yesterday. It became common knowledge that my husband was ill because we had a lot of lesser staff ask how he was doing. It was not only scary, but disappointing that my husband did not get to experience the food like I did. Especially at Autor. He had to leave for the restroom every 15 minutes during our experience there and it was very sad that he could not eat much or enjoy it. It was ironic that after that, even though I had signed to be charged for the medicine, they would not let us charge the aloe. I loved this resort. I know that weird things happen sometimes and it was probably a huge fluke. We have traveled so much and neither one of us has ever gotten sick like that. I wish that we had gotten some concern from management. That is a huge regret for us. Other than that, we have tried not to let that ruin our experience because the resort really is lovely. They are new and are working out some kinks. Things like hot water and such, will work themselves out over time. An interesting note: The president of Mexico was having dinner outside on the patio of the Bistro our very first night there. There were tons and tons of federal security agents with automatic rifles everywhere. It was quite exciting. We also saw some famous Mexican television personalities. This will be a grand place once everything is worked out........if management will demonstrate some professional courtesy and care for their run of the mill guests..... A NOTE ON TIPPING: Please please please make sure you tip. The average daily wage for the mayan riviera is $8.00. Per day! They usually work 6 days a week.....10 hours a day. $48.00 a week is nothing to live on...even for down there. Please do your part and help them. The people who bust their tails the most are the ones cleaning the beach and maintaining the landscaping. Then the ones who are running drinks to the beach, and cleaning the rooms are next. These people are the ones who usually get the least tips and the least pay. The ones who don't speak any English are paid even less. Please do your part to help them and also create a space for some common understanding for why they risk being away from their families and loved ones to try to make it into America for some kind of opportunity. Or why the life of drug crimes is so prevalent in Mexico. FINAL NOTE: I know this was lengthy.....I'm long winded. Hopefully the pictures will show the beauty of this place.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSimply the best!!!\u201d", "Author": "Mishko95", "ReviewID": "UR31630984", "Content": "Well, let me start out by saying that it was our first vacation at Riviera Maya and the first trip outside of the US with our 3 years old boy. After spending sleepless nights on the Internet for about 4 months, we've made a decision to book this hotel, despite the fact that the prices were extremely high. So, here we are in Cancun on Saturday April 25. 11 am and we are waiting for our transportation. 35 minutes later we are approaching the Grand Velas. It has impressed us from the very first sight! Beautiful grounds with some sort of a jungle theme, super nice, modern and clean lobby. We were greeted by names by the concierge and the bell boy. After a short conversation and a couple of cool welcome nonalcoholic drinks we were brought to our room. What can I say? This is the best room we've ever been to: it was enormous (and we had the smallest type of the room), the bathroom and appliances are gorgeous, the view from the balcony is breathtaking. For the little one that brought a small bathrobe and fresh juice. Everyday entering such clean and well kept room was a true delight for us. The food. Since we were with a kid we were not allowed to visit the adult-only restaurants, although they gave us an option for baby-sitting for 30.00USD in hour, which we decided to forgo. We probably missed a lot, judging by the restaurants that we were allowed to visit. The food was out of this world. The breakfast menu at the buffet, called Azul has been changing every day. approx. 12 types of freshly squeezed juices, a special section for health conscious people, the quality of food is superb. Btw, the best filet mignon of the stay and also their sushi were fresh every day and surprisingly good. All the restaurants have the kids menu, although our little one has been eating the \"normal\" food as well. If he did not like something the chef always accommodated with a special request. Each and every person from the staff knew him by name and he quickly found his friends after saying \"mucho gracias\" every time he was taken care. Other restaurants, Frida and sin lin (which is located in the jungle), are top notch as well. As a tradition, my wife and I celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day by having dinner in some new and posh restaurant in Manhattan. Traveling around the world we've also visited some good restaurants, so I can say for sure that we know what the good quality of the food as well as the ambiance is. Both restaurants at Grand Velas are the world class and the food and service were superb. Staff. Since we were with the kid we had to wake up very early to beat the sun, so by 6:30am we were up. It seems that the staff starts working around 5am or perhaps works 24 hrs or so:). They were constantly cleaning the grounds, they are taking care of you by accommodating you with every possible thing and they are very friendly. The beach and the pools. As it was mentioned in other reviews the beach is rocky. The water is full of seaweed and although the staff is going above and beyond by trying to remove it from the water, it is still there and it looks and smells unpleasant. The beach is quite long and we had enjoyed our family walks after breakfast. The pool is divided into adult and children sections and is heated, so despite of the everyday winds, the temperature is very comfortable. My wife did not get a chance to explore their Spa but she did use the gym daily which is very clean, has all the latest equipment as well as the personal trainer, Ivan, on staff. The people. We've been there for one week and the number of guests at the hotel has varied from 20 to 60 at the most. A lot of large families with kids. A couple of nights when we went to dinner we were the only people in the whole restaurant and it was a bit weird. There were a lot of Brits in the hotel as well as Americans. By the way, there is a great room service feature that we've used 2 times. It is 24/7 and it is totally worth trying. So, overall, despite of the swine virus, which kind of shocked us, as we didn't know about it before one of my wife's colleagues had sent us an e-mail telling us to check the news as there is something going on in Mexico, we had a blast! Our boy enjoyed himself and I'm glad that his fist family vacation was such a nice experience. We would definitely go back to this hotel and do recommend this to others. It is superb and is truly part of the Leading hotels of the world. Just keep in mind that the prices are high and we paid full price for the kid as well as there were no promotions for staying at this hotel with the kids.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThis Resort definately has the \"WOW\" Factor\u201d", "Author": "britex", "ReviewID": "UR31591355", "Content": "Without a doubt the best facility we have been to.

We have been to Puerto Vallarta and stayed at Velas Vallarta when we visited. This is a sister property to Grand Velas Nuevo Vallarta and Grand Velas Riviera Maya. We loved the property and had a great time while we were there. We liked Velas Vallarta so much we bought a one bedroom suite at the property. The one bedroom suites there are huge. They have a full kitchen, living room with couches, a SEPARATE bedroom, large bath and very large balcony. Grand Velas Riviera Maya was being built at the time and we were told all about it. We were very excited and planned then, 1 year ago, to come and visit Playa del Carmen to see the new Grand Velas. The Grand Velas is advertised as an all suite hotel with 1 bedroom suites. Well that is a complete lie. The rooms are not one bedroom. They are one large hotel room with a large bath and balcony.The rooms are OK but NOT at all what they are advertised to be. First when we started booking our reservation for May 2009 we were told the All Inclusive fee was $330 a night per person for the Ambassador Suite . Which is the standard rate every person is given. We were not happy with this because when we bought our property at Velas Vallarta in Puerto Vallarta we were told we would get a better deal on the rate than the standard person would that did not own at Velas Vallarta. We explained we were owners at Velas Vallarta and were told it did not make a difference and that was the rate. We really wanted to see the new property and decided to go ahead and book the room. A few months later I called owner services and after allot of headache was finally given a cheaper rate as an owner. Not much cheaper though. Now about Grand Velas Riviera Maya. We arrived and were met in the lobby by someone to help with our check-in. We explained we were owners at Velas Vallarta and asked if there was any way we could get an upgrade to the adults only section. The girl went and checked and came back and said there is nothing available and they had a great suite for us. We asked where it was located and we were told they were putting us in the corner of the hotel where you can barley even see the water and could not see the beach at all. All we could see is the pool. I said when I booked I specifically requested a beach front room with ocean view. So she goes back and acts like she is trying hard to find something else. Comes back a minute later and says we have great and bad news. Nothing available in the Adults Only section but they have a room with ocean view and now we get a room with a plunge pool. So we were taken to a room on the far end of the hotel, but did have an ocean view. The rooms do have the extra large wooden door which is nice. Then we entered the room and it's only one large room. I asked why they advertise the suites as one bedroom when they ARE NOT. We were told this is what all the rooms are like in the hotel. No explanation for lying and saying the rooms are one bedroom. Even when I booked the room I asked if they are one bedroom and was told, \"YES THEY ARE ALL ONE BEDROOM SUITES\". I was also told about all the restaurants and all kinds of details about the property. So now we are here and find out only 3 of the restaurants are open. All require pants and collard shirts. Which we don't mind having the opportunity to go to nice restaurants and getting dressed up for a few of the nights. The problem is there are NO casual restaurants open so we have to get dressed up every single night of the 7 nights we are here, which is ridiculous. The only way you can eat in a casual atmosphere is if you order room service. So this is our 2nd night here at Grand Velas. We went to Frida last night for dinner and it was AWESOME. We were very impressed with the quality of the food and the service. Although you do have to wait for a receipt, even thought you have paid a very expensive All Inclusive fee. You get the impression that they expect to be tipped. On top of the All Inclusive fee you have already paid. Also we were 1 of 3 couples in the entire restaurant. Now about the occupancy of the hotel. It appears there are very very few people in the entire hotel. There were only about 15 people total on the beach and maybe 25 to 30 people around the pools. Now remember we were told that there were no rooms available in the Adults Only section. Which is obviously another LIE. So now we are back in our room after being out on the beach and by the pools all day. The light does not work in our shower. Also as others have said in these reviews, the temperature of the water is not consistent. It was freezing cold then scolding hot the entire time in the shower. We called and they came and looked at it. They said they will have to try a few things to see if it can be fixed. We are not expecting that to happen. Then I take out my computer to get online. As the hotel is advertised as having wireless access throughout. Well that is another lie. No wireless access. I call the front desk and they say \"well wireless is not available in all suites\". They do bring an ethernet cable so I can access the internet. But my problem is another lie about stating there is wireless throughout the hotel. Also I almost forgot. People are raving about the beds and pillows. Well they are nothing special. There is a feather down comforter, but why would you want a feather down comforter when it's in the mid 90s outside? And the pillow menu is nothing special either. They have flat feather pillows, which you might as well not have a pillow at all. There were 2 other types of pillows available. None are very good but atleast better than the feather down flat pillows. Now about the beaches. Some people have stated the beaches are very rocky. Well that is not true. The beaches are not rocky at all. In the water there is old coral/rocks. So that may be what they are talking about. But that is VERY obvious if you just look at the photo of the resort.

We have been to many exaulted places, eaten at great restaurants, and usually want a little better than is provided. There can be nothing better than perfection, and Grand Velas is perfection. Reception: After a little confusion at the airport, corrected instantaneously, we were checked in while sipping wonderful hibiscus tea, seated at a comfortable sofa. Everything done well. I was blown away by the lack of attitude and pretension. My 3 yr old was not exactly pleasant after the train ride, but he was deescalated by everyone around us. Rooms- We had one pool suite and two ambassador suites. All were impeccibly clean, free of ants, mosquitoes and all the other issues that some regard as tropical \"charm\" The minibar always full, the linens better than Four Seasons, wonderfully powerful air conditioning, and a view to die for. Huge in size, we wanted for nothing. Each day housekeeping would make sure the marble was compltely dry so that my 80 year old mother would not slip. Beach- Well cared for, always clean, with wonderful service. Some areas had a coral/rocky botton, but there were plenty of areas to swim and walk on soft sand. Drinks were provided before asking- always everyone remembering your name and what you liked to drink. My 9 yr old had his mango smoothie without even having to ask. Plenty of shade, sand, chairs. Pool- The most beautiful I have ever seen, composed of tens of thousands of granite tiles. The kids side is larger than the pools at most of the resorts, the water clean, incredible service, and comfortable chairs. I wanted a tasting of different reposado tequilas one day, and the bartender at the pool bar poured me a tasting of 18 tequilas, and described the properties of each one. Amazing. Utterly amazing. My brother the lawyer and his pageant queen wife did not want to leave the pool area. Food- The best part of the resort. Will go over each separately. Room Service- Simply wonderful. Breakfast is nirvana on your patio in the morning. Other meals excellent, but did not come close to breakfast, and were less excellent than any of the restaurant food. Asian - forgot name- Good, but not great. The duck did not have the crackling skin I am used to, and many of the tasty treats were not hot enough, but this place is outrageously beautiful, located in the master suite jungle area. Piaf- I believe the chef is from the Loire Valley, and the food is deep, robust and magnificently presented. Service superb, and all wine glasses were Riedel. The place evoked a 1930's French bistro, without the smoke. The filet I had was simply the best I have ever tasted. Frieda- The only \"fine dining\" restaurant that allowed kids. This place is stunning, with marble, granite, a waterfall, excellent views, and delicious Mexican food. The striped bass here could not have been better, and the levels of complexity amazed me, having eaten at Frontera Grill, and spent much time in the wonderful restaurants along the Mexican coast. Azul- Had the most wonderful breakfast buffet. Tiny quantities of fruits, freshly queezed juices, cheeses, pastries, mexican dishes, several ceviches, and great great coffee. We had probably 8 meals here, and I never thought I would be praising a buffet. My kids loved the eggs cooked for them, and the view to die for. Bistro- My second favorite restaurant, in the adult section. I will always remember the awesome langoustines, grilled with a bit of lemon, garlic and olive oil, and one day when they did not have then, the chef found some lobster and served that grilled. The charcouterie all homemade, and the pastas to die for. The menu is huge, and my only suggestion is to allow kids for lunch. BTW, my son loves sushi, and this was made for him daily, exquisitely fresh fish that I stole from his plate. Guadaloupe, simply put, could teach his craft to the waiters at Fench Laundry. He put them to shame. Autor- The best of the best, and one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. If you read some of my other reviews, I tend to rarely gush. Each meal, involving 6-10 courses, were works of art. This rivals Arzak and most of the new wave Spanish restaurants in Barcelona and San Sebastien The sommilier, Miguel, was encyclopedic about wines, and the description that he provided were pithy and correct. Wine is my passion, and he knew everything. We ate here four times out of eight dinners, and could eat here every night. Kids- The facilities were great, and the caregivers intensely protective of their charges. This is one of the few places that I felt comfortable leaving the children alone. In short, we cannot wait to return. This is an incredible gem, and I felt bad that the swine flu fiasco(I am a physician), hurt this place and tourism in general. It is expensive, but worth more than every peso.

The grounds and beach are amazing and I can't even begin to praise the service. We were waited on hand and foot and esp at night at the restaurants, there was nothing we could ever want for. Our favorite was the Spanish restaurant with the chef's tasting menu. SO GOOD! On par with the best places we have eaten at in the states and the wine pairings were superb. The pool was beautiful and very quiet. We never had a problem finding a comfy bed and never had to wait for a tasty poolside drink. The service was great and very attentive and they'll even bring you lunch so you never even have to move out of the glorious sun (unless you want to!)

From the moment we arrived the staff was incredible and the place was absolutely gorgeous. The grounds were perfectly maintained with lush vegetation and the pool was amazing. The kiddie pool was massive and did not even seem like a child's pool. The resort was obviously not at capacity b/c it was post Easter and a crappy economy. News of the swine flu probably caused many cancelations. ROOMS: The rooms were very large...much bigger than rooms at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carltons. They had a private balcony with a table and chairs and a cushioned outdoor bed to lounge on. The bathroom was great-large shower w/seat and a separate large tub. We had two beds and a crib for my son. FOOD: Outstanding for an all inclusive. The selection at bkfast was so vast and the restaurants were great. The restaurants that allowed pple 19 yo or older rivaled any top notch NYC restaurant.

Bliss...\u201d", "Author": "simsgirls", "ReviewID": "UR28875839", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Velas with my 2 daughters for 5 nights from April 6th. We spent a long time researching our holiday and were looking for a luxury hotel with good food, good service and lots of sunshine! After weeks of trawling through various Trip Advisor comments, we stumbled across the Grand Velas, which ticked all the boxes. The good news is, when we arrived the boxes remained ticked! We booked our room through the hotel directly, which appeared to be the cheapest option. Maude and Marlem at reservations were very helpful and made this process very easy for us. After a long and stressful flight from London via Miami, we arrived late at the hotel. The taxi service that was arranged through the hotel was waiting for us at the airport \u2013 a large white van that could accommodate several people if needed! We were greeted in the lobby by the lovely Orlando with drinks and the obligatory registration. Sadly we were just too tired to appreciate how gorgeous the open plan reception was, and declined his offer on the hotel tour. Our room was vast \u2013 two large twin beds, modern interiors, and a large, spacious bathroom with plenty room for the 3 of us to relax and spread our girlie stuff round the room. The beds were really comfortable, the sheets soft and the pillows were squishy and fantastic! In the morning we initiated ourselves with breakfast at Azul. We were warmly greeted by all the staff but notably Omar who very quickly learnt that we liked our coffee after we collected our food from the buffet and that we didn\u2019t like our plates taken from us en route to our table from the buffet. This was the only thing we could criticize Azul for \u2013 there were loads of staff to the number of guests staying at the hotel, and though it shouldn\u2019t sound like a criticism, they were falling over themselves to carry our plates back to the table. Maybe as a Brit, this is something we didn\u2019t like. Breakfast was consistently good and the fruit juices were particularly good! The eggs were freshly made to your order and there was plenty of variety. Each group of rooms is assigned a \u201cbutler\u201d to oversee your stay. We had Ana who we could not fault. She was friendly, sincere and helpful. Each day we told her which restaurant we would like to eat in and she personally reserved a table for us. We also needed more amenities for the room such as towels, hangers, another robe and slippers and also some more water. It would\u2019ve been nice, as they were expecting 3 guests for the room to have already had these but Ana very quickly accommodated us. As the hotel was only 50% capacity (or less), it was not too difficult to find sunbeds round the pool. However, hardcore holidaymakers clearly get up early there and several of the best-positioned beds were hogged by about 8am. If the hotel was more full, reserving a bed should not be permitted. The pool staff were again, numerous and very willing to help if we needed a drink, some snacks or just erecting a parasol for us. We particularly bonded with Carlos who was extremely friendly and very helpful catering to all our needs. Tadye was also lovely, and was happy to pull 3 beds into a new position for us as it was so busy by the pool. We also really liked Kaspar the barman who serves up wonderful drinks all day long. 1 criticism was that the pool water by the bar was a little too cold. On to the restaurants! This was the most surprising aspect of this all-inclusive hotel. The restaurants were mostly a far better standard than we had ever expected \u2013 sometimes a little too pretentious perhaps. As a caterer myself, we found the Cocina del Autor to be the most original and experimental. We entered into the spirit of it by having the taster menu. The staff were great and explained each dish and also pointed out that should we want more of one thing, they would be happy to accommodate. In fact, they couldn\u2019t do enough to please us. The second restaurant we went to was Sen Lin in the jungle area of the hotel, which we got to with a courtesy bus. The menu was unusual and interesting and probably one of the busier restaurants. Again, the staff were incredibly helpful and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. I had the crocodile and my daughters had the duck. The third night we went to Frida. This one of our favourite restaurants. Again original, beautifully presented and the staff, though a little more subdued, were helpful and polite. The lamb shank, recommended to me by the waiter was delicious. The fourth restaurant, Piaff, was possibly the most disappointing and also the quietest. The room was decorated in dramatic black and red with chandeliers and mirrors \u2013 Bordello style. We were assigned a waiter, who was slightly creepy and seemed disinterested from his job. We then got assigned another, and although friendly and helpful, we felt he was a little bored. Perhaps the lack of customers was not helping this. The food was ok. Living near France, we are very familiar with French food, but this was the restaurant we felt didn\u2019t hit the mark. We had 1 lunchtime in the room as it was so busy by the pool and we ordered room service. It was delicious, arrived quickly, and was again beautifully presented. We also had 1 breakfast in the room which was different to the type of breakfast we would\u2019ve had in Azul and we were very impressed with the standard of it. The hotel was clearly eager to please their guests and we felt a 5 diamond award would be duly deserved. After we left the Grand Velas, we stayed a further 5 nights at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun, considered to be the best hotel on the strip. Compared to the Grand Velas we felt let down and we really missed the Grand Velas and the staff and would\u2019ve happily returned there. The grounds were phenomenal and the gardeners constantly tended to the lawn and the beach was beautiful and cleared of debris every morning. I was with my daughters aged 21 and a very grown up 14 yr old. Obviously we didn\u2019t qualify for the \u201cadult\u201d section of the hotel, but similarly we felt we did not want to be played with families with young children either. Something maybe the hotel should look into or rectify in someway? The only other comment we have is that at the end of each meal, we were unsure as to whether or not we had to keep tipping. We were presented with a bill to sign and felt obligated to leave a tip, which we did. I do believe that when the staff are working so hard and are so pleasant, they do deserve one, whether or not it\u2019s an all-inclusive hotel. We didn\u2019t feel that they were working so hard to receive a tip, sadly something we felt the Ritz Carlton did a little too often!! The criticisms we make really aren\u2019t that bad as the standard was so high. In the past we have stayed in Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental\u2019s in other parts of the world and felt Grand Velas could hold its own up there with the best of them. Although this was not a budget friendly hotel, we felt in this instance you get what you pay for and at the Grand Velas you are able to get a lot. We have not posted any photos with our review simply because photos do not do this hotel justice. Rest in the knowledge that when you arrive, you will be more than happy with what you receive.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel - Disappointing Service\u201d", "Author": "LSLA", "ReviewID": "UR28830385", "Content": "We stayed at Grand Velas in March for 5 nights. Hotel is 30-40 min drive from the Cancun airport and 15 min drive from la 5ta. We arrived on a Tue and the hotel seemed to have low occupancy from Tue-Thu and only really seemed busier on Sat. We were the only guests in the restaurants Tue \u2013 Thu evening. There was also plenty of room poolside and on the beach. Everything about the resort was amazing, except for the customer service \u2013 which was disappointing enough for us to not be able to fully recommend this hotel. Read below for details. Location: The hotel location is perfect for a relaxing vacation. It is far enough away from the loud, crazy atmosphere of la 5ta, but also a short drive from it. Beach: The beach in front of the hotel is great. It is a little rocky in some areas, but there are still areas that are walk-able. Water was warm. The hotel cleans the beach and grooms the sand every morning. Food: The hotel had the following restaurants open \u2013 Azul, Bistro, Cocina de Autor, Piaf and Sen Lin. The first 2 are the more casual family restaurants and are good. The latter 3 are the more formal restaurants that are \u201cadults only\u201d at night. Our favorites were Cocina and Piaf. I am vegetarian and the chefs were very willing to create special vegetarian dishes for me. Sen Lin was OK. The food at all the restaurants and cafes was excellent for an all-inclusive. And at Cocina and Piaf the food was pretty close to 5 star. Even the food at the poolside bar area was tasty. We also got room service for breakfast and it was very good. Gym: New equipment, great personal trainer available. Hotel: We stayed in the Ambassador Suite. The hotel room was very nice and spacious. Very comfortable king size bed, high-end furniture, nice flat screen TV, balcony, etc. The ocean and pool view was amazing. One thing to note: the room description on the hotel website is incorrect \u2013 there is not a couch sitting area (only 2 chairs) or remote controlled blinds in the Ambassador Suite. There was one issue we encountered with our first room. The air conditioner was making a strange noise, which we mentioned to our \u201cbutler\u201d the minute we walked in, rather than switch us rooms they insisted on trying to fix it, 3 different times. In the end, we were moved to a room that was not as nice as our first room, but they said that was all they had available \u2013 which seemed strange considering it felt like a ghost town our first couple of days. Customer Service: The food service people and \u201cbutlers\u201d were very nice and helpful. However, that same cannot be said for the lobby and concierge workers. They need training in 5 star customer service \u2013 especially since they are part of the Leading Hotels of the World. In addition to the poorly handled room switch when we first arrived, we encountered 3 other service issues. 1) We booked via Orbitz and saw there was a promo for 2 free massages or golf per person per stay. We did not receive confirmation from Orbitz, got to the hotel and told them about promo, hotel said they were not aware of promo, we contacted Orbitz who told us it was a hotel promo, we spoke to the hotel and after furnishing a print out of the promo that appeared on Orbitz they said they would honor it, next day we were told after we booked the spa appt that the promo was not valid, I spoke to the same hotel lobby person who now said that his boss reviewed it further and decided it was not valid. Both Orbitz and Grand Velas were at fault for the runaround that we received, but the hotel had the opportunity to remedy the situation and instead made it worse. It was extremely frustrating and not 5 star service. 2) Hotel claims they will pay for the transportation into town, but that you pay the way back. The cab driver picked us up, dropped us off in town and was expecting payment from us because the hotel did not pay him. We paid him and paid the driver that dropped us back off at hotel. We told the hotel, they seemed confused and said they would look into it. Nothing happened. Not 5 star service. 3) In order to contact Orbitz, we had to use the hotel phone. Charge was $5 per connection. We tried calling 6 different times, but the phone would connect and then cut out 10 seconds later. The 7th time finally worked. At check out we were told we had to pay the $5 connection fee for the 6 calls despite the fact that their faulty line dropped our calls. No compromise, no apologies. Again, not 5 star service. If you never have to interact with the Lobby help, you will love this hotel. If you do, don\u2019t waste your time trying to clarify any issues, you will only end up frustrated.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beautiful West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect\u201d", "Author": "geezerex", "ReviewID": "UR28647165", "Content": "Please note that these comments apply only to the family friendly section of the resort. On the positive side: A very safe-feeling atmosphere. Beautiful entrance, lobby, and grounds. Large, new, clean rooms and baths. Extremely comfortable bedding and pillows. Soft sheets and duvet covers that were changed daily or every other day. There was a good variety of TV channels. There was a DVD player and a roomy safe in the room. Great mini bar items which can be customized and restocked for free. Well decorated restaurants with great food and friendly service. Beautiful landscaping. Fantastic director at the kid's play center and friendly activities director for the children at the pool. The large, heated infinity swimming pool is designed extremely well for families. Drinking water you can trust. A fantastic spa with a wonderful, skilled staff (spa charges are all extra). Fun Karaoke bar with children's hour. The complimentary beach bags and slippers in the room were a real convenience. On the flip side: the butler concierge was sitting at a desk in front of the elevators when we arrived at our floor and he escorted us to our rooms. That was done just for show as he was never again to be found there. There was tequila with limes over the mini bar, but the limes disappeared the following morning and were never re-stocked. Even though we offered to pay extra for it, the kitchen refused to prepare a box lunch for a 12 hour excursion to the Mayan ruins which was arranged for us by the hotel (cost of the trip was extra). We ordered room service sandwiches the night before, but there was no way to wrap them for the trip. The main hotel concierge spoke either in Spanish or in broken English. I can understand Spanish rather well but when she became frustrated with her inability to express herself in English, she began speaking Spanish so quickly and stridently it was impossible to understand anything she said. There was no DVD rental library. There was no wireless internet, although the hotel let us borrow an ethernet cable to connect to their high speed internet service. There weren't enough hangers in the closet. Despite artificial reefs, the ocean was really too rough for swimming or snorkeling, especially for children. The hotel imposed a fee on all telephone calls - cellular or from the hotel room, even if you used a telephone card. I never got to use the telephone card I purchased to call home because the telephone in my room never worked, despite multiple requests for repair. The wait staff at Azul restaurant descended on us like vultures at the end of the buffet so that they could take our plates from us and carry them the remaining 10 or 15 feet to our table (it was over the top and embarrasing). The wait staff also kept offering extras, such as cocktails, wine, bottled water, al la carte menu items, etc., so that they could build up the \"bill\" and increase their tips. The constant presentation of \"bills\" for the purpose of creating a basis for a tip to the wait staff at a supposedly all-inclusive resort was a bothersome distraction. Instead of presenting bills, they should just increase the room rates by a hundred bucks a day and use that to compensate the staff for their services. We weren't there to spend time watching TV, but you should know that, unlike other rooms described by reviewers of this resort, our flat screen TV did not pivot or swivel and it was not possible to watch TV from the sitting area. While the above comments make it sound like there were more negatives than positives, it was really a great overall trip. I find that if I know the possible drawbacks of a resort in advance, I can adjust my expectations accordingly and have a more pleasant experience. I hope this review helps you in that regard. Also, please bear in mind that the resort is new and I'm sure it will continue to improve with the passage of time.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, top service, outstanding food!\u201d", "Author": "Zacharys_m0m", "ReviewID": "UR28519132", "Content": "We visited this resort over Spring Break with my nine year old son.

The resort was not booked and had no troubles with reservations for dinner, finding pool or beach chairs, etc. The restaurants were outstanding. We loved the Frida's menu and could have gone there every night. The red snapper and all of the soups were outstanding. However, our son loved Azul because it wasn't quite as formal, and the food was also very good. We had room service a couple of times and thought they had a great selection and the ceasar salad was unique and delicious. The breakfast buffet was the only buffet we went to and it was great. For lunches we usually ordered pool side and loved it was well. I usually have much lower expectations of food at all inclusive resorts and this was the best ever. The only unusual thing was that all of the menus had prices. We figured out half way through our stay that the \"bill\" was presented to you for tipping purposes. Some guests we talked to did not tip, but once my husband started tipping, they made sure to get us our bill. The pools on the kids side of the resort were great. They were heated at various temperatures, with the very shallow pool for the small kids being the warmest. Plenty of room and great to look over into the ocean. Bar service at the pools was friendly and prompt. The spa was unbelievable. The water treatments that you can access with any treatment were fantastic. Two different kinds of showers, a clay room, a sauna, a steam room, an ice room, the pools with different sprays and jets, the walk of pleasure/death....Can't say enough about it. They were still working on the spa which was distracting for the treatment itself, but once it is completed, it will be one of the best in the region. The only recommendation I would make is to have a few more activities during the day. We were wanted to walk on trails that were advertised, which were not available.
