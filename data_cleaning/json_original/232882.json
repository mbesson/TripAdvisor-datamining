(But note the Leonardo Express, platform 27, is another 5 - 10 minutes tromp from the automated ticket machines at the front of the station!) The \"tourist\" sites are spread all over Rome so nowhere is going to be ideal for everywhere - but the main bus station is outside the Termini, so this is perfect to be able to catch a bus or metro and cut your walking down a bit. Hotel has reception and (big) lift on ground floor and breakfast room / lounge / computer on top floor. And best of all the roof terrace. Breakfast can be taken to a table on the terrace and as it was 28c (in October!) when we were there - being outside in the Autumn sun was a good thing. Every member of staff was helpful and smiled a lot. Most spoke very good English. Breakfast was standard fare - but plenty of it. Meats, cheese, bread, croissants, cakes, cereal, fruit, juices and fresh coffee made to order. It was possible to fill up enough to just about avoid a lunchtime meal, which was good as Rome must be one of the most expensive places I have ever been for food and especially drink. Bedroom (Rm 212) was ok, with most of what you expect (flat screen TV). Shower only (no bath) but it was a good powerful one, so didn't bother me. The room has an easy to operate safe - but only just big enough to take an iPad - so a bit on the small side. Only thing lacking in room is a kettle and tea / coffee making facilities, but this is a common European fault. Staff on reception really pleasant, especially the two girls.

The room was quiet, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Breakfast on the terrace was a delight each morning. I could speak endlessly about the amenities, but I will focus on the exceptional staff. Shortly after booking the room, I sent an email requesting confirmation. I received a thoughtful response from Eleonora which included a site map, some thoughtful travel advice, and a sincere offer to assist with event bookings and other needs. I instantly felt welcome. On the day of our arrival, we struck out to see the city and were met by the desk staff as we left Columbia. The gentleman suggested we leave our passports with him, for our own good. Being a first-time traveler to Italy, and more than a little suspicious, I declined and kept the passports. A day later we met three US travelers who had just lost their passports to pick-pockets. The staff at Columbia had truly been giving sound and caring advice. Finally, at the close of day 1, I was still struggling with a newly purchased cell phone which simply would not function in Italy. Staff worked with me and, when the phone proved to be inoperable, Eleonora used her own credit card to phone my home in the US to tell family we had arrived safely. So much kindness and consideration...I hated to say goodbye. Everything about this place exceeded expectation. The price was right.

I can only hope that my review might still reach anyone traveling to Rome, & that they might have the pleasure of experiencing a hotel that has quite honestly become my home away from home, & a staff that has become a part of my family no matter where I am! The Hotel Columbia is conveniently located just a few minutes walk from Termini Station on an equally safe & quiet side street that is just steps from the Red line metro, multiple bus stops, and from Piazza Republica & It's majestic fountain. This location offers amazing convenience to get directly to the city center, while being just far enough out to allow for a comfortable evening walk & peaceful nights rest. If these criteria weren't enough already, the staff themselves are like nothing I have seen before in hundreds of hotels across more than 20 countries.Once inside the hotel, it is easy to notice that cleanliness, style, comfort, and more importantly pride in what they do is at the utmost level of importance for every staff member from the very top down. Simply put, they actually enjoy having you as a guest, and are willing to do anything within their means to make your Hotel Columbia Experience and enjoyable & memorable one. From the warm greetings of Victoria & Anche, to Pietro's incredible smile & cappuccini, and if you are lucky - an afternoon drink on the terrace with Patrizia, every moment at the Columbia is memorable to say the very least! Although the straight forward details of the hotel are enough to convince nearly anyone, to understand my experiences it is important to go back to the beginning, and follow what has led me feel confident that as long as the Hotel Columbia is in Rome, I will always have a home away from home! I must admit that my first stay was due to a very fortunate disaster, where I found myself very overwhelmed & very without a place to stay. I stumbled into the small but beautiful lobby of the Columbia, a site that I now know so well, for the very first time with luggage on both arms and an equally combined look of fear, frustration, and failure to enjoy my time in Rome. I fully expected to be laughed right back out the door as I asked if there was any chance for a room for my final remaining night, not to mention at a ridiculous rate that matched my almost completely depleted funds. Whether it was just my lucky day, or the wonderful woman ( whom I now know as Victoria) just felt bad for me, I will never know. All I do know is that upon hanging up with the owner, she looked at me, smiled widely, and said \"We just happen to have a special right now for that exact rate!\". Since that very first stay I have never turned back, and do not intend to. In the time that has gone by, I have taken groups as large as 24 to Rome, groups as small as 3, and even my parents & family; every time having stayed at the Hotel Columbia. I have yet to find anyone who did not thoroughly enjoy their stay. The incredible & unique stories that have resulted are far to many to share here, but the one thing I can assure everyone reading, is that when it comes to hotels in the \"Eternal City\", the Hotel Columbia will FOREVER be the only choice for my employees, clients, friends, and of course myself & my family.

The location was great: a couple of blocks from Termini (the major train station in Rome), and across the street from a cafe/bar for evening snacks and cravings. The room rate included breakfast, which was a plus. The breakfast is simple: yogurt, cereals, juices, milk, bread, pastries, and cappuccino, which did the trick. Also, breakfast is not a major meal in Italy, so this was extensive by most standards. The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly.

There were no reviews of bed bug spottings at Hotel Columbia, and I personally checked out the beds and sheets and found no obvious signs of bed bugs (I'm not an expert by any means, but I've looked into what signs to watch for, and yes, I am a paranoid New Yorker!). I found the neighborhood around the hotel to be safe (contrary to previous reviews) and actually a breath of fresh air from the tourist-dense parts of Rome.

For the 2009 visit, we stayed for 3 days when we first arrived and had a great experience (outside of being robbed, if that makes any sense), and stayed for one night on our way back to the states and had a bad experience. When we stayed at the Columbia on our way back we were treated to a rude front deskman and a smoking room with a non-functioning A/C unit. We arrived late (7 PM) but had confirmed our late arrival. Nevertheless, when we pointed this out and asked for a non-smoking room, we were told there were none available that \"that's what happens when you arrive late.\" Another front deskman the next morning had no idea of where in the train station to buy the tickets for the airport train. But my main complaint is this: In my 2007 stay, I arrived back home to find that my guidebook to Rome and a small gift I'd purchased while there was not in my luggage (I'd packed both away before my last night in Rome). I emailed the hotel and asked if they had found them, and they said they had not. I chalked it up to carelessness and them possibly getting underneath the bed or tangled in the bedding (and taken by the staff, of course), but my instinct told me I HAD packed them in my suitcase. I should have listened to my instincts. For my 2009 stay, I packed one dress shirt along with about five other casual shirts, still on their hangers. I placed them in the closet on arrival Friday and when I went to get the dress shirt for dinner Sunday night t was not there. Again, my first instinct was to think that I may have somehow changed my mind about taking the shirt (I had worn another similar colored dress shirt on the plane) but I was sure I had packed the shirt. It was then that I remembered of my previous visits\u2019 experience of missing items. I didn't mention anything to the staff (why?) and when I got home I confirmed that the shirt was gone. So I've stayed at the Columbia twice and had items stolen from my room twice. You'd think I'd learn from the first visit. I can't imagine that I'm the only one that's had this happen to them. I did notice that if you stand at the front desk you can clearly see the keys of the rooms who's occupants are out; an easy job for someone w/ a hotel pass key. It\u2019s too bad; the Columbia has almost been 100% wonderful, a great value, mostly friendly staff (the woman that works in the dining room on the weekends is a gem) and perfect location.

We walked our socks off (for over 10 hours) but didn't need any local transport. We only stayed for 2 days, so the fact that we didn't have to wait to anyone and anything was fab. No only is the hotel in a fab location, but it was extremely clean. Our room was great, burgandy walls, tall ceilings, HUGE chandalier and gold beddings, curtains and settee! (my fav colours!) Although I do think some other rooms are neutrel in colour. Our receptionist 'Andrea', went above the call of duty and catered to our every need and more. He even waited for us to return on my husbands birthday to send up a complimentary bottle of champagne!! I wanted to take my husband someone special with 'proper' italian food, where the italians eat. No worries, he told me of a restaurant 5 mins walk away which he goes to regularly himself, he rung and booked a table, gave us a map with instructions and off we went. The food was out of this world (restaurant name: Pasta Love!!), and although the owner couldn't speak much English, he knew far more than we did Italian, but we did get what we ordered (although I did feel very embarrassed as he apologies to us for not knowing much English, but I spoke to Andrea and asked him to explain how grateful we were) The hotel is on a b & b basis, and the breakfasts are fab, eaten on the roof terrace (although temperature still very hot at 8am), but there is plenty of seating inside. Lots of selection of food (not cooked), but you really don't need it when it's hot outside and you'll be doing lots of walking!! Absolutely fantastic time in Rome and got to see many of the sights in so little time. Always get a guided tour of the Coloseum, only costs additional \u20ac8 p.p (on top of the normal \u20ac12 entrance fee), but you get talk outside, skip the queue, tour inside (approx 1 hour) and even get a further 1 hour tour of the ruins next to the Coloseum. Absolute must and the tour quides are walking about outside the entrance. Also went to the Trip Elevator which is a 4d experience cinema (which is great when its hot) we went for the starting of the world & the Romans film. Approx 1 hour in total, was fab again and you had the glasses, headphones (in many languages) and it was all simulated with the seats moving with story (fab). Tevi fountain is a must, it took my breath away (which thrilled my husband!), and take your water bottles as the fountains, which are found in loads of places, is all drinking water, so fill your water bottles up with the cold water or have a wash!!

Full of italian people, excellent food and well priced! Jug of wine is 8euros! - Thats amore (restaurant) - don't be fooled by the look of it, its overpriced, staff are stroppy and food not great. -Get a metro pass for 3 days - 11 euros, can travel almost everywhere and it includes the buses too. - I missed it, but alot of people on the plane on the way back were saying how lovely the trevi fountain is at night. - Vatican museum- There are people selling tours but they work out around 50 euros each which are probably very good but inside the museum you can get an audio guide for 7 euros which is still good if your trying to save money for more wine!

Was perfectly located a 5 minute walk away from the Termini Rail Station, so no need to get a taxi. We recommend landing at Fiumcino Airport as you get a shuttle train service directly to the Termini called the Leonardo Express. The service runs every 30 mins and the journey time is also 30 mins. Cost is 11 euros per person one way. If there are 4 people in your party, it seems like it works out a little cheaper per head getting a taxi from the airport into Rome. In this case its best landing at Ciampino Airport as its a little closer. The hotel is slightly to the east of the city, but the main sights are in easy reach. Colosseum is 10mins, Trevi, Spanish Steps and Pantheon 20mins, Vatican City 30mins. All of these attractions are highly recommended. If this sounds like too much walking you can book a tour bus at 25 euros per head for two days. There are a few companies which you can find easily outside the Termini. You can hop on and off at any time and we didnt have to wait any longer than 15 minutes for a bus. This proved a saviour for my pregnant wife! The Colosseum and Vatican Museums have very long queues at peak times and we deemed it worthwhile paying extra for a guided tour which means you jump the queues. We didnt book in advance as these agents go up and down the queues regularly. Cost to enter Vatican Museum is 14 euros but we paid 45 euros for a guided tour. A bit steep maybe, but cut queuing down from 3 hours to half an hour. The Museum proved the highlight of the trip, so we could easily justify paying extra. Colosseum costs 11 euros, 21 euros with guided tour. As for the hotel, although not 5 star, is very clean and comfortable. Well stocked bathroom and minibar, plenty of storage space and flat screen TV. Breakfast buffet is served on the glorius roof terrace and was delicious. Staff are very friendly and were more than happy to carry luggage up to rooms, even though the lift was being refurbished during our stay(work had just finished on the lift by the time we left).

Rooms were very clean and staff very helpful and friendly. Katrin at the Hotel Columbia was there from the start, ready to lend a hand. She was considerate, communicative and such a pleasure to work with. Katrin even booked our tours of Rome as well as our private transfer to the hotel since we were arriving very late at 11:00 PM. This turned out to be a wise decision. We had everything in order before we arrived and were able to start our Rome tour right after our sumptuous breakfast among the lemon trees on the terrace. Breakfast was more than I imagined. They provided fruits, breads, cereals, juices, two types of tortes and cakes, cheese, meats, yogurt and more! YUM! Hotel Columbia is situated in a convenient location for touring. The tour company Katrin booked us on for our Vatican City tour was just a block away but they picked us up and dropped us back off in front of our hotel anyway. Just a few helpful hints: The Roman Colosseum is just a short 15 minute downhill walk, the Piazza della Republica a short 1 minute walk, and the Stazione Termini a short 3-5 minute walk. The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps were about a 20 minute walk or about 6 Euros via cab ride. We just took the cab ride on the way back since it was an uphill walk. My husband and I so enjoyed the Hotel Columbia and its warm and inviting staff. We wished we could have stayed a bit longer in Rome but had to catch a cruise. We will surely be back to stay there longer when we return to Rome! It was like home away from home! Aloha from Hawaii!

Despite being a five minute walk from the train station, the hotel feels completely safe; I felt comfortable walking around the area at night, and as there were two restaurants opposite the hotel that seemed to stay open until a bit past 12:30AM, there was still plenty of light and cover. The hotel felt more like a B&B to me; the room was not what I envision when I think 'hotel' (particularly at that price point), but it was more than adequate and acceptable. The furnishings put me a bit in mind of a friend's sister's bedroom, which was rather charming. There was, surprisingly, plenty of space in the room; the desk chair was rather uncomfortable, but as the TV was opposite the bed, I just used the bed as a couch. The bathroom was clean, if a bit small, but everything worked perfectly. Some say the shower's a bit small -- it's a standard shower cube, nothing more and nothing less, and perfectly easy to deal with. Housekeeping was quick and efficient, and they always restocked the shampoo and body wash (I believe I had three separate bottles at one point), which was much appreciated. The breakfast buffet is worth it -- no hot dishes, but plenty of other standards, and rather yummy. If you go early, before it gets too hot, the rooftop terrace makes for an enjoyable, relaxing way to start the day. However, the best thing about the hotel is the staff -- charming, professional, kind, friendly. They always welcomed you upon return, were prompt with requests, and genuinely a pleasure to deal with. Only downside to the hotel is the location -- close to the train station means far from most tourist sites. While the metro is close by, the Roman metro is an acquired taste -- scent, rather, and that may not be for everyone. That being said, it's possible to walk, but that's may not be an enjoyable experience in the summer heat. Overall, not a bad value for the money. I likely won't be returning to Rome, but if I were to, there's a good chance I'd stay here again.

The best thing, however, was the location - just about everything was within walking distance (took us about 20 minutes to walk to the Colosseum). A tip for anyone visiting for the first time - it's worth taking the hop-on/hop-off sightseeing bus to get your bearings. We didn't do this until the Sunday and were surprised at how close the other sights were to the hotel. If you're planning to visit the Vatican, get there as early in the morning as you can and make sure you're in the right queue! We arrived at about 10am on the Saturday morning, stood for 20 minutes in a fairly fast moving queue to discover it was for reserved tickets. We went to join the \"ordinary\" queue and, I kid you not, it went all round the outside of the Vatican walls - not short! Added to the fact that the weather was unseasonably hot (in the 90s every day!), we thought we were going to have to give it a miss. As luck would have it, we were approached by someone in St. Peter's Square who pointed us in the direction of an English speaking guided tour which was just starting - cost a bit more but at least we finally made it in!

I would recommend this hotel to anyone its in the right place surrounded by lovely places to eat, its not a hotel with a gym sauna swimming pool etc etc etc but it makes up for it in other ways Will be back there soonxx", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201clovely, friendly, convenient and clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "SalScotland", "ReviewID": "UR5439551", "Content": "we would definitely return to the hotel columbia, although the area around Termini was not so perfect it was in fact very easy to get around Rome from and buses everywhere returned to Termini so no matter how far we walked it was easy to get back.

Stayed at the Hotel Columbia which is in a central location just around the corner from the Termini Station and was easy to find. Was a bit disappointed with the exterior as it looked a bit shoddy and was located on a grubby street but was very pleasantly surprised once inside. The Hotel Columbia is spotlessly clean and is well maintained, the staff are friendly and always eager to help. The rooms are tastefully decorated, we were very lucky to have the only room in th hotel with a terrace which was a great place to unwind after a hard days sightseeing. The roof terrace is the perfect place to start the day, breakfast was as expected with a selection of cereals, croissants, toast, cheese and juices. The terrace bar was open on an evening but we never had the time to go up for a drink. Overall I was very impressed with the Hotel Columbia and would definately stay again.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient, helpful staff.

We found this to be an excellent hotel; both rooms were of adequate size, clean and well maintained as was the en-suite facilities. The staff were very friendly and most helpful on all matters. Breakfast was something to look forward to and there was always plenty on offer to set you up for the day. The rooftop terrace was also a bonus in Rome, especially on a nice evening and the bar prices were very reasonable for a city. A bottle of wine from the bar was cheaper than the off licence around the corner! This hotel is handy for the bus and train terminus for those with walking difficulties. Personally, we enjoyed a pleasant walk to most of the main sights and called in at many beautiful Basilicas en-route. There were many good restaurants in the area, but one to avoid is the rip-off \"snacks\" restaurant across the road (overpriced beer, poor food and 15% service charge), ask the staff for their recommendations. Our tour guide gave us the following advice on prices \u2013 use the price of the Margarita pizza on the menu as a guideline - 3 euros was reasonable, 5 euros was expensive and anything beyond was a rip-off. Don't expect any pizza in Rome to come up to the quality/quantity standards of your local pizza delivery in the UK - you won't find any - trust me!!! The staff will also book your taxi to the airport on the morning of your departure for a realistic fixed price, so no big fares or surprises.", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woking Surrey", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel\u201d", "Author": "cannylass61", "ReviewID": "UR5289408", "Content": "Excellent location.

It's 2 minutes stroll from Termini, where you can pick up bus, metro or tour buses to virtually everywhere you want to go, or easy walk to most major sites. It's dead central but very quiet and peaceful, the staff are a delight - friendly, helpful, polite. Its not, itself, smack bang in one of the Tourist Spots, so its more Real Rome, local restaurants/shops are reasonable. The rooms do vary, so if you're not happy ask to see a different one. Ours was on the small side, but v. peaceful with lovely balcony and all mod cons so we were content. OK, the bathroom door handle was loose, but that was such a minor complaint against an otherwise perfect hotel. Lovely roofgarden for breakfast or a quiet drink and no ripoff bar prices. Only other slight reservation was the Tour Company they use (if you want to book a tour via the hotel) is distinctly dodgy.

There are plenty of good restaurants in the surrounding area and the hotel receptionist was very helpful in suggesting where to go and not to go. The room was spotlessly clean with fresh towels and linen every day. It's not the fanciest hotel we have stayed in but has everything you need. The breakfast was excellent and is served on the roof terrace. Rome is a wonderful city to visit but watch out for the con men who drive around, pretending to be lost. They will call you over and ask for directions to wherever, then they spin you a yarn about their wife being the same nationality as you and that they are in Rome for a fashion conference. The outcome is that they will try to \"borrow\" money from you for petrol for their hire car!

There was a large selection of fruit, cereal, pastries, cold meats and yogurts. The rooms were very clean and a decent enough size. Staff on reception are very pleasant and helpful, plus they speak English. The only slight downside to this hotel is its location close to Termini station. This is a rough area, so be careful when travelling home at night. Its not dangerous as long as you exercise the usual caution you should in any city, dont carry too much cash or cards(there is a safe in the hotel room) and put your hands visably over your bag to deter muggers. This is not to scare anyone, just a note to remember. You will find these areas in any city.
