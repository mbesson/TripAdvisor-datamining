I was visiting Spain for the first time with my spouse and decided to choose Hotel Del Comte due to its great location. The best part is that you can connect from the airport by taking Aerobus A1 from the airport than stops at Urgell metro and then the hotel is a block walk up on Del Comte. On the way back to the airport too, the stop is 2 blocks south on Sepulveda - it is Euro 5 per person per trip. The buses are very frequent running every 6-12mins depending on the time of day. It is truly situated in a very central part of Barcelona, central to everything - metro (Urgell - red line). For my LGBT friends, this is 2-3 blocks to the gay area of Eixample - so you can party all night and then walk back to the hotel. As for the hotel, the room we got was a back room #215, the street facing part of the hotel - so it can get a bit noisy from the traffic. The rooms need better windows to keep the noise out. The room was comfortable and clean when we got there with enough closet space for the 2 of us. The bathroom has a walk in shower with good hot water. There are no bedside clocks here, as is the norm in any European hotel, so if you are used to it bring along a travel watch. They only provide a shampoo/body gel combo tube, so if you like your own brand, bring one along. The bed mattress was great in my opinion, I like a firm mattress. The room is also safe as far as valuables storage is concerned - there is a safe in the room, I just put a lock on my bag when I was out. The rooms are a bit thin-walled, so if you have a noisy neighbor, you may hear it - I had a tour group staying on the floor and it was noisy some nights. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for Euro 9 but your can skip it and grab breakfast otuside at the tapas joints around or at the supermarket below the hotel called Dia market - things are very cheap hear. You can buy bottled water for 19c/bottle - we never spent more than Euro 5 for 2 people for breakfast there.

There is a buffet breakfast, (not that you really need it in Barcelona you are far better off going straight out), free internet in reception and wi-fi throughout.But thats about it. The rooms are a bit basic but once again that doesn't realy matter as most of your time will be spent out and about. Once again I would thouroughly recommend it and would have no hestitation staying there again.I have stayed in flea pits for the same price The hotel is far enough out to be quiet at night, but only 1 minute(if that) from the nearest metro and a 15 minute stroll to the top of La Rambla and only a 30 minute stroll to the born/port", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "kasia_pestka", "ReviewID": "UR42699780", "Content": "very nice hotel, good location, close to city centre and metro", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cI'd stay there again\u201d", "Author": "kopfli", "ReviewID": "UR21544267", "Content": "This hotel is very good for the price: - location: not in the middle of sights, but waking distance (30 min.) to almost everything. - very helpfull staff - good, clean rooms - aerobus stops just outside", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, England", "Title": "\u201cThere must be better places than this.....\u201d", "Author": "S_Jane040", "ReviewID": "UR20780036", "Content": "I booked the Del Comte after seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor. The location is fine, but I found the hotel depressing and the staff unhelpful. The 2 rooms we booked both had windows facing onto a drab internal courtyard. The rooms are dark, basic and despite switching rooms twice, the 'Non Smoking' rooms all stank of both stale and recent smoke. Very unpleasant. When we complained about the smell the concierge shrugged and said 'they are Non Smoking rooms. If someone chooses to smoke in them, what can I do? I have no other rooms.' No apology - nothing. Incidentally, the Non Smoking rooms have ashtrays in them so I guess clean ashtrays = Non Smoking, whilst dirty ashtrays = smoking. The same employee was also supremely unhelful to another guest who asked for the number of the Spanish operator while I was waiting to change rooms. Same shrug, same lack of care.

The bathrooms are great and also have a bath which is perfect for relaxing in after walking all day.
