We just got back from staying here and I was very wary of the place based on previous reviews. Really, it is not that bad. No, it's not a 5-star hotel but what do you expect for the price? There is a lobby where you check-in during normal hours - the glass window is for late check-ins which is pretty standard at a cheaper hotel. Our room was clean and had the added bonus of a fridge. The breakfast was a variety of pastries which were ok. If you're travelling with a dog you can't beat the location as it is sooo close to Fiesta Island (amazing off leash dog park) and just across the street from Camp-Run-A-Mutt for doggy day care (if, like us, you don't want to leave your dog in your room all day while you do things without them). The only thing is it is hard to find information on their pet policy online which makes it seem like they don't charge for pets - they do, it is $15 per day. The location is not at all sketchy, I saw one review where the person complained about the number of RV's parked on the street. That's because there's an RV service garage just around the corner from the hotel! I did not observe any drug related behavior from anyone in the neighborhood - the hotel is right next to an 'active seniors' condo complex! I felt pretty safe while staying there and I am 6 months pregnant so do take extra precautions. Anyway, I would stay there again and would recommend it to anyone looking to save a few bucks on a centrally located hotel in SD.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casa Grande, Arizona, United States", "Title": "\u201cOnly stay here if you want to pick up a cocaine addiction.\u201d", "Author": "Gage_12", "ReviewID": "UR125628523", "Content": "My wife,son and I decided we would book this hotel for our trip to seaworld,The price was good..But thats where the good experience ended,when we first came to check in,there was no lobby,and nothing but a very rude woman,behind bulletproof glass to check in with.

Yes there was a sign that stated it was not allowed but obviously not enforced.

We never felt unsafe inside our hotel room, but my husband would not let me leave the room after dark to get ice from the ice machine, because he did not feel it was safe for me to do so alone.. In retrospect, hit was probably a good decesion. Don't expect to get any sleep if there are a herd of elephants in the room above you during your stay either. I had to finally go up to the front office & request they send security officers to make the herd above me stop stomping around . It was so loud, it woke my 8 year old up at Midnight.

One day it was in quart sized bottle & the next it was in a Tupperware type container. It was not even in a bowl of ice or anything like that! The coffee was in a pump top dispenser.

Heritage Inn San Diego The place can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. Although the hotel itself is okay...its the area that surrounds it that makes it....eerie. Right across the hotel..there is a grassy area...near dennys..and well..lots of bums in the street and weird people talking to themselves hang out there. But in the 4 nights i stayed in the area...and DO take note that i walk to and from the area Every night ALONE around 11pm....nothings happened to me. Its just really creepy when you have to pass by a bum in the street whos talking to himself. Looking at the hotel itself...its pretty clean..no complaints...Staff are VERY nice and helpful. Area is superrrrrrrr great! near the beach...near bus stops....and not too far from gaslamp quarter which was hella fun. And it is VERY affordable. I kinda feel sorry for this hotel actuallly...because the hotel itself is not bad..and the location is good too. But its the area surrounding it that makes it creepy. Rest assured though..the cops are DEFINITLY on watch. i saw the police come by the hotel TWICE! One guy was caught getting a hooker. Tips if u decide to stay: 1. Get a room that is on the lower floor..Because the elevator is CRAP! it smells like pi$s...the lights flicker..and its superr slow. (think horror movie elevator scene) 2. If u want to avoid the creepy surroundings..just mjake sure u have a car. Theres no where really to hang out at night anyway in that area. 3. Its cheap..so dont expect 5 star cleanliness. There was NOTHING dirty about my room...but obviously it doesnt have that spark nice hotels has. 4. IF you are truly on a budget..go for it.

Staff at front desk friendly & informative. We had two rooms, non smoking, one room with a queen bed and the other with two queen beds both on the top floor as requested. Both rooms had a fridge. They served danishes, donuts, coffee & tea in the front office each morning. We used the pool & hot tub each day. Parking was never a problem. Both rooms had recently been refurbished. After asking, the staff advised me most of the rooms had been refurbished & they should all be completed soon. We drove to Sea World only 2 minutes away. The 8 & 9 bus goes past the hotel to Sea World. Plenty of restaurants & shopping nearby. I would class this property above average for the price I payed & the price they had on their sign. I would recommend it to travelers who are looking for a clean & neat motel room.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Shasta, CA", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "Excalibur13", "ReviewID": "UR11111432", "Content": "I wasn't too pleased with the roaches that were crawling over everything at night and having to pay an extra $9.99 per day for wireless internet.

After staying here for 3 nights with my 21-year-old daughter, we both agreed we'd prefer staying here again over the Hotel Circle facility stayed at 3 months ago (which was slightly higher in price). Depending on what you're looking for in a room, the price cannot be beat for what you get (comparing it with San Diego's high prices) -- a clean, comfortable bed (pillow-top in the upgraded rooms); clean room; manicured lawn; and a central location with quick access to/from I-8. Be aware, however, that small amenities are not provided in room -- coffee pot, hair dryer, or iron/ironing board -- so either bring what you can from home or borrow from the office. Noise level (next door neighbor's t.v. or maid's cart wheeling by on sidewalk) was dealt with by turning on the heat/air conditioner unit, which runs constantly while on ... a benefit! ... (versus the \"on-and-off, on-and off\" type of unit which can disturb your sleep). We'll definitely consider staying here again on a return trip. I chose to rate it \"above average\" WHEN COMPARING IT WITH other hotels at the same price ... due to the PLUS factors (comfortable bed; clean room; central location). It's otherwise just an average motel ... nothing fancy. If you're looking for atmosphere, check elsewhere and pay the price! I'll spend the money saved on healthy, delicious food!", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thousand Oaks", "Title": "\u201cEvery room smelled like smoke\u201d", "Author": "Robin805", "ReviewID": "UR4831876", "Content": "I had made a reservation for a non-smoking room.
