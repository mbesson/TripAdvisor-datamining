There's a broken broom and a wooden ladder. Then when this family left, someone else found this place and turn it into a intermediate ho hostel. Imagine, the room is like your room, with 6 beds / 3 double deck. They aren't even symmetrically placed.

There was a kitchen and fridge next to the lobby, if you want to buy groceries or snacks and prepare food. (no Aircon) We heard, it was much better than Chung king Mansions Double room Very small w/ TV english channels, aircon, window, tiny bathroom w/ hot water (good water pressure). WIFI worked. Overall ok 4-bed dorms Very small, stinky, poor ventilation, aircon worked, good lockers, restroom inside (doors didn't close and you could hear everything) no floor space for walking when fully occupaid. There was a tv on the corner really hard to use. WIFI worked very very very slow and only after midnight. I would only recomend it, if you are on a tide budget, since location is nice and safe. If budget allows get a double instead of dorms.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "Title": "\u201cIts cheap, great location, but basic\u201d", "Author": "starbuck251", "ReviewID": "UR105433430", "Content": "In the heart of HK island where space is very expensive and at a premium, this I felt, for the money, was a pretty decent hostel.

Just a few minutes walk from Causeway Bay exit E, and the tram stop, it is in a fantastic location, and for the $150 per night I paid, was the one of the cheapest places that was pretty decent (if you've seen Chungking mansions, you'd know how awful they were!). the internet access was very poor, frustratingly, but hey its a cheap place.

BUT: the stuff is absolutely unfriendly and ignoring, shouting, not helpful at all, the rooms are terrible, and loud, the walls thin. You can hear all the AC-noises and waterpumps from your neighbours, and you smell all the citchen dust of the places below. They offer hot water, but it is only working in case you are the very first person in the morning. After this the water is cold, no fun when room temperature is below 15 celcius. I wanted to change my very poor double deluxe room, which was almost below standard, had no window to let fresh air in, and they refused. They offer Wifi, but you have to sit in a garbage room where the door is always open to the outside area, which makes no sense, when the outside temperature is around 10 celcius. In case you want to stay in this area, in this building there are 30 different guest houses on 16 floors, so it is no need to book a specific one in advance, you just come here and somebody on the street will ask you for a room, and it is up to your disposition to choose what you like or not. Since I paid all nights in advance on arrival, my hands were tied.

La \u00fanica explicaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda que hay habtiaciones muy distintas, ahora nosotros eramos un grupo de 16, y todas nuestras habitaciones eran malas. La habitaci\u00f3n alucinante. Sucia. Era cu\u00e1druple. Dos camas individuales y una de matrimonio enana. Los colchones eran dur\u00edsimo, de verdad, si le dabas un pu\u00f1etazo te romp\u00edas la amno. Adem\u00e1s ten\u00edan unas fundas de pl\u00e1stico bastante asquerosas. El cuarto no ten\u00eda ventanas, bueno, ten\u00eda una ventana que se abr\u00eda a la mitad pero chocaba con el edificio mugriento de en frente, que estaba a unos 10 centimetros, as\u00ed que mejor no abrirla, bastante asqueroso. El cuarto de ba\u00f1o era una cuartito enano con un retrete, un lavabo y una ducha todo junto. No hab\u00eda separaci\u00f3n entre ambos, as\u00ed que se mojaba todo. La puerta estaba rota y faltaban trozos as\u00ed que tambi\u00e9n se mojaba el cuarto. Por supuesto no hab\u00eda ni toalleros ni nada de eso. Lo m\u00e1s incre\u00edble era el cuarto de ba\u00f1o com\u00fan, para las habitaciones que no ten\u00edan. Alucinante. Era tambi\u00e9n el cuarto de la limpieza as\u00ed que estaba lleno de cajas, de fregonas, cubos, etc. Todo muy sucio. La sitauci\u00f3n era tal, que optaron por hacer sus necesidades en un cubo. Lo peor es que pag\u00e1bamos 20\u20ac cabeza. Pens\u00e1bamos que ibamos a un hostal como los europeos, sencillo pero limpio y c\u00f3modo. Nada que ver.
