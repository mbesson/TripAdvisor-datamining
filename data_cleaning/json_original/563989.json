{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very nice location, very helpful service and satisfying facilities We stayed in Park hotel for 7 days. First of all we chose it because of its location. But later we found it has more than that. The manager Rodal is very helpful. He tried to help whatever we needed. The services of front desk were more satisfying than in the 4 star hotels I stayed. For the price we paid, the room was above our expectation. Spacious and with almost everything - fridge, tv, free wireless. The room was very cozy, with nice heating. If you are a budget traveler you can just buy ready food from supermarket, they have microwave and oven to heat up. The hotel is near every essencial transportation spot and shops. We were there for conferences, and we found it very convenient to go to every other hotel. For the people who want to do a lot of shoppings, it is in a perfect location, few steps away from Macy's, Victoria's secret, Nine west, Coach..... It is also close to China town and all famous restaurants. I definately recommend it to people who want to choose a hotel with good location and good service.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR118011941", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jukeboxblue"}, {"Content": "Scabies infection.

The property is charming early XXth century building not very large situated amazingly - right in the middle of everything in San Francisco, well better location in this city is not just existing. All attractions or shopping areas are easily reached by feet except some very far ones like Golden Gate Bridge  Park or Presidio.Average night fare is not cheap, I have to say even overpriced as compared to same level accomodations in other places (even European cities, I wouldn't even go as far as Asian ones). The hotel is on the edge of being acceptable from the point of view of: cleanliness (be not surprised to notice a smashed cockroach on the wall near reception area), room comfort (my room had 2 huge windows right around the bed which is bad fengshui I believe...), but mostly because of catastrophic noise factor - you hear EVERYTHING - from nearest tenants' activities to all the sounds from outside (24hours without any quiet break), don't even think about falling asleep without earplugs, even they do not help completely.So if even I visit SF again I'll choose maybe less central location but in more quiet area or I'll pay more for a hotel of high quality chain with certain soundproof windows  walls.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR337656793", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pepetito"}, {"Content": "good location, fair price       lobby area", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR709069765", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "traumatizer"}, {"Content": "Perfect Location Decent Room Great Service Firs let me say that if not for RODEL the manager, I wouldve looked for another hotel.

You won't get to spend many waken hours in your hotel room, as there is much to see and do in San Francisco, especially if you are, like us, only there for a week.The room was clean, service was actually quite friendly, but we did run into an incident with a visitor over there... My girlfriend got into an argument with a strange man using the computer, he started to insult her, screaming at her and making racist comments (we are French Canadian). He had something very scary about him, enough to terrorize my girlfriend. The guy was thrown out, but my girlfriend did not want to stay there anymore. Well, the guy at the front desk was nice enough to trade our room with another of their affiliated hotels (The Spaulding Hotel), just on the other side of Union Square. After visiting the room over there, in a matter of minutes, everything was solved and we didn't let that event spoil our vacation.That's enough for the anecdotal part of my review!So all in all, great location, great price and it's not in the dodgy Tenderloin area, so it should definitely be the first choice for the budget traveler.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR242182973", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Radaghast"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel Outstading service, good location and great place to stay in San Francisco.
