I reserved a 1 bedroom suite, which was supposed to have a separate bedroom with a king size bed, plus a living room with a queen size sofa bed and kitchen. When we got to our room, it was just a basic hotel room with one king bed and a small kitchen. I called down to the front desk, and they said they were very sorry but they had no other rooms available, so all they could do is send up a roll-away bed. Once I saw what that was like, and realized we were missing an entire bedroom, I called back and asked to speak to the manager. The manager said she was terribly sorry, but they made a rare mistake, and she offered to give me the first night free, plus a discount on the second night, or help me find another hotel if we decided to move. Well, moving was just too much trouble, so we stayed both nights. The view is fantastic, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the king bed was very comfortable. We asked for a couple things (e.g., extra blanket), and they were delivered to the room promptly. We took advantage of the shuttle, which saved walking up and down the hill. It was very easy to walk to Hollywood Blvd where all the main attractions are within a few blocks of the hotel. On the last day, I asked for a late checkout, which the manager was happy to arrange. Then, on top of all that, she said she'd decided to give us a full refund for the second night as well! It is rare to find a hotel manager who really understands the value of good customer service. I could have left very disgruntled about the mixup, and posted lousy reviews, but instead the manager went out of her way to apologize for the hotel's error and to do everything she could to make it right. We will definitely return here on our next trip to the area.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHollywood Hills Hotel\u201d", "Author": "greenfnlantern", "ReviewID": "UR125571232", "Content": "The wife and I were in town to see a few concerts on the Sunset Strip.

But finally, this is the place! At the last minute, we needed a place to stay in Hollywood near our apartment for one night. I called The Magic Castle (another GREAT place to stay in Hollywood) but they were booked and suggested their sister hotel, this one. And it was $50/night less expensive... which was perfect for us. After booking the room, the receptionist asked if we were celebrating anything, and I told her our anniversary was coming up (but honestly, I hadn't thought of celebrating it that particular night). When we arrived there was a bottle of wine with balloons, a card (hand signed and very sweet!) and a delicious little chocolate cake from Susina Bakery (a great LA bakery) waiting for us. It was unbelievably welcoming and awesome... and because of it, we decided to celebrate our anniversary that night with a nice dinner at Yamashiro! It was very romantic and fun. We never expected to have such a fun impromptu anniversary celebration! The Good: Friendly/welcoming/professional/helpful staff... everyone included! Perfect location GREAT views of the city VERY comfortable new bed with good/soft linens/comforter (no old style bedspreads with scratchy sheets here) Large room/suite with kitchenette/living room area with couch/chair Large balcony with table 24-hour heated pool Yamashiro (restaurant and bar) is right up the stairs Magic Castle is on the same property Easy parking ($11/day) Secure (gate w/ code) and safe feeling Sparkling Lemonade \"welcome drink\" in champagne glasses upon check-in Late check-out was available... I checked out at 12:30 which was helpful The Bad: Nothing! The Average: The room has a bit of \"shabbiness\" to it... some chipped paint, and a few imperfections. The decor isn't fancy or fabulous... BUT we did not care one bit because the service/location/view was worth so much more. The decor was easy to get over since we were enjoying the experience so much.

Safe neighborhood just steps off Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theater, etc. A little tricky to find but well worth it. It is the sister to the Magic Castle Hotel and is up a steep hill which you can drive to and park with secure guaranteed parking, walk to, or get a shuttle ride up to. The Magic Castle Hotel itself is a little pricier but very nice looking with nice pool and apparently big suites. The Hollywood Hills Hotel is a step down in quality but still very decent. Really it is a bank of small apartments, some of which are still rented as apartments, some as rooms. Since it was a quarter mile up in the Hollywood Hills, the view was magnificent from our large balcony in the one bedroom suite. Kingsize bed, good size bathroom/double sinks, foldout double sofa, table/chairs, kitchenette with dishes, microwave, fridge, TV's in living room and bedroom. Not huge and not fancy, but homey and nice, everything working, clean, quiet and comfy. Then there is the staff. By far the nicest, friendliest, well informed staff I can ever remember. They will help you find things, get places, stay late, park easier, and just make your stay so much better. Complimentary sodas, snacks and candy are available - just ask and they fill a bag for you. They packed us a bag to take to Universal Studios and several times just to take up to the room. Hot cider and cookies in the lobby in the evening and nice continental breakfast in the morning. Check in, snacks, breakfast, free DVD loan are all done at the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill. MCH pool is heated and HHH is not, so we were invited to swim down there, as well. We did ask for a ride up the hill once and they couldn't have been nicer. Also, by staying there, you can attend a dinner show or brunch show at the Magic Castle, otherwise you have to be a Magic Castle Member (a magician!) Brunch is the only time kids can attend and coat/tie is not mandatory. The food and shows were fabulous and the hotel staff let us leave the car in their lot.

We stayed 3 nights while we did a quick stopover on our way back to Australia from Florida. The good: Fantastic service. Nick, the guy at the desk, was truly a font of knowledge on the local attractions. Helped me with booking a day tour that turned out to be brilliant. He explained how the hotel worked, that we could get free mini-bar snacks and soft drinks and about the included buffet breakfast in the morning. All the other staff were also friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the mornings is awesome and sets you up for the day. The average: The rooms could do with a bit of a spruce up. There was mould in our bathroom and the room was pretty smelly, stuffy and hot. The small air conditioner didn't really do much to help so we ended up having to keep all the doors open which isn't ideal. Some new carpets and a split-system airconditioner would help. That said, the room was ample in size for our family of 4. There is a separate room for the master bedroom and a pull out sofa. As our kids are older we bought an air bed and sheets at the local Target for our son to sleep on (too old to share with sis :0)). The pool area was teriffic and the views of the city from the balcony superb. There is a shuttle bus up and down from the sister hotel (Magic Castle) for breakfast if you want it. We just walked which only takes 5 mins at the most (no wonder the yanks are obese if they can't take a small walk up and down a hill). The location is great, you can easily walk to Hollywood Blvd for the nightlife, star walk and city tours. Plenty of places to eat also within walking distance.

We used it as a base of operations on either side of a road trip to the San Francisco area. Because our other son was traveling with us, we opted for the suite to begin with. We booked another suite (one floor higher) on our return to Hollywood. Then, when our son flew home before us, downsized to a smaller room. So, we got a good sampling of what they offer. Customer service is a priority with this hotel, and everyone I dealt with . . . from initial booking, to the front desk, to the air conditioning mechanic, to the shuttle driver were all very pleasant and helpful. Being separated from the Magic Castle Hotel, at the foot of the hill, was not a problem.

The swimming pool was a plus . . . located in a remote section of this hillside retreat, it was gated as was the entire hillside compound. Well-maintained, it provided relief from the hot temperatures. My major gripe, was the level of building maintenance common to all rooms. Windows that didn't lock . . . same with a slider. Domestic water temperatures that were excessively hot, and were reported but not sure if they were fixed because of our short time in each room. Areas that needed caulking and painting. Overall, we would stay here again as the viewpoint of the city from the hillside gave us a feeling of place. From our balcony, we could see the Griffith Observatory, downtown L.A., the Capitol Records building, and a good portion of Hollywood.

The small tube t.v. was a little disappointing, but for as much time as one spends in a hotel, it was fine.

My only other complaint would be the Yamashiro restaurant. I would not eat there again. It was convenient for anyone staying at the hotel but the food was average at best. Our salads were soaked in a disappointing dressing which weighed heavily on the vinegar, and the green salad was simply put, boring. The sushi rolls were disappointing as well. The Darth Vader roll had an average thousand island dressing on it, and the tempura had little flavour. This restaurant made me want to go back to our room and cook.

It's a \"sister\" hotel that's a 5 minute walk away and borrows some of the Magic Castle's services. At first I was pretty annoyed. Instead of the bright, family friendly Magic Castle I'd booked, I found myself climbing a very steep, dark hill up to this place, which appears to be mostly residential apartments, and those that aren't filled with permanent tenants are used as hotel rooms. It has a coded security gate at the entrance, but the actual room security is pretty poor. The room smelled of gas, and the air con was incredibly loud. I was fairly unhappy by the time I settled in (I called the desk to ask to be moved but was denied). Then I looked out of the window (of room 504) and the view immediately made up for a significant part of that unhappiness. On a clear day you can see the Griffiths observatory, the corner of Hollywood and Highland, and Downtown LA in the distance. It's a really great view, and when the sun came up, the hotel suddenly started to feel a lot more secure, nestled in the hills amongst the typical Hollywood houses and the Yamashiro restaurant next door. As it's run by the Magic Castle, you get use of their free breakfast, their free \"mini bar\" (you have to go to their front desk to collect items), their pool and their mostly lovely staff. That's a definite plus, but as I say - I wanted to be in the Magic Castle, not a 5 minute walk away. Worth noting that there's no internet at the hotel, you need to walk down to the Magic Castle's pool area if you want that. The location is pretty handy though, as it's a short walk down the steep hill to Hollywood Boulevard, which meant it was easy to get to the Chinese theatre before the crowds turned up. If you do stay here, bear in mind you can use your pool key to get through the lower car exit gate which saves a lot of hill walking. The pool (separate to Magic Castle's pool) is very pretty, themed after the Yamashiro restaurant, but quite busy and loud (the residents were playing music there for most of our stay - if you like Alkaline Trio you'll be OK here). The car parking is awkward, but safe and easy to access (costs $10 a night though). My main gripe is that there's a few factors that eat away at my ability to sleep here - the door locks feel loose and the doors rattle in their fittings at night; the air con is insanely loud at times; the fridge buzzed like crazy; the room smelled funny - if only the place had a bit more attention maintenance and security wise, it would have been a fantastic stay.

You check in and eat breakfast at the Magic Castle Hotel as the rooms of the Hollywood Hills Hotel are up the hill and some of the property are residential apartments. When we arrived we were greeted with a cool drink and instantly made to feel very welcome. We had a studio room with a kitchenette with a lovely view of the Hollywood Hills. The room itself was on the older side but it was quiet and spacious. The walk down to the Magic Castle Hotel took 7 minutes (and I'm not a particularly fast walker) but it is quite steep. We never did walk up as there was always someone able to drive us up to our room. We never waited longer than a couple of minutes for a ride and this was at all sorts of different times of the day including after 10:00 pm. The continental breakfast was great, including yogurt, cereals, toast, croissants, scones and muffins. There were a number of juices and tea, coffee and instant hot chocolate. Definitely a big cut above the average. The Magic Castle is located a block and a half from Hollywood Boulevard. Once you are on Hollywood Boulevard you turn left and right there is Madame Tussauds and a bit beyond in the same block is the Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre. Madame Tussauds was amazing and the half hour tour of the Kodak Theatre was certainly worth doing. In the area in front of the Kodak Theatre there are a number of stands with numerous brochures, with lots of information about attractions, some with coupons for the local attractions. There is also a manned Information Centre there on the left hand side as you are facing the theatre. The entrance to the theatre is actually quite far back from the street past a number of shops and the box office for tour tickets for the Kodak Theatre is located there. One other attraction which we thought was wonderful was the Hollywood History Museum. It had a huge collection of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and so much more. It is on Highland just off Hollywood Boulevard and again really worth seeing. One more thing, we loved our tour of Warner Brothers Studio, especially our tour guide Andy K. We had dinner at Yamashiro, which is just above the Hollywood Hills Hotel. The view from the restaurant is beautiful and expansive and it is not too expensive if you watch which entrees you order. The Magic Hotel staff made the reservation for us and imagine our surprise and pleasure when we were served a free appetizer compliments of the Magic Castle! One other thing about the hotel as that they had a list of goodies, snacks and soft drinks that you could have by simply going to the front desk and requesting some. My son (and I!) really loved this, particulary at the end of a long day exploring Hollywood. I can't say enough about the staff at the Magic Castle Hotel.

It is paired with the Magic Castle Hotel, which is where you check in and eat breakfast. This hotel is located in the steep, curving hills of the Hollywood Heights neighborhood, about two blocks north of Hollywood Boulevard. The scenery is gorgeous, as is the pool. The grounds at HHH are well tended, with walkways, waterfalls, lush greenery and stonework. Our room had a view of the hills to the east, with some wealthy neighbors nearby and the Griffith Observatory a little farther away. At the top of the driveway, there is a fantastic view of the Hollywood sign, very close compared to the view from Griffith Park, which is where many people seem to go to see it. The service was excellent. The staff was very helpful and friendly and provided us with free minibar snacks when we arrived tired and hungry. Normally, minibar snacks are $1. The breakfast selection was large and tasty. Fresh fruit that has been washed, scones, muffins, croissants, bread, yogurt, granola, hot and cold cereal, juice, milk, coffee (and flavor shots), tea. You have to go down to the Magic Castle Hotel to eat. The walk is lovely and safe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and steep. Rides are available, too, but we only used those to get back up the hill a couple of times when we were very tired or in a hurry. The pool at the HHH was big and beautiful, particularly when compared to the little bitty pool at the Magic Castle Hotel. The HHH pool is not heated, but the one at Magic Castle is. Depending on the time of year you're going, it wouldn't matter. We were there in July, and the water was quite warm. Our room: big. Inside the front door was the small kitchen and living room. The fridge/freezer (small, but not dorm-sized) was cold when we arrived. There was a pull-out sofa, coffee table, end tables, dining table and chairs, and entertainment center. Sliding glass doors led to the balcony, which was the length of the room. The balcony was rather narrow, however. Two glass doors with cellular shades separated the bedroom from the living room. The bedroom had two double beds, nightstand, dresser, chair, and closet. Another patio door leading to the balcony was off the bedroom. The bathroom was located off the bedroom. The bath had two sinks and a shower/tub combo with room at the back to sit or store your stuff. A hair dryer was provided. There was more than ample storage space for toiletries and beach towels. Shampoo was provided, even enough for us with lots of hair. Also provided were conditioner, bar soap, facial cleanser, body wash, and some other girly stuff that I can't remember. The linens and towels were very white and the beds were comfy. The housekeeping staff fluffed the pillows in a decorative way, which was a fun touch. I wouldn't say the room was cleaned to perfection every day, but we were there for five nights, and whatever dirt was in the corner of the bathroom was definitely ours. Some miscellany: The room was air conditioned, and the AC was not loud, which was nice. It was a quiet place, except when people came back to their rooms at night and chatted (or laughed or yelled) on the walk to their rooms. Parking was odd. The driveway and parking areas are quite narrow and twisty-turny, so you definitely need to pay attention. Parking spaces are assigned and are not necessarily across from your room. Internet is only available at the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill, which I wasn't crazy about, but it forced me to do things rather than get caught up in emails, facebook, etc. It would have been nice, though, to be able to double-check directions online or check traffic updates (sigalert.com--very useful) before we left. Definitely go to Yamashiro Restaurant up the hill. The sushi was fantastic, and their desserts are heavenly. Any attire is acceptable. We saw people in shorts, jeans, and evening wear. Even my 15-year-old who is convinced the whole world is watching (and criticizing) her felt comfortable there. In all, this was a great place. It's an old Hollywood hotel with real charm and homey elegance. I had looked at other places closer to Hollywood Blvd. for similar cost, and I'm glad we chose this place.

The room was big and although a little dated it was clean with decent air con and a kitchenette particularly useful if you are on flydrive or a longer stay in LA.

You could also use the pool at the magic castle hotel. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful in pointing out restaurants, attractions. If you wanted a lift up or down the hill anytime all you had to do was call and they would pick you up or drop you off- especially useful in the evening when going out for dinner.

We also went to the beverly Centre for some more shopping. Went to see a The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in CBS studios, went to Santa Monica beach, Universal Studios which was only about 10 min drive away, Six Flags and also to an LA Lakers game in the Staples Centre which I would highly recommend.

Finding the Hotel: At the beginning of your stay at the HH Hotel, you must check in at its sister property, the Magic Castle Hotel. Like other reviews, my wife and I plugged the Magic Castle into the sat nav, and ended up at the door of the (associated) Maigicians club next door. The valet there was very polite and pointed us in the right direction. There is a short term (10 mins) space to park right outside of the reception. Arrival: We received a very friendly greeting from the lady on the front desk and our booking was confirmed. Whilst waiting, a guy came up and offered us a flute of traditional lemonade, which was a nice touch and much needed after a long drive to LA. Another guy came around 2 minutes later with chocolates for us. The receptionist informed us that we were in room 504 - her favourite. We were given two room keycards and a seperate key for the swimming pool. You also get a keycode to enter into the gate of the car park, along with a tag to hang on the rear view mirror - failure to do this might result in you getting towed. Location: Be warned that it is quite a steep hill up the the HH Hotel from the Magic Castle - about 0.25 miles. Overall the hotel is well located - we (like seemingly everyone else in LA) drove everywhere, so the hill didn't bother us. Once down the hill, Hollywood Boulevard is close by and an easy walk. You are also at the right end of town for Universal Studios/Warner Bros etc, only a 10-15 mins drive away. Breakfast is complimentary and served in the Magic Castle Hotel. We started walking down the first morning, but could not find a path, and didn't fancy the steep walk up the road, so went and took the car instead - there may be a path that we failed to find, but what looked like stairs down from the pool area ended in an abrupt halt where at some point the road had carved across them! If you do take the car to breakfast you can park (check the hours) for free in Orchid Avenue just down from the Magic Castle. We didn't ask, but the Magic Castle Club is closed in the morning and has a huge car park so you may have been able to park there too. Someone else on Trip Advisor mentioned that the staff will run you up the hill if required - this is good, but was neither advertised nor mentioned to us. The Room: First impression was that this is a decent sized room. Think more studio flat than hotel room. As you come through the door, there is a kitchen area with breakfast bar, cooker, fridge, microwave and sink. Part of our reason for choosing the HH was the kitchen facilities. After 2 weeks on the road, we actually longed for some home cooking rather than eating out. We were very disappointed by the equipment in the kitchen - one tiny saucepan, a small frying pan, plates, cutlery and.. that's it. Not even a tin opener, no over tray or gloves. There was washing up liquid and a sponge, but no tea-towel to dry anything. In general the kitchen area was tired and could do with a refresh. It was adequate, but could have been better. The bed was large and comfortable, linen was clean. There was a couple of armchairs and a side table in the living area, as well as a TV. We don't go on holiday to watch loads of TV, but the TV reception was generally poor. Plenty of channels though. Again, the living area is a little tired feeling - old carpet, worn fittings etc. The bathroom contained a bath/shower, sink and WC. All were clean enough, but all were old. Think of this more as a dated motel rather than a modern hotel and it is fine. There is air-conditioning via an old in wall unit - noisy but effective. The highlight of the room is undoubtedly the balcony - or rather the view from it. The balcony itself was a bit crusty and in need of renovation/decoration, but there is a great view over LA downtown and over the Hollywood Hills. It was great to stand out here at night and watch the city go by. Breakfast: The complimentary breakfast was good. Yogurts, bread/toast, cakes/muffins, cereal, juice and coffee. All good and all just right to start the day of well. Parking: There is secure parking right outside the accommodation block. One thing we found annoying was this: each room has an allocated parking space, clearly marked with the room number. Given this, why does the hotel charge an extra $10/night (+ taxes) for guests to park here? If you weren't parked here, the space would be sat empty. You need to display your pass in the car when the car is parked or you'll be towed, plus you need a code to get in the electric gates, so you can't get around it. One of my personal pet hates is unnecessary car park charges by hotels. Facilities: HH has a laundry - $1 for a wash or dry, $0.75 for powder. Last wash has to be in by 21:00 in the evening. There's an ice machine and drinks vending - $1 for a can of soda which is actually good compared to most hotels. There is a very nice looking swimming pool. We never found time to use it, but it did look good. There are sunbeds around the pool. There is wireless internet at the Magic Castle Hotel and also an internet 'booth' in the courtyard area by the MC pool. Overall: I have to say that I hadn't intended this to be a negative review. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the HH Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. The staff there were superb. The receptionist asked my wife how the room was, and when the reply was \"it was fine...\" she seemed genuinely concerned by this. We had the best view in the house in our room and that made the experience really. In writing this review however, I am trying to think about how I would feel about the room as a stand-alone entity, ignoring the awesome views. The rooms and fixtures and fittings are dated, but they are clean and everything we used worked fine. We paid over $200 a night including parking, so for that price I would expect more. Without a car, I'd personally not want to stay here. The views and general location, plus the excellent, attentive staff are what pulls this up from average to above average. Rating the room on its own, I'd say 3/5 at best.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Amazing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Janey3", "ReviewID": "UR20485242", "Content": "With my partner I have just returned from an eleven night stay at the Hollywood Hills Hotel, beginning on 16th September 2008 and can say with all sincerity both of us were more than happy with all aspects of the hotel and its service. Believe me, I am the type of person who tells of a situation exactly as it is and if I wasn't happy about an issue would speak out but in the case of the Hollywood Hills I had nothing at all to be unhappy over. Check-in for the Hollywood Hills is at the Magic Castle Hotel and from the second we arrived to the second we left the front desk staff couldn't do enough to assist us and made us feel completely welcome. The Hollywood Hills is located (obviously) on a hill behind the Magic Castle. The distance to the Hollywood Hills is perfectly walkable and although a little steep is pleasant, taking around only 10-15 mins at a steady pace. We walked most days, without any problems and found the walk great for excercise, but for anyone unwilling or unable to make the walk the Magic Castle staff are always more than happy to drive guests the distance - at any time of day or night. A drive can be requested to or from the hotel just by asking at the foyer or picking up the phone in your room. As for the hotel itself, let me firstly point out the amazing views of LA it has to offer. We took a studio city room (room 404) and it had the most fantastic, extensive view over the city, right to downtown. It also had a gorgeous view of the Hollywood Hills (see my pics). Sitting on the balcony watching the sun rise and fall over LA is something I will always remember. The room itself was a decent size, clean, tidy and perfectly acceptable. There was a good size private bathroom, with the bath, sink area and toilet kept in pristine condition. The shower was powerful, a good tonic after a long day. **Please note - the TV worked fine and had more than enough channels for someone taking a vacation** The bed was the most comfortable of any I have ever stayed in at any hotel. It was huge! No chance of my partner kicking me in his sleep - he wouldn't make contact! The kitchen area was also clean and well stocked with cooker, fridge, microwave, grill, pots, pans and even washing up liquid. The location of the hotel is very quiet, away from the citys' noise but is ideally located for Hollywood Boulevard. The walk from the Hollywood Hills to street level is much shorter and attractions such as Graumann's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood and Highlands shopping mall are minutes away. The hotel is also ideal for travelling elsewhere in LA. Bus services run from Hollywood Boulevard to pretty much everywhere and the fare is just $5 for an all day pass. Also, the Metro tube is at the side of the Hollywood and Highlands Mall, running directly to Universal Studios and so forth. Each morning, a complimentary breakfast is provided at the Magic Castle between 7 and 10am, consisting of fresh pastries, cereals, yoghurts, bread, juice and teas/coffees - all are delicious. During our stay we were also given bottles of water, chocolate and other goodies, free of charge, given with a smile! The staff are so genuinely friendly and helpful. Any queries are dealt with instantly, they even printed off directions and bus times to local attractions for us as well as checking in on line for our flights home and printing our boarding passes. The hotel also has a laundry room open until late, where wash powder can be purchased for a small price. The Magic Castle offers use of its' pool and sun loungers at any time and staying at either hotel gives access to the Magicians' club just next door. At the side of the Hollywood Hills is the Yamashiro restaurant. From the restaurant there are the most spectacular panoramic views of the city, well worth walking the two minutes to photograph. All in all I do not have a bad word to say about this hotel. If you are looking for great value ($159 per night for a studio city room) a stunning view, comfortable, clean accomodation, friendly service and close proximity to Hollywood Boulevard, this hotel has it all. If you expect pure J Lo style luxury and 100% modern and expensive fixtures and fittings or are upset at the thought of a daily walk up and down a moderately steep hill you may need to look elsewhere. For everyone who does book, you should not be disappointed.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Anglia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "planetrock", "ReviewID": "UR20315708", "Content": "The Hollywood Hills Hotel is actually part of the Magic Castle Hotel and Club, having initially driven into what we believed to be the entrance, we actually ended up at the Club entrance and were directed to the building next door. The staff at the club were friendly but the signs were mis-leading. We arrived a day earlier than planned in LA and they were happy to accommodate the extra night. This part of the hotel actually consists of rooms in a gated enclosure at the top of a hill and although not walkable if you wish to leave your car outside your room, the staff will happily drive you up and down to your room as and when you request. The staff were extremely helpful and could not do enough to help but were equally run off their feet. Although not a huge place there were a maximum of two members of staff evident at any one time and with a couple of people waiting at reception and a request for some guests to be driven about, we really felt that the staff were coping extremely well under pressure and despite people waiting, their attention faultlessly remained with the people they were dealing with . Our room had the 'Wow' factor when we walked in and we had a great view of LA, however on closer inspection the room itself unfortunately lacked attention to detail, there was paint flaking off the wall in the bathroom, the bathroom tap dripped constantly, some of the handles were broken on the cupboards in the kitchenette. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced on the second day and the towels were not always clean. That said, this in no way detracted from our overall enjoyment it was just quite disappointing to see, on account of how good everything else was. The hotel was literally a couple of minutes walk from Hollywood Boulevard and the Metro station. It had great views from the hills and an independent restaurant at the back of it. An excellent continental breakfast was included in the price and consisted of a variety of bread, pastries and cereals, fresh fruit and yoghurts and was far superior to the any of the other 'complimentary breakfasts' available throughout our trip to California.

The check-in, and general hotel logistics are a bit 'fiddly' to negotiate, quite quaint in a way - but definately worth it if you don't mind the hassle - for example the apartments are right at the top of a steep hill, with tricky access on foot - so the Magic Castle staff- and they were very glad to do it, would ferry us back and forth up and down. which was fine since they're very chatty and love telling you about LA - as do all the staff. It also seemed guests were able to use all the Magic Castle facilities, like breakfast ( bagels etc) pools and free snacks and drinks (Vey handy!!)

I travel on a budget so the price of $190 per night (that includes the state & hotel taxes of 14%) was more than I wanted to pay but I discovered that the hotel was well worth it. The hotel sits on a hill that overlooks Los Angeles so we had a great view of the city and even could see the Hollywood sign. I especially enjoyed looking out our balcony & viewing the city lights at night. Our room was equipped with a full kitchen, though small but it had everything: microwave, frig, stove, coffee maker, and even plates, cups, & silverware. There was a mini living room with couch, chair, and TV & a small spot for a table to eat our meals. The cozy bedroom had another TV & with a soft duvet on the bed & the bed was roomy enough for 1 adult & 2 teenagers. The bathroom had double sinks & the tub was equipped with water jets to take a relaxing bath. The hotel is linked with the Magic Castle hotel that is down the hill & that's where we ate our continental breakfasts. We could use the pool at the Magic Castle but found it to be small & always crowded with kids. So we swam in the bigger pool at our hotel. In fact, we were the only ones in that pool which is surrounded by a waterfall & Japanese garden next to a classy Japanese restaurant. Because we were up on the hill & away from traffic, our stay at the hotel was quiet & peaceful. Check in is at the Magic Castle hotel & I was greeted with a bubbly lemonade drink while I registered. We were shuttled up the hill to our hotel in the hotel's Toyota Highlander car. I was told that the lobby is open 24/7 and the shuttle car between the 2 hotels is always available to bring you back & forth. Also at any time, you can request a nice variety of free snacks. I would give this hotel an excellent rating if not for the fact that the furniture is worn, the carpet had stains & the walls could use fresh paint. Luckily past reviews on Trip Advisor prepared me for that. I felt that the hotel had a quirky charm that was enhanced by the curvy scenic drive up the hill; complete with a friendly neighborhood cat roaming the premises. Overall, this hotel far exceeded my expectations & the service was fast & friendly.

On the plus side, the location is awesome and the views are amazing. The pool is fine and it's nice to have a kitchen in your room, though we had some issues with our ability to use it-more on that later. On the down side...where to begin. I guess with the whole check in debacle. First of all, it's extrememly difficult to even figure out where to check in. Once we figured it out (after a lot of gratuitous driving, parking, reversing, etc) and got our key, finding the room took another ten minutes of bafoonery and utter confusion. The thing that is ABSOLUTELY INSANE to me is that they don't have FAQ's at the front desk. We spent our entire stay there trying to figure out how the hell things worked. For example: We were not informed that there is a shuttle to take us up and down the hill if we needed one. We were not informed that internet only works at the magic castle hotel, and not at the HHH. Our first morning there I asked someone at the front desk how to get on (after informing her that I was staying up the hill) and she told me, but left out the fact that i had to come down the hill and bring the laptop with me in order to get online. We were not informed that if we walked down the driveway there was a pedestrian gate to get down the hill, and we were also not informed that the same gate is not open-able with our room key upon returning. So I had to climb the fence. In my skirt. The weirdest thing to me was that the front desk was SO inefficient and they acted as though we were putting them out every time we asked them a question. If they would just have a FAQ handy for every guest, the wouldn't have to answer the same damn questions all day long, and they wouldn't have to get annoyed with every guest that asks them. A list of other oddities: 1. Housekeeping cleaned our coffeepot and coffeecups, but did not restock the coffee. We had to ask the front desk for some and the person who answered the phone had to drive it up to us. Guess how annoyed she was? 2. There is nothing \"fresh\" about the breakfast. Oh, I'm sorry, there were some nectarines and kiwis. Otherwise it was just crappy toast and muffins from the grocery store and mini cereal. 3. Our A/C dripped a small lake onto our balcony and we feared electrocution. 4. They have complimentary snacks, but both times I asked for something the person at the front desk had to actually leave the room to go get it. Like they walked around the counter and out the doors to the pool area. Again, is it any wonder they are so annoyed? Can't they keep a small stash of stuff in the room BEHIND the front the desk and restock as needed? 5. They park the shuttle in the garage. So when you need a ride they have to finsih whatever unrelated task they are doing (there is no shuttle driver) and go pull it out into their focacted driveway where people are moving backwards and forwards in halting, spastic movements, trying to figure out where the front desk is and where they can park. So, as I said, there were things that were inherently cool about the place. Like the view...but the staff seriously needs to have a sit down and figure out how to run their hotel more efficiently. As it is, they just seem to walk around in circles doing whatever task comes up at the moment, forgetting what it was they set out to do in the first place.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camrose, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Staff\u201d", "Author": "camrosegirl", "ReviewID": "UR16751748", "Content": "We were in Los Angeles the last week in May and due to unusual circumstances had to stay in two different hotels that week.

It's basically an apartment complex that has some rooms fixed up nicely to be rented as \"hotel\" rooms. Yes, you check in at the Magic Castle Hotel down below, but I was told that when I booked directly with the property. The prices have since gone up significantly since 2000 (if my memory serves me correctly, I paid about around $85/night+taxes). And parking was included back then (I see on their website they charge $8/night for parking now). But they didn't include continental breakfast at the nearby Magic Castle back then either. I'm with the majority of the positive reviewers here on Trip Advisor: this is not the place to stay if you need to be waited on hand and foot. While I found the staff very nice (in fact, I was waiting on a job offer being faxed to me while at the the hotel and they called me when it arrived), there is no room service here. But my unit had a fridge, small kitchen, plates and utensils, so in addition to eating out around the city, I bought my own food and cooked a bit and chilled \"at home\" while staying here. LOVED: the pool (not heated though, but on sunny warm days, it should be fine), the VIEWS over the city and the hills from my balcony, the privacy and quiet. I couldn't believe I was in a big city up here. COULD HAVE LIVED WITHOUT: passive aggressive attitudes of the long-term renters: the owners of this property apparently rent out some of the other units. I used some of the washers and dryers to wash some clothes, came back to put some clothes in a dryer and found my wet clothes in a pile on top of the machine I'd been using. Gee, thanks. But that's a small gripe. Also, should note that parking is secure in that there's a gate with code you have to enter to get into the property, so there is some security here. Overall, I found the HHH a great place to use as my headquarters while I navigated Los Angeles for job interviews, and then later as \"home base\" while I apartment hunted for my own real first home in L.A.

The room was open yet cosy and the down conforter and pillows was a great treat. Really beats sleeping on those glorified curtains you get at most hotels. Even the tiny shampoo and soaps they give you were wonderful. Normally I just ignore those at other hotels but these were like ones you'd get in an expensive luxury hotel. The balcony was my favorite part of the room. It was big and had a table and chairs and the view was GREAT. I really can't express that enough. It was so nice to come \"home\" to a quiet room above the city and sit on the balcony and just relax before going to bed and waking to another day in the busyness of L.A.

Beautiful views and Historic.\u201d", "Author": "zandt", "ReviewID": "UR10060915", "Content": "I stayed at the Hollywood Hills Hotel (HHH) for 3 nights beginning September 30. In doing my research on where to stay for my trip to the Hollywood Bowl, I used the opinions of other travelers,from Trip Advisor, about HHH and found them to be helpful in making my decision. Read all of the reviews about HHH to make your decision. HHH is not your ordinary hotel. Personally I loved it and will return when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in Hollywood again. For some it may not be right. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my contribution to the HHH story. First lets make the distinction between HHH and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Western Hollywood Hills Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The HHH is owned by the same group that handles the Magic Castle Club and Hotel. By contrast, the Best Western is on street level (a busy street at that), whereas the HHH is up a winding historic hill, security gated, and tucked away in a nice residential neighborhood. You share the hill with the Yamashiro Restaurant (which has a fascinating Hollywood History). You can still see the ruins of the 300 stairs from 1914. Otherwise, there is a lot of greenery and natural environment considering you are in the middle of a busy city. The staff was incredible. When we checked into our room we were greeted by a nice personalized (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome Dave Matthew Fans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) card signed by the staff and a delicious mini chocolate cake for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. They brought us a fan. They showed us a way to get to the Hollywood Bowl that the cabbies didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. They drove us up and down the hill when we asked. Many of them have worked there for a while. The General Manager, Mr. Ross, is apparently as good with his employees as he is with guests because the staff treated us as good, or better, than any hotel that I have stayed at. That says a lot. A big thanks to Christen, Andrew, Gretchen, and thanks for the help with the croissants Ricky!! The room, #206, was 600 square feet and had a 20 plus foot wall of glass overlooking downtown Hollywood and LA. The balcony was at least that large in our room. Remember, these are converted apartments. If you are expecting a standard hotel layout you will find that each room is probably different. I would check with the staff about your reservation. The bed was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen had a full stove/oven, mini-fridge, sink and dishes and it was easy to get picnics ready for the concerts at the bowl. There were some signs of wear but the beautiful setting won out over everything. We felt more at home here than anything else. With that said, I have a family member that is handicapped. While accessible, I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel for someone that is older or disabled. The tub in our room had a high lip and the hills could be challenging for some. Talk to the staff about accessablility. A few other things. You can get a picture with the Hollywood sign in the background just outside the security entrance. Check out Runyon Canyon Park It is a great hike. [--] is a great 160 acre mountainous park right in the middle of Hollywood and about 4 blocks from HHH at the end of Fuller. You can climb and hike and have a spectacular view. Incredibly great croissants on the breakfast brought in from a local bakery! A full variety of complimentary snacks at the front desk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6just ask! Bristol Farms supermarket is not far away and great food/deli for the bowl. It is possible to walk to the Bowl, but for a few bucks you can tell the taxi driver about the secret back way to the bowl and keep your wife happy for not having to hike up a hill in her concert-wear.

When we arrived, it was a bit confusing to know where to park, but it turns out there is 10-minute parking right in front of the Magic Castle (where you check in). We were greeted with flutes of sparking lemonade (quite good!) and the two guys who checked us in were very friendly and helpful. We also got upgrades on both of our rooms. Initially arriving at the HHH (which is also strange to get to the first time, as it's behind a coded gate), I was wondering if we had made the wrong decision. The outside of the rooms is not the nicest and the staircases need painting. But that's only a problem if you're a picky traveller, like some reviewers seem to be on here. The rooms themselves are very nice. What a bonus to have a functioning kitchen, a living room, two TVs, balcony, a good shower and comfortable beds, for a great rate to be anywhere close to the Hollywood area! My friends ended up getting upgraded to room 403, which has an unparalleled view of the Hollywood Hills and Los Angeles Downtown. Absolutely beautfiul from the balcony. One obstacle of the HHH is that the hotel is up a hill. However, whenever we needed a ride, the staff would drive up and promptly shuttle us down to the Magic Castle with friendly service. So this obstacle ends up not being an issue. Location? Okay, this can not be beat. Once at Magic Castle, you are literally a five-minute walk away from the main Hollywood area, including the Kodak Theatre and Grauman's Theatre. I was so impressed by this hotel and its great staff and housekeeping that I had to express my opinions on here. If I return to Los Angeles in the near future, I would certainly stay here again.

It smelled like old, musty wood-so we opened the windows and lit some candles and fell into a comfortable bed. In the morning we noticed the paint on the ceiling of the bathroom was chipping, water damage to the walls and floor, and stains on the very thin carpet. The bathroom has a thin pocket door that was dirty, the front door was dirty and the walls in the bathroom were dirty. The tub, sinks and toilet were cleaned very well. We tried to upgrade and were told the hotel was completely booked. The neighbor above us was a resident and rolled around on a chair (or something) all night. You can hear everything, including the phone ringing.

The bed and the bathroom seemed very clean, but the carpet had stains, the microwave looked like it had been at least 20 years old and the same about the stove.

Let me just say that the photos are not a good representation of what the actual hotel looks like. When my friend and I were driving up the hill to the place, and finally figured out how to get there, I was very disappointed. The buildings were originally apartments, and the outside has not been kept up at all. The place kind of reminded me of a place you would see on an episode of cops!! For us, two women traveling alone, we were freaked out. The inside of the room was nice, very spacious, and great view of the city from the balcony. Had we stayed in this room, I probably would have enjoyed my stay more, but we didn't, because after the first night we discovered that the heat did not work. The staff at the magic castle (who owns the HHH), was very accomodating in changing our room, but 2 minutes after stepping foot in the new room we decided to check out, that room was not at all like the first, was dirty and smelled like stale cigarettes! We packed or stuff, and went down to the magic castle to check out...the staff asked us if there was a reason for leaving and I told her that we were not at all happy with the conditions at the HHH and they knocked $100 off of our stay for the night before, and offered for us a suite at the magic castle hotel for a discounted rate. We did take the suite, and found the Magic castle wonderful. I have to say thank you to the staff here they are amazing...especially Gretchen (I believe that was her name). I think that if you get the right room at the HHH, you could be satisfied with your stay, but if you are traveling alone, or a group of women...the place might seem a bit seedy...but the Magic castle is a great alternative.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "yomama999", "ReviewID": "UR6622868", "Content": "I found this hotel at a discounted price on Travelocity. We paid $110 a night - which seems like a lot, but in Hollywood, it really isn't. I had a hard time finding a hotel in Hollywood for under $150 that didn't look scary. The Hollywood Hills Hotel is truly a unique find. We talked to the owner a bit about it - it used to be apartments, which they are converting into hotel rooms as residents leave. They are not allowed to take the apartments away by force, so currently, it is half hotel, half apartments. It feels like you are staying in a bungalow - there is no one above or below you, only people on either side. The room we had seemed to have been an efficiency apartment at one time- it had a small kitchen, one huge room that had a pull-out couch and a king sized bed, and a small bathroom, closet, and a private deck. They have upgraded the appliances and counters, so even though the complex has been standing awhile, the rooms are still very nice. The best part is the breathtaking view. You are literally in the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the city. At night, it's gorgeous. You are within an easy walk of the touristy Hollywood stuff, like the Chinese Theater, Hollywood Walk of Fame, etc. My only complaint is that it was difficult to find. Take note that you actually check in at The Magic Castle hotel, which is visible from the street. Follow the hotel's website directions to get there - mapquest, yahoo maps, and google maps get you to The Hollywood Hills Hotel, but you can't check in there, so it's kind of confusing in that regard. Also note that there is a fee for parking, but that's the case with almost every hotel in Hollywood.

I just got back from staying one night at the Hollywood Hills Hotel and was immensely disappointed. The only reason this hotel deserves 1 star is because of the friendly staff. When I first walked into the room I was pleasantly surprised. The room was large with a small kitchenette area and a large private balcony. I put our drinks in the fridge, but noticed it was as warm as the room temperature. I thought no big deal since the size of the room is above average and the balcony was a nice feature. My partner and I decided to check out the pool, but ended up being disgusted by its condition. The bottom had flaking off paint and was plagued by algae. We went back to our room and turned on the A/C and took a shower. While I was in the shower within 5 minutes the water was freezing cold! My girlfriend couldn't even take one after me because it would not even get just a little bit warm. When I came out, the floor around the A/C vent was soaked! On top of that, only one light worked in the entire room! Luckily I got the room at a discounted price, but if I had paid the standard rate, I would have demanded some compensation. This hotel could have easily received 5 stars if the owners would just put some money renovating the entire property. I felt the quality of the hotel was equivalent to a Motel 8.

Driving into Hollywood was an experience as it was crowded and noisy so I was really concern when we arrived on Franklin Street and found that it was quite busy. After checking in at the front desk of the Magic Castle Hotel, I was very pleased to find my room at \"the top of the hill.\" The view was great and yet, it was so quiet. We had our own assigned parking space but I don't recommend a big car. The hill can be steep and it might be hard to navigate a large truck/suv.

With so many things to do in LA, this hotel is in a perfect central location... an easy trip via the local Metro station to Universal City Walk, or downtown to Union Station and Olvera Street... an easy drive to the beaches; Venice - Santa Monica - Malibu... an easy walk down to Hollywood Boulevard... and when you return, you're on a secluded hillside with a view across Hollywood to the LA skyline that makes you feel like you own the entire city. The staff is truly great. Ashley & Mary Jane quickly and courteously resolved a couple of minor issues at check-in. Gretchen is wonderful, she makes us feel so welcome; and she loves LA so much that she is a great resource if you're looking for suggestions of things to see or do. Darren, the manager, is a gentleman and a pleasure to converse with. I found everyone to be genuine and sincere (either that, or they all deserve an Oscar for being exquisite Hollywood actors). Once again our suite was clean and comfortable. I can only think of one other hotel we stay at where the bed is as comfortable as home. In spite of the unfavorable comments you'll see regarding the pool, it's actually just fine. Sure, it needs a paint job, but it is clean. The surrounding terrace with its pagoda is charming and relaxing.
