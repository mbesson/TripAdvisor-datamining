It is nothing but the best. If you can, take choose the Fitzgerald Suite - unless you really want to splash out and try the Chanel Suite. The pool is a highlight, complete with underwater music; the Hemingway Bar one of Paris's best with its fabulous cocktails (and staff!!), all raconteurs in their own writes, but watch out for the dragons doing pedicure at the spa. They get a little carried away with the pumice. Ouch! Some lovely ideas along the shopping arcade within, too. L'Espadon defies description in creativity and excellence.

A number of facts that changed history was planned or decided at Ritz. Despite the fact of staying at an important historic palace the hotel is beautiful and glamorous \u2013 could have some modern touch, but art pieces don\u2019t change. And the location is the best: few steps from Opera, Louvre, Madeleine and shopping areas. The bell door was helpful and very welcoming. As we arrived he conducted us to the reception and from that time we already felt like a guest. Unlike my expectation our room took almost one hour to be ready and they said we had to wait. I expected a different reception but everyone were so friendly we didn\u2019t mind the delay. We used that time to walk through the elegant hotel halls, including a quick look at the 300 euro menu restaurant, the charming lobby bar and the huge shops corridor on the lower floor that leaded to Rue de Cambon entrance, where the wonderful Ritz Bar is located. We had time also to visit the wonderful spa, where the marvelous swimming pool and Ivo Pitangui\u2019s dermatologic creams were some of the attractions. When the room was ready someone was looking for us to introduce us to the hotel. There was two ways to go to the room: the stylish stairway beside the lobby and a small elevator backward. The room was very classy and elegant and the classic furniture with calming colors took us to a timeless Paris. The bed was incredibly comfortable \u2013 I mean it \u2013 and there were some modern features like the big TV with more than a hundred channels (half of them were from Middle East), IPod dock station (unfortunately there was a strange noise and I turned it off) and useful lights controls. The small balcony with flowers with a view to the garden and the gorgeous chandelier gave the special romantic touch to the room. The bathroom was not glamorous but had its charming like the tap with an interesting duck shape. Beside the bathtub there were two bells to call the help (male or female) \u2013 in my opinion not useful but funny. There were keys to call help beside the bed too. Pink towels, robe and slippers were ultra-comfortable and cosmetics were La Prairie. The concierge was very patient and got us exactly the kind of restaurant we wanted and an incredible table with a panoramic view to the entire restaurant (note that was a 2 star Michelin restaurant and the reservation was made with no more than one hour in advance). Actually some of the concierges were excessively arrogant but some of them are amazing. Keep trying. Breakfast was served at the starred and glamorous restaurant with some menu combinations or separated items, instead of buffet. It costs around 30 to 60 euros. Everything was delicious, from the breads, served warm, to crepes and omelets, although not surprising. As every guest is exclusive it was not necessary to ask a bill to be signed \u2013 they knew our room number \u2013 we just had to leave as soon as we decide. Not to be missed is the Ritz Bar, especially when there is a DJ. The 30 euro cocktails were perfectly prepared and the fashionable ambiance was delightful. Different from the entire stay, as uncomfortable as waiting one hour to get the room was the check out. They telephoned us and knocked on the door at noon to check if we would really leave. Of course we would not stay the whole afternoon but the plan was to leave between noon and 1 pm.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cStill the best\u201d", "Author": "NYCDesign78", "ReviewID": "UR124430462", "Content": "Can see that it does need updating, but hope they don't ruin it with the renovation.

On the day we checked out of our beautiful Sofitel hotel in La Defense Paris at 3pm as they had allowed us a late checkout. We were due at the Ritz for High Tea at 4pm. The journey took us about 30 minutes by cab. The Ritz Paris is a beautiful hotel. We arrived outside the hotel and immediate two men (porters) came over to take our luggage and stored it whilst we had our tea. As we were early, we walked around the hotel and looked at the Rotz boutique. We were allowed to walk around freely in our casual clothes, something you could never do in the London Ritz where my wife and I stayed for our wedding night. When the time came for tea, we were seated at a loved table in the Salon d\u2019ete by the grand piano where a man was playing tunes. We did have to wait for a bit (circa ten minutes) to be asked what we wanted to drink \u2013 my wife had an amaaazing hot chocolate which I can only describe as pure melted Cadbury\u2019s chocolate! I was boring and had coke on the rocks with lemon. The finger sandwiches, scones, preserve, clotted cream and cakes were divine! The staff and service was excellent \u2013 they were very caring, always wanting to top up the hot chocolate. When I asked if I could buy some cakes to take back to London for my family they brought in a beautifully presented box with cakes as a gift from them to us! The only criticism I have is that when I booked the High Tea on the phone from the UK I was quoted 45 Euros but they called me on 30/12 to confirm the booking. They said that the High Tea had been moved to the Salon D\u2019ete and that the price would be 65 Euros.

Only spoke to one person on the front desk who while not unpleasant did not give the service i expect from such a luxurious hotel, everyone else though gave excellent service. The public areas of the hotel were beautiful, decorated as you would expect for such a famous historic hotel. The pool was large though lacking the same style as the rest fo the hotel. As it was my birthday they gave us a free upgrade and placed a cake with candle in the room which was really apreciated. The room was large and spacious, the decor was a bit too old fashioned and took a while to settle into, it felt more like it was preserving the theme of the origional hotel than actually being a functioning hotel in the 21st century. I could imagine recreationist happily wandering around in period clothes, as if it were a museum, and because of this i didnt feel comfortable for some time in my room. Despite this i think it would be hard to find another hotel decorated in such a way, and is one of the reasons i chose the Ritz paris. The room was clean, had modern amenities such as flat screen tvs and music players. The bathroom was imaculate with the famous golden swan taps. I would request a room with a view in future as the inner courtyard was a bit gloomy on a winters day. Corridoors are a bit of a labarynth but add to the charm of the hotel. Had afternoon tea in the hotel, was one of the best ive had and nicer than the Ritz in London, service from the Maitre de was exceptional. As they knew it was my birthday they lowered the lights and braught a cake out, with the pianist playing happy birthday, a lovely touch.

Perhaps Le Bristol is reeling from their latest acclaims. But they should beware! The Ritz was genuinely glad to have me back for a second visirpt and prove some of the glitches I encountered first time around were not typical. Although we did not book the extremely expensive Chopin Suite this time, we were treated with great generosity, an exquisite accommodation. I hold one person especially responsible: Monsieur Joerg Boehler, Director of Rooms. True to his word, he did say if we would return to the Ritx he would make our stay perfect. And it was. Thank you Monsieur Boehler. It's not often nowadays that promises and their fulfillment are the same. (see my review of Hotel Imperial Vienna).

October 2011 Great location, beautiful building with palatial public areas. It is hard to be unimpressed with this hotel. The restaurants, bars, lobby and pool are luxurious. The staff are very professional, polite, helpful and even quite friendly in a slightly conservative way.\u00a0 We saw none of the arrogance or pomposity that that we almost expected. The only dreadful displays of self-importance we saw came from a small number of obnoxious guests whom I suspect were overcompensating for their own insecurities. We were there during fashion week which added greatly to the entertainment. There were lots very strange \"fashionistas\" strutting around in bizarre outfits. \u00a0Mostly tall, bulimic, angry looking young women and outrageously effeminate, emaciated (and equally angry looking) young \"men\". \u00a0All seemed extremely self-conscious and mildly contemptuous of \"normal\" people, they were absolutely hilarious to watch. Now back to the hotel. The regular rooms are not large but are quite adequate and beautifully appointed. The hallways are quite narrow and our elevator was incredibly small, not quite what you expect in a five star hotel. The Bar Vendome is really a restaurant not a bar. It consists of a beautiful, classically French room and an equally beautiful walled courtyard. We would have loved to have eaten in this courtyard but it was the exclusive domain of nicotine addicts who made it uninhabitable for non-smokers. We retreated to the clean but overly warm air of the indoor section. In this city it seems that air-conditioning is rarely used at anything other than its least effective setting. The result is to change the room temperature from unbearable to just mildly uncomfortable. The food and service in Bar Vendome were both superb but be warned, such was not the case in their flagship L' Espadon. My wife and I went there for breakfast with the intention of booking dinner on a later date.\u00a0 The room is beautiful and the service was excellent but, unfortunately, the food was mediocre and inconsistent. This is supposed to be a Michelin 2 star restaurant but they didn't seem to know how to prepare decent scrambled eggs.\u00a0 My wife and I both ordered scrambled eggs and sausages. The sausages were poor quality but they were consistent, I am guessing they all came out of the same slightly stale box. My wife's eggs were as good as any fast-food restaurant might provide, but mine were tepid and dry.\u00a0I suspect they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time, whereas my wife's had been freshly prepared. \u00a0Michelin 2 star?

I have three issues/peccadillos about my stay at the Ritz. 1.) ROOM UPGRADE My husband and I booked a room at the Ritz in June 2011 using our AMEX platinum and were \"guaranteed\" a room upgrade like our stay in London last year where we were upgraded immediately upon arrival. We checked in and the manager 'feverishly' tried to find us an upgrade. \"No, we are totally booked.\" he said. He had brought us to a room overlooking the alley where we could hear and see delivery trucks etc.. It was obvious that this room was a little more worn than others. (This seems to be a recurring theme from previous trip advisor comments.). We went to a cafe for breakfast then returned to the front desk. We spoke to a second shift manager who had absolutely no problem showing us another room. It was on the top floor overlooking a pretty garden with a waterfall. For the remainder of our stay, I had noticed that most of the rooms around us were unoccupied. I am not sure if the 1st manager resents AMEX upgrades, 11year old kids, or was simply unaccommodating...perhaps all three. 2.) ROOM PREPARATION The manager who showed us the room said that they would bring up our luggage from the other room after the final inspection. We came back later in the afternoon and had to call for my daughter's bed to be delivered and made. In London, the bed was made, cookies delivered, and stuffed animal on the pillow. In Paris, the bed was delivered without cookies and void of stuffed animal. At a 4 digit dollar amount each night, they could have spared the added touches. We finally got the bear after asking at check out. One afternoon, about 5ish we returned to our room where a hotel housekeeping supervisor was coincidently leaving our room just as we opened the door. She said she was checking the room to be sure it was acceptable. It seems she needed someone to double check her double checking because the bathroom had no refills of various incidentals and there was no bottled water on the night tables???? What was she checking? 3.) THE CONCIERGE We were lucky to be in Paris when there wasn't a cloud in the sky and the temperature was 80. I had asked the concierge to make reservations at a nice casual cafe with outdoor seating. He sent me to a crowded cafe in a crowded square to a restaurant that served stews. It was 80 degrees....stews at an indoor cafe? I can stand the heat, but stew on a gorgeous night just doesn't seem right. It was the first night so we were exhausted and didn't look for another restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the stew was good..but perhaps on an evening where the temperature is below 75-80 degrees. Toward the end of our trip, I wanted to visit/shop in Marais and asked the concierge for recommendations. He circled a section on the Ritz map which I had shown to the taxi driver. $50 later we ended up at a museum in Marais in the middle of nowhere. I had asked for shops. It was a Sunday, shops aren't open there. The concierge did not circle Les Place de Vosages. What was the concierge thinking and what was I thinking? We then decided to go to the Louvre. In my opinion the Ritz Paris has lost its charm and 5 star service. The Ritz London was hands down a better hotel with better service; no detail unattended.

This is a common trick that lower-class hotels use to steal a bit of extra money from you, but I was pretty surprised to see the Ritz try to do it. For any US credit card holder, when a hotel tries to charge you in USD rather than Euros, this means \"the Ritz tried to charge me a needless additional 3% fee\" without asking.

As expected, the rooms are luxurious beyond imagination and for Paris standards also extremely spacious (the bathroom at the Ritz was larger than the entire room at the other hotel that we patronized on our trip). Parts of the building date back to the 18th century and the interior design goes for a Louis XIV/Louis XV look (not a good choice for travelers who prefer modern interiors, but exactly what you would expect at the Ritz). Great care was taken to blend modern amenities with the traditional styling of the hotel, and even the air conditioning controllers are specially designed to match the look of the original light switches. The only items that stick out a little is the flat -screen TV and the modern clock radio with iPod docking station. The room contains several little electric boxes that can be used to summon the maid, valet, or sommelier (!), or to adjust the lighting or the window shades. Notably, even the bathrooms contain pull cords for calling a maid or valet, so that you can order a snack without leaving the bathtub. We didn't actually try any of those gadgets for calling hotel staff to the room, so we can't really tell for sure whether or not they really worked. One thing that we found a little bit of a turn-off was that you had to walk through a long hallway filled with advertising showcases in order to get to your room. These glass boxes contain products of all luxury brands known to man and may be appealing to the average Ritz customer (the advertising is certainly hitting the right demographic, that's for sure). We found open advertising that is so prominent and in-your-face a little misplaced and annoying. We had previously read some negative comments about the Ritz and other 5-star hotels treating non-jet-set customers in a snooty or arrogant fashion but that was definitely not the case for us. Despite not showing up in a luxury limousine with a bunch of Louis Vuitton luggage in tow we were always treated warmly and respectfully. The lady from the reception was very nice and explained in great detail how to operate the various switches in the room (and there is a lot that needs to be explained). Refreshingly, the Ritz is one of the hotels that still provides excellent concierge service. I've stayed at countless hotels where the concierge was not even familiar with the restaurants in the area or made questionable recommendations or was plainly clueless. The concierge at the Ritz was fun to talk to and helped us a lot in getting around and finding nice dinner places (all in perfect English without being condescending about it). The only flaw with our stay at the Ritz was that there was considerable noise at night. We had rooms on the top floor facing a side street. On top of the ubiquitous noise from Paris mopeds, we could hear a lot of loading/unloading noise, including slamming of doors and frequent operation of hydraulic lifts. We complained the next day and the hotel staff investigated the issue. They found out that on the night in question a big wedding had taken place at an event venue across the street, and they assured us that the problem would not recur. We asked to be moved into different rooms, but this request was declined despite being made in the morning with much time to spare before check-in time. I didn't really understand why we couldn't have switched rooms with some other guests who had not even arrived yet, but maybe that's just the policy at the Ritz. Unfortunately, we were disturbed by similar loading/unloading noise until 3am the next night. Apparently, people were busily setting up yet another event across the street... Well, we did book the lowest room category that was available, and maybe this sort of disturbance just comes with booking the \"cheap\" rooms at the Ritz. All in all, we did enjoy our stay at the Ritz, but in a hotel in this class it's hard to get your money's worth. There is only one Hotel Ritz Paris, and if you want to say \"I've stayed there\" you've got to pay the price. Yes, it's maybe a notch more luxurious than a 4-star hotel but it's also slightly over the top (or actually not so slightly, it is just over the top). In the future I will probably settle for 4-star hotels and put the saved money towards another trip.

It was truly a classy and highly respectable hotel. The staff were exceptional and treated you like royalty, attending to every possible need. We had to rent 2 connecting rooms, but there was a deal for families that allowed the 2nd room to be half price. Initially, one of the rooms had faulty air conditioning and I called the front desk to complain. After investigation by their technician they determined that it could not be fixed that day and they offered to move us to another floor, which we accepted. The duty manager sent us a bottle of champagne and a letter of apology for the inconvenience, which was very kind and classy. Other hotels would not have taken such action. Unfortunately, the TV set in one of the other new rooms was faulty, but I did not bother to complain, although I am sure that they would have promptly fixed it. I am surprised though that they did not check this (and the air con) ahead of time. Part of the standard checklist at such a high class hotel should be to test the TV, Air conditioner, water taps, windows, curtains, etc. before any room is given to a new guest. Oh well. Other than that, it was a lovely place, however, this kind of high class can become boring after awhile. I personally would not want to stay at the Ritz for longer than a couple of days, even if I was a real millionaire (instead of pretending to be one). The trouble is that there is not really much to do there, after awhile. Its a great place for a 60 yr old, rich, snobbish widow to spend time eating at their expensive restaurant and to go shopping in their long narrow galleria of shops, but younger people will eventually just be yawning after a couple of days.

As others have said, the hotel has a bit of an attitude, but that is an integral part of what the Ritz is: a classic, relatively formal luxury hotel intended for well-heeled guests with money. Some might consider the hotel stuffy or formal; if so, they would probably be better off at The Four Seasons George V or The Park Hyatt Vendome, hotels with a much more relaxed, contemporary vibe. Location: Though I generally prefer to stay in St. Germain in smaller hotels, I love the Vendome location. The Place Vendome is not only a special little jewel, but the location cannot be beat. For me, the location is one of the best in Paris, and is far superior to the Four Seasons, in particular. Building: The facilities are beautiful, but can seem slightly dowdy or passe when compared to say the Four Seasons or the Meurice, which definitely have more modern touches, and a more up to date feel, both in the common areas and the rooms. My deluxe room was very nice, but again, comparing it to the Meurice or the Four Seasons is a bit like apples and oranges; these hotels are different, though, in general, their rooms are a little more polished and modern. Unique: This is a one of a kind property with a storied history, and walking through those doors every day when returning makes one feel a little special (at least it did me). Service: I find the service to be very good, though it can seem a bit haughty, and is not up to the coddling service of The Four Seasons. What is amazing, however, is that this is such an old-school hotel where everything is done in house, and there are always people to respond to your needs; for example, on my previous stay, I was out quite a bit, often coming home late at night and craving lobster bisque and french fries - something about the elegant room service at two in the morning of a terrine of bisque and french fries was very comforting. The Concierge desk is very good, but I have had superior experiences with both The Meurice and The Four Seasons. Cost: Paris is very expensive. The dollar is weak, so for Americans, Paris is very very expensive. A room at one of the top hotels in Paris is around $1,000/ night, give or take, depending on the season. The incidental costs at these top hotels is through the roof; breakfast is easily $75/person....room service can approach a hundred dollars or more for a burger and a sandwich... a drink can be $30 or $40 dollars. You should not stay at these hotels if you are going to worry about these charges. Part of staying at a special hotel like the Ritz (for me at least), is enjoying a drink at the bar, frivolously ordering a room service snack, or enjoying breakfast in the hotel; if you are going to count every euro spent, I would not recommend staying at the Ritz, or any of its competitors, for that matter. Value is not part of the equation here. For me, there are other hotels in Paris that I prefer, but they are not \"better\", just different.

The Salon had a pull-out couch which our two young children used as their bedroom. Let's be honest, if you're considering the Ritz you're not concerned about the cost. Well, maybe a bit concerned, but it's a relative concern. Concerned about getting what you expect for a tidy sum per night, not about the dollars involved and whether you have them. I also presume that Americans may also be interested to know if they will be treated with disdain by the French staff. On the latter question the answer was happily no. Virtually every employee we encountered was exceptional. The few minor problems we had were resolved quickly and requests were met promptly and efficiently. Breakfast at 8 meant exactly 8 sharp. One morning I forgot to ask for toast with our order but it was added anyway as they clearly remembered that I asked for it every other morning. The gentleman that manned the concierge desk in the evening was really a wonderful, pleasant man. My son and I came back from the Bastille Day festivities and he was wearing a French naval hat I purchased for him. I mentioned that I did not realize they would have all these military vehicles at the Opera and I didn't have my camera. The gentleman looked at my son and told him what really matters was the time he spent with his father and that memory will be more important than any picture. It was an incredibly nice thing to say. Sure, there were a few employees that could have been a bit nicer and some that will look in disdain at an American, just because it's the Parisian way. The Ritz has reputation that will not waiver one iota based on what anyone on a message board posts. It is an icon of Paris and rightfully so. If you are heading to Paris with young kids (in my case two grade school aged) and you can swing the cost, you should enjoy the Ritz. The location is fantastic and the hotel has several nice touches the children should appreciate. Food at the hotel is very expensive. If the hotel is a splurge, consider that there are numerous places in Paris to get an outstanding meal for the cost of a room service croque-monsieur. Mind you an exceptional croque-monsieur. Unfortunately, the children's cooking classes ended at the beginning of July, which is the one children's activity we would have liked to sign them up for.

We had adjoining rooms looking out over the rear of the hotel and the back of the Ministry of Justice \u2013 a peaceful view without being spectacular. The rooms were comfortable, bright and well-furnished, though ever-so slightly tired. The ceilings are high and the windows tall but the bathrooms really were nothing special. The bed was very comfortable and covered with gorgeous silky linen. The Ritz is expensive, but it is the Ritz, so no complaints on that score except...the price of breakfast. Yes, it is taken in the glorious dining room and the cornflakes are nice - but $100 per person?! Can\u2019t comment on lunch/dinner because we did not take any other meals in the hotel, partly because two boisterous young children just did not fit with the rather hushed ambience. They have a good pool in the basement. No real complaints, and I\u2019m happy to have tried this legendary hotel, but beyond the history, the Ritz has nothing special to recommend it.

In addition, I travel to Paris often and within the past two years have stayed at Four Seasons George V, Le Meurice, the Ritz, and Plaza Athenee. Again without any question the Ritz was the best experience. I last stayed at the Ritz ten years ago and it was good then. But everything about the hotel has improved, especially the service. At check in our room was not ready but the very friendly front desk staff sent us down to the spa and pool area. She asked us what we needed from our luggage and then carried some of our belongings herself! For those who have stayed at the Ritz before you know that they have one of most beautiful indoor poor and spa in the world. My partner and I got to relax in the pool, jacuzzi, sauna; we even took a nap by the pool. And we spotted a famous French actress/model swimming in the pool, clearly a part of her noon exercise routine. When we checked into our room we were upgraded to one with a sweeping view of Paris including the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides. And the room's bathroom came with a jacuzzi tub and sauna! A first in my extensive travel around the world. We also had dinner at L'Espadon and found it to be a truly wonderful experience. The food was great and the wait staff very friendly. My partner does not speak any French but the staff was just as courteous and warm. We also had dinner at Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athenee and the restaurant at Le Meurice during this trip but liked L'Espadon the best. And just as before I love the peach-colored towels (and more number and kinds of towels than any hotel!) at the Ritz. Really makes one feel being enveloped in warmth and luxury in the bathroom. And they upgraded to la Prairie bath products which are excellent. And one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in, much better than the one at the Plaza Athenee. Also whenever we ordered room service the food was delivered quickly and seamlessly. What had always distinguished the Ritz is a sense of history, luxury, discretion. During this last stay it's clear to me the service has also improved to the level of the best Four Seasons hotels in the world.

I get the sense that they are living off the Ritz name, while not really offering the full Ritz experience. The rooms are more tired than luxurious......not a PATCH on the quality of the London Ritz's rooms, despite costing a lot more. The service is fine, and i must say that I encountered none of the bad service others have mentioned here. But two things irritated me following my three day stay: 1) The rooms.....with their slightly worn out carpets, old bathrooms with blemishes in the workmanship fully on display.....simply not 5 star rooms. 2) The prices. Ok, you could say \"You stayed at the Ritz...you can't complain about prices\", to which I would say \"Why NOT?\". Just because it is named \"Ritz\"....does that mean they can charge ANY price they like? Like $40 for a drink in the bar? Like $12 for a can of coke in the mini bar......or $12 for a tiny can of Pringles in the mini bar? Or maybe $60 for a room service burger, or $70 for a cheese pizza? I got the sense that, more than any other hotel I can remember patronising, that these guys are REALLY after your wallet....and are determined to empty no matter what. The lobby areas are quirky, long tube-like spaces with no central grand lobby area. There is a 300 foot walk (if not a bit more, in fact) down a seemingly endless passageway lined with merchandise for sale in order to get to your room. Somewhat tacky, to my taste. Considering that they charge as much as the George V, I struggle to see why anyone would stay here. And if you DO for some reason stay here, do NOT fall for their trap of picking you up or dropping you at the airport. They charge $350 for this (each way), and any other limo company in town will do it for $150 in the same, or nicer car. As I said, the main impression one leaves with is that the primary theme here is to get as much money out of you as possible. If they lowered the price of everything 50% in the hotel, bars and restaurants you would just about be getting good value.

I wanted to try another Paris hotel for a change. Stayed at the George Cinq Four Seaons once, and wasn't really impressed; (had lunch there this time and I was really glad I hadn't chosen to stay there...I think I have overdosed on the ubiquitous FS brand -Im just over it and overdosed on it). The Ritz Paris: I was a little trepidatious because it is a \"tourist attraction.\" Sightseeing buses and folks laden with cameras all come to look at the Ritz:: at least as much because of Princess Diana as well as being one of the most \"famous\" hotels in the world. Sometimes \"famous hotels\" can be tourist traps, so I was a little worried. The security at the hotel is fabulous; the doormen and \"plain clothes\" security men ensure that tourtists are not in the lobby to gawk and give the place a \"once-over\", impeding the privacy and enjoyment of the hotel guests. Upon check-in, we were whisked to our beautiful suite, and we found a bottle of Champagne, a bowl of fruit, chocolates and a huge flower arrangement of white roses. The check-in formalities were done in the room: no standing at the desk at reception after a long, over night flight from the U.S. We specifically booked the Chopin Suite. It is stunning. All the panelling and highly decorated ceiling, with gilt and mouldings and panelling, fireplace, and parquet floors are original. Chopin's last dwelling was across the Place Vendome and this suite was created in his honor.The furniture, draperies, bedding, parquetry floors and period-accurate accoutrements enhnaced the beauty of the suite. Although not enormous, the suite had a lovely entry hall, which had a door which closed off theliving area completely from the front door. This was great: when we ordered room service, the waiter used his pass key to leave the table in the entry foyer while our privacy was undisturbed. The living room was lovely with brand new upholstery; everything in great condition. Off the living room, there was a huge bathroom: all black and white marble, and elaborate bronze taps on all the sinks...shaped like swans.....a tad over the top, but fun, for it really helped to keep up the fantasy of actually living in the period of the decor. The original panelling concealed closets. Even light switches were \"banned\" from the room. What looked like large brass keys controlled the lighting. The lighting was ample and there were dimmers on all the chandeliers and sconces as well as any lamps. The bedroom, which is the heart of the Chopin Suite, is a hexagonal-shaped room. With splendid period furniture and the most magnficent ceiling and marble fireplace, I felt lucky indeed. The huge French Door/window overlooked the Place Vendome. It was fun to step out on our balcony and drink in the atmosphere of this iconic Parisian spot. There was a second, full bath, gorgously done with every amenity imagineable. The room service food was a let=down, and the service from the concierge was spotty. For a hotel of this calibre it seeemed odd that the concierge was not really on top of things; they did not have a \"we can do anything\" attitude...which I thought was a major flaw. By the way, the hotel was absolutely empty....although this is not necessarily the fault of the hotel...the ghost-town quality of the hotel was a little bit of a turn-off. I had no desire to go the bar or have a relaxing meal in any of the dining venues because I felt we would be dining alone. All in all, I nice stay. I don't think I would go back to this hotel. The location is not my favorite. I prefer the location of the Bristol, the George V and even The Crillion (on the stupendous Place de Coooncorde) seems a little closer to where I like to be in Paris. The Ritz is located in what was formerly the best part of town. but like in most cities, the best, or most exciting, parts of town shift over time. Also, The Rtz seemed harder to get to the left bank and it was quite far from the Eiffel Tower. All in all, though a nice stay ibn a beautiful, unique suite.

From the outside The Ritz is a revolving door and a few white awnings, once inside the sheer scale of the place is impressive; a real tardis effect. It is a very discreet hotel, the sort of place one cannot really look into, it is certainly not a property one wanders through on a whim; I observed several tourists attempting this and they were all prompty bounced out. To address some of the previous \"reviews\" regarding entry being refused, The RItz is a world of its own, the moment it lets everyone enter this world, this world is no more. Check-in was very efficient; in fact all the staff were not only courteous but also extremely friendly and helpful. My luggage comprised a couple of delicate items (glass) I had bought that day at the shops, and they were relatively unwrapped in a shopping bag; when my luggage was brought to the room they had been wrapped in bubble-wrap, just one example of the exceptional service one can enjoy at this property. The rooms will not be to everyone's tastes. If you like everything to have a brand new, creak-free feel to it you won't be impressed with the bedrooms here, the bathrooms even less so. This is in fact what I found most charming about the bedrooms, besides a new television and other modern technologies they remain pretty much unchanged for decades and decades, and have a timeless elegance and opulence about them. Decor is classic \"palace style\", and everything was absolutely immaculate. The bathroom could've been straight out of the thirties, elegant white marble, a vast cast iron bath-tub, twin pedestal basins with taps formed as swans, all decked out with their signature peach towels. My only gripe was that the bath took nearly half an hour to fill as the hot water pressure was pitiful. However, the charm virtually nullified this minor inconvenience. The spa area is an impressive size, especially for a Parisian hotel. A particularly homely touch is that one can wander down (via a direct lift) in their bathrobe. There is a pool area and separate mens/womens jacuzzi, sauna and steam room area. Around the pool are loungers and one or two \"bed\" type arrangements for couples. Whilst these facilities were a pleasure to use and the staff excellent, they do feel somewhat dated compared to more modern spas - the sauna is just a sauna, not one of those pearlescent tiled ones where water trickles through various scent phases etc. This is certainly an area which could be improved upon in terms of what is on offer, but what is currently offered is high quality and certainly provides a pleasant respite from the busy city. Also available within the hotel are numerous bars, the famed L'Espadon, and a shopping gallery (which must be several hundred feet long). Even breakfast was served with finesse and elegance; the a la carte menu offers some delicious dishes, all typically classical in their nature. The Hemingway Bar provides a pleasant juxtaposition to the opulent grandeur of the rest of the property, it is a small wood panelled room with various photographs and mementos from Hemingway, with a clubby feel. It reminded me of the bar at The Connaught, London prior to its identikit renovation. Value for money is something that one shouldn't really attempt to categorise when staying at The Ritz. The staff are all so helpful, pleasant and charming, the rooms so comfortable that one really does feel at home there, relaxed with virtually every whim catered for. Needless to say, nothing is cheap there. A couple can easily rack up a EUR500 room service bill on a couple of dishes (not even caviar or truffles) and a bottle of \"cheap\" wine e.g. a pizza is EUR50. One does not go to The Ritz and expect economy. One thing that irritated me slightly was not being open about charging for extras, EUR50 for a pizza is fine, the price is stated... I asked housekeeping for a couple of toothbrushes and paste (a very standard request in any hotel) which were very promptly delivered in a Ritz carrier bag. I thought nothing more of this until I came to check-out and had been billed for them; not cost price, but probably something approaching 12 times cost. Firstly, no hotel I have ever stayed at charges for a dental kit (admittedly these were full size tubes of toothpaste and \"normal\" toothbrushes, but one would and should only expect the best at The RItz) and secondly, it would have been courtesy to have left a receipt for this in the bag; all things considered, this is a petty gripe in the grand scheme of things. If you are the sort of traveller who seeks to experience an era of grand travel and elegance that is no longer widely prevalent then The Ritz is definitely the place where you can indulge yourself.

The Hemingway bar is a must and it does have great historical significance. On the negative the concierges were both short and one restaurant recommendation was positively atrocious. The room was dated and yes again the bathrooms are beyond dated. Check in was shoddy and slow and overall feel was not a value especially again compared with it's peers.

He decided to book for the Valentines weekend. He had problems booking direct with the hotel initially and eventually had to use an agent. As the date got closer he telephoned the hotel to enquire about certain arrangements and was assured all was in hand, he also mentioned that he assumed that as per their own website as it was Valentines weekend we would as a matter of course received the 'little extras' mentioned. He was told in no uncertain terms that no we wouldn't as there was no availability left. He questioned this as he had booked a while earlier but the staff were un friendlt and unbending. Hmmm...... should have seen the signs. Perhaps it was because we have not booked direct? But that was because he couldn't! On arrival, check-in was no problem, and we were shown to our room. As we looked out of the window to see the view of the garden we had been assured of, we looked out onto a road. My husband didn't want to make a fuss and spoil the weekend so mentioned our disappointment when we went out. Next morning we went down for breakfast to see a number of different couples, families milling around the entrance to the L'Espadon restaurant. When we spoke to the lady at the entrance to the restaurant we were told very firmly that there was no availability in the restaurant. No apology, no alternative, we got the distinct impression that she would rather like us to not want breakfast and to just go away. My husband spoke to reception who arranged for a side room to be opened and and a 'sort of 'breakfast service was offered to us and others who were waiting. It was not nearly the same standard and my husband explained that we were unhappy and could we be guaranteed a table in L'Espadon the next morning. After all this is The Ritz and L'Espadon is special and is what is expected when you are paying for breakfast. We were told we would have a table and asked what time we would like it for we said between 9.45 and 10.00 am. Fine, booked. We got down to breakfast and just gone 9.45 am and were informed that as we hadn't arrived'on time' there was no table. At this stage my husband is really seeing red. He explained that we had left the time a little flexible for their benefit and that we DID expect them to allocate the next table free to us. Eventually we had breakfast in the beautiful room. As a gesture of apology we were offered a late 'check-out'. Which was much appreciated as we were booked in for afternoon teat in the hotel and we did not have then to lave our bags with concierge and could change before we headed off for the airport. However, whilst we were having afternoon tea, we were approached by a member of staff who questioned why our belongings were still in our room - we fels as though we were being accused of almost trying to squat there and refusing to leave! We explained that we had been given a late check-out and this was accepted. However my husband was seething as our afternoon tea was ruined, we felt rushed then and so quickly finished what should have been an enjoyable end to our stay and went back to our room to get our bags. No sooner had we closed the door to the room than it was being banged quite abruptly. On answering my husband was questioned by the housekeeper as to when we would be leaving and standing just behind here was a gentleman in a suit, obviously there as back up just in case we were refusing to leave, we can only assume! This action was totally unnecessary, so totally over the top and so wrong. We were not overstaying at all, it was till only early afternoon and we had been offered the late check-out by reception, by way of apology. We explained our extreme upset at our treatment and went through the eents at reception. They obviously apolgised and said that they would investigate to see what had gone wrong. To this day, we have still not had a written communication from the hotel, let alone any form of compensation for such a totally ruined stay. We stayed here because we have previously stayed at The Ritz in Madrid - what a difference. That hotel is superb, fantastic and the staff are wonderful. Nothing too heavy just professional and good! Paris was not even close to Madrid so if you're just looking for a lovely weekend stay go to Madrid instead. If you need to got to Paris, book anywhere else instead.

I was reasonably excited at the prospect of staying at such an iconic establishment, but I have to say, I was almost entirely under-awed by my experience. From the snooty reception and concierge staff, to the TINY room, the whole hotel gave the impression of leveraging off it's name, rather than actually offering a decent standard of accomodation and service. Perhaps the Ritz isn't targeting western european business travellers, it would certainly seem that their larger clientele now comes from the middle east and Africa, and perhaps the 'old school opulence' works for these guests. From a western perspective, however, the pastel pink mongrammed bath towels, the golden swan-shaped taps (i'm not kidding) and the ornate baroque lamps next to the bed just seemed overdone, worn around the edges and quite frankly, a bit tacky. It's not just the decor though! 78EUR for a steak and chips on room service, with 9EUR for sides of vegetables is laughable. My 14EUR can of Heineken from the minibar didn't jump out, open itself and give me a massage, as I would expect for that price and the 1.5hr wait (and 4 phone calls) to get my television to work properly is frankly unacceptable.

He accompanied us to our room, which was drop dead gorgeous, made sure everything was to our satisfaction. We requested, and got, a deluxe double room with a king bed and rollaway, which was so beautiful it looked nothing like a rollaway. The bathroom was huge with magnificent, thick peach colored towels. Everything gleamed and sparkled, especially the swan tub and sink fixtures. Because we arrived on Christmas eve, the hotel was simply beautiful with holiday decorations. Understated and elegant. An unexpected bonus came at 11:45 at night, when a housekeeper brought a huge poinsettia to our room, which she placed on the mantle above the fireplace.

Before going I read the reviews on here and they seemed somewhat mixed and I had average expectations as I was concerned it may just be trading off its name and that it would be full of wannabees and \"look at me's\". How happy I am to say that this was so not the case. Let me just say that we went in winter which certainly may have made it a lot less quiet and pleasant but anyway. Always a few downsides though so here goes. Checked in and was told our suite wouldnt be available for another hour so, would we like to have a drink in the Vendome bar. So a bit peeved about late check-in (which made it 4pm - and that we had to have a drink on our own wallet - this has happened at other hotels and we've been given a drink voucher which wouldve been lovely and very much appreciated. About 4.15 was told our room was ready. I cringed at our room being the one right next to the lift and with pretty good reason - we heard the lift quite a bit throughout our 5 day stay but it wasnt too bad. Our suite was absolutely stunning with a large, separate and beautifully furnished lounge room with 2 terraces opening out onto a view of the eiffel tower which we werent expecting! So, gazing at this through the day and the hourly light show through the night was breathtaking. Our suite looked out over a boxed-in courtyard which made it very quiet and serene. Hard to beleive we were in the middle of such a huge bustling city. We were expecting some sort of welcome drink (champagne?) or sweets but there was nothng. Someone came in an hour later and delivered a plate of little cakes. There was no complimnetary water or anything else which you'd expect in such a professional - and expensive - place. This was the only complimentry thing we received throughout our stay. The room certainly exceeded our expectations. Huge comfy bed, beautiful lighting, quite large bathroom, beaufitul toiletries, fluffy pink Ritz robes and slippers. Minibar was a little disappointing with not much on offer. And housekeeping throughout our stay was really quite slack. Came back to our room each day around 4pm and room still not done. They came around 5 or 6. One day they forgot to give us more soap and shampoo which we'd run out of. Turn down service at night very disappointing. Nothing left on the bed but a breakfast menu. I've never not received a chocolate on a turn down service before. In-room dining was a wonderful experience. Very efficient and food prepared in our room. Had an amazing slow-cooked lamb shoulder for 2 with pistachio rice and a bottle of chilled champagne and the following morning exquisite french toast with ice-cream, all just as ordered. They didnt collect our breakfast table until 5pm even though we rang straight after breakfast so we had to put up with it in our room all day - it was too big for us to get it out the door. Dining at the Ritz restaurants is wonderful. Aftenoon tea at the Bar Vendome was our ritual each afternoon at 4pm where we slowly grazed for 2 hours on all the different delicacies. Breakfast - included in price - was a very sophisticated affair. Its called a buffet but you actually choose all the things you want from a menu and they deliver it all to your table. As soon as a mouthful of coffee was drunk our cups were topped up, as soon as a croissant was eaten another one was put in our bakery basket. And they dont rush you out no matter how many people are queueing to get in. We had a 4hour dinner at L'Espadon which was honestty the most wonderful dining experience of my life. 3 courses so professionally cooked and served by such lovely waiters followed by a cheese trolley that you can pick as much as you like from. Had caviar and truffles for the first time in my life which I'll always remember. Overall it was 5 days of bliss and I cant wait to return hopefully in the not too distant future. There were a few \"peevs\" but we tended to focus on them more due to the rate we were paying but they certainly didnt dampen the experince that much. If you're dreaming of going - do it! We loved the place so much we only ventured out into the city for one day. It was just a pleasure to be either in our gorgeous suite relaxing, wandering through the lobby or having a drink or some gastronomical delight in one of the intimate little spots available. Also the Ritz Bar - not the Hemingway bar (too bright and small!) but the bar on the right is ultra-cool.

We can dream though! The rooms are just as I'd imagined, old styled furniture thick sofas rich fabrics beautiful artwork etc. We had a separate bedroom with the most comfortable bed and two lovely long french windows with a balcony overlooking the Restaurant Courtyard which through the day was frequented by some really artistic and creative sort of people even though I didn't know who they where I imagined they were famous designers and wives of the politicians and the elite Parisian people. Next door you could hear children playing in one of the private schools on the block it was truly lovely. The Ritz is situated in the loveliest part of all of Paris with beautiful boutiques carrying the finest that France has to offer. You can walk pretty much everywhere from this location. If your a fashionista like myself you can visit the world famous Chanel Boutique Rue Cambon just 1 street away and have your purchases waiting in your room for you, pretty special! We never really saw any staff or chambermaids they seemed to know when you were in or out and worked around us. The room products were so special and we had 2 mini-bars 1 in each room and I must say they were the best stocked bars that I've ever seen. They bathroom was stocked with the best products, and there were lots of cables and buttons in your room and in the bathroom which you can call the chambermaids for help. Everything was amazing even down to the gold swan taps. The concierge was brilliant they arranged all our ongoing things for us and also having them confirm our arrangement seemed to work much better than me trying to do it myself so if you need anything ask the concierge they seem to be in the know with everyone and the arrangements through them were spot on. We were given VIP treatment at Charles De Gualle Airport with there arrangements and a lovely room upgrade at our next hotel all from the Ritz's fine concierge. I can see why the rich and famous frequent this establishment they feel safe and protected I know I did. There seemed to be security everywhere and they all looked like secret service agents if you were not supposed to be in the hotel they'd be straight on to you they have a strict no filming or photo policy which they do police vigorously (yes i did get caught) I was given lovely gifts everyday that I stayed there (5 days in total) Lovely chocolates little cakes and biscuits a lovely book on the history of the Ritz everyday there was something nice in my Suite.

The Ritz in Paris is, to my mind, one of them. Forget large intercontinental types of hotels, where you unhappily mingle with badged conference people; The Ritz has kept its essence, and 'raison d'etre' when it was created; to be a home away from home. And what a home! Having booked a deluxe room via Amex platinium, I was offered on checking in, to be upgraded to a junior suite; so I was shown the deluxe room first, then the vast junior suite, with it's separate living room. Well, would you believe, I decided to go for the deluxe room,; and for a simple reason. The junior suites generally overlook one of the hotel's smallish, inner courtyard, whereas, the better deluxe rooms are at the front, overlooking the legendary Place Vendome. The reason why those deluxe rooms are in a better position is because, I was told, this is where all the grand, royal suites are loctated, and so the rooms can be used to connect with the suites if needs be. This means that those deluxe rooms are staggeringly beautiful, with huge ceiling heights, stunning chandeliers and gold-leaf detailing; One really feels steeped in history, in Marie Antoinette settings, as if falling asleep in a bedroom in Versaille. And that is the 'forte' of this hotel; (unlike the Ritz in London, where I also stayed, which really is nothing special at all). Service was near ennough perfect, just the right blend of friendliness and professionalism; with a very good room-service, and an excellent housekeeping who, when asked for some extra body lotion, delivered them so discreetly into the bathroom that we never even knew she came. On the subject, the bathroom products were 'la Prairie', the best of the best, according to my wife, and she should know. Also, what a wonderfully large and deep bathtub, and those little swan-shaped taps and thick peach-coloured towels added to the overall experience. No separate shower, though. So no negatives at all ? Well alright, one or two litlle things, just to confirm that perfection does simply not exist. First, the pool was not all that great; nice to have in the middle of Paris, but it isn't big enough to take more than a maximum of three swimmers doing lenghts, at a time, so you just have to wait your turn for someone to come out . (the web's photo would have you believe that it is much bigger than it actually is, which is a bit naughty) Also the changing/locker rooms are cramped and uninvinting. And the only drawbacks I could find in the bedroom was the faint whirr from one of the nearby lifts, when it was in use, and also the imposibility to work out the heating system, as the many handsome brass switches were very confusing, and it got far too hot in the night.

Upon arriving, I checked in with a very kindly looking receptionist who indulged my wish to try out my French very politely. He took our two small cases and led us to the lift (so far so good). What he didn't mention beforehand was that the Junior Suite Deluxe we had reserved (basically a nice big room) had been upgraded to an Executive Suite with two bathrooms. The view of the gardens below was lovely and the rooms in the suite were exactly as I had hoped. Nice touch to have taps resembling swans spewing water out of their mouths! I dug my hands in my pockets and forked out more than my usual tip for such a treat. Some people say that there is always a risk of tipping too much in France but I've never heard the recipients complain about it, or offer worse service as a consequence. The TV welcomed us by name, as did a hand written card, although they had assumed that I was coming with my wife which amused my partner enormously. That was the only minor drawback and it did not offend me to be honest. Room service was perfected executed on both occasions I used it. They arrived within reasonable time and served with a flourish. Everyone in the hotel who would be in a position to speak to guests speaks good English but they also don't mind you having a go in the local language if you want. In the Espadon restaurant in the hotel, the service was professional and friendly. I decided to push the boat out and have the \"menu decouverte\", involving nine small courses. The multi-lingual staff presented the tasting menu that we ordered at a very good pace, explaining what each course was and accompanying each one with a glass of wine to perfectly compliment the flavours. Seven glasses of wine later I was feeling very happy indeed with the dinner and the evening in general. The food is delicious, with excellent sauces, but don't expect to be stuffed by the end - huge portions is an Anglo-Saxon feature which us Brits and Americans could do well to abandon. The next day we had a snack in the Vendome bar. Again the staff were friendly and welcoming which was fast becoming the norm for the hotel workers. The decor and opulence of the rooms and corridors is pretty much the same as the Ritz in London; it's very Louis 16th, which I like. If you appreciate this style you'll be impressed with the attention to detail and lavish designs. If you like your bed firm then that might be a problem for you as my one was a bit on the soft side but it was exquisitely dressed and, ofcourse, the maid turned it down before bedtime. Finally, we checked out and let a doorman hail a taxi for us and put our cases in the boot of the car (another tip but I didn't mind). I had read a couple of very negative reviews on this website from other guests of the Ritz in Paris, which had alarmed me a bit before I arrived there. Now I am just a little perturbed - my experience was perfect (I am reasonably familiar with the five star industry so I don't think that I am particularly easily impressed). Maybe I was lucky but I doubt it.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cRitz is the Pitz\u201d", "Author": "scooby19", "ReviewID": "UR7485528", "Content": "It is with great disappointment that I write this negative review of the Ritz in Paris. I've stayed in many similar caliber hotels in the world -- this hotel just didn't meet the standards of a luxury hotel. Let me say first that if judged on looks alone, the Ritz is absolutely beautiful..but there is little substance under the beauty. Service at breakfast was horrible. I was served first, my husband nearly 20 minutes later. No explanation provided. We had to ask for coffee -- it was a good 15 minutes after we were seated when we finally got a cup -- served in very chipped coffee cups. The centerpiece on the table was broken and the napkins were stained. One would be much more forgiving in a propertly where breakfast of oatmeal and fried eggs didn't cost $150. When we complained, we got a call early in the afternoon the next day for an offer to buy us breakfast THAT day -- needless to say by 1pm we had already had breakfast ! No further effort was made. The Spa, touted as one of the best in Paris left lots to be desired. Absolutely zero service. The showers in the ladies side had not been serviced ditto for the poolside lounge chairs. Pretty gross. There was no water anywhere except in a water cooler just outside the locker room. None was offered before or after the massage. There was no \"relaxation room\" to wait in prior to treatment. Just two chairs stationed in a hallway outside the treatment room as though you were waiting outside the principal's office -- just terrible. Zero amenities in this Spa. We were told that usually the spa has much more \"energy\" to it. Well allrighty then! What a ridiculous explanation. We were offered the hotel car for a ride to dinner one night. Once outside there was a rather heated debate beftween the doorman and the conceirge. Apparently the hotel car was promised to another guest -- it was very awkward standing there while they decided who the lucky guest would be! We won that battle, but then realized it was literally a 2 minute ride. All that fuss over a 4 minute round trip ride. Unbelievable! Service at Hemmingways Bar was similarly sad. We went in for a cocktail and it was obvious that the bartender didn't feel like working as we were the only two guests in the place. We did not choose to have any further meals at the hotel after that. This will change for next year, as France will be going smoke free as well. But... beware cigar smoking is all the rage at this hotel with the exception of the hallways in the lobby leading to the restaurant and the bars. This hotel, unlike other luxury hotels is not careful with hotel transfers. We arranged for a transfer to the airport on check out and were placed in a filthy, banged up taxi. Just awful. A couple of positive highlights though -- the concierge recommended two restaurantes for dinner and both were superb and presented two very different dining experiences. The second high point -- the bed. So comfortable that you actually consider staying in it rather than hitting the town! Finally, location cannot be beaten -- Next time however, we will stay at the Maurice or the Four Seasons George V- I am sorry that I opted for the Ritz and will not make that same mistake twice. A hotel of this caliber and this expense should really clean up its act. There are so many other choices out there.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThe Ritz ...unbelievable !!\u201d", "Author": "ballymoreboy", "ReviewID": "UR7420060", "Content": "The most beautiful hotel ...such service is rare ...

Have never written a hotel review before, but I relied on this site in choosing the Ritz, and had a somewhat different experience than what was described. I am not one of those fussy, super-critical folks, but the Ritz did not meet my expectations in several areas. The bad: 1. Concierge service was awful. Not only did they not contact me before my arrival, they insisted I use e-mail when I called to arrange transportation from the airport. Then they did not respond to two e-mails. While there, it was amazing how often they were flat wrong about things they told us. They were also the only people who really seemed snotty to us in the hotel. To top it off, the night before leaving, we made arrangements for a late check out and transportation to the airport: the car came six hours early, did not come with child safety seats as requested, and the late check-out memo was lost. In short, of the six or seven things we asked them, they screwed up five of them. 2. Kids. One of the main reasons we chose the Ritz was reading about how well they treated kids. But our kids did not receive a \"welcome gift\", as their own materials promised, and there seemed to be no special attention to them. They seemed to look at our kids as a potential annoyance to their \"important\" guests. Far from \"greeting them by name\", the only special greetings we got were asking if we were registered guests. And the five or six doormen on duty did not leap to open the non-revolving side door for our stroller, even when we were obviously struggling. 3. Cost. Paris is very expensive right now, but this place is out of control. Brunch and room service dinner for our family of six the first day were over $500 each. And $35 a day for internet access! 4. No water in our kids' bathroom the first night. They did give us half off on the room that night, though. The Good: 1. Very comfortable beds, and excellent bathrooms. 2. Very good location, almost perfect. 3. Quiet and clean in both public and private areas. 4. When our daughter got sick the last night at 2 a.m., two sympathetic, uniformed chambermaids arrived to change the linens within five minutes. We had such a good time on the trip that it's hard to be too negative. But the concierges are absolutely useless, and we didn't experience any of those \"special touches\" that others have raved about.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool,UK", "Title": "\u201cl espadon restaurant\u201d", "Author": "huitres", "ReviewID": "UR5709674", "Content": "Fantastic setting.

This was both business and pleasure and we spent hours doing research and planning for our stay. Our one major hesitation was that the grand dame might have been past her prime, sort of like New York's Park Plaza before it closed when it was yellow and frayed around the edges. Well we are happy to report that this place ROCKS BIG TIME! We were blessed with a fantastic room, and the service, the environment, all made us feel at home, royally. The Ritz is a living classic, a legend that is still very much alive. Why not be part of history? Staying at the Ritz the past and the present come together, as if the Mona Lisa could still smile and talk to you. I recommend buying into the most delux accommodations you can afford in order to get a great room, one with the super high ceilings located in the old part of the building. The concierges were wonderful and helped us get into the BEST restaurants. The place is central to EVERYTHING and we walked easily to THE LOUVRE and to the MUSEE D'ORSAY as well as GOYARDS. I was also afraid its location in the plaza would be cold in sterile, but really it is rather intimate in scale and although lacking in vegetation and color, the plaza's striking and bold BRONZE monument adds plenty of greenery. The spa is a luxurous catacomb of ancient ambience and quiet mystery. We had breakfast in the room with the windows open, which felt like the most exclusive table in town. The Ritz is an experience you will never forget. Our only complaint is that it was so seductive; it was difficult to leave to see the rest of Paris. You have to do the research too. BUY the zagat, michelin, and timeout guides and read them, and you have to be willing to splurge and let go and be open to the experience or go somewhere else. Use the spa, get a facial. go swimming this is the place to do it all. After paying the bill, I felt I got a bargain thats how spectacular it was! If you get the breakfast deal get it delilvered to your room, you will happier! Remember to tip and be friendly to the wonderful staff. They are the Best.

The Kids were given Christmas stockings, a gift and a visit to the pastry kitchen to participate in a festive cookie class. Breakfast was very good, although perhaps slightly rushed on Christmas morning. I don't undertand the complaint from another review regarding the worst seating near the exit. The restaurant is in a secluded end of the hotel lobby. It's impossible to have a bad seat.
