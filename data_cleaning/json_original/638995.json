Transport: As far as I could see you need a taxi to get anywhere from the hotel although there's a free shuttle to the main mosque (Hagia Sophia), which you need to book in advance. Bear in mind that the hotel is south west of Istanbul so if you need to get to a place north east or in the Asian part, getting there will take a while. Stay: Rooms are standard and rather unmemorable but modern and clean. There's free Internet, both wireless and cable. Because of the highway noise don't even try to open the window but airco is good and quiet. Breakfast ok. Fast check in and out.

The big downside is the noisy freeway that separates the hotel from the waterfront. The waterfront is not in use for anything so you cannot walk along it at all. This hotel is locked in by the freeway so if you want to go anywhere you need to get a taxi. They don't even have a suggested outdoor jogging circuit.
