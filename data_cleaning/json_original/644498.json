The guy at the front desk was not polite at all. I had left my room to do some shopping and upon returning I had been locked out of my room because someone apparently was knocking on my door when I was gone. I had not seen anything out of ordinary before I left and was not notified that someone had been knocking on my door that afternoon. I was highly upset when the man at the front desk said it was because of this happening and I was not aware of this situation whatsoever. Later on that night I was sitting outside on the balcony and two suspicious men were walking through the parking lot. They proceeded to go to a girls car that was staying in the room next to me and slash all four of her tires and pour sugar in her gas tank. This was unbelievable to me for they did it only 3 feet away from where I was sitting. The guy from the front desk came out, saw it, and did absolutly nothing. He saw me sitting outside still and didn't bother to ask if I was ok, what I had seen, alert the girl whos car it was, or even call the police. The next day come to find out the girl had said it was a \"bad drug deal\". Long story short the people in the motel are the number one problem and the man at the front desk including. When I told him that I felt unsafe to stay any longer he would not do a single thing for me, even though I am a 20 year old girl 1500 miles away from home. This was by far the worst hotel experience of my life and I would never reccomened this place to anyone.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat room for the value\u201d", "Author": "swestberry", "ReviewID": "UR138879101", "Content": "We have stayed there three times now.

It is obvious that management has cut many corners to make this a value motel while trying to pass it off as a nice 'resort', but we would probably have been just as happy with one of the many dumpy motels who offer more for less. If you want a comfortable stay on or near the beach, I suggest you shell out more money and get a room in the hotel right on the beach. We also chose this hotel for their wi-fi but were dissapointed to learn that their signal was very weak and spent much of our time trying to find the best signal. The rooms themselves were passibly clean, but extremely cramped. It was difficult to navigate around the bed and had to pass the luggage over the bed - very inconvenient. The bathroom was dated, but at least it worked and was clean. All rooms face the pool, and the pool was busy and noisy. At one point it seemed that some kids from outside the hotel snuck into the pool, so it didn't feel very secure. Also note that parking is around the back of the motel, which is not very secure either. Don't expect coffee machines in your rooms, nor is there any coffee available in the office. When we inquired about this, we were informed that you can purchase coffee at the corner store accross the street. This was an added dissapointment. The only thing positive I have to say about it is that the motel is steps away from an entrance to the beach.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Gerald B", "ReviewID": "UR137555251", "Content": "Each summer for the past 3 years I have stayed in this motel. I liked the price and rooms until a few weeks ago. I will never stay there again! Bed bugs were so bad that I vacated my room at 3:30AM. I couldn't figure out why I was itching badly--and having a fairly severe allergic reaction that began to affect my breathing--until I saw a large bed bug on my sheet (i.e., the size of a large tick but bigger head and eyes, only six legs instead of eight, and faster moving than a tick). The large ones got away, but I caught a few juveniles (much smaller but still blood suckers) and gave them to the night clerk. (From personal [problems in the past] and professional [professor of biology] experiences with bed bugs, I am 100% certain that I am not mistaken.) After demanding my money back, I slept in my car for the rest of the night. Before getting home to PA, I had to fumigate my suitcase and car to prevent carrying bed bugs into my house. The 20+ welts on my body, from bites, lasted nearly a week. Worst motel experience of my life! I stand behind this review! The owners and desk clerk should know exactly who I am.

Unfortunately, this totally backfired on me this time! We all hated this motel; I'll try to enumerate the reasons why. 1) Parking/office. When we arrived, it was hard to tell where the office was, and driving around the parking lot made it clear that the parking would not be convenient to the rooms. We finally parked and walked around until we found the office. 2) The person at the desk was rude & unpleasant during checkin. You would think they would be happy to have customers. We had 2 rooms, but they didn't even bother to give us adjacent rooms. 3) Dead cockroach outside door, left for several days. Ugh. 4) The rooms were nasty. No chairs; only place to sit was on the bed. Barely enough room to walk around the beds. Fridge & microwave, but no coffeemaker!!!! No do-not-disturb signs, no shampoo. Entry was via keys and doors did not automatically lock behind us. Due to the nature of the people staying at and hanging out around this very cheap motel, I did not feel safe. 5) Not soundproof. And the people staying there (did not see any besides us without tatoos or with all their teeth, not to be judgmental...) were loud and rude (roaring up into the courtyard on their Harleys at all hours), which would have been ok had there been any soundproofing whatsoever in the rooms. 6) Pool area: 2 umbrellas and about 7 plastic lounge chairs; one plastic table. 7) Housekeeping. This is the beach. There was some sand on my floor from my sandals; they didn't even bother to try to vacuum. We paid in advance for 3 nights; two was all we could stand.

Check out time was at ten o'clock very early and I asked for a late checkout at ten thirty she said yes. The management was very rude and unfriendly.

We asked the lady at the front desk if we could skip out early (paid for an entire week up front - NEVER DO THAT!!!) and she told us that it was fine and she would refund us for the days we wouldn't be staying. After we had packed all our stuff, went to the front desk to check out, she told us that they were keeping our money and to get out ASAP other people would be coming in!!!! Talk about cheating students! This place was not only money grabbers but it was also discusting. When the ladies came in to vacuum our room, she vacuumed up my anklet and then pulled it out of their vacuum and left it on the floor all black and discusting. I guess they thought I wouldn't notice? Anyways my advice to all of you, NEVER STAY HERE EVER!!

What a dump. If I thought the outside was bad the inside was worse. As soon I saw my room I handed in my key and left. The smell of the room hit you in the face when you open the door. The toilet still had urine and cigerette buts in it from the previous guest. This in a \"non smoking room\". The matress was disgusting. I would not let a dog sleep on it.

The King Suite was a full size dirty mattress, no heat, the curtains did not cover the windows, phone did not work, nasty towels and no hand towels, and the only mirror in the room was over the toilet. The other tentants were very loud until 2 or 3 in the morning, a car in the parking lot was broken into to and on the day we were leaving, a man was asleep on the back steps. Of course you had to pay for the entire stay the day you checked in, and if I would have seen the room before we paid, I would have rather slept on the beach.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cSeriously Made Me Sick\u201d", "Author": "torontocarp", "ReviewID": "UR6832631", "Content": "STAY AWAY Looked at this hotel on their website,and it looked amazing. Big Big surprise when we arrived in Daytona beach and physically saw the rooms. As soon as you opened the door a heavy smell of must overcame us fallowed by the strong odour of bleach use to try and cover up the must and mold smell. The matresses on the beds looked as though they were found at a dump site. They were torn,dirty with stains and smelled of must. The bathroom was filthy and covered in black mold on the tile surfaces. The carpets were disgusting and covered in stains. The whole room was not fit for a dog to stay in let alone a human!!! We Told the manager that we were disgusted in nthe way this place was run down and dirty and said we would not be sstaying there ( was during the Daytona 500 race) at $165.00 a night. We were assured that our credit card would not be charged and we left. After returning home it was discovered that the credit card had been charged for the room that same day. This place is disgusting at best and the staff are dishonest.
