It was cute and nicely decorated. The view of the golden horn from our terrace was also quite nice. The breakfast was ok and the staff was very friendly. I was hoping for a bit more of a bathroom. It was a little shocking at first to see the shower was basically just a toilet with a shower head and a drain. It was a little cramped and odd but after a few days, I was getting used to it. I also wished that there was a safe to put our passports and valuables in but there was not so I had to carry my passport with me at all times. It was a cozy spot and pretty convenient, close to the old town, Balat and 15 minutes to Taksim Square. You can walk to the major tourist sites from there or take a cab. Overall, it was a really good value and a comfy spot to stay in Istanbul. If you have an iphone from the US, you might have problems connecting to the internet. I had no Wifi connection while I was in the hotel.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cMakes You Feel At Home\u201d", "Author": "e_supertramp", "ReviewID": "UR45987694", "Content": "HotelDaphnis is a very hospitable with a very warm ambiance. the staff gives you the feeling of a home.

It consists of 100 year old rum houses that were converted into a hotel. Despite the historical value, the hotel is equipped with great wifi. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. I was not tripping over my suitcase all the time. The rooms were cleaned, beds made, towels replaced very soon after I left in the morning, yet I was never interrupted by the cleaning staff at all. Right across the street, was a park by the Golden Horn, where many locals and some visitors would work out or take their children to the playground. I have been oversees many times, in many kinds of hotels, and have never felt so accepted as I did at the Daphnis. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were just as eager to learn about our culture as we were to learn theirs. Some of the staff would stay after their shift ended just to be able to hang out with us. I caught a bad cold in Turkey and returned to the hotel feeling miserable and exhausted. When I woke up a couple hours later, I had a hot cup of wellness tea waiting for me. The caring staff had prepared it for me while I was asleep. It was instant relief. I was in Turkey as a member of an orthodox christian group, and we were there on a mission trip. We encountered a lot of resentment and dirty looks from many people in the town, but we always knew that we had friends waiting for us at the hotel. It really felt like I was staying at a relative's house (a very big house), where everything seemed to revolve around me and my needs. By the time we left, it was like saying goodbye to our family. The Hotel Daphnis is one of the most memorable things of my entire trip. I highly encourage everyone to stay at the Hotel Daphnis.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "LucyNebraska", "ReviewID": "UR28643474", "Content": "The Daphnis Hotel was perfect for my trip to Istanbul! The beds each had a down comforter and were extremely comfortable. The service was very hospitable - welcoming us every time we walked through the door and always more than willing to help with any task. The Daphnis Hotel was a relaxing, quiet, and homey place to come back to at the end of our long and busy days. Aside from the amazing comforters, my balcony had a breathtaking view of the Golden Horn. Also the Daphnis is located a short walk from the Spice Bazaar and is within 100 yards of the spectacular Patriarchate. With its great location, outstanding service, and \"homey\" feel, the Daphnis Hotel is the perfect place to stay while enjoying this historic city.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely charming hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jewelfmk", "ReviewID": "UR28592138", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel as part of a group recently and cannot wait to go back! It is a charming very cozy little place perfectly situated right across from the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

The staff was absolutely delightful and by the end of our trip felt like family, despite some language barriers that needed to be crossed. The restaurant is delicious, as is their Turkish coffee (I had about 20 cups in one week). The space is a little tight, but nothing too obstructive, especially when compared to other European hotels.

The facilities are not luxury - the bed is lumpy, the breakfast is slightly dodgy, the bathroom is tiny to the point that you are standing next to the toilet and showering directly onto it (Valuable lesson learnt: take out the toilet roll BEFORE shower and leave it somewhere safe and dry!). Also, if you read nothing else of my review, NOTE THIS: ASK FOR A ROOM AT THE BACK!!!! Rooms at the front of the hotel face the main road, and if the traffic noise doesn't keep you up all night (and, no, the traffic doesn't ease up after, say, 3am - it goes on ALL NIGHT), the dog next door barking its head off all night will. There's nothing the hotel can do about the dog as it belongs to their neighbour, and I can tell you that dog has perfected the art of barking loudly just at the moment you manage to almost fall asleep. AND he manages to do this all night too. BUT (and this is the lovely part): it is also probably one of the loveliest hotels I have ever stayed in - the furnishings are beyond quaint and absolutely charming; the airport transfer, which I booked through them, worked just fine (although it is still MUCH cheaper to take a cab!); the cleaning and restaurant services are also all very satisfactory. Most of all, however, the staff are probably one of the nicest I have ever come across: having complained about the all-night barking dog (see above), they changed me to a room at the back (perfectly quiet) with absolutely no fuss, and carried all my luggage to the new room without even my asking - now THAT is service. On the day I checked out, I left behind a blouse mistakenly, and the cleaning lady rushed after me to return to me my blouse. These are the things which imprint a hotel onto one's mind. So, if you are looking for luxury and service, head for the Hilton. If you are looking for the quaint and the lovely and utterly charming, stay at Hotel Daphnis.

Like many hotels, there are lots of stairs to climb as there is no lift. You can have a view of the river....as long as you don't object to the heavy traffic noise. Breakfast is included but they wait until you come down before they start brewing the coffee. Means the coffee is fresh but it also means that you must wait 15 or more minutes. We thought if we came down around 8 rather than 7 we might find everything set up and ready. Wrong. Restaurant written up in Lonely Planet as a reasonably good choice is not. Overpriced and underwhelming. We felt distinctly shortchanged. The worst thing about the Daphnis is its location. Far from the inner city, most taxi drivers have no idea where it is, it is not the place where you wander around and browse the shops, try out different restaurants, and see the sights. It definitely diminished our enjoyment of the wonderful city of Istanbul.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Daphnis Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d502351-Reviews-Daphnis_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$79 - $112*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "502351", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/39/1d/77/getlstd-property-photo.jpg"}}
