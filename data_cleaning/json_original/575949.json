After several trips to this type of resort throughout South East Asia, it seems to me that some places prefer to spend their money on the guest rooms rather than the pool, restaurant, reception, and so on, while others take the opposite approach.Karma Jimbaran definitely falls into the former category. We arrived late and were quite concerned to see the small, dark, and utterly uninteresting reception area. When we were taken to our villa, however, we were divided between sheer delight and worry that there must have been some kind of mistake. We had been upgraded to a four-bedroom villa that was larger than any house I have ever lived in, with a huge living area, a large garden and patio, a private pool (which was actually big enough to do a few strokes in rather than just jump in and out again), five toilets (I can't remember whether we used all of them or not), four bathrooms plus an outdoor shower, and the fancy kitchen area that we actually only used to chop up a pineapple...The resort is set a little bit back from Jimbaran beach, so does not have beachside facilities, but it really seemed a bit pointless to leave the comfort of such spectacular accommodation, and actually Jimbaran beach is not really all that great for swimming and sunbathing due to the very high tides and the warung restaurants that cover large parts of the beach.The resort restaurant was good too. Breakfast is a la carte rather than a buffet - I can particularly recommend the Australian breakfast - and the two lunches we had there were extremely good, if a little pricey. There is a main pool area, but we never saw anyone there. Like us, they were probably happy in their villas.For dinner we went to the warung on the beach every night for seafood. The food was pretty good and very cheap, and the atmosphere with the smoking grills and candlelit tables is great. We tried different places every night but the menus were practically identical. Teba Cafe seems to be most popular, but Roma at the far end was also good. After three nights of seafood, I was struck by some quite serious Bali belly, though, so it might be wise to give yourself a night off here and there!One more service that I greatly appreciated was being greeted and rushed through Denpasar Airport immediately after stepping off the plane - we were out in 15 minutes while everyone else stood in endless queues for visas and passport control.The only tiny complaint I can think of is that, for some bizarre reason, the shampoo and shower gel in the villa had quite clearly been watered down! I didn't mention it as it was such a small thing and made no difference to my overall impression of the place, which was overwhelmingly positive.Can't wait for the Karma Margaret River to open in 2011!", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR420457295", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Phil&Osamu"}, {"Content": "Very private, lush villas       view from PJ's down the beach", "Date": "Aug 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR886628791", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kmalia"}, {"Content": "Another wonderful stay at Karma Jimbaran We have just had another fabulous week at Karma Jimbaran.

Flew from Singapore to Bali, and after the usual USD 25 visa on arrival faff, I was through customs. The driver appeared to meet me perfectly on time, even though I had not re-confirmed the pick up before travelling. The drive to the resort is 10 or 15 mins, through some typically dusty and ramshackle Balinese streets. Then you turn off, past a few eateries and beach bars, to arrive at the resort itself. Security is quite good - they use sensors to check each vehicle entering the resort, which is freaky but reassuring. The grounds are beautiful - well tended, verdant and very Eastern with lots of Buddhas and design touches. I was immediately escorted to my villa, presented with cold towels and a fresh juice drink. All I had to do was fill in one form, while my case was taken to the main bedroom, and then I was left to it. It was a great surprise to get upgraded to a 3 bed villa, which was really well appointed and spacious. Travelling on my own this seemed a bit indulgent, but the plunge pool you get is slightly bigger too, so that was nice :-) Otherwise, unless you really need the bedrooms the villas are pretty similar. So, the villa. 2 buildings, one for the living/kitchen/dining room. This was very large, well furnished and with a full kitchen. There was even a washing machine tucked away separately, as well as a WC. The kitchen is fully equipped, so if you can be bothered to cook it would be easy enough to whip up a great meal. And you can have chef's lessons in your kitchen too. The other building housed 2 bedrooms (both with ensuite; one outdoor) on the ground floor, and the master suite on the upper floor. This was really large, with a 4 poster bed, dressing area and a large bathroom, complete with walk in shower and huge tub. The tub was great, took 30 mins to fill but was worth it! Between the 2 buildings was a sun terrace with loungers, and the plunge pool. Mine was not that big - maybe 5 or 6 swim strokes across - but enough to refresh you quickly. And good for lounging in while reading. There is a main, large, pool by the restaurant. Each villa has a main gate that you can shut off to avoid being interrupted if you want that all-over tan!The restaurant is really good - both the chef and sous chef are excellent, providing a nice selection of European and SE Asian dishes. I ate there most evenings, and a week was enough to sample all the things I wanted... after that it would have been a tad limited. But there are some restaurants in the vicinity, and as described you can cook too. Plus I know that the chefs were open to requests from guests and would happily do a special meal if you gave them enough warning. The staff are great (Indra especially) and will do their best to make you feel welcome and looked after. Service isn't quick, but then it's nice to spend some time enjoying the meal and the tranquil setting. Internet and reading library are above the restaurant. I had 2 treatments at the spa - a facial and body rub. Both were nice, professional, but nothing better than you would get in a local place. There are a few spas in the area, so trying them all to compare would be fun! The beach at Jimbaran is OK - but then I am a beach snob after visiting the Maldives last year. I went a few times, more to be beside the seaside than to enjoy the water. But then when the resort is so comfortable you could spend all your time there and not feel like you missed out... The main pool is plenty long enough to really swim (25m?) and it's right by the restaurant. Great at evening meals with lanterns all afloat.The only negative experience I had was a mix up over the tariff. The Easter offer had stated Daily breakfast and 4 course meal in di Mare, and I took this to = half board, but you actually get ONE meal at di Mare. Only breakfast is included daily. But the Easter offer was 8 nights for 6 too, so overall it was not out of league for the quality. Price wise, meals were reasonable for western prices, and fairly expensive for local. A bottle of beer was 26000 in the restaurant (GBP 1.50 roughly) and a cocktail 65000 (GBP 3.60). Main courses varied from 150000 to 240000 (GBP 8.35-13.35). I took some snaps of the menu and will try to attach some other photos too later. Overall, it was enjoyable, relaxing, tranquil and luxurious. I would say it's perfect for couples, families with kids of any age, and was good for a single traveller too. It's not high octane, but that's not why people go to Bali.
