We paid 30 euros per night (double room, shared bathroom, stayed in February 2012) and what we got for such a small price was very decent. However, everything in this hotel matches the price so, in case you want more room and luxury, you should look further. Having said that, the price wasn't the only good thing about the hotel. Everyone at the reception was very polite and ready to help with everything we needed. The location is pretty convenient, since it's close to a few bus/tram stations, but the neighbourhood gives out a somewhat sketchy vibe during nighttime. We had no problems during our stay, though. The hotel seemed rather clean, even the bathrooms (as clean as a shared bathroom can be), and our room was cleaned on regular basis. Breakfast was okay - great for the price - and it's pretty much what lots of people would have at home (bread, jam, cold cuts, boiled eggs, cereals, fruit etc). They also have vending machines at the receptions; one of them offer fast food - FAR from good, but it comes in handy if you get hungry in the middle of the night. As for the downsides, the biggest one is the quality of sleep. I'm not talking about the beds here, they were comfortable, albeit tiny. The walls are, however, very thin and you can hear people talking fairly quietly in the room next to yours (let alone the ones who yell in the middle of the night without taking other tourists into account). Be prepared to wake up in the middle of the night... more than once. Also, everything is miniature. Rooms are the size of a toilet and toilets are the size of a cupboard. While small rooms weren't the issue for us, the tiny shower room was uncomfortable at times - and by tiny I mean if-you-are-a-bigger-person-you-might-not-be-able-to-fit tiny. Once you get in, you have to stand in the shower in order to close the door. The stairs might also be a problem if your luggage is bulky and/or heavy, since they're steep and narrow. Overall, this hotel might seem crammed and tiny, but, when you can get it at a price this small, it's a great budget option.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Emeryville, California", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs- Stay Clear\u201d", "Author": "StrwberSortcak", "ReviewID": "UR124483573", "Content": "stayed here in 2009, since it was a cheap alternative to many of the expensive hotels in Amsterdam.

The first shock came shortly after I made the booking - my card was charged by the full amount of my reservation, even though the booking terms & conditions indicated payment upon arrival. After a week I got my money back, and the reservation appeared to be still \"officially confirmed\" (quote from e-mail I got). One month later (shortly before my trip to Amsterdam) I received an e-mail stating that my credit card is wrong and I'll lose my reservation if I don't send details of another one (via an e-mail - where's the security?) in 24 hours. I was in travel and since I didn't expect things like this to happen, I checked my email slightly after that period. I asked for explanation, since my card has been previously accepted and I didn't believe I provided wrong expiry date, like they suggested... The answer was quite ridiculous - they agreed my card was ok the first time (which obviously meant expiry date was fine - what a stupid excuse!), but they tried to charge it again and it didn't work now, so they cancelled my reservation. When I checked the website, the room was again available (on the day before hotel was fully booked), but for 165\u00e2\u201a\u00ac instead of 94\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Conclusions? They can charge your card when they're not supposed to do, leaving you without money (I was lucky I only booked one night - imagine you were coming with your family for entire week). They can ask for credit card details via e-mail, which basically means that if they charge it for no reason (like they apparently do), your bank most likely won't accept the complaint on fraudulent transaction and won't give you the money back, because sending the data by such an insecure means is basically considered holder's fault. Then, they can cancel your reservation in the last minute, forcing you to pay twice as much, because it's impossible to find a cheap room in such a short time.

We were, however, disgusted to come back to our room from breakfast and find that money had been taken from each of our wallets. From that point on we took everything of value with us whenever we went out. The hotel also charges a 5% fee for paying by card (credit or debit) so if you do decide to stay there, pay in cash. Overall it's far too expensive for such a basic hotel and it seems they'll try to get money out of you in any way possible. I would never stay there again.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cSmall, a little pokey, and robbed on the first night.\u201d", "Author": "t00k3r", "ReviewID": "UR15569992", "Content": "We arrived before check-in time, and assumed that the hotel would have a secure room where bags and luggage could be left safely. Unfortunatley this is not the case. The receptionist expected us to leave our bags (unattended) in the reception area. We then tried to pay with a Maestro (debit) card. The receptionist informed us that we would have to pay an extra 5% charge to use our card. While we would have been happy to accept this for using a credit card, we were using a debit card. This is ridiculous. They did however, offer us an option to pay by cash. The room was small, but comfortable (we booked a twin room with an ensuite bathroom), there was a TV with lots of channels, and the bathroom was small, but it was clean. A buffet breakfast is included in the price, and whilst we were down having breakfast someone (the cleaner?) took 20 euros from each of our wallets (which we left in our rooms). As we counted out our money the previous night, we are absolutely certain money was stolen. If you choose to stay here, I strongly suggest that you count all money, and check all personal posessions every night, and every time you come back to the room. I dont recommend leaving a wallet in the room (probably not a good idea anyway :) and be prepared to face hidden charges. The breakfast is nothing to write home about either.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDon't Book It...\u201d", "Author": "KatyK80", "ReviewID": "UR8688014", "Content": "My sister & I stayed here during the IBC exhibition -- we were charged 635 euros for a 3 night stay (the price was hiked up because of the IBC) -- usual price 225 euros - don't even book it at this price -- the place is a mess - dirty, dark smelly -- the location is OK for the RAI -- but coming back to the hotel from the city centre was scary - its in a residential area & who knows who was lurking in the small park area at the top of the street -- our friends stayed at Bed & Breakfast Fort - check this out -- it was a fantastic place.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel in 30 years of coming to Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "treats", "ReviewID": "UR7427527", "Content": "This hotel was by far the worst we have ever stayed in during 30 years of visiting Amsterdam.
