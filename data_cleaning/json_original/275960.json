The hotel is very spacious and peaceful, which is a real relief after the crazy crowds in Venice. If you want a luxurious hotel in striking distance of Venice but not in the centre this is ideal - but for the prices charged a few changes would have made it even better. Staff are helpful and courteous. The breakfast is delicious with a wide range of choice of hot and cold food but a pity the decaf on offer only nescafe instant. I agree with other reviews about the bar prices - once on the island for the night you are a captive audience, and 7 euros for a small bottle of still mineral water is excessive as are the bar snacks - 27 euros for a simple hamburger with chips that are cold due to the distance from the kitchen. We would have eaten in and ordered more drinks if the prices had been more reasonable. Chamber maids are erratic, not cleaning rooms till after 4pm and coming back an hour later to do a turn down, not taking away dirty glasses. The rooms are otherwise very clean and bathrooms lovely - but stuffy without air conditioning in April. Only English TV is CNN or Fox news, so not great for UK residents.

Checking in: First of all we took a taxi to the hotel from the airport - this costs 120euros but is really the only way to arrive in Venice - splash out! We arrived at the hotel, I felt very tired and was wearing my 'comfy-flying-on-a-plane' clothes so wondered how we would be greeted keeping in mind this is a 5* hotel. I needn't have worried - the boat concierge was delightful and our luggage was swept up and we slowly walked into the hotel taking in the atmosphere of the breath-taking island in the evening spring sunshine. Inside the receptionist was very pleasant and gave us a timetable of the shuttle to San Marco. She then showed us to our room - we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 3rd floor over looking the entrance path. The room was vast yet very comfortable, luxurious and warm. Our luggage arrived about 10 minutes after we did which had given us enough time to explore the room. One point I feel I must make for ALL hotels I have stayed in in Italy - if you are British/American, don't expect there to be a kettle in the room - it just doesn't happen here. I don't see it as a problem at all - I am on holiday, in another country, please deal with it and stop whining! The bar: On our first night we had cocktails in 'Gli Specchi' American Bar. They were divine and were served with a variety of olives, nuts and crisps. Other reviewers have commented on the expense but I think for the treats that come with them, the service, the surroundings and the quality - I happily paid 28 euros for 2 drinks! 'Le Maschere' restaurant: Because of the time of year that we visited, this was the main restaurant open at the hotel. We ate here two nights because the food was so delicious. Both times the receipt was very acceptable for the quality of the service and food - I thought it was almost too cheap in comparison to a number of other restaurants in Venice! At the end of our first meal on the first night we were both given two small bouquets of flowers which was lovely. After our second meal we were given a small tray of traditional biscuits, compliments of the chef. It really went beyond 5* service! The shuttle/boats: We took the shuttle everyday to Venice - it was very convenient and never full. It was a smooth ride to a private launch in San Marco which was very easy to find. We also took a private boat to Murano - we were advised by the boat concierge that this was always on standby. He also arranged for us to go to a gallery which offered private glass blowing tours to guests of certain hotels - it was fantastic! The Island: we were very lucky that the weather every day was perfection - blue skies and warm sun. The island is bliss to walk around, with an old church to explore and very large bunnies (which you must not disturb) who are cuteness personified! It is a spectacular location. The hotel: Some people have commented on the hotel feeling like the set of The Shining - all I can say is it is a shame. I felt like I was walking around a royal palace. Considering the history of the building (monastery to institution) they have made it into a fantastic hotel - you wouldn't know about its history without reading it. The corridors are long, yes, but my gosh - what a feeling you get being able to stay there! Spa: We requested a couple of treatments at the spa. The day we went, it was very understaffed but this wasn't an issue for us. We had booked in and the lady was wonderful. I had a manicure and facial and then was offered a cup of green tea whilst my mother had a massage. It was fantastic! Breakfast: The one thing I love about Italy is breakfast! The hotel breakfast didn't disappoint - so much choice! So yummy! The service was great, you were shown to your seat and offered coffee. You then serve yourself at the buffet which had everything under the sun you could think of! The perfect way to start the day! This is an incredible hotel and by far the best place to spend a luxurious and relaxing holiday in Venice. Yes - it might be a bit of a 'one off' holiday for most but it is worth every last cent!", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cPure Bliss\u201d", "Author": "Matt B", "ReviewID": "UR126614133", "Content": "Beautiful hotel, has great historic background.

You are no more than a 15 minute boat ride from the island of Venice which is a service offered free by the hotel.

The grounds of the hotel are well worth a wander around as is an afternoon spent by the pool both offering a tranquil retreat from the bustling city. The hotel is grand and elegant with sweeping staircases and never ending corridors. Our deluxe room was wonderful and spacious with views over the lagoon towards Venice and like the rest of the hotel it was immaculate.

It is grand in a formal, faded kind of way, in keeping with Venice itself and has lovely walks around the grounds. It's appeal is exactly the fact that it IS a Venetian hotel - a bland 'corporate' type hotel in Venice would just kill the point of being in this stunning city. The bar is beautiful (have a Bellini cocktail from Omar in his white tux) but beware the prices!! As you're on a small island ie: no other choice, 21 euros for 1 gin and tonic meant that we took the boat over to Venice itself (15 min trip), though that is also dear. The hotel bar also closed at 1am when our group were still in full swing. Food-wise, we ate as a corporate trip so not sure if the food was it's usual standard or not - it was only very average. In terms of location, some people love the fact that the hotel is on an island by itself and therefore quiet and very spacious. Others said they would prefer to be in Venice itself. There is a beautiful shuttle boat (think shining wood and cream leather) which travels to and fro from St Marks square (takes 15 mins - gorgeous views of Venice en-route - personally, we felt this was part of the thrill of the experience), from 6am - 2am. Venice itself is spectacular - if going again, I'd probably consider staying in Venice itself if you got the same hotel character and authenticity. Finally, we went in November, blue skies, sun, stunning, need a coat. I'd recommend this time of year as it was bustling but not packed - I believe the summer is crazy busy.

The extra for the package is a small amount to pay compared to the price paying for all its extras singly. Included was a candlelight dinner for two in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Le Maschere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Restaurant. Again the service was excellent and the food perfect and presented exquisitely. Breakfast was also included and it there was a wide selection that was regularly topped up as items began to run low. Lastly for anyone that visits I would highly recommend the Spa facilities. Exploring the many hidden backstreets of Venice can be hard on your feet but an hour in the jacuzzi followed by a massage in a relaxing setting had us ready to go again. Loved every minute of our stay and although it isn't cheap it was worth every penny.

The amazing hotel/spa/resort was on it's very own island which explained the asylum/monastery part. Although that is very creepy, I still recommend it. I had a very fun time with my friends.

The boat shuttle from the hotel to the main island was fun and was appreciated.

The waiter (who was really nice) also brought us chips and mixed nuts to snack on while we were waiting for our food. We weren't rushed at all by the waiter, and he was very accommodating when a bunch of our tour friends came to sit with us. The breakfast was the best out of all of the places that we stayed at on our tour, and it included various pastries, cheeses, juices, amazing yogurt in glass jars, fruit, hot foods, etc. Note to Canadians/Americans: the hot chocolate is not sweetened, so it tastes very different from what we are used to! Little touches were greatly appreciated, such as putting out water and apples for hotel clients in the afternoon and having free internet access. The hotel also made a call for us to the main island to check on the availability of opera tickets. The hotel would be a little pricey for us to stay at if we were not on the tour, but they offered us a discount on the room rate if we wanted to extend our stay after our tour ended, which was extremely nice. A great experience! For those tourists who get the tax refund for spending a certain amount of money in one store, there is a place right in St. Mark's Square where you can get the refund.

This was bewildering, since very few rooms were occupied and rooms much closer to the lobby were surely available. Late in the evening as we returned to the hotel and walked to our room, the total emptiness of the place gave us a creepy feeling. We compared it to the hotel in the movie \"The Shining.\" When we checked into our room, a shelf on the wall close to our room had dirty dishes, bottles and glasses stacked on it. The next day at lunchtime, those dirty dishes were still there. Where was the staff? We wanted to eat at the hotel, but a glance at the menu showed us that a hamburger cost 27.5 Euros, or about $35 in American money. The main menu for the sit-down restaurant did not have a single entree for less than 33 Euros, with some much more. The salad course had to be ordered separately at outrageous prices. An unopened bottle of wine disappeared from our room. It was noticed right after the maids cleaned the room. My wife ran down the hall to question the maids, but they just played dumb. We think they must have taken it, but have no proof. In favor of the hotel, they did have a computer hooked up to the internet free for guests to use.

They offer guests an impressive selection of bars and restaurants then decide to close them all as the visitor numbers drop when a week or so out of high season but still advertise them when you make your booking. The net result is that you choose a hotel which is a 15 minute boat ride from the main area of Venice in the mistaken belief you have plenty of options for food and drink when you return. Further more I suggest guests forget the spa as we were unable to get any form of treatments in the entire three days as their staffing levels in the spa were so low.

The last day I wasn't feeling great, so we decided to take a vacation from our vacation and spend the day on the island. We played two hours of tennis (nice rackets and fresh balls provided by hotel) and lay by the pool for a while. The only reason I don't give them a 5 rating is because the place could use better maintenance. The grounds are a little scuffy (not much, but just enough to notice) and there are some scratches and nicks in the woodwork, some trash laying around. We wanted to start the day with a run around the perimeter of the property but some of the path was piled with old junk, etc. A 5 star wouldn't have this, in my opinion.

While this is a nice hotel, it is also an odd hotel.

Much of the time, we felt like we were the only ones there. We knew there were other people (because they came over on the boat with us), but they would just seem to dissapear. As an aside, it is quite a long (but pleasant) boat ride from the main area of Venice (near the Dogge's Palace) to the hotel. We found the desk staff a bit snooty, but the rest of the staff was wonderful. We had room service for several meals (we were exhausted...but restaurant options at the hotel were limited to one place). Room service was fantastic and the presentation was divine. We would probably not stay here again, just because of the odd feel to us. It is not something that is even easy to put in writing, but you know odd when you feel odd. None the less, we can't really say anything bad about the place. It was impeccably clean and well maintained, and had the masseuse not told us the asylum part, we would have never known.

The property is gorgeous! You feel wonder in the private boat and walking on the lovely grounds. Very clean and beautiful! The pool was a must for us and that is why we chose this hotel.

Those items above are the only reason! If you are looking for any decent service this is NOT the place for you! The price of the hotel does not include anything additional. The concierge desk was always empty, the front desk had one maybe two people working it. The worst part of hotel is the lack of amenities. My husband (as well as multiple other guests). Could not get water. The gym did not offer water, the bowl in the lobby was empty and my husband. Kept asking for over 2 hours, the pool only had bottles at the bar you could purchas for 8 euro. Another guest from the UK reminded me that what're should be a right to us. Not a way of making money. It's in the Geneva Convention for gods sake. The pool had one server and he was slooooow. There is no waiter walking around taking orders and even a three star in Mexico does that. I understand that air conditioning is different in Europe, but at such a nice resort you would think you get what you pay for, but no. Just cool air.definitely not the temp that I would set the thermostat at. Multiple guests had the same problem. There are multiple signs stating that this is A Leading Hotel of the world. Well they will be getting a letter from me because service was not included in the price of the stay. Internet only free in lobby and pool. You must pay in the room. Another guest was irate about this. Again. You are paying to be on the property, thats it! 2 diet cokes came to 14 euro. So again not a great price.

And I'm so glad that out of all hotels in Venice we picked this one. Yes the stay was not totally perfect and yes there were some issues about this and that but overall it was still magical. First of all I have to say that this was the only hotel (out of four we stayed in) where we were congratulated with our marriage and what's more were upgraded to a better room which was very pleasant and was so unexpected that I even forgot to thank the lady at the reception properly. Right from the start I was very impressed with their shuttle service which never gave any reasons to be disappointed that you were on an island instead of Venice itself. With this you have a wonderful opportunity to spend a day or part of the day in a noisy and crowded down town and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outskirt and then sale away to the peace and quietness of this wonderful island. Perfect combination! On arrival we had to wait a while to check in but it was not bothersome as the staff took our suitcases and we took a nice walk around the hotel grounds. The room was marvelous: nice furniture, huge marble bathroom full of light and a walk-in closet. Beautiful! The room was spotlessly clean except for the shower cabin though, which had spots of black mold in the corners. It was unacceptable and I should have stated this to management of course but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like taking care of it in those three days we were staying so we just took bath instead of showers most of the times. The staff was very polite, helpful and fast. One time we bought a bottle of wine in town and realized we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a corkscrew in the room, so my husband called to the housekeeping which sent a man to us in no time, like a minute at most. We were very impressed. Although I have to admit that, as mentioned in other reviews, during breakfast the staff once forgot to serve us coffee we asked for, not that it bothered us much, we just called another waiter and asked again, but indeed this should not be happening in a place like that. I agree. The restaurant with a seaview they have is totally amazing. Food is great, view is breathtaking, staff are very polite. And oh that sunset! Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in that hotel, just book a table in this restaurant, take a shuttle to San Clemente and enjoy amazing peaceful sunset over Venice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely worth it! Probably the only thing we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like were the mosquitoes on that island. Somehow the management of the hotel obviously does nothing to fight numerous mosquitoes. Obviously some kind of traps should be used in a restaurant, otherwise if guest don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spray from head to toe they get eaten alive, as simple and as true as this. And there should be some nets in the vent and some traps by the windows in the rooms otherwise people just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep properly.

Admittedly occupancy was 2-3 times higher than on our previous visits (never a good sign unless services can keep up with it) and this implied short stays by tour groups. Incidentally I wouldn't expect hotels to be run at economically unsound ocupancy levels but I do expect them to provide optimum service to returning customers. From the beginning we were struck by numerous examples of attempts at cost savings at the expense of client satisfaction (the most grotesque one being the discontinuation of supplying complimentary drinking water to the rooms). The hotels labels itself 5*L which should allow little gounds for complaints. The hotel with 200+ rooms providing 1 (one) computer for internet use for those not bringing their own laptops is also unsatisfactory. The pleasant poolside restaurant has been much reduced in size and the quality and choice of the food-at the prices charged-is inadequate. One has the impression that the hotel is searching for their business model. The property remains gorgeous and particularly suitable for a visit to Venice in the summer months but there is a deterioration in the levels of service which shouldn't be allowed.

Spooky? Bad service. Venice is Great.\u201d", "Author": "Mr_Vegas_OC", "ReviewID": "UR115189207", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a wonderful trip to Italy. We stayed at three of the hotels recommended on TripAdvisor, so I wanted to make sure I gave some feedback to others. Venice -- We stayed at San Clemente Palace. Now this is definitely a hotel where I have some mixed emotions. Let's start out with the good. If you want the \"Wow\" factor, this is the place to go. A 12 minute shuttle ride from St. Mark's takes you to a private island. You walk down a row of tiki torches to an old monastery converted into a hotel. The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms were beautiful. The hotel is almost a little spooky (have seen some Shutter Island / Shining comments) as you rarely see anyone in the hallways. It is very large and I got lost a few times my first day or two there. One night we took the penultimate shuttle ride back to the hotel in a storm -- it felt like a scene from an old mystery/horror movie -- but in a very cool way. So great atmosphere. The breakfast was outstanding, and my wife and I usually don't eat breakfast in the hotel when we travel as we tend to grab something on the go. But the selection was great, and it was served in a beautiful dining room. The bad parts were the service, which was more than a little disappointing. For a few examples, my wife asked for an iron to press some things, and they told here this was not permitted by fire codes (we did get an iron in Rome, so this excuse seemed kind of lame). On our way back to the train station, we reserved a water taxi. About 20 minutes into the ride, we thought he might be taking us to the airport instead of the train station, and we told him. He apologized and said the concierge told him we were going to the airport (we had plenty of time, but for someone that likes to cut it close, this could have been a disaster). There was also a bottle of water left in the hallway by our room that seemed to sit there for a day and half -- thought the staff would have cleaned it up. And on the night that I mentioned where we rode back in the storm, there were five of us on the shuttle. We all got drenched sprinting to the hotel -- it would have been nice if someone could have greeted us with some umbrellas. Admittedly, these are all small things, but the service was noticeably not the best, and the staff seemed a little stiff. The other thing I would say is to think about the water shuttle. On the one hand, it contributed to the very cool atmosphere of the hotel, and if you time it right, you shouldn't have any major problems. But there were a few instances where we forgot to check the schedule closely, or where we missed one, and you may end up waiting a half an our at St. Marks to get to the hotel. This can be a little frustrating. Note also that in order to get to the hotel when you first arrive you will probably need to get a water taxi (Euro 70 - 75), as it may be a pain to get the vaporetto to the shuttle and wait (could be 1 - 1 1/2 hours total). If you have a lot of bags and just got off a long train/plane ride, you will probably want the convenience of the water taxi. That being said, I'm not sure many other hotels in Venice are much more convenient, and we did see lots of people hauling around their bags through the city which was kind of funny. So all in all, would I go back? If I were going for a romantic get away with my wife or girlfriend, wasn't very high maintenance with regard to service required, and thought that I would spend a little more time on the island (relaxing poolside or dining at the restaurant) versus going into Venice, I would think again about staying here. But if I wanted something a little more convenient, required a lot of service from hotel staff and/or thought I would spend most of my time in Venice proper, then I would probably try to get one of the more upscale hotels around St. Marks as it will be much more convenient.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201c5 Star Facade & prices...3 Star Service & rooms\u201d", "Author": "Zephorla", "ReviewID": "UR115126917", "Content": "We stayed in this 5 star hotel for 3 nights in June 2011 as the first stop on our honeymoon in Italy. The hotel is located on an island in the lagoon with a very regular and reliable free boat service to St. Mark's Square. Unfortunately we were not entirely sure of the geography of Venice upon arriving and spent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 (a combination of 2 x \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 bus ticket and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70 water taxi) to get to the hotel. First impressions are that the hotel is indeed an impressive place, accessed as it is by the water to a well appointed jetty with a short walk to the front entrance. We were advised upon checking in that we had been upgraded and the helpful receptionist actually showed us to our room, which I can't recall ever happening to us before. It's just as well she did though as the Hotel is cavernous and you could quite easily wander around for an age without bumping into another soul. Our room was fine but no more than that although it did look back over the lagoon to Venice which was nice. We have been fortunate enough to stay in several 5 star hotels but the prices in San Clemente Palace were among the most extortionate that we have ever seen and we quickly learned to eat elsewhere and bring our own snacks to the pool (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac7/\u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 for small bottle of coke - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 for 2 cups of tea!!!!). I suppose they are aware that the have a captive audience, as it were, and can charge what they like. For a 5 star hotel the breakfast was lamentable and the service terrible. On every day that we were there we had to ask several times for hot water, the 'hot' food was always cold and on the one day that my wife dared to ask for some warm scrambled eggs she was advised that they could not do that unless she paid. On the positive side the shuttle boat to St. Mark's Square was extremely regular and punctual and is a very pleasant way to travel and the pool area was nice with a reasonably large pool and plenty of sun loungers etc. The outside pool and the open areas are the main reason that we chose this hotel as they were a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Venice.

At breakfast the selection was uninspiring and the service quite poor. ordered a latte and waited 20 minutes, finished my breakfast, only to be brought a tea. also we were told the boats would be every 15 minutes but on the weekend they were every 40 minutes so we spent a lot of time hanging around waiting to be shuttled back and forth. The grounds were lovely, but nothing else really made it special and ovrall we felt pretty ripped off.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTHE best place to stay in Venice by far.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR106934531", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 days.

Leaving the dock, you walk past lovingly-tended gardens, filled with large trees, a broad expanse of grass, and you face a lovely palace hotel. The San Clemente Palace hotel, having been restored eight years ago, places you in a setting that makes you feel like you wandered into a private palace. The staff makes you feel like royalty. Every aspect of this hotel is well-done and luxurious, yet, at no time, do you feel that you \"do not belong\". Most remarkable is the number of families with children--strollers abound. And, yet, there is no noise, no sense that you've wandered into a children's park. Everyone fits together--the guests, the staff, even the location is perfect--for honeymooners, conference guests (yes, they have \"meetings\") and, it's away from the bustle and crowds and pickpockets of Venice. Yet, you are no more than 10 minutes away via motor launch...and those run every 20 minutes day and most of the night. The breakfast buffet is lavish, fresh, and delicious. Service is outstanding. But, the San Clemente Palace Hotel in Venice has earned our unwavering loyalty, not only for what we've mentioned above, but for their dedication and success in finding an English-speaking sitter late in the evening to stay with my husband in the hospital, after he had fallen and suffered a mild brain hemorrhage earlier in the day. I had tried to find someone at the hospital, but had not had any success. Upon my return to the hotel at 8 pm, I received a phone call from the General Manager, Mr. Vicenzo Pagano, who asked if I would like to have him find someone to stay with my husband. Flavio, a member of the concierge staff worked diligently, and a kind lady showed up at my husband's bedside within two hours.

My two biggest gripes: 1. No free Internet access anywhere in the hotel. I really resent paying top whack for a hotel room, then paying extra for Internet access. Even the three hotel PCs in reception were chargeable wifi only. Seriously, how much would it cost them to hook those three PCs up to their corporate network? Internet access really should be free in a five-star hotel. 2. No complementary mineral water in the rooms. The mineral water in the mini bar was 7 Euros a bottle. Both of these things, in my humble opinion, should be included in the price of a five-star hotel room. I would not stay at San Clemente again purely because of these two things - I feel like they're trying to rip me off. Also, silly little things like the toiletries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just one small bottle labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shampoo / bath foam\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, no shower gel, conditioner, cotton buds etc. Other than that, the service was excellent, and the staff very well-trained and helpful, without exception. The hotel occupies the whole island, with large gardens, however they don't really make the most of this. The gardens aren't particularly nicely landscaped. The pool is lovely, and a real bonus in a crowded city like Venice. We were there in April, which was just about warm enough to sit out at the pool, although it was very windy in the mornings, so people generally only used the pool in the afternoons. The trade-off to the space of the gardens and pool is the 15-min boat ride to Venice, which is a pain. Another reason I wouldn't stay here again. The hotel does the best it can, by running shuttles every 20 mins, but it's still dis-spiriting to have to wait for a boat after a long day walking around the city. The hotel, due to its past, is very inward-looking (good for celebs looking to escape from the public perhaps??). There is a 3m-high wall around the whole island, the only exception being a terrace where you can sit outside at tables on the waterfront, with waiter service from the (rather expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c E9 for a Peroni, E6 for a Fanta) bar, which is really nice. The inward-looking theme continues in the rooms. Our room (367) was at the far end of the hotel, right next to the water. However, the rooms look inward to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (trees), and the corridor gets the water view instead. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help wondering why on earth they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the rooms on the water side, and the corridor on the garden side. It felt like all stud walls, so I think they could have done it quite easily. Some of the other wings of the hotel do have the rooms on the other side though, so perhaps we were just unlucky. The windows are very high in the rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sill being 1.3m high meant that you felt a little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153locked in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same in all the rooms. All we could see out of our window was sky and treetops! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really quiet at the hotel, despite having almost 200 rooms (I think?), and it was easy to get a good quiet night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The spa is good and not too expensive for a 5-star hotel (1hr massage = E100, 80min facial, E110). The fitness room is a bit rubbish though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very small, and WAY too warm, being located on a mezzanine inside the Jacuzzi room. Breakfast was fairly good, with a wide selection of items, all pretty good quality. Not the most extensive breakfast range I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen, but pretty good for a continental Europe hotel, and enough to keep us both happy. The coffee however wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really that good. My partner knows good coffee, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed at all with their offering.

Back then for 1 extra night apart from the conference I stayed at Luna Bagnioli in the very city center which was also great, but to start our vacation in Italy this time I had no doubts in choosing San Clemente.

Venice is astonishing and the hotel very comfortable. My husband and I stayed at the San Clemente for 5 nights at the beginning of September. We chose this hotel primarily because it has a swimming pool and good sized gardens. I was convinced that Venice would feel claustraphobic if staying in a hotel with no outside space during hot whether. I was very pleased with my choice because after sight-seeing there was nothing nicer than coming back and lounging by the pool. The hotel is on a small island about 15 to 20 minutes by hotel boat. The hotel's boat stops right next to San Marco so is very convenient. The boats are charming, and as I like boats, this added to the holiday. They run about every 20 minutes. Our room looked over the water to Venice. It was a beautiful view. The room itself was, as you'd expect, good quality, designed in standard international hotel style. It was very comfortable and attractive. Again, as you'd expect the bathroom was marble and worked well. The breakfast was excellent. There was lots of choice, both hot and cold, and everything was attractive and good quality. We used the hotel bar on several occasions. Expect to pay about \u00c2\u00a318 in total for a beer and a prosecco. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. I would happily return. Prepare yourself for high prices for the room, the drinks and the meals.

I will go into details, but overall the front desk and concierge were rude and incompetent, the rooms were shabby and dirty and the atmosphere is more like the mental hospital that it once was than the hotel that it tries to pass itself off as being. From the moment that we arrived we were unhappy. We had traffic getting to the hotel from Florence and did not get in until 9:40 pm. We originally had a 9 pm reservation at the hotel restaurant. The concierge told us that if we were not seated by 10 pm, that they would not serve us. After getting our luggage, we rushed to dinner and made it by 10. While we were sitting in the restaurant, several parties came in after us, one even arrived at 10:30. We were upset that we did not even have time to freshen up or change before dinner. The hotel has a strange appearance and creepy feeling. You never see any people even though it is quite large. The hallways are enormous so there is no charm or warmth. There were red stains on the carpet in the main hallway leading to our rooms and half of the large lanterns used as lights for the hallways were not working. It reminded me of Shutter Island and the Shining wrapped up into one hotel/hospital. We learned that it was once a mental hospital that was closed because of inhumane treatment to its patients. Our rooms were also not what we expected. The bathrooms were dirty and the shower grout and tile was missing in spots. The furniture was dingy. In the bathroom there was one sink and the toilet was almost in the shower. When you showered, there was only a trickle of water coming out of the spout and the water temperature kept changing from hot to cold. The toilet never flushed properly. July in Venice is hot and our air conditioning did not work. It would not go below 22.5 degrees celsius. We found out from someone else staying at the hotel that you needed to ask them to lower the air conditioning for your room at the main computer. We did, and it worked for our room, but did not work for our children's room. After complaining all day about the heat in my children's room, at 12:30 am, the maintenance man admitted that the air conditioning in that particular room never really worked properly and asked us if we would like to switch rooms. At that time, 2 of our 3 children were sleeping, so we did not change. On our last night, we arrived back to our hotel room after dinner and one of our windows was open. We are not sure why the housekeeper opened it, because it was oppressively hot outside. However, there was a rain storm that night and our packed bag that was sitting under the window was drenched. A Louis Vuitton clutch (a gift for my husband's mother), 4 watercolor paintings we had purchased of Venice, and my son's movie poster were all ruined. The bag was soaked, as were the curtains and the carpet. We called down to the concierge to complain. The concierge, the only person on duty at the hotel at night, barely spoke English and said that there was nothing he could do to help us. Housekeeping was closed so they could not even dry the bag. The hotel never apologized or offered to do anything to make up for the damage. When we finally left the hotel, the bill was incorrect. They tried to charge us inflated rates for both of our rooms. We showed them the written confirmation from our travel agent, and they lied and said that they had sent her an email changing the rate. We called our travel agent who confirmed that they had never changed the original price. My husband, fed up from our whole terrible experience, gave them his credit card, but told them that he was not paying the higher fee-he would take it up with the credit card company when we got the statement from them. When we went down to the dock to get into our water taxi for the airport, the hotel kept the water taxi at the dock and would not let us leave. They essentially held us hostage until my husband agreed to pay the inflated rates. We almost missed our flight. It was a terrible experience. To pay so much money to stay at a hotel like that is insane.

Its location, on an island in the lagoon, a twelve minute boat ride from San Marco, seems to be its major selling-point and, initially at least, it's great to escape back to the hotel after the crowds of high-season Venice. After a few days however, I found the to-ing and fro-ing a teeny bit wearisome, despite the glorious views everywhere and the highly efficient shuttle service on the hotel's private launches i.e. you can't just pop out for an impulsive stroll round the city as you could from a more central hotel; it becomes a slight expedition, albeit a pleasant one. The hotel buildings are VAST and slightly austere with endlessly long corridors and, despite the extreme luxury of the transformation, it is easy to see the ghost of the huge hospital it used to be. It could never be called an intimate hotel. I'd rather like somebody to bulldoze the existing edifice and create something on a more human scale. By contrast, the gardens are exquisitely landscaped with a beautiful pool , a family of tame rabbits and fantastic views out over the Lagoon in every direction. There is also an impressive semi-restored church attached to the hotel and an outside waterside restaurant for summer dining which must be one the loveliest places to eat anywhere in the world, looking across towards the campanili of Venice. Our room was very large, impeccably decorated with excellent beds, loads of hanging space and a massive and luxurious bathroom. I notice another reviewer commenting on the old-fashioned TV set. Who cares? You're in Venice; go and look at a Titian instead. The staff were all very friendly and extremely professional - a delightful group of people. The San Clemente is undoubtedly extremely expensive. At the pool, a tiny bottle of Perrier (three gulps and it's gone) was 5 euros. A club sandwich with fries in the bar was 24 euros (intrinsic value about 2 euros I'd guess) And don't have the room service breakfast - for 22 euros, I got ONE teabag and five very sad-looking rolls - by bizarre contrast the buffet breakfast downstairs is generous enough to keep you going till dinner. To summarise, I really enjoyed four days there. One would have to be a spoiled brat not to do so. It is however very expensive and the island location, however much of an oasis from the crowds, I personally found to be a double-edged sword.

Loved that the hotel is on a private island. Venice is very crowded and it was really nice to be able to be away from it for it a bit. They knew it was our honeymoon and when we got to our room (a junior suite) a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us. Our room looked faced the lagoon with a great view of Venice. It was a great way to start a visit to Venice....which we loved. We arrived to Venice by train and took the vaporetti (water bus) to San Marco. Once there, we located the shuttle to the hotel, about a 20 minute ride. My husband at times gets motion sickness and I was a bit worried about having to take the shuttle to/from San Marco, it was no issue at all and we had rain everyday in Venice. Our rate included breakfast. There were eggs, breakfast meats, rolls, pastries, cakes, cheese, yogurt, lots of fruit. They also had a gluten free and diet section. There is something for everyone. They also have prosecco by the juices....I made a mimosa everyday. One reviewer mentioned that it wasn't opened. I only experience that one day and I asked one the the wait staff to open it. Think I may have been the only one drinking it that morning. There was plenty of staff and they were very attentive, getting coffee/cappuccino, clearing plates. The grounds are lovely to walk around and at night the path to the water shuttle has torches lit, very nice to come back to after an evening in Venice. The pool was opening the week after we were there so we didn't get to use it, but it looked nice. Our room was very nice... junior suite with a king size bed. Bed was comfy and the room quiet. I like to take a relaxing bubble bath, the tub was deep and filled up pretty quickly. We were traveling in Italy for 2 weeks and didn't want to pack a lot. I didn't bring a lot of toiletries, I used the ones provided by the hotel and they were very good.

Had a junior suite room via Amex with the rate of 390 Euros, which included breakfast buffet plus 85 euros hotel credit (credit per stay, not per night). Positives: The property has very large and beautiful gardens. The setting was simply fabulous, with the gorgeous hotel buildings. This would be the strongest point of this property. And the property is very quiet. Good relief from the hustle and bustle of Venice. Pool was closed in April so we can't provide any comment on it. Welcome fruit plate with some chocolate on arrival (along with a welcome card from hotel management) was of good quality. 5 star service. A small bottle of water was provided -for free- for each guest everyday at turndown service, this is just a normal 5 star service though. Hotel bar was wonderful. Very good ambience with great quality of drinks, aside from its cheap BGM (a bit too casual I felt). My husband says he had his \"best daiquiri ever\" there. The lagoon view from the room was amazing. Also the great point of this property. Negatives: Room- it was good-sized enough, nicely appointed, with a large walk-in wardrobe/closet. But speaking of the room category, the room wasn't of a 'junior suite' class but just a normal 'deluxe room' which you'll expect when in 5 star hotels. As a deluxe room in 5 star, it was very good I must say. But a junior suite?? No. Wrongly labeled. Also, there was no DVD player nor iPod connectivity in the room. The TV was not with large screen and was of outdated. We also didn't like the fact that no coffee or tea making facility was there inside, no mug cup was there even. So inconvenient and disappointing. It's not a 5 star again. But later in Milan, we found the same was true with the room of the Four Seasons Milan!! WHY was that, Four Seasons?? Perhaps this might be an Italian hotel standard, since they don't care for 'regular coffee' I guess. -Sorry if I'm wrong. Internet- The pricing was very expensive. About 15-20 euros per 1 day but I forgot the exact fees, sorry. The truth is that the internet service here is managed by Vodafone Italia. Therefore, the hotel doesn't accept any responsibility for any internet malfunctions or pricing. We also didn't like their way either. Anyway, when you try to use internet in the room, you'll be firstly connected to Vodafone web page, which explains the fees and conditions. Also you'll have to type in your credit card info for the settlement. This means you can't make it included in the bill of your stay. In Tokyo, almost all the 4-5 star hotels provide internet service for FREE. So we really didn't like such a high pricing, but, later in Milan again, we found it was even higher in FS Milan than in San Clemente... Breakfast- I agree with all the negative comments about the breakfast buffet. To us, the biggest problem was the quality. Not tasty, just mediocre. Far from 5 star's quality . Even as a 4 star hotel, it would be 'only just par'. After the first breakfast of our stay, we totally gave up the idea to have dinner/lunch in the hotel. We also didn't like the fact that the buffet selection was never changed during our stay; same pastries, same hot meals, same cheese selections for example. It's not a 5 star hotel again! Speaking of Prosecco, Italian sparkling wine, yes there it was - but we never saw the bottle uncorked during our stay. So, just help yourself or wait for someone, or have someone to uncork the bottle. Bathroom- Beautiful marble bathroom with a separated shower booth, however, we didn't expect a single basin when staying in the 'junior suite'. And so, it didn't have enough space for putting make-up items on. But the main problems on the bathroom were; 1) Shower was very weak, and sometimes wasn't hot enough at all. 2) The hair dryer was out of date and immovable (fixed to the wall). Hot air from the dryer was also weak, plus you'll have to keep on pressing the button to get it on. Service- Just hit and miss, overall. Tips: City/Hotel map is provided on the writing-desk in the room. Very handy and convenient. But if I were hotel management, I definitely would print the shuttle boat timetable on it... Don't forget to get the timetable at the concierge before you go out. Curiously enough it wasn't provided in the room. WHY?? Perhaps you might have difficulty in locating the jetty to the hotel (means the shuttle stop, from Venice to the hotel). You can see the image of the jetty in my pictures. Here's the more details how to get there; From the nearest Vaporetto or water-bus stop (named San Marco XXXXX), you'll walk for just a few minutes to the jetty. Please remember, if you come to the Ducale Palace, you've already gone too far. If you find the shuttle jetty for the 'Hotel Cipriani', which is much easier to find, you just should step back. Look around and you'll find a small wooden 'TAXI' station/stall(see my picture 10/10) nearby the Cipriani jetty. The San Clemente shuttle boat stop is located a few meters away from the taxi station, a few meters away 'to the direction of' the Vapporetto stop. All in all, I would call it 'a good 4 star hotel with great potential to be 5 star' , as in the title of my review. The location and the settings (both gardens and the buildings) are really unique and fabulous, just right for a 5 star level. However, if the hotel remains just the same, in particular about the breakfast, we might look for another 5 star hotel next time. When all is said, it was very good hotel for the price we paid. If it were a real shining 5 star just like Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton or whatever, you'd not be able to stay here at this price range in Italy.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Honeymoon Days\u201d", "Author": "FZaluski", "ReviewID": "UR63892975", "Content": "I was planning my honeymoon trip using the Trip Advisor and I've found the San Clemente.

Even the drinks have different prices, and you might order the same wine or prosseco from the restaurant cheaper than the Bar, even if you're seated at the bar (ask for the menu from the restaurant).

So the answer is to stay at the San Clemente Palace, located on San Clemente Island just 5 mins across the lagoon from Piazza San Marco. It is on the island by itself and used to be a cloister. The rooms are large, the property offers every amenity, and it is a quiet and peaceful escape from the noise and the crowds in Venice. They offer complimentary shuttles to and from the Piazza San Marco every 1/2 hour - 24/7 and will provide you a complimentary shuttle to the glass factory on Murano. (skip the tours to that include Burano and Torcello, there's nothing to see on those islands). The buffet breakfast is excellent and offers a wide selection of breakfast items including juices and prosecco (Italian champagne). The bar inside the hotel is a great place for a nightcap and the patio bar and restaurant next to the lagoon are a great place for dinner and to while away the evening. At dusk the hotel lights torches along all the pathways on the island and its an indescribable sight when you return from Venice on the launch and walk from the dock to the hotel with the path lined in torches. The hotel also offers a beautiful pool, which you can't find at any hotel in Venice island. After a morning in Venice, its nice to come back to the San Clemente Palace and take a cool dip in the pool and relax before returning back to Venice for a gondola ride.

The reason I am writing this review on my very first night instead of waiting till I return home is the fact that already in one day I am deeply frustrated with this hotel. I cannot believe that this hotel is rated 5-STAR and voted the \"best hotel experience\" by some notable travel surveys. It is beyond my comprehension to connect this hotel with luxury. The rooms, the service, the benefits - is all tantamount to 3-star at best. It's OK to be OK but don't say you're amazing when you're just alright!!! To start with, I arrived after a brutal red-eye flight from the US and could not wait to get to my room. But the people at the reception desk themselves escorted each guest to their respective rooms instead of hiring people to do this. This \"luxury escorting service\" caused a hold-up at the reception where people (including myself) had to wait until others were shown their room before they could be checked in. The next thing that hit me were the large lifeless corridors with no artwork, and - better still - NO PEOPLE. Looks like this hotel is not doing that well (rightfully so) as there are not many guests here at all - and they've shut three of their four restaurants! Then the room itself. Archaic television, old-fashioned furniture (under the veil of being charming), boring drab room design, no iron, no coffee machine, no free internet! What's more, they offer a ironing service at 35 euros for a suit. Room service and internet are equally expensive. The poor guest is left with little choice but to pay these high rates for standard services that one would expect even from a 4-star hotel, leave alone 5-star. This is extortion in the disguise of luxury. As icing on the cake, the air in my room did not work and I wanted the AC on. So I called the front desk and they SWITCHED OFF THE AIR IN MY ROOM. The explanation - no hot air so this will cool your room !?! More so - when I got back from an evening excursion around Piazza San Marco there was a huge flying bug waiting to welcome me in the room. It took some acrobatics to catch and kill it. With regard to the much-tooted about swimming pool - it is open only a few months every year (during the summer). So it pretty much did not exist for me. The gym was extremely basic. I still have to check out the \"free\" sauna / turkish bath but am not expecting anything out of the ordinary there. How then does this classify as luxury!! Here are some good things - the free shuttle service to San Marco every 20 minutes is convenient. But they have to have it in order to compete with other better 5-star hotels in the heart of the city. The concierge was polite and informative. The bathroom was all marble and very clean. The view from my room was nice. But weigh these against all the cons and you have an average, midscale hotel experience.

The hallways are REALLY long, the ceiling are REALLY tall and its very quiet inside. I booked it through lhw.com and received an upgrade to a fantastic room with super comfortable beds. My biggest complain about hotels these days is how thin walls are and how easily noises from other rooms and hallways can be. I didn't hear anything from other rooms. Its as soundproofed as you can get. The breakfast buffet as the hotel is unbelievable. The selection of food was so diverse and delicious, I am drewling right now just thinking about it. Make sure you try the freshly squeezed orange juice. The one drawback to this hotel is that its a 15 minute ferry ride from St Marks Sq. The ferry runs every 30-40 minutes during the weekday and during weekends I think it runs more frequently. On the other hand, its on its own private island, secluded and quiet. I liked that they had good quality umbrellas to borrow when it rained. It came in very handy when it just completely poured on one of the days. I ate at the hotel's restaurant one night for dinner, and it was on the expensive side and not that great. In fact, I found the food in Venice to be mediocre at best. Go to Florence, Bologna or Rome if you want good Italian food. Hotel had wi-fi internet in the room but be prepared to pay an arm and leg for it. Also, try not to ever take water taxi's in Venice. They are ridiculously expensive. Also if you come from the airport and take the Vaporetto, when you get off the stop in St. Marks Sq, go left when you get off the Vaporetto to find the hotel's ferry.

Our overall opinion is that it must be one of the best hotels in Venice, with helpful and friendly staff, but who are not overbearing or pretentious, good food and a fantastic setting, and as others have said an oasis of tranquility and well worth the extra cost over more ordinary hotels. We will definitely return to Venice one day and would not consider staying in Venice itself as it was far too busy and hectic, and will return to the San Clemente Palace, which we would highly recommend, and provided you are not going to nitpick over minor faults or worry too much about the relatively high cost of rooms and food, you will enjoy it. Apologies in advance for the length of this review, but I have included the things that I would have liked to know before I went. Getting there Although there is the vaperetto from Marco Polo airport to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, which I would suspect takes at least 30 mins and gets very crowded, and then the San Clemente Palaces\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 private boat to the hotel we were advised to book a private water taxi. Looked at various on the web and many wanted to charge euros 300 for the return trip, but made an enquiry at www.motoscafivenezia.it , who are a consortium of taxi operators with more than 100 water taxis, who quoted euro 105 each way or euro 200 return, about \u00c2\u00a3180, which we booked plus 20 euros for private minivan to save the 8 minute walk from the airport to the water taxi pier. Arrived 1 hour 30 mins late due mainly to flight delay, met by Motoscafi, driven to water taxi pier, straight on to water taxi and a high speed, sometimes bumpy ride, felt like we were in a James Bond movie, direct to San Clemente Palace in about 30 minutes. Return journey picked up exactly on time. From our experience would highly recommend Motoscafi, but if you book with them they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an online payment system so I paid over the phone, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ring their main number on their website as no-one speaks English, but spoke to Mario tel no [--] who was very helpful and took my payment and. San Clemente Palace Hotel First impression on arrival very good, friendly welcome at the boat dock, luggage taken for delivery direct to the room, quick and courteous check in, escorted to room, with commentary about the hotel on the way, deluxe room no 413, a pleasant 3 minute stroll from reception, with a view straight across the lagoon to Venice and St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for more. The hotel is on a private island and used to be a monastery and has extensive grounds, swimming pool, two tennis courts, 3 hole chip and put course and a beauty and wellness club. Our room was elegantly furnished, comfortable bed, two armchairs, writing desk and chair, cupboard with ancient CRT tv, only one English channel, BBC World News, but watched Arsenal v Wigan as it was the live game on Sky Sports, with Italian commentary. The air conditioning worked well and was reasonably quiet, with the ubiquitous minibar and the normal expensive drinks, but surprisingly no tea or coffee making facilities, so if you want a cup of tea or coffee first thing in the morning, you will need to take your own travel kettle, tea, coffee etc. Good size marble bathroom, with separate shower, low water pressure, and bath, bathrobes, slippers and good quality toiletries. Reasonable amount of hanging space and drawers, but possibly a bit tight if you were staying for a week, with a safe, no charge for use, and Wi-Fi hot spot, but surprisingly for a relatively expensive 5 star hotel you have to pay to use it, a bit mean in my view. Housekeeping was excellent with tooms serviced twice daily and bed linen and towels changed daily. The interior of the hotel is very elegant, see photos on various websites, with high ceilings and was relatively cool despite the outside being quite warm, with lots of chairs and sofas spread around and a number of small sitting areas, could be accused of lacking atmosphere but we found it tranquil and quiet, which after the hustle and bustle of Venice was most welcoming. Breakfast is taken in the Gli Arazi rooms, but as the weather was warm/hot and sunny most guests had breakfast in the adjoin courtyard, no view but still very pleasant. Breakfast is typical of a high quality European hotel, with cereals, breads, cheese, meat, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon etc with fresh orange etc and even Prosecco if you want to that early in the morning. Staff very friendly and helpful and all food good quality and plentiful. Only ate at the hotel on one night at the Ristorante Le Meschere, booked a table and glad we did as they were full and had to turn some guests away. Our table was next to the water, in the courtyard to the small San Clemente church/chapel and was lovely setting for a meal. The main gourmet restaurant Ristorante Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122dei Frati was closed. Wide ranging menu, my wife had home made ravioli filled with sea bass, clams and clams sauce and zucchini, and I had fillet of beef medallions from the grill served with baked potato and vegetables, which together with one glass of Pinot Grigio, one bottle of water and one coffee, came to a bill of euros 84, about \u00c2\u00a375, which by Venice standards is not particularly expensive and which for the location and quality of food and service was excellent value, especially as it included a very nice Amuse Bouch of fried tagiatelli with mushroom sauce and a glass each of Prosecco. The swimming pool is very pleasant, freshwater not seawater, and is quite large, with lots of sun beds, towels etc and we presume that it is heated as the pool temperature was very comfortable to get in and not at all cold, and is a most enjoyable retreat when returning from Venice, which was packed to the rafters when we were there. The pool is next to the Ristorante La Laguna for lunch and snacks and the bar Le Conchigli for drinks, but both are relatively expensive with soft drinks, tea, coffee or a beer costing about euros 8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10, about \u00c2\u00a38. When we were there the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motor launch, which I believe can carry about 30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 40 people, ran every 20 minutes starting on the hour, both from the hotel and from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, and is a 12 minute, not 5, 10 or 15 as suggested by others, enjoyable ride through the lagoon, probably not taking much longer to get to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square than from many Venice hotels, but a lot easier, and was very reliable always leaving exactly on time. It runs 24 hours a day, but from about 1.00 to 5.00 am it is by arrangement and not the normal day schedule. The view of St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Venice when arriving on the motor launch is unforgettable and probably a good enough reason in itself to stay at the San Clemente. There was a good mix of guests when we were there, with different nationalities, a fair percentage being English and Italian, and age groups, mainly 40 plus but a nice sprinkling of younger couples, some with young children, which contributed to our most enjoyable stay.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLike The Shining with good food - bizarre stay!\u201d", "Author": "UpgradeQueen", "ReviewID": "UR43179678", "Content": "We had an almost surreal experience at this hotel.

The staff were amazing - all very attentive and the breakfast staff remembered our name from the 2nd morning onwards which we thought was very impressive given the size of the hotel. I read with interest the reviews which say that the hallways of the hotel are spooky and hospital like and I could not disagree more. They were beautifully decorated and spacious and not at all spooky. The chandeliers were amazing! Our room was fabulous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very high ceilings and a view of the canal. I had let them know it was our anniversary and they left champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room for us on arrival which was a great surprise.

It either runs every 20 minutes or 40 minutes throughout the day/evening. There is a schedule of times that they give you when you check in. We did not eat in the restaurant at the hotel at all (except for breakfast) and ate in town every night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the concierge was very helpful and recommended places to eat and was happy to book them for us. My husband was concerned that we would miss out not being in the thick of it but we both agreed that being a 10 minute water taxi ride away was not a problem at all and we would stay there again if we returned. Hotel gym and spa were closed on random days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although when we wanted to use it they opened it for us and left us to it! This hotel is one of only 4 that has a pool in Venice and as we were there in the summer this made a massive difference. It looks very small on the website but is a big pool with around 100 sun-loungers around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough for everyone.

Positives - the staff were very friendly but I didn't feel they communicated well internally as I had plans to go to the Cipriani and the Concierge said the shuttle would drop me off the Cipriani and then head onto Venice San Marco - but he didn't. So I had to wait for the Cipriani shuttle which is on call 24/7 - and it took 5 mins - that's service!! The Hotel itself is beautiful but very sparse - it used to be a mental institution and still has a touch of that atmosphere to it - think The Shining. Long hallways, white walls...kinda creepy if I was by myself. But I am exagerrating, it was lovely. The pool is great but definitely made for the average sized European, not Asian. I had to stay on a last step like a child so I didn't drown. They have one lovely Cabana Type bed and personally i think they should get more. Good looking pool boys though. Negatives: It felt like it didn't refurbishment. The flush was sort of broken as after you did flush, the water kept running. We got a Junior Suite which was nice but I didn't feel it was worthy of that title. The water pressure in the shower wasn't strong enough and the tv in the room was really small and old - not what you would acquaint with a Junior Suite. It is on a separate island to Venice which sometimes is nice cause when you leave to go back, you leave the tourists, etc all behind but having said that it is a shuttle like a bus and if you miss it then you wait another 15-20 mins for the next one unlike the Cipriani.

We had been many times before that and thought it was time to introduce our daugher - first checking that it was not high tide. Remembering Venice and the standard of food (poor) rooms (small) cheap hotels (terrible) we decided to spalsh out to \"guarantee\" some of the things we can now afford. First thing. Venice was just as beautiful and in some respects even better than we remembered. We found some great food in new places (la calcina for lunch) - and our old \"cheap\" favorite \"Alla Madonna\" was still noisy, bustling, rude and good quality value seafood. (You cant book but hotel managed to do this !) Even at Easter weekend the crowds were not too bad. The shops are more upper class chains than we remember and gone were most of the individual little shops. The idea of taking a posh hotel taxi to your private island is fantastic. Its really great being away from Venice and the crowds at the end of each day. We found the staff very good - the concierge was very helpful. The manager was also good. The room we had ( a junior suite) was plenty large enough - but furnished more like a conference hotel. New but not good. However bed was comfortable. Shower was weak. Agree with previous comments about the souless hospital feel and characterless corridors. The BIG disappointment was the \"Easter Dinner\" that we had in their lagoon view restaurant. I don't think we've ever seen such chaotic service and disappointing food. Given that they had pushed it so hard we were really looking to our 7 course menu overlooking the lagoon. Each course was supposed to come with a different wine. The overworked staff couldnt cope with the full restaurant. The wine turned up when we complained or someone else compained and they took opportunity to fill up others. They even ran out of glasses ! The foos was dumped down on the table by a sweaty stressed waiter. The food degenerated as the courses progressed - and the eventual main course of lamb loin was basically ALL fat. We think the chef had given up by the end of the meal or more likely has run out of lamb. It was so disappointing. The F&B manager was very apologetic the next morning and clearly cared but not so much as to offer any reduction of bill etc. He probably knew we wouldn't be returning. We didn't make a big fuss but this was one of the truly worst meals that we had ever had. We don't excatly know what went wrong - maybe they were not ready for a full house ( the hotel is very quiet in the evening) and I hate to say this - maybe they charged too little for the meal - charge more and deliver. This place is good to get a guaranteed big room and some space and breath outside Venice. Its a lot cheaper than the some other great hotels which trade on their reputation. The dinner (and breakfast too crowded) were bad. The staff were generally professional but not the established top quality hotel kind. We can't say that this was a waste of money as really it is quite reasonable as a 4star in venice and at least the room is big. We also think that the dinner disaster was a blip that would be corrected. Stay here if you want a comfortable hotel with a big room in Venice.

Food was good and excellent value for money (around 200 euros for two) compared with lesser quality cuisine on Venice mainland. Breakfast was included in our room rate and served in a pleasant dining room with an oval buffet arrangement in the middle. The selection of food was alright but nothing special; the space around the food felt a little pinched. On request, the concierge will organise a free trip to Murano to see the glass makers in action at a few minutes notice. A water taxi takes you there and back (if you were paying it would cost about 50 euros each way) and on arrival you are met by a pleasant representative from one of the factories. You will be given a fifteen minute demonstration of glass making by a small group of artisans and will then be invited to view various galleries displaying the work of the master craftsmen. It's stunning stuff but be warned, nothing costs less than a couple of thousand euros. Once you've sheepishly admitted you're not inclined to spend that kind of money on an impulse purchase, you'll be taken to the shop at the exit, where you'll be so relieved to see more modestly priced items (and remembering that you're dependent on your attentive host providing free transport back to the hotel) that you'll happily spend a couple of hundred euros buying a token something.

Bad stuff - Hotel is very expensive (both to stay in and also be in). Food and drink options are very expensive in the hotel. I understand that 5* luxury hotels are pricey but this really embraced the Venice culture of charging very high prices that almost leave you feeling mugged.....20Euro for a regular run of the mill beer. I have to add though that the food we had in the hotel restaurant was excellent but overpriced. OK - so the mental institution bit.....although it is called a palace it never has been, it is very much like an institution. Bars on windows, internal courtyards (no escaping!) and when walking around the gardens you cannot help but notice the high walls and no views....again - don't want you escaping :) I found it all a bit creepy and my new wife had nightmares. Long empty corridors certainly make you feel like you have a palace to yourself but it also reminds you when you hear the echo on the floors and the hospital feel that it is not a palace. Very luxurious comfortable rooms, attentive staff but wouldn't return to this hotel.....and if you want luxury and not bothered about the history I would certainly visit.

We got a private boat transfer from Marco Polo airport (the only way to do it in style and without getting stressed) and from the moment of arrival were impressed with the location, the hotel itself, the room, the grounds and the staff. The interior of the hotel has been beautifully decorated and the long corridors simply add to its sense of exclusivity and tranquility. The room itself was lovely with a view of the manicured gardens and the lagoon. It was very clean and we had our complimentary bottle of Prosecco waiting for us. Being March, a majority of the hotel's added features were closed such as the outdoor swimming pool and restaurants but they make this very clear on their website and it certainly didn't affect our stay in any way - in fact, I can't wait to go back in summer so we can have a completely different experience of the hotel! It is very easy to hop on the shuttle back and forth to St Mark's Square and it's a lovely little boat ride so it isn't a problem. Besides, by the time you've experienced the hustle and bustle of inner Venice you can't wait to go back to the peace and quiet of the San Clemente. The concierge were absolutely brilliant - very welcoming and fun and they made a real effort to make our stay memorable. The spa was very nice - we spent a lot of time basking in the double jacuzzis and turkish bath whilst we were there. The breakfast was lovely, very continental which is perfect for us but if you do like a good fry-up then you may have to order off the a la carte menu. We didn't try the restaurant whilst we were there purely because we'd never been to Venice before so we wanted to try places outside but if we had stayed an extra night then we would have gone as the menu looked excellent.

There was no tea /coffee making facilities. / no UK TV channels - why? / no iron / no heating when it had turned a little cold overnight ... Beyond the room there was no indoor pool and the outdoor one was closed (this means that there are no swimming facilities for the majotity of the year). The vast long corridors leading to the ridiculously expensive restaurant and the very low key health centre - this is suppsed to be 5 star! - combined with large vaulted ceilings and drab light fittings made it feel like an institution rather than a hotel - impossible to disguise that it was a monastery in days gone by!! If you do not relate cost to value then you will willingly accept the extortionate charges for everything from bar snacks and drinks to room service tea (14 euros for a tepid pot of hot water and a couple of t bags!!) but charging a lot of money does NOT make this a luxury hotel!! The boat shuttle in and out of the city was very reliable and easy to use but after the first few rides the novelty wore off and there was nothing to see or do at the hotel in the evening meaning a trek back to the city by boat (15 mins) which made us wish we had booked in the city despite it being busy and full of tourists. Overall we would not book into this hotel again- it was disappointing. We loved Venice - would probably not choose to go at a weekend again as the huge blocks of flats called cruise ships disgorge zillions on passengers into what is already a heaving city making St Marks and streets around practically unnavigable...

Location comes first. Venice is outstandingly beautiful, but it's also claustrophobic, crowded and exhausting; to me, the city is best appreciated in a series of short, sharp bursts. And that's where the San Clemente Palace scores - it's only 10 minutes by free shuttle from St Mark's piazza and a short taxi ride from anywhere else in the city, but it's a haven of peace and tranquility. You can spend the morning in the city, return to the pool for a few hours to escape the heat of the day and then head back to the city in the cool of the evening. Few other Venetian hotels offer that perfect combination. The best way to arrive is by water taxi. It costs EUR100 from the airport, but you didn't come here for a cheap holiday. You certainly don't want get off to a bad start by battling the crowds on the vaporetti or looking anxiously for the unmarked jetty near St Mark's piazza where the San Clemente shuttle boat docks. The taxi ride takes about 30 minutes and gives you magnificent views of the Venetian skyline - quite apart from the convenience, the fare is fully justified by the enjoyment of the ride. We were immediately taken care of when our taxi pulled in to the hotel. Our luggage was promptly offloaded and taken away while we strolled through the beautiful gardens toward the deserted reception area. Our deluxe room was upgraded to a suite (our package offered an automatic room upgrade, subject to availability) and the helpful receptionist escorted us to our rooms and talked us through all of the hotel's features and services. The hotel and the room were magnificent - serene, spacious and elegant. The decor skillfully mixes traditional and contemporary design elements, generally understated with exquisite detailing, and everything is maintained to a very high standard. Our room was large and light with an enormous bed, and the marble bathroom was similarly spacious with a separate toilet, two sinks, a walk-in shower and a bath. Earlier this year I stayed in a so-called 5* hotel where my entire accommodation would have fitted comfortably into the bathroom in the San Clemente. We used both principal restaurants in the hotel, and both were excellent although neither was cheap. The gourmet C\u00c3\u00a0 dei Frati caught me out (along with several other guests) as it does not permit men to wear short-sleeved shirts, but the maitre d discreetly found me a jacket to spare me from returning to my room to change. The food was delicately refined, both in flavour and presentation, and the atmosphere intimate and formal without being stuffy. We also ate in Le Maschere. Like all the diners that evening we ate outside near the water's edge and enjoyed the nighttime views across the lagoon. The menu in Le Maschere is much more typical of northern Italy and the flavours are correspondingly more robust. My wife and I both slightly preferred this restaurant but we would regard either as being outstanding if it were transported to our home in Wales. Both restaurants share an extensive wine list, although, unlike other parts of southern Europe, rose wines were very scarce with only two listed. Prices started at around EUR30 for a bottle. Against this excellence, breakfast was slightly disappointing - pleasant enough but typically unmemorable hotel fare. Service was perfect at every level throughout our stay. The closest we came to bad service at any time was when my wine glass was allowed to remain empty for about a minute. When I moved to refill it the waiter realised his error, called an apology across the restaurant and literally ran to correct his mistake. His evident embarrassment at such a tiny incident demonstrates the standards that the hotel expects of its staff. The pool was very quiet, especially around lunchtime. The staff there were very attentive, greeting us with towels and periodically rearranging my parasol to ensure the shade remained exactly in accordance with my wishes as the sun moved across the sky. We left by taxi. As I had by now come to expect, our bill was correctly calculated and waiting for me on my departure. We arrived at the jetty five minutes ahead of schedule, but our luggage and the taxi were already waiting for us. Perfect. Will we return?

This booking was made thru orbitz and was prepaid. When we checked in on Aug 29th, we explained this to clerk and a credit card guarantee was provided. The problem started on Sept 1st, the morning we had to check out. We had a 11:23 train to catch from Venice station to Rome. I went to the front desk around 9:35 requesting that I need to check out. There were two ladies at the check out counter. At first the lady told me that there was nothing to check out since everything was prepaid. I said no I had no prepaid for two days and I needed a bill in any circumstance. She said she would not be able to give me a bill since everything was prepaid. I asked her to check once more. She said she would prepare a bill. Meanwhile i had requested for someone for help with my luggage from my room. The luggage was picked from my room and left under the staircase.So my husband had to go behind the guy for the luggage. In between there was another guest who came with some questions and the other person at the front desk was attending to her. The lady who was supposed to prepare my bill, went to listen to her. Finally at 9:55 one of the ladies gave me a bill. She did not ask me to provide my card again just gave the bill which I thought was final,since my card was already on the records to charge to. I went to shuttle boat to catch my 10;00 Shuttle so I could reach the station in time. But at the gate , I was detained by the security saying that I had not paid my bill . My bags were removed from the shuttle. So I went back ot the hotel . This time, I talked to a different gentleman . He immediately relooked the bill had in 2 minutes got my card and gave me a receipt . This time the guard let me through. but the shuttle which i needed to catch the train had left. So not to mix the train I had to take a water taxi and pay 70 Euro extra. The whole morning routine was frustrating . I have no idea why it takes 25 minutes to check out someone with two people at front desk and two people total in the queue.

Before arriving at the hotel we asked for 2 junior suites to be on the top floor next door to each other as our children are aged 12 and 15 any problems at least we would be nearby. We arrived at the hotel by their own shuttle launch after receiving detailed explanations from the hotel on where it would be by St Marks square no problems at all, the boatman was absolutely brilliant in helping with our cases etc, we used the shuttle a lot during the 5 days in which there were different boatmen, each one showed the same level of curtesy to myself and my family. We arrived at the Hotel docking area and was met by the person that was in charge of all boats docking and dropping off their cargo or clients, our luggage was identified and was waiting for us in our rooms no problems at all. At the reception area we were welcomed by a male staff member unfortunately his name escapes me, but his level of care and detail does not, even showing us up to our rooms (and yes we did get what we asked for previously) and pointing out some hotel features on the way, so we thank you if you are reading this. The rooms were a delight and no problems at all in appearance everything that we expected from a 5 star was there except for tea / coffee facilities it was lucky that we had brought with us our trusty travel kettle. The same time that we were staying at the hotel there was a Society wedding and reception (Tamara Beckwith) taking place which did interfere with my sleep on the 27th as outside by the church end their was a stage that was built for bands etc, unfortunately the music rebounded into our rooms the thud thud thud of the beat, so at 1.20am I phoned the duty manager he was not there so I left a message with one of his staff to ask him to call me, 1.50am I phoned again to ask why the duty manager had not phoned me and was told \"dont worry sir he will phone you in a few minutes\" at 2.30am I wrote out a letter to the General Manager to complain about the lack of respect that his duty manager was showing me in not returning my calls re the noise. About 9am I delivered my hand written note to reception went off for breakfast and then to St Marks square, unfortunately due to the lack of sleep we returned early to the hotel, where upon we had found out that the General Manager had called a meeting with the relevant staff and asked his operations manager Luigi to contact us which he did, the outcome was that the Hotel aplogised they had assumed that by placing us in the rooms we would not be disturbed by the music, they apologised for the lack of respect shown to me by one of their managers and what could they do to rectify the problem, the upshot was that my family and I had a superb evening meal with ALL drinks free of charge so I must say my complaint was handled very very quickly to my satisfaction. Everywhere we went within the Hotel be it the breakfast room, restaurant, swimming pool, shuttle boat, reception, concierge, in the hallways, the staff were brilliant, always polite. We stay at 5 star hotels on a regular basis, this hotel is my wifes favourite and wants us to come back again for xmas so our experience all in all with San Clemente was a pleasant one.

This was a short stay of only one night. When we went for the boat to the island we had the problem that the boat jetty doesnt have any obvious signs that it is the correct place. The boat driver wa courteous. When we arrived the receptionist was very friendly and we had a nice chat. Our room wasnt ready yet (we were a little early) so we decided to have a little stroll around the hotel. The American bar looked very nice so we stopped for a drink. It was reasonably priced for a hotel of this category and the service was prompt and friendly. So far we were quite impressed. We checked in around half an hour after we arrived and our room was nicely decorated (paintwork on the walls was a little scuffed but this didnt hamper my opinion of the room). The bathroom had everything I would expect in a five star hotel, the toiletries had their own labels. I read an earlier post which mentioned they had no hair conditioner - this must have been rectified as we had some in our room. Prices in the minibar were steep but we expect it in hotels like this. We used the spa (the lady looked surprised to see anybody) which we had to ourselves. There was two jacuzzis, steam room, sauna and relaxation area. There were no changing rooms (just a toilet which surprised me as I dont like to get changed in a toilet cubicle) but there were lockers. There was no availability of water to drink which also surprised me. We then went to the pool (the walk through the grounds is lovely) but found it very shambolic here. The lifeguard was in the middle of cleaning out a cupboard with piles of random things everywhere, so didnt look like she was the person to see for keys for the lockers (or to get pool towels from) but she was. It took a while to realise that. The atmposphere at the pool wasnt the best. People were smoking on the side of the pool and not using an ashtray which is a bit offputting. Also, there were alot of children jumping in and out of the pool - not the hotel's fault though, and this would be a good thing for families I am sure. Just a small thing that irked me was that a family arrived who wanted three sunloungers together facing the sun, while we were in the pool. The lifeguard came and moved our sunlounger (with our things on it) along to accommodate them, but in the process moved our loungers out of the sun, not so accommodating to us. Turndown service was a bit poor - I'm used to getting a little gift but they only left a bottle of warm water. Restaurant for breakfast buffet was not impressive at all. The room was tiny and had very little space between the tables, therefore we had no privacy as both tables around us were occupied. And there were small things that werent right, like there were no small spoons to eat the yoghurts with, and there was no butter to be found when I was looking for it. They keep it in a big basket away from the breads and it had run out. Very odd. The choice was ok, not great but ok. It is worth mentioning that the staff were very good (except the lifeguard) in particular the concierge, receptionists and the restaurant, but everybody was pleasant and anyone you met in the corridor would smile and greet you with a friendly word or two.

The floors have enormous ceiling heights, so my guess is that even a regular room would feel spacious. The pool area is terrific.

As you will have read, it has its own island, which is a very pleasant 15 minute ride in their luxury, air-conditioned, two cabined boat (the journey time is halved at night when they tend to ignore the very tight speed limits). The boat leaves from right in front of Gardini Reali, which fronts St Marks Plazza - it couldn't be more central. It is also about 20 yards from the San Marco Alilaguna stop - which is the public transport from the airport (although our recommendation is to really consider the very expensive, but sooo much cooler water taxis from the airport to the hotel. Some of the Alilaguna public bus boats only have closed windows that are very dirty from sea spray - they take ages, and for groups of four or more the price difference starts to narrow - it's the one thing we'd have done that we didn't). The boat is very punctual, and if you miss it then there is another in 20 minutes - and given you will either have St Marks Plazza or the hotel's beautiful grounds to wander around while you wait - well, you might find yourself like us, sometimes missing it on purpose! On arrival our bags were carried to reception as we walked up the pathway through the beautiful wooded grounds to the entrance. We arrived late evening, and there was only one receptionist, so we had to wait a little - but that was the only negative experience with the hotel the entire time. We received an upgrade from the standard room to a deluxe, and ended up in a beautiful room on the top floor, with views over the grounds and towards Venice (see my photos). The room was perfect, stylishly furnished, a strong Venetian feel, but not over the top. Comfortable bed, cabinetted TV with good films and usable internet access with an infrared keyboard. The room also had wifi internet access, which appears new. A very nice bathroom with huge shower (pressure was fine, if not very strong), large bath and a delightful set of bath and shower gels. We had very comfortable robes and slippers, and to top it all, a chilled bottle of champagne with a personal greeting from the staff was waiting for us. The room was prepared twice a day, once in the morning, usually while we'd been to breakfast, and then the beds were turned down in the afternoon - very nice. Breakfast was superb - an excellent range of everything you could hope for, cereal, fruit, continental and cooked (including perfect scrambled eggs - a good thing to judge the cooking by) There was also a bottle of bubbly (to make bucks fizz each morning with the freshly squeezed orange juice), prompt service, and lovely outdoor courtyard if you prefer to sit there. On our first night we went a little crazy and ate in the top restaurant, the C\u00c3\u00a0 dei Frati. It was the best meal we have probably ever eaten - and one of the most expensive. The waiters were charming, knowledgeable and kept just the right balance of attention and leaving you to yourselves. We went for the fixed price 'Gourmet menu' at 110 euros each, plus wine starting from about 30 euros a bottle (or 10 a glass). This five course meal ended up at about eight courses, as the chef prepares various little surprises that the waiters bring to you with large smiles. The food was superb - and as I looked at the prices, it was only perhaps 20% more than the 'casual' restaurant at the hotel - Le Maschere, which others said was very good too. What C\u00c3\u00a0 dei Frati also has however, is possibly the best view of any restaurant in Venice! Located the top floor of the hotel, in a timber beamed room (it used to be the drying room of the monastery's laundry) it has HUGE windows that look out over the lagoon and Venice beyond. Make sure you book so you are there for the sun setting - it was unforgettable. The pool was lovely, we snatched some time there on our last day. Very clean, a good temperature and set in beautiful grounds just outside the hotel. They have started doing evening barbecues there which seemed to be the best value eating at the hotel. I had a quick trip to the (free) spa which had a nice sauna and turkish bath area, plus two large jacuzzis. I didn't see the small gym upstairs. Massages start at around 40 euros I think. The concierges were excellent, confirming our tour of the Doges Palace for us (search the forums for the 'Secret itinerary' tour details, it was a great behind-the-scenes visit for not much extra than the normal entrance price). They also recommended an excellent, classical venetian restaurant owned by a lovely couple, called Osteria Oliva Nera, not far from St Marks, which was delightful for our last night. I can't recommend the San Clemente Palace highly enough.

The umbrellas do not protect very well against the sun. I got burnt despite being in their shade. Contrary to what others have posted, the tennis courts are excellent. One is hard court, Green Set type, the other is synthetic grass. Both are in excellent repair and the nets are fine. As others have mentioned, food and beverage are outrageously expensive. I confirm, a small 2dl Coke costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7. However, all the tourist areas in Venice are also exorbitantly expensive. Compared to other places, and given what's on offer, the San Clemente seemed almost reasonable. We were sad to leave the San Clemente after a week's stay. The taxi to Piazzale Roma costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70.

It is absolutely ideal as it is set on it's own dreamy island only 10 mins ride on glamorous (complimentary) boat to the centre of Venice itself. The room we had was with the most spectacular view across the water to San marco itself (no other view like it in Venice as it's so tightly packed). The best view is from a slight distance with the sound of tolling bells across the water. The sense of 'escape' after a day trekking around the twisting turning tourist packed streets of venice is such a welcome relief. The use of the spa is complimentary (and the staff gentle, attentive and caring). If you have your huge breakfast and then go straight to the spa until after midday you virtually have it to yourself as everyone else is huffing it around Venice. I'm tremendously body conscious so to me this was total heaven - I didn't have to worry about my cellulite once!I I recommend hitting Venice mid afternoon after chilling in the Spa and staying in Venice for Dinner (if you can afford to but I recommend eating in the hotel). The staff at the Hotel are marvellous. There are complimentary things you must ask about such as a FREE boat ride to Merano (glass factory) provided as part of staying at the hotel - you practically speed boat it to Merano in 15 minutes like a movie star on the deck of a boat! ...(but you have to get the vapouretti back - who cares - not I). The foyer, seating areas, bars and restaurants are absolute heaven, really tastefully decorated with big fluffy pillows and leany things. BIG TIP: We learned that is is about the same price to eat IN the hotel restuarant in glamorous settings as it is to eat IN Venice (where you WILL BE RIPPED OFF horribly - average, basic meal 50 pounds for two) and the ambiance is like a greasy egg and spoon caf in most places! The newly opened top notch silver service restuarant at the hotel is HEAVEN with views of venice in distance - you can eat eat there if you have two courses as there are lots of 'compliments of the chef' dishes between courses. Three courses are for 'millionaires, Rodney' - but well worth it I'm sure. The waiters are lovely as they are polite and charming and flirt with you slightly even if you are ugly. Everything to the constant supply of fuzzy slippers and robes (used in the Spa and rooms etc) to the marvellous food and courteous and professional staff will make this a holiday of a lifetime whatever your age (looks and financial situation).

We stayed during peak season and did not mind the shuttle to and from St. Mark's (actually it was better than staying in Venice proper as far as I'm concerned, since you avoid the traffic and noise). I think the longest I ever had to wait was about a half hour (and this was very late at night when they don't run as frequently- in the event you miss the last shuttle of the night, a phone call to the hotel will send a shuttle to come get you no matter what time it is!). Usually the wait was only 5-10 minutes, and there are benches nearby if you don't want to stand to wait (there are also street artists with their works for sale right nearby if you feel like shopping to kill those 5-10 minutes). From there you are a 2-minute walk to St. Mark's Square and about a 30-second walk to Harry's Bar. Water taxis and vaporettos are also right there. The shuttle takes about 10 minutes and it's a beautiful, scenic ride. Don't get offended at the boat driver half-yanking you to help you into and out of the boat- they just don't want you going in the drink. The rooms (we stayed in the classic rooms and a few friends stayed in a classic suite, which was large and excellent) were not overly spacious considering their price tag, but definitely had enough room for 2-3 people to negotiate within it. The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous, marble throughout. Deep marble tub and separate shower stall, bidet. Housekeeping kept everything immaculate. Watch out for the minibar prices, I think a can of Coke was something like EU 7. Free shoe-shining service if you stick your shoes outside the night before. All the usual and expected commodities were there for a 5-star (fridge, pay-per-view, writing desk, stationary, bath robes, slippers, very nice shampoo/soap/etc). The suite had a scale, separate closet/changing area, complimentary fruit/chocolate plate, separate bedroom with sliding doors, couch, table and 2 chairs. All rooms had beautiful cathedral ceilings and huge windows (that often did not have views but at least had something pleasant to look at outside). Staff was friendly and helpful enough, some were more accomodating than others but all gave professional service. The only problem I had with them is that messages that were given from the U.S. for me sometimes did not get relayed to me (only 1 message of the 3 came through to me, and that was only after I called regarding something else and was told 'oh, by the way, so-and-so called for you'). The English is not 100% (or even 50% with some staff members) and I feel this may have contributed to the problem. If you have difficulty walking you should try to request a room close to the main entrance as this is a HUGE property. I got lost every single day trying to find a friend or family member's room, no joke!

The price of food is very expensive. On arrival I got a club sandwich in the bar which cost me 25 euro! for a plain ham and cheese its 15! A 3 course dinner in the middle-priced restaurant with the cheapest bottle of wine cost us 190 euro! Needless to say it was delicious but a little expensive! The boat to venice was regular and always warm which was great. Staff were very friendly which was nice and they were very helpful. We would definitly stay here again at the drop of a hat.

Nice touches included bath robes and slippers and even bookmarks by your bed. They do a turn down service where they put the lamps on and leave a bottle of water beside your bed. The hotel decor was really grand and it was decorated beautiful for xmas. The only thing was it was really quiet which is not a minus to us but the bar area (which is really nice) was always empty. We loved the breakfasts there and found that the fresh fruit, cerals and cooked breakfast set us up the for the day, meaning we did not need a lunch. We also visited the spa once and had it all to ourelves ( although i did not have a treatment).

We were deciding between staying at the Hotel Gritti or the San Clemente Palace. After reading the inconsistent reviews and looking at the photos of the Hotel Gritti's room on this website, we decided that the San Clemente Palace would be more up our alley. Both times at the Excelsior on Lido, we went in late spring so the weather was nice and there was daylight savings so the sun didn't set til pretty late each night. We've never come to Venice in the winter before. Anyway, the room was very well-appointed and had great furnishings. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which I wasn't sure was a suite because it was one big room - quite different from the pics on their website. It looked more like their deluxe room. It was spacious and felt luxurious. The best part was that it felt new and well-kept. Likewise, the bathroom was nicely appointed with a separate shower stall from the tub. I felt that this room was far nicer than the rooms that we had at the Westin Excelsior. The free buffet breakfast was fine - nothing special. A spread with eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, bread, cereals, fresh juices, etc. There was absolutely no variety but this wasn't a problem since we were there for a few days. We didn't try either of the hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them. The service was very mediocre and disappointing for this level of hotel. I find that my experiences with the hotel staff in Venice is disappointing in general. They just weren't helpful - seemed to be an almost alien concept. Most of the staff just stood around, especially the front desk staff and the concierges (with the shining exception of Alessandro Heinrich who was GREAT!). When I asked about the weather for the next morning, the concierge on staff said that he didn't know. I hadn't realised then that the hotel leaves a notice with the next day's weather by our bed. If the hotel had that information, why didn't the concierge?! Also, on our last day, I asked if we could have late check-out; I was offered 12pm. That is normal check-out time, and the annoying thing was that the hotel was probably only half-full, if that. Because of the weather (rain and wind), it was not ideal to stay at San Clemente Palace. We opted for this because we had done this before and really enjoyed the experience of staying away from the hordes of crowds on San Marco. However, we didn't anticipate what a pain it was to have to wait for the hotel's complimentary boat in the rain. Getting on and off the shuttle boat during high tide or rain was not fun - if you have limited mobility or are elderly, this is not the place for you during winter. Starting last week, the boat was on a 30 minute interval schedule so less convenient than the 15-20 minute intervals that we experienced on our 1st day there. I would recommend this hotel for the summer when all their resort facilities (e.g., pool, golf course) can be enjoyed. In the winter, probably more of a pain than it's worth. BTW, the long corridors were fine - they weren't ornately decorated, but was by no means sterile. I found it quite simple and tasteful. Who would want to have the hallways of the Overlook Hotel?! For the record, I seriously doubt that there is any spirit roaming here contrary to one of the previous reviews - this place is NOT haunted.

We booked a private taxiboat to go from airport to San Clemente island : amazing views and unusual exciting experience!! Arrival to the palace was very welcoming and smooth from the boy on the pier to the reception staff. Young man at reception was quite strict but extremely professional. He proposed to upgrade my parents to a large suite with view on San Marco. I was so happy for such gift to them. San Clemente Palace is beautiful, relaxing and luxurious. Nice swimming pool is a big big plus for a hotel in Venice. Rooms and suites are very large and nicely appointed. I have to say I am much more in contemporary minimalist-asian design style, but those rich, colored, decorative furniture, clothes and lightings are so nicely fitted with building and setting that it didn't bother me. Two minor negatives: - I didn't like so much large and very long corridors which give impersonal feeling, but I loved impressive stairways. - It is a pity there is no benches on the green area except at the entrance of the building. My parents liked to walked on the small island, but they could not have a sitting for a rest. Otherwise, we have only very good memories with San Clemente Palace: - the Palace is perfect for those seeking escape from hot and touristic jams in downtown Venice - Free shuttle boat from hotel to San Marco is great experience - Reception staff, concierge, breakfast staff , pool boys were very nice. Wd could sometimes feel that some young people were somehow inexperimented but they were always very smiling and helpful. - Food is great. - Setting is unique - Sunsets are beautiful - Swimming in the pool during very hot weather is brilliant I do recommend this hotel compared to other \"not enough space\" and stuffy hotels in Venice.

I looked for a five star luxury hotel in Venice and the San Clemente seemed a very good deal, in comparison with the price of a (little) room at the Danieli or at the Gritti. Due to his situation, on an island in the lagoon, remote from the agitation of San Marco, the San Clemente is both very quiet and most cheaper than the others five star luxury hotels.

When I reserved at the concierge desk the table in the Ca Dei Frati restaurant, I asked for a special dessert with candles as a surprise for my wife and I received a: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153of course but only for 2 people because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept children in this restaurant!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Because I booked the package for 3 persons, because there is no indication of that on their website and because I had no intention to drown my son in the lagoon in order to have dinner with my wife, at this very moment, I began to loose my temper a little!

The building is imposing and the grounds well maintained. The pool area is beautiful and the bars, restaurants and lobby are fantastic in terms of their furnishings and presentation. Staff are generally very pleasant and the complimentary boat service is very very good in terms of promptness, frequency and comfort. But there are too many problems wih this hotel to allow me to just agree with some of the glowing reviews on this site. First off, I will just say that I took my partner away for a week to Venice for a romantic break, not a honeymoon or anniversary. Therefore I did not feel like the stay had to be absolutely perfect but in the end I was quite suprised at some of the fairly basic problems with this hotel. The corridors are indeed (as has been pointed out in some other reviews) cold and underfurnished. They have far too strong a resemblance to the corrdors of the mental hospital that formerly occupied this building. The lobby and communal areas are very well presented and furnished to a high standard. Why could the same not be done for the corridors? The answer is that, in a five star hotel, it should have been done. Our room was big but not huge. The bathroom was again big but the marble was of poor quality and the secondary shower did not work. There was heavy scuff marks on the skirting boards and the heavily obscured view of a tree laden courtyard was very, very disappointing. I realise that not all rooms can have lagoon views and would have been happy with a garden view. What I wasn't expecting was a great deal of daylight to be excluded from the room due to dense tree foliage being yards from the window. None of this is acceptable for what was a deluxe room at a five star resort . Nor was a smirking concierge, understaffed restaurants and bars and broken guest computers. With regard to the understaffing in the hotel bars and restaurants, I had a casual conversation with one of the barmen one night and asked him about the delays in service and foodin the day time. He informed me that the hotel seem to routinely place 1 or 2 staff in bars and cafes that require 3 or 4 staff to maintain an efficient service. They then still see fit to charge highly extravagant prices (even for Venice) for this poor service. He said that he felt it was unprofessional and was leaving at the end of this holiday season. This is not a bad hotel. It just has too many problems to make it an excellent one. You get the overwhelming impression of a paper thin 5* facade behind which there is not enough quality of service. That said, it does seem to be somewhat cheaper than similarly rated hotels.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Viejo, California", "Title": "\u201cSan Clemente was Top Notch\u201d", "Author": "travelernottourist", "ReviewID": "UR5488121", "Content": "After researching many hotels in Venice, Italy, my husband and I decided on trying the San Clemente Palace. The rate we got for 2 nights in May was excellent for the quality of the room, services and grounds. We paid $335/night, which is for a 5 star experience not a bad price overall, especially for Venice. It was our 20 year anniversary so we had to splurge before our Med Cruise. Our room was for a standard double but it was hardly basic. The linens were luxurious. The draperies were velvet and sumptious over floor to ceiling windows. The marble bath is quite spacious with walk in shower and sunken tub. Separate toilet area - very nice amenities. Lots of closet space and room is large. I opened the windows and we caught a beautiful breeze from the surrounding water. We had a lovely corner room with a good view of part of the island and water. It was peaceful and quiet. Breakfast was excellent with a good selection of cold meats, cheeses, eggs, bacon or sausage, pastries, juices, rolls, coffee, etc. We took our breakfast out in the courtyard and enjoyed the ambiance. We ate one lunch at the poolside restaurant and it was quite good if straightforward. We enjoyed the convenience of the San Clemente's boat which was reliably available every 20 minutes every time we went down to catch it either at the hotel's dock or the pier near St. Mark's Square. Note: when we arrived to airport we found that there is a direct Allilaguna boat that runs directly from the airport pier to St. Mark's Square (no stops). This was I think 25 euro each vs. 10 euro each for the regular boat. For us, it was worth it because this direct boat was not crowded, very comfortable and far cheaper than taking a 100euro private taxi. Faster too without all the stops along the way. We were tired and wanted to get to the hotel. Also, this boat drops you off right next to the dock for...you guessed it, the San Clemente Palace hotel. This is a very special hotel; although expensive it is not as expensive as others more famous such as the Cipriani, Danieli and the like. I don't think anyone would be disappointed. We have stayed in many Ritz Carlton's and Four Seasons in the US and Mexico - this is on par and perhaps a little nicer than any of these other 5 star properties. Note: the photos on the hotel website are very accurate. The property is gorgeous. Funny though...every where we went Venetians pointed out just before property turned into a hotel, it was a mental hospital for women. They don't advertise that since more famous as a former monastery.

The hotel is a former monastery and retains the grace and elegance of the original building. We stayed in a very nice room at the front of the hotel, looking out over the gardens and towards the bay. You could not see venice, but the view was still wonderful. The room itself was extremely luxurious, with a big and comfy bed, rich furnishings and a great marble bathroom. Each room is equipped with a tv which has a few english language channels, and apparently also has internet connections (though we had no call to use them during our trip). The toiletries provided were of excellent quality, and repeatedly replenished throughout our stay (sometimes twice a day). We had one problem, in that the air conditioning was not properly working on the first night. Given the heat in venice during july it made that night rather uncomfortable, but after some complaints to the reception the problem was fixed and the temperature was perfect for the rest of our stay. The other problem was that we arrived at the hotel rather late, having taken a water taxi direct from the airport. This meant that the kitchen had closed and we could not even get a snack at the hotel bar. We had to settle for room service which was fairly limited and extremely pricey. However, they were the only faults we could find. The breakfasts were delicious and extensive, the pool was very well maintained, clean and at a perfect temperature. The grounds were also lovely (though my boyfriend did complain that the gravel from the paths got into his sandals) and the old church was particularly beautiful. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants (apart from at breakfast) since we wanted to go into venice but one of the main restaurants is located just outside the church which always looked very romantic as we passed in the boat on our way to and from the hotel. The hotel boat is an excellent service, it runs every 20 minutes on the dot to and from St Marks Square (apart from after 11.20 when it starts running every 40 minutes). It takes about 15 minutes and although it can get fairly hot, standing out on the deck is very pleasant. The hotel is very peaceful and quiet (probably not great for party animals) even though there were plenty of kids about. It means that going into venice, which is absolutely heaving during july, isn't such a trial. However, it is a relief to get back to the peace and quiet, and air conditioning, of the hotel. Advice for venice would include not using the water bus to get to and from the airport. Water taxis are very expensive (about 100 euros) but well worth it. However, if you can't stretch that far then get a coach from the bus station. The water bus to the airport is a really unpleasant experience - you can't see out of the windows, you are sitting below sea level and it gets very hot and busy. Plus it takes about an hour, whereas the coach takes about 20 minutes. However, I would recommend using the water buses within venice, which are great fun and you get to see the sights of the grand canal without shelling out for a gondala. Wandering around the streets of venice is great fun. We didn't actually go into many museums because of the queues but the campanillo was good (particularly since the breeze was lovely and cooling), and we also went to the academia - full of medieval religious paintings and not much else. You have to search for restaurants that are anything out of the ordinary, but there are good value places out there which serve good food. All in all it was a wonderful trip.

We had obtained a good rate of 600 Euro/nite or so for a Classic Suite with Lagoon view. Here are the pluses and minuses (however tiny) of our stay at this hotel: The San Clemente Palace is really on its own island. It's fabulous if you want to get away from the maddening crowds of San Marco and the Grand Canal. There's nothing on the island but the hotel - a former convent - a mini golf course, a lovely abandoned church, and the parklike grounds. Absolutely beautiful, except humorous hubby remarked that it appeared slightly like a mental institution in the early 1900s. I've got to hand it to him for that one; the hotel does have that ''sanitarium'' look to it, at least exteriorwise. Also, the pool area is a bit barren, due to the landscaping being very recent and the trees still quite young and short. The common areas, however, are quite glamorous, yet discrete. Nothing overdone. Tastefully positioned antiques, Murano chandeliers, plenty of light. The restaurants are very appealingly done and I'd schedule a wedding here or a large scale public event any day. And, in fact, the San Pellegrino Cooking Cup was held at the hotel during \"our\" weekend. To the credit of the hotel, we only saw participants in the cup as they landed with the shuttle boat. Otherwise, we had the impression we were the only ones there. Our suite did have a view of the Lagoon, however, the vista of San Marco et al was quite small. The windows of the suite remain unaltered from their nunnery days and are on the small side positioned quite high up. There were no French windows or terrace doors, which limited the view when sitting down and looking out. The suite itself was extremely well planned; there was a large dressing room, a big hallway/anteroom, a huge livingroom and a big bedroom. Furnishings were elegant if a bit boring. What are Victorian armchairs doing in Venice? The room was in some way a little too \"soothing\" and without character. There could have been more paintings on the wall, more interesting antiques (or repros for all that matter) which would have given the suite more warmth and magic. Everything was simply \"too beige\" and too \"institutional,\" even if elegant. The bathroom, curiously enough, only had one sink and was on the small side. Shower pressure was iffy. Toiletries were ETRO, not that great. Very perfumey, I wouldn't use them. I prefer natural products, even L'Occitane is better. Nevertheless, we liked it and since it was our wedding night plus, we were content and happy. What wasn't so great, which we soon found out, was that at this time, THERE IS NO BROADBAND OR WI-FI IN THE ROOMS. We were given some kind of modem number, but absolutely no information as to passwords, ISP or other technical info. When we complained to the concierge, he did this characteristical Italian shrug and told us to use the public computers - 3 of them for 200 rooms. We were watching them like hawks, and when some hogging teenagers finally got off, we pounced. We also discovered that the computers (the public ones had broadband and were very fast) were very much available in the mornings. Still, it's a detriment to such an elegant hotel. They couldn't tell us when wi-fi or broadband would become available. But this is typical of Italy. Some things work flawlessly, other things don't. We lived with it, anyhow, but it was a bit of a pain not having one's own laptop for access. As to the food, it was truly flawless. The breakfast buffet was very good and had a variety of items. We also had dinner at Ca' Dei Frati, their premier restaurant on the third floor, overlooking the lagoon. Truly splendid. We're hoping the chef gets a star in the Guide Michelin, because he's worth it. His preparation and execution was every bit as good as at Osteria da Fiore, where we ate our first night in Venice. They've got one star and I'd recommend them as well. Aside from the computer issues, the concierges at the San Clemente were extremely professional and helpful. I do speak Italian, so I don't know how they handle other languages. But it seems that they converse with equal ease in English, Spanish and French. They were very prompt in booking our restaurants, our wedding luncheon, faxing credit cards long before we got to the hotel, etc. Highly recommended. The spa is typical of a luxury hotel and the technician who gave me a body scrub was charming, spoke excellent English (she's from Brazil) and did a great job. I had her apply fake tan in addition to the services requested and she did it very well. Didn't charge anything extra and was very meticulous. As to the free shuttle to San Marco and back, it was prompt and a nice ride every time. Unless you're willing to wait the 20 minutes for the shuttle during daytime and every 40 minutes late at night, be prepared to shell out $80 plus for each time you want to leave or come back to the island. In three days, we ended up spending roughly $800 on just water taxi rides. We never did go on gondolas (and you can't to the hotel, it's much too far) because we were surrounded by the silence on our island and we didn't need any extra quiet riding the canals at night. But we walked the side streets and we noticed that the crowds didn't bother or stress us out, since our hotel was so quiet. The only time we saw people was during breakfast, but otherwise, it was free from noise. We'd recommend San Clemente Palace for an over-the-top wedding with loads of guests (we got married at the Palazzo Cavalli and had our FANTASTIC wedding luncheon with guests at Harry's Dolci on Isola Giudecca) or for those seeking solitude on their own. Yes, it seems paradoxical, but there was a wedding on the grounds and we only saw it in the distance...didn't hear one peep. The grounds are that big. If your taste runs to the more dramatic in terms of furnishings and style, you'll be disappointed. I'd suggest staying at the Danieli or the Cipriani Hotel with Palazzo Vendramin, also a fantastic hotel (but at twice the price) on Isola Giudecca. Will we go back to the San Clemente? Probably not. It was perfect for a wedding or a wedding night, but next time we'll probably for a suite at the Palazzo at the Bauer. More designer drama, plus you only get married once, right?

But bad surprise when arrived at the hotel. We were actually very disappointed by the quality of service and a bit by the ambiance. Sure it is a majestuous and historical building, located in a unique place in Venise lagoon. But what a cold ambiance there ! Of course the building was initially a monestary, transformed afterward into an hospital. But the problem is elsewhere : spaces, corridors and rooms are definitely too big and ceilings too high to create a well-balanced and friendly p(a)lace. To be short, despite luxuous facilities and materials, the transformation of this former monestary into a palace is not very convincing. But the worst is the service. When we arrived, the A/C was out of order and the room was frozen. That can happen but you can expect from a 5-star hotel to find generally a solution within the day, by repairing the facilities or by proposing another equivalent room, or upgraded one sometimes for compensation. It was not at all the case. We had to wait two days to have another room and A/C has never been repaired despite several claims. Thus we were very upset. As reception desk didnt feel responsible at all, they did't appreciate our negative reaction and show it by saying first we hadn't to forget that we benefited from reduced fare by internet and second by refusing to provide services at the end of our stay (carrying luggage to the shuttle boat for example): incredible attitude from such a called Palace. Finally, I recommend this place for old and rich people only, who have paid the full price !

The staff, who were very patient with my attempts at Italian, (even though they spoke perfect English) were polite and throughout the stay, ever helpful.

Clean cool sheets and numerous fluffy towels every day, and everywhere spotlessly clean, The Chandeliers are stunning. Breakfast was excellent, with a large selection of everything you could think of, and we were greeted personally every morning. After a busy day walking around Venice, which is charming,but very busy, even in March,it was a luxury just to catch the boat back to the Hotel,no pushing or shoving as on the local boats the 10 minute journey, not too far from the maddening crowds, but far enough to let you unwind and relax or use the Spa before returning back to Venice. The boat leaves every 20 minutes, and I felt safe enough to travel on my own to go shopping in Venice once or twice.

Most of this reviewers were very lucky to be up graded to Jr Suite, or get a bottle of free champagne.

First of all, I did research the price on Hotel web-site and Leading Hotel's site which prices were little bit different for same type of room. In order to leave an evidence what I asked, I sent a fax to hotel and I got reply 5 days later, which is not a 5 star standard. Then I mentioned that your reply made me worried, then some hotel reservation staff said that they never received my fax to make a excuse. Their correspondance was the most slowest in my experience of 5 star hotels. For example, Santa Caterina Hotel in Amalfi reply within 1-2 hours and they try very hard to reply. Then when we arrived the hotel, door man at the pier was very friendly and welcoming, but at the front desk, the lady never smiled for 3 days even when we pass each other. This lady took us to the room and as I already read some review, she never explained serving time for breakfastand and the restaurant location in such a big place. (I think this is the basic explanation when you showing around the guest) So, I had to ask everything including where is the spa and fitness centre. All other 5 star hotel I have stayed were showed the facilities and opening time and I believe that the staff have never worked for 5 star hotel before so that they don't know how it should be. (sorry again Hotel Santa Caterina in Amalfi, all staff even cleaner and gardener never ignore you. they always greet and of course hotel front desk never missed whenever we pass and they always call our name and they are so friendly) I was mostly disapointed by the food in the evening, because everyone on this review said that it was good meal. Some of them were far too salty and not edible. Then there were hardly any meat in ragu pasta. My husband's meat was chewy and not tender how it should be. The couple next to our table were strongly complaining to the staff that their fish were very dry and hard. I am sure that they use frozen fish, not a local catch. If you love food and you think you are gourmet, don't eat there. You will get disapointed. There are more restaurants in Venice which serve more authentic food. The food in Hotel is really arranged for tourist and we were not happy about thier standard of quality. The room was beautiful, but since we booked Jr Suite, I thought I will get a separate lounge which other 5 star hotels normally provide, but just little bit bigger than normal room. However, cleaning ladies works very hard and everything was so clean,tidy and spotless. Concierge was great and very friendly. All of them are always greeting us with big smile and tried to help. They are the star. Shuttle service was excellent and we were very happy to chosen this hotel due to canal was very narrow and crowded. The hotel location is not bad as you think.

It was tastefully furnished and there was plenty of space. The bathroom was very good. We were on the end of the hotel near the church, which gave us a great view across the lagoon back to Venice. One word of warning if you are staying in early autumn (and possibly late spring). Apparently, an Italian energy saving law does not allow the heating to be turned on until 15 October. Our room got very little direct sunlight and so was quite cold. We complained but were told, due to the law no heat could be provided. The staff were polite and sympathetic, but were constrained by the law. In the end we gave up the great view and moved to a room on the front of the hotel that got a lot more sun and so was much warmer. The hotel concierge desk was very helpful. They really know their stuff. We explained that we wanted to visit Murano (famous for glass blowing) and asked which trajetti/water buses to take. We found out that one of the glass manufacturers would send a water taxi to take directly from the hotel to Murano and back for free. (When we arrived there really was no obligation to buy and we could come back when we wanted, so could visit other places on Murano.) There are two restaurants in the hotel.

Do not stay here thinking you will be treated well. The service stinks. Unlike other four and five star hotels, like the Four Seasons where anything and everything you could ever want is responded to with an \"Of course, Ms. Smith\", at the \"palace\", the staff seems a little miffed to have to be acknowledging you AT ALL. Want to make a phone call? Good luck figuring it out. They aren't going to help. Worried about your luggage (delayed on a plane)? Don't dare ask the front desk, only the concierage should be asked; confused about whether breakfast is included? Again, don't ask because they will tell you that it is for 2 days in a row and then on the third present you with a bill for all three days (I'm not making this up). This rudeness holds true for the front desk staff, the concierage, and the manager. The random shop clerks, waiter, and maid were very pleasant. Perhaps it was because we booked a good deal on their website (350 Euros - gee, a cheap 500 bucks USD a night - instead of 500 euro during high high season). I do not know. Reading the Turin Hotels goal for \"hospitality\" makes me laugh, though. As other reviewers have noted, the shuttle service becomes irritating rather quickly. It takes 15 minutes to get to Piazza San Marco. Unless you want to pay 12 Euro for a coffee, 20 euro for desert/appetizer, and 20 Euro min. charge for ANY room service, you have to go into San Marco. Venice is expensive indeed, but a cappuccino in Piazza San Marco is 1.30 Euro at the bar, a far cry from San Clemente's prices. Another problem is that they turn off the A/C. If you are there when it is not extremely warm out, they shut down the whole air conditioning system and you must open the windows. The windows have no screens, and the mosquitos will buzz around in your room all night biting you and keeping you awake. That's some 5 star service there. Our friend's 3 star hotel on the Main part of Venice had air conditioning that worked all week. Also, we relied on his front desk/concierage for all of our questions regarding the phones and other basics about Venice. The only positive is that the rooms are really nice. Nice big beds, big baths, great design. They are all really new also. Not much Italian charm, though. I completely regret that I booked this hotel. I should have chosen the Hotel Bauer. Hotel Bauer is right off Piazza San Marco. Such a shame that we didn't stay there. I was really influenced by Trip Advisor naming San Clemente as the \"number one\" hotel in Venice. Just realize that rating is based on a bunch of Americans - every person staying there is American or Asian. None of the Europeans are staying at San Clemente. I think this says something along the lines of those who are really in the know stay somewhere else. If other people write later about how I must be crazy and the service is great, either Turin Hotels have switched out the whole hotel staff or the other reviewers are unduly impressed with front desk people in coat and tails. I'd rather have my questions answered than have the front desk staff looking daper in finery. We have traveled all over the world at some of the finest hotels in Europe, Asia, and the good ol' USA, and the \"palace\" is the worst for service ever.

The beds are very comfortable -- unlike some others we experienced at other 5* hotels in Italy. The rooms are beautifully decorated. I loved the bath and all the bath products -- if Venice wasn't so enticing I'm sure I could have spent most of my time in the bath tub. We didn't have a terrific view overlooking the water but I didn't mind -- we spent most of our time in Venice anyway. The boat trip from the hotel to San Marco is fun and a welcome break from all the hustle and bustle of Venice -- I was happy we weren't staying right in Venice and could get a break from all the activity and crowds. The 10 minute boat ride was an easy transition in both directions. The staff were wonderful. The concierge was especially helpful in pointing out good times to visit places like the Basilica, the Doge's palace, and the Guggenheim when we wouldn't be inundated with tours -- he was right too! He also made some very good recommendations for restaurants -- we liked one so well we went back twice. I read some reviews where people were disappointed with the buffet breakfast -- I thought it was great but, then, the only eggs I really like are scrambled so it was very ok with me that that was the only egg choice. We were eating so much for lunch and dinner anyway that I had to consciously limit myself from overeating at the buffet! We didn't eat at the restaurants at the hotel but we did spend one lovely early evening in the bar -- the seating choices are extremely comfortable, the staff friendly and attentive -- we stayed in the bar longer than we were planning to just because it was such a pleasant place to be. People who like a lot of activity and energy should take note that they may not feel as comfortable at San Clemente as others who really want peace and quiet -- it can be very, very quiet there.

He is a big guy and sometimes the hotel robes don't fit. and I loved the pillows, the suttle boat was also nicer than we expected. The negatives of the hotel are we did not think the staff were as great as other people had mentioned. Reasons being when we arrived at the airport the hotel clerk told us the suttle bus was no longer running this time at night and told us to take a water taxi. We chose the vaperreto and to our surprise there was the shuttle boat at St. Marks picking up people. What?! Why did the desk clerk tell us it had stopped we will never know?! Trying to make appts with the spa to book massages required persistence. We showed up and found noone there but 3 other couples also wanting information and looking around for someone to talk to. One man was walking around sweaty from a workout wondering where he could get a towel. After reapeated phone calls from my room I finally got through and the massages were great. The 2 women we met there were lovely, and gracious. (I just think they needed a full time receptionists to answer questions and book appts) Breakfast was pretty good but not a huge choice. Only 1 type of egg (scrambled) noone making omeletes - I'm not a huge breakfast person. We found the rooms to be quite cool. When we tried to increase the temperature it didn't work. I don't know why this is. The biggest thing I didn't like was the water presure and lack of really hot water in the room. I take very hot baths. The most I could get there was a warm bath. They give you bath foam but because of either the lack of temperature or pressure the foam never bubbled up. We were given a bottle of champagne in our room for our annivesary which was very nice, but it was sitting in a bucket of water by the time we got there - major delays at Schipol due to fog. As mentioned before the prices in the bar and room service are scandalous. Twenty euros for a club sandwich in the bar, eight euros for a non- alcoholic beer. Oh well we had an overall great time. I think I would try another hotel before coming back because being on the island does have disadvantages. The last day we booked our massages early afternoon (only time we could get). We were done by 4:30p.m. Our flight didn't leave until nine.

We spent 7 nights there so had the chance to get a real flavour for the place, and it really was beyond expectations. The gardens are immaculate and so peaceful and tranquil after the bustle and crowds of Venice. The lounges, bar, and all the public areas are beautifully furnished and just ooze class and quality. We dined in le Maschere Restaurant on 5 of our 7 nights and found the food to be excellent, and on some occasions truly outstanding. On a couple of evenings we were given the option of dining on the outdoor terrace overlooking the lagoon, or in an inner courtyard, and each has its own special atmosphere. The only problem was that some of the dishes were quite elaborate, and, after 5 nights, the menu was a little repetitive, but there was no problem at all when we asked for a slight variation / simplification of a dish. (Hint 1: if you can pre-book your dinner inclusive / half board option with your tour operator this saves a small fortune as you can basically have any 3 course meal from the menu. To pay for some of the same dishes as you went along would have cost maybe 2 - 3 times as much) The shuttle service to and from St Mark's Square was brilliant: efficient, reliable and always on time. On sunny days, there really is no better way to arrive in Venice, and the mooring jetty is literally at the entrance to St Mark's Square. Whilst you can pay for internet access in your room, there's actually free unlimited internet access at three P.C booths situated around the bar area. We had notified the hotel in advance that we were celebrating a special occasion, and we were upgraded to a premier suite (Room 102) which was literally breathtaking, with its own lobby, double bathroom, full sized lounge, bedroom and dressing room. (Hint 2: it's also worth registering on their THI website to become a member, which is free of charge; this also gives automatic room upgrades, early check in, free newepapers etc). If we could find any fault at all it was that breakfast could be a bit hit and miss, and the selection probably not up to 5* standards. Similarly, the sunbeds around the pool and the toilets/changing rooms in the pool area were not as well maintained as at other hotels we have stayed in. Having said that, there is a lovely outdoor bar and restaurant where it's stunning to sit with a glass of prosecco as the sun goes down. Finally we pre-booked a range of treatments in the spa centre and they were outstanding, and no more expensive that in the UK. The hot stone therapy with Joanne was exceptional!

Just now, in midsummer, the hotel was hardly crowded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in winter it can be a wonderful place as it gets even quieter. The hotel is a former monastery, renovated and extended to the highest standards. Its hundreds of metres of massive, calming corridors maintain a miraculously constant level of air conditioning. It boasts a spectacular mirrored bar (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGli Specchi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), a high quality regular restaurant (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLe Maschere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, currently with additional waterfront seating), and an exceptional haute cuisine restaurant, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dei Frati\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (here the tasting menu, at 95 Euros, is phenomenal value in a highly over-priced city). The rooms are extremely comfortable, especially the bedding and the bathrooms, but if you can manage it you probably have to go up to Junior Suite/Suite standard to get the best quality. We suggest you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a room on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCa dei Frati\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 courtyard as we discovered on this visit that it suffers from the noise of early morning collections across the cobblestones and what seems to be the solid hum of a generator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but when we complained the hotel immediately moved us to a quiet room at the front of the building. Right alongside the restaurant is a fascinating 12th Century church, which is undergoing renovation (a wonderful spot for a wedding!). Other facilities include a fabulous spa, a conference centre, an open air pool, a putting course, and delightfully wooded lawns with vantage points over the walls of the island to the lagoon and St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

The hotel upgraded us to one of their best suites (huge -- bigger than our London flat!), probably because we were among the few travelers who weren't part of a business conference or a tour group. It's hard to dislike a hotel when they've upgraded you. But even if they hadn't, we would still rank this hotel as one of the most memorable we've ever stayed in. First, the location. Riding the private water taxi to and from San Marco was incredible. We stayed four days, did the round-trip taxi ride twice every day -- and enjoyed it each time. The taxi was never late, the staff were always courteous. And who could ever tire of approaching San Marco from across the lagoon? Returning to San Clemente was such a relief after the crowds. When you stepped off the boat and into the hotel courtyard, you could hear birds singing. I never thought I'd describe any trip to Venice as relaxing, but that's exactly what it felt like. All the touristy craziness was within easy reach, should you wish to return to it. As I've said, we did the round trip twice every day, and it was no hassle at all. There seems to be disagreement among reviewers about the hotel's atmosphere. Yes, it hosts a lot of business conferences (there were several while we were there), but the conference building is separate from the main hotel. We never really saw the \"suits\" -- except when they were sneaking away, going to San Marco on the water taxi! The hotel apparently opted not to go super-Venice in its design. Instead, it went for a classic feel with only a few nods to Venetian things, like Murano glass chandeliers. That's fine with me; it gave the hotel an airy feel that contributed to the feeling of calm. And the buildings are by no means new. They were built in the nineteenth century (okay, new by Venetian standards, but not exactly built yesterday), and there's an interesting older chapel attached that's worth exploring. Since it was April, the pool wasn't open yet. But in the summer months, an outdoor pool and tennic courts are another nice touch that you don't get with most Venice hotels. Given what a great time we had, I think the price we paid (313 euros per night, including tax and breakfast) was a steal. The bellinis, at 15 euros each, were not such a great bargain. We grumbled a bit about that . . . then ordered them anyway! This hotel is fairly new; it opened in 2003.

The shuttle service to Piazza San Marco is convenient and virtually at your disposal - it's almost as though you have your own private water taxi when you want to head into the City. You will find that the separation from the bustle and noise of the Venice is a wonderful luxury in and of itself. We all laughed when we saw our poor fellow travelers struggling with their luggage up and down the bridges of Venice bedraggedly looking for their hotels. For an extra fee, we were greeted at the train station with our own English-speaking guide and a porter who whisked us to our pardisical island with no fuss, no muss! This was worth every penny! The spa is also tremendous and not to be missed. The staff there are so accommodating and put you immediately at ease - my husband got the best haircut of his life here and we all had wonderful massages, steams and jacuzzis. My 17-year old neice, a very picky eater, was able to find whatever she wanted on the kid-friendly room service menu. Even she proclaimed that the San Clemente Palace was the best hotel we stayed at on our five-city tour of Italy!

It's the epitomy of elegance and style and is a destination in itself. It starts with the beautiful polished wooden speed boat which takes you back and forth to San Marco. The trip takes 10-15 minutes, a comfortable and enjoyable ride. It's not sea-sickness inducing I found: very low to the water and steady. Then there's the hotel itself, standing in lovely gardens on it's own island. Refreshing to stay somewhere so tranquil after the crowds of San Marco. The hotel is huge, but perfect. It sparkles. Our room was beautiful, well sized, with a lovely bathroom. We had a view of the water and Venice, but being far and hazy could not see much of the distance. We also had a view of the old, ornate church and some gardens, so our view was heavenly. Had the opportunity to explore the church at dusk, which I recommend. The hotel has it's own beauty spa: I had a divine facial there - it's top notch. Breakfast is grand, much better than most hotel breakfasts. Fresh and tasty, great scambled eggs, fresh fruit, Italian hams & cheeses etc (and the rest). Minor annoyances are so minor I would have to be nit picking (hair dryer isn't great, you cannot iron anything for yourself, only real movie options you have to pay for, like a lot of places). I did not like Venice much on my first trip. It's true it's too touristy, busy, dirty and expensive (food especially is hit and miss). However this time, I loved Venice despite all that.

The rooms at the Clemente are of a generous size, the bathrooms are wonderful, but generally it is all just a little too clinical, too large and possibly too corporate for my tastes. That is just my personal opinion. I spend a fair deal of time travelling on business in large corporate hotels so in my spare time I really appreciate a smaller, more intimate setting.
