It was very clean and the single bed was very comfortable, in anything I suspect the mattress had been charged as it was very firm and I had a perfect sleep all three nights. If anything the TV has improved in that we now get a flat screen TV with a wide variety of channels. Wifi was free and that was a huge plus. The bathroom was larger than the one I stayed in at the Hotel Europe St Severin for which I paid a lot more too! The power of the shower could be improved in my opinion, but this could be due to the high floor. The air conditioner worked perfectly. Breakfast was a \"semi-buffet\" in that you get one croissant and one half baguette, but you could help yourself to as much corn flakes, muesli, cheese, ham, salami, fruit salad, yoghurt, orange juice, fresh fruit as you want. The coffee tasted as strong as it did before, you only have to specify if you want cafe, or cafe au lait, or a chocolat chaud. Enough has already been said about the excellent location of the hotel. Apart from the excellent public transport accessibility, it is right in the latin quarter with loads of restaurants so you never get hungry, and in fact the creperie next door is open for business 24/7. St Severin church is also just round the corner, and if you want cheap grocery supplies just walk towards the Cluny museum and opposite there is a Monoprix.

Walked to hotel from Metro St. Michel in less than 5 minutes. + Location cannot be beat. It's in the heart of the Latin Quarter which gets lively. Walk out and survey your eating options: crepe stands, sidewalk cafes and ethnic restaurants are plentiful. + I stayed in Room 49. There's a lift and the room is facing the inner buidling thus no street view which is fine b/c the street can get noisy. + Twin beds are decent but not plush. I managed to konk out each of four nights. + Bathroom is modern and showerhead was fixed asap when we complained. + Breakfast is decent and included in price of stay. Includes coffee, water, juice, cereal, yogurt, boiled eggs, cheese slices, ham slices, baguette and croissant + Reception is always pleasant + Area is safe. If were travelling alone i have no qualms as a solo traveller. + TV reception fine but why watch it when you have Paris outside the room. + Lobby is plush red! I loved hanging out there. So warm and cozy! + Fashion illustrations line the hallways and room walls. I love the decor! + Vibrant decor in nearly every room. I poked into some of them realize room numbers ending in 8, 9 and 0 do not face street and may be quieter than other rooms if you are sensitive to noise. The Minuses of my stay: - Upon check-in we were handed wrong room keys until we finally got our twin bed option. May need to reconfirm your stay because they couldn't find our reservation. Best to print out your confirmation before showing up. - Space is tight. I had to put my suitcase on the desk and my friend used the luggage shelf. - The pricing of a double room is more each person than booking two single rooms at EUR 76 each Final say: I'd rebook.

Well the rooms were really small and the toilet made me wondering....Why on earth would on put the WC on a different room that the bathroom? It was really funny but the WC was like a confiding room, not for claustrophobics. The location was nice but rather noisy and the staff quite friendly but they give BAD info, so be careful.

We were very pleased with the accommodations and especially the location. Our total rate of 175 Euros per night included a pleasant buffet breakfast (7 am until 10 am) each morning where one can also boil their own eggs to satisfaction.

The St-Michel RER train and Metro station is at one end of rue de la Harpe (next to McDonalds restaurant), so we took the RER train from Charles De Gaulle airport with our baggage, took the St-Michel exit, strolled half a block, and there's the hotel. There is also an internet cafe named \"Milk\" on the street where we bought 30 minutes of internet use for three euros. Also nearby, there are some markets - similar to 7-11's but with a lot more produce - named 8 a' Huit (8 to 8) where you can stock up on water, beer, wine and other snack or pic-nic foods by the 6 or 12 pack if you want to save some money. The hotel is also a short walk to Notre- Dame Cathedral where the open top tour bus originates. I do have to say that the elevator (lift) is very tiny and is crowded with two people and a suitcase - it's not a big problem, as all the plusses far out weigh that negative.

We were there last June and loved the hotel, and particularly our room so when we went back this year we booked the same room, number 36, overlooking the street, which they were able to accommodate us. As far as Paris hotel rooms go (& I have stayed in a few) the room & ensuite bathroom are both a decent size, with crisp, fresh linen on the beds, upmarket toiletires in the bathroom, somewhat 'bohemian' decor, but very clean & tidy. The room is also airconditioned. The room we stayed in had a flat screen TV, but being English speaking we only got the benefit of watching the international news channels. The room also has a mini-bar which is well stocked (but pricey). The hotel is very close to 2 metro stations & as you walk out of the hotel front door into the narrow street, the Rue de La Harpe, you find yourself in the heart of what Paris is all about. Cafes & restaurants abound with pavement diners & a buzz that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Buskers & street artists entertain diners and those just strolling the street. For those who need to mix business with pleasure, there is an internet cafe in the same road as the hotel, about 30m away from the front door (when you turn right out of the hotel). Its quiet in the mornings and gets progressively busier during the day, so go early if you have to use this! There is also a Macdonalds on the corner near the internet cafe, a saving grace when you have an 11 year old who is not into the more 'sophisticated' foods that are available in this area's restaurants! Breakfast is included in the room rate and this includes croissants, baguettes, ham, cheese, jams, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, juices & hot beverages. There are also eggs and you can boil these for yourself if you feel so inclined in the egg boiler.The breakfast chairs are not the most comfortable I have experienced but I think this is in an effort to encourage guests not to linger as the breakfast room is small in relation to the number of hotel rooms. My only complaint about the hotel this time around (as there were none the last time) was that on one of the days, we got back at 3pm from a few hours of pounding the streets of Paris, to find that our room had not yet been made up, which was disappointing when we wanted to relax in the room for a bit.

On foot I visited everything; it is steps away from Notre Damn, Pont Neuf, and other major attractions. I was even able to walk all the way to the Louvre the very first night I was there. In the morning I was able to hear church bells in the distance, as there was a window I could open for fresh air. The street the hotel is on is busy, but I enjoyed coming back to the hotel at night because the street was not deserted; there are also several food stands and an internet cafe on the same street ( McDonalds too!). But it is not too busy, and the crowd seems to disperse by midnight; some of the other streets were either deserted or had hoards of people, to the point where you could not walk down it, this street is a happy medium. I had heard from another guest that there room was a bit noisy because their room faced the street, but that was not an issue for me. Also as a solo female traveler I felt very safe within the hotel, and traveling the streets surrounding the hotel.
