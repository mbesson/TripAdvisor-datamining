The location is nice and there are lots of good restaiurants in the area. I walked three blocks to the Top Of The Mark Hopkins for lunch one day, and we liked the steakhouse at the Westin Saint Francis just down the block. We took the double-decker buses and could get anywhere in SFO. One day, we bused to the north end of the Golden Gate and walked all the way back through the Presidio, Marina District, Fort Mason, Fishermen's Wharf, and Lombard Street.

We arrived late on a Monday afternoon and were given a northwest facing corner room with wonderful views of the city including portions of the Bay Bridge, Coit Tower,and Alcatraz. The appointments were simple, functional, and comfortable, especially the wonderfully comfy bed. If you are an Elite member of Marriott's Guest program, be sure to visit their Concierge Lounge. The views of the city to the south, east, and west are spectacular and the continental breakfast features freshly baked croissants and pastries along with the more traditional morning fare.

Much more centrally located than the Wharf where most tourists seem to stay. VERY close to all the Union Square shopping and restaurants. Cable car runs right next to the hotel on Powell street. Service: From check-in to housekeeping this is a highlight of this property. One of my buttons on a sportcoat I brought came off one evening. I had it laid on my desk. To my surprise after the housekeeper had cleaned the next day she had sewn the button back on! Now that is way beyond any expected service. Doormen are great for hailing cabs. Huge Lobby: Unlike many of the other hotels in the city this property has a large lobby perfect for meeting up with others or just hanging out. As others have stated the the rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom is on the very small side. Otherwise this is an outstanding Marriott property.

We came out to San Fran for business and booked at the Marriott Union Square, in the Club Level Rooms. The bump up in price from a standard room is by far and away worth every little penny to upgrade. The cost to upgrade every day we were there was less then breakfast would've cost at the hotel and we were able to enjoy the \"Club\" throughout the day! To begin, our plane was 45 minutes early arriving and we made our way to the hotel, in the hopes that one of our five rooms might, on the off chance, be ready. Here we met Susan, who was incredibly helpful, sweet, fast and nice! She moved some things around and found us not one, but two rooms that we could start with- which was beyond helpful to throw our bags in before our first appointment. We ran up to the \"Club\" quickly after that to grab a water and met Daniel, who was one of the team members in charge of the club at the time. He continued the trail that Susan had blazed with being incredibly helpful, with all kinds of hints to get around the city, what to do, what to do, what to maybe avoid and things that were definitely must-see items. It was also helpful to run into Daniel because he let me know that the car service that we booked for the following day could actually be backed up a half an hour because the traveling time was not as long as the company had told me to plan for. We were helped, several times, by the entire team at the front desk, and the bellmen, with directions of how to get where we were going, how to find the nearest cable car stop and how to get to the destination we were trying to find. They were always at the ready to help each and every guest. Every single team member at this hotel was nice, helpful and efficient. The Club level breakfast was awesome! Scrambled eggs, homemade oatmeal, toast/bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, coffe/tea - just about anything you'd order from room service. We did not get to enjoy lunch there any of the days we were there, nor what they had around dinner time, but snacks and dessert were great and it was always helpful to be able to run up and grab a water/diet soda, etc throughout the day at the drop of a hat. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the beds were wonderful! I'm not a great sleeper at hotels to begin with but the beds were very comfortable and I actually got a great night's sleep. I understand that because we were on one of the \"club\" floors that we had a room that was high up above all the traffic noise below, and the room was pretty quiet as hotel rooms go. I read many accounts of the bathrooms being on the small side and I would say this is the very tiny, only bad thing about this entire hotel, which is really saying a lot. The counter space, at least for this lady, is really quite small and there really isn't much room for make up and toiletries, etc. They even had more room to move it over, but it is located about five inches from the shower. I did find, if you move the shower curtain over to the opposite wall, which seemed like the sensible thing to do, that it gave you the feel of having more room and not being pushed out by the shower curtain. This hotel also has a computer in the lobby to print off boarding passes, etc and was efficient as well! All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful hotel, it's in a great location to cable cars, restaurants, stores, shopping etc that I'd stay here again in an instant. The team that works here represents their hotel very well and they should be proud of how wonderfully they represent the brand. (I work in marketing, can you tell?).

This stay was at the one on the corner of Sutter and Stockton STs. The hotel is a nice property with doormen opening the doors as you enter and exit. Staff was friendly and attentive. The lobby isn't much: basic space to support check-in, check-out, a bell desk, and access to a restaurant. The rooms are comfortable with a cushy bed, flat-screen tv, desk, and great views (if you are on a high floor). Space is a bit tight. The room had a feeling of a long, narrow galley. I was disappointed that there wasn't a place (other than the desk) inside the room to eat. The closet was also small. Rather than a bar across the entire closet, there were to bars running from front to back. This allowed the closet to be more narrow. This might work well for people with roller bags. It was a nuisance for me because I have a hanging bag. Once the bag was suspended across the two bars, hanging clothes had to either be hidden behind my bag or placed in front, limiting access to the bag. Tolerable, but annoying. Most frustrating was the size of the sink in the bathroom. It was tiny with limited space for tools (hair brushes, shavers, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.). And using it I felt cramped by the shower curtain on a curved rod that caused it to insinuate itself into the space for the sink. I couldn't get it out of the way enough to not feel cramped as a shaved or brushed my teeth. Maid service was attentive. And, as a frequent stayer, I received nightly turn-down service: closing the curtains, a brief tidying up of the room, and leaving two chocolates on my pillow. My Marriott status also entitled me to the use of the Concierge Lounge. The lounge served a breakfast of oatmeal, cold cereal, scrambled eggs, the usual unripe fruit (cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple), and good pastries. The croissant were crispy and flaky. There were scones, pain au chocolate, and various fresh sweet rolls. Orange juice was served at breakfast. Coffee, and a selection of teas, soda, and beer are available throughout the day. The afternoon snacks were disappointing. Turkey and ham sandwiches on focaccia, a hot appetizer (e.g., mini vegetable spring rolls that were mostly fried dough with limited vegetable filling), a tiny vegetable \"salad\", and a cold antipasto tray that usually included slices of sausage, cheese, and olives. A later dessert included an assortment of three mediocre cakes and brownies. A nice feature is that the lounge is open all day even when food is not being officially served. Soda, coffee, and tea remain available.

This time I chose to stay at the Marriott Union Square at 480 Sutter streat. The hotel does have a very central location which makes it really attractive from that perspective. The checkin process was smooth and not att all cumbersome. I had a car this time so I parked just in front of the hotel and that is all good but the problem is that there is no real hotel parking area which feels a bit unsecure as you are close to the traffic, not a huge deal but maybe something to think about if you are traveling with children because then it is extra important to make sure that they do not exit on the left side of the car due to the traffic. The parking fee was 45USD which is quite expensive for 1 day parking but thinking about the fact that you are downtown San Francisco then it is probably not that bad. The rooms are very nice, modern, clean and offers a nice street view. What I really like is when I can open the window which actualy was possible even on the 12th floor. The rooms are also quite big with a very comfortable bed and furniture, they just had safebox installed which also add some extra security if you are bringing a computer or other high-value items. The hotel feels actually much more modern than the JW Marriott hotell just a block away and the Marriot Union Square has a nice design in lobby. I like this hotel and I will most likely book it again.

While my friend and I did deal with a few hiccups as a direct result of the renovations back then, overall, the room was nice and spacious, with little noise from the street. This time, however, was different. Instead of the double queen room I occupied on my previous stay, my wife and I stayed in a Single King Bed room with a view, and I felt like the room was much smaller than I anticipated. It served its purpose to give us a nice room to sleep and keep our stuff in, but everything was tight and cramped. I had to get dressed out of my suitcase in the closet, because my wife used the ottoman on the side of the bed to hold her suitcase, and the dresser drawers were way too small to hold a week's worth of clothes. I was pretty disappointed, because I was expecting a much larger room with the price I paid and the memory of the spacious double bed room. The sink in the bathroom was small with very little counter space, as noted in other reviews on here. We could also hear our neighbors in the next room when they were coming and going and also when they were talking at a normal volume in their room. We could hear a baby crying from a room somewhere around us as well. I can understand a little noise from neighboring rooms in a hotel, but this seemed a little loud. Oh, and while I planned on using the Stockton-Sutter Garage across the street for our rental car the last 2 nights of our stay, I ended up having to use the Marriott parking garage at $48/night, because the other garage was closed by the time we got back to the hotel. I also had to pay $12.95 for internet each day, which is a ripoff to me. While many hotels are still charging for internet, I think it is ridiculous and policies need to be changed. The good: nice, updated place with good customer service and friendly employees. However, I don't think those few good things are enough for me to come back. I think I will try a different hotel next time we visit San Francisco.

Not good for family with children, little or teenagers (teens like to stay on the computer!). I just think it's a shame that at lower cost Marriott Hotels, (such as Residence Inn), you pay less, have great rooms, with an all inclusive package. But, here - You pay hefty, get great location....just don't expect all the added Marriott perks - Not here. So, no complaints with the rooms or service - All was fantastic and served the purpose of this trip. But, on routine vacations - we will surely stay at one of the more economical Marriotts.

The streets were lined with shops around. The tram stopped right next to our hotel. Also about a 6 - 8 min walk to the famed tram turnaround area.

A side note for anyone who may be deciding between Union Sq and Fisherman's Wharf, do stay at UnSq! We went to the Wharf for sightseeing and it didnt even take up half a day.

This was our second stay at this hotel, the first being the same week a year earlier. Our room on the 22nd floor (2215) was very large, thanks to the generous addition of floor space enabled by the wall-size floor-to-ceiling bay window. It looks out directly to the Sir Francis Drake Hotel across Sutter St. and with a view to the left of the SF Bay. The room was very quiet with no street noise. The bed was very comfortable, the room had lots of good lighting, and the swivel chair w/ottoman was comfortable. (Why is there only one chair when two people often occupy a room)? As Marriott Rewards members, we had access to the wonderful Concierge Lounge on the 28th Floor, which offers a gorgeous view looking over Union Square. The breakfast, snacks and evening desserts in the lounge were of good quality. The Front Desk was very helpful (especially Nan) and the Bar/Restaurant Manager was very nice and accommodating as we sought to move away, once we were served, from a very loud & annoying group. Our only complaint rests with the housekeeping on our floor. The tiled floor in the foyer, closet and bathroom had long hairs, which clearly were not ours. It was not clear to us if the tiled floor was ever cleaned and wiped as these hairs were there throughout our stay. Also, housekeeping did not replenish the toilet paper when one roll was down to almost nothing and there was no back-up roll on the shelf. Not a big deal, but we did have to call late at night for replenishment. A general complaint about this & most other hotels is the uncomfortable desk chair. Also, why does Marriott not offer free Internet access at its better hotels, when they offer it for free at their lower-cost Courtyard and Springhill Suites brands?

The rooms were small, even by San Fran standards, but with a great location in a city like SF we did not spend much time in the room. The design was clean, but a little routine.

I recomend you park at the Sutter Garage one block before the Marriott on Sutter. You have to enter on Bush. I parked at that garage for less than $20.00 and day and $13.00 overnight on the weekend, a big break from the nearly $55.00 the hotel charged.

While the location was quite ideal, I can say our stay was only fair. When we checked in early, they were kind enough to find us a room on the 29th floor (second to top floor). While we checked in, we got to listen to a front desk associate rudely talk to a person she was checking in who indicated that he had booked a different room than he was given (her response to him was essentially \"prove it\" instead of trying to help resolve the situation). When we got to our room we were initially pleased although disappointed that the concierge lounge would be closed until the next evening around dinner time. My husband and I then went out for the day and evening and when we returned that night, realized the possibly worst problem with the hotel... weddings on the 30th floor. It was 9pm when we arrived back to our room. The music was loud as could be and our room was shaking. We figured, wait til 10pm before saying anything... but we were on east coast time and every tired so we decided to call and ask when the wedding would be over. We were informed it \"should\" be ending at midnight. So obviously, we could not stay in our room! That is a serious flaw in the floor plans of the hotel as the rooms under the ballroom are not usable to sleep in when a party is going on directly above. So, to their defense, they did help us move our room and our belongings (which was much appreciated) but by the time we re-unpacked and got settled it was already after 10pm (or 1am EST) and we were very tired and acky from our long flight. The next morning, since there was no concierge lounge open for use, I ventured downstairs to ask about the other dining options in the area to which I was informed by the exceptionally rude front desk lady that \"we aren't giving you a voucher just because the concierge is closed, that is standard marriott.\" Well first of all, no it isn't. Second of all, I never even asked about a voucher or the concierge lounge, I only asked what dining options were available in the area. I guess I would sum it up to say if all you are looking for is good location and a nice looking clean hotel, this is a great place.

As a business guest I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem but as a leisure guest who only really wanted to check a couple of things (opening hours for shops etc.) I thought this was pretty bad. There was no free internet access anywhere in the hotel apart from to print out boarding passes. This was pretty shocking to us as we had stayed in hotels thoughout California for this trip (incluing some pretty remote ones - Yosemite, Lassen Volcanic Park) and this was the only one that charged for the internet.

We had the fastest check in ever. I'm sure it only took about a minute. Our room was a reasonable size although we noticed a trend of US hotels of not having a fridge in the room. Only on one day out of the four did the maid not come round to make our room but we were not fussed. Internet is expensive US$6 for every 15 mins. There wasn't really anything to complain about. The hotel is located on the corner of Powell and Sutter. From Powell you can catch the Mason street tram which takes you down to the wharf. There will be a stop near the hotel, otherwise walk down to the bottom of the street to watch the turn around of the tram and hop on from there. Make sure you look at the half price ticket booth in Union Square (350 Powell Street) for any deals for shows. We saw an extremly funny comedy play for only US$20. A must do for San Fran: * Alcatraz - book online as it may be booked out as its a very popular tour * GoCars - need to see SF in a day. Hire these small GPS guided cars for a 3-4 hour tour on your own (read reviews on Tripadvisor) * Tram/cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. Eat at the The Francision - great restarant * Union Street - for some trendy cafes Overall a pleasant stay.

The shopping by this hotel is better than any I've ever been to in my life. Within walking distance are: Macy's, Neiman-Marcus, Sak's Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom's and tons of other shops. This hotel would be perfect for a shopping vacation.

The bell staff took care of our luggage and we started to explore the area. We came back and got a beautiful king corner room on the 16th floor with great views of the city. I loved all the windows. The toilet and shower room was big and was separate from the sink area which was a great feature. The shower was one of those big round rain shower heads and made for a nice strong shower. The sink area had a floor to ceiling window which I loved. The bed was very comfy and made for a good night's sleep which was welcomed after walking around all day. We ordered in room service one night and the service was fast, friendly and the food was good. The hotel is in a great location. The cable car stop is just across the street and the bus stop is also very close. We took the cable car to Fisherman's Warf and took the #30 bus back. Both easy to use and convienient. Any type of restaurant you want is with in walking distance and we enjoyed some good meals on recommendation from the hotel's list of local restaurants. We got this from the front desk. The hotel is right across the street from Starbucks so we got our morning coffee and pastry and because Starbucks is so busy in the am, we took our stuff back to the hotel lobby which is very spacious and comfortable and had our coffee there while watching the people walk by. Again lots of big windows in the lobby. We walked as far down to Market Street and went shopping in the big mall as well as shopped our way back through the streets of Union Square. Chinatown is also very close to the hotel. Though I don't love the colours of the decor of the hotel, I appreciate that everything from the lobby to the rooms was well coordinated and in good taste. The room had some local photography of the Golden Gate Bridge which I thought was great as oppossed to some tacky photos that you often find in rooms.

Since this was our first trip to San Francisco, we chose this hotel based off reviews we read and the location. I have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel. Our flight landed around 12:00 and we were at the hotel by about 1:00. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we knew we made a great choice in hotels. The door man greeted us with a smile and helped us bring our luggage from the taxi inside. If any of you pack like I do, you know this is no easy task! Since I had to pay $25 per bag up to 50 pounds, you know I utilized each pound in each bag!! Anyway, check in was flawless (plus they let us check in early which is always a plus) and everyone was extremely friendly. We booked a King Guest Room. The entire hotel appeared to have been recently remodeled; everything was modern and extremely clean. Our room was clean and modern (like the rest of the hotel) and extremely quiet. We have stayed in hotels in the past and barely got a minute of sleep because of the noise from elevators and other guests. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was always kept clean and there was always plenty of hot water. (Believe it or not, we have stayed in hotels where there wasn\u2019t enough hot water). The location couldn\u2019t be better; it is centrally located to many attractions. Plus, there is a pick up for the famous cable cars right outside the hotel and a Starbucks is right across the street with Union Square only about a minute walk away from the entrance to the hotel. Many tours start and end at Union Square, so this was a definite plus for us! While reading reviews before our trip, some people complained about the service and friendliness of the employees at this hotel. I can say, with 100% complete honesty, that any time I had a question I was always answered with a smile and provided accurate information. Every time we entered or departed from the hotel, we were acknowledged warmly. The employees were always happy and helpful; no one ever seemed to be angry, upset or unwilling to help.

We arrived on a Sunday at noon expecting to stow our luggage until the 3 p.m. check-in. Chris, the desk clerk, listened carefully to our request for a nice-sized quiet king room away from the elevator and offered to check us into room 2108 immediately. We were pleased with his choice. The room was spotless and peaceful. We rarely heard noise in the hallway or outside our floor-to-ceiling windows, which offered nice views of downtown and the bay on a clear day. There was a comfortable reading chair, lamp and ottoman by the window. The two of us had ample space to unpack our clothes and stretch out. The bathroom wasn't huge, but provided plenty of counter space and shelves. At our request, we received a mini-fridge and feather-free room. Best of all, we have never slept so well in our lives. Marriott's Heavenly Bed and blackout curtains struck another home run. The last morning, we enjoyed the hotel's buffet breakfast, which we felt offered better food, higher value and faster service than nearby Sears. We also used the hotel's fitness center. We greatly appreciated the kiosks in the lobby, which allowed us to check in our flights and pay for checked luggage in advance. That proved a HUGE timesaver at the airport. A few areas to improve: We paid $199 plus taxes per weekday. (The AAA rate dropped to $125 plus taxes over the weekend.) For the weekday price, we were appalled to learn that Marriott charged nearly $30 per day for Internet use. Most coffee shops will allow you to log on for free. There is no fan in the bathroom, causing shower steam and odors to linger. This seems to be consistent with other Marriotts we've frequented. The hotel wasn't busy, yet no one brought us a cart or offered to help us with our luggage. The staff was terrific when we stored our suitcases and laptop after checkout, however.

We had reserved our room 3 months prior to our stay, had paid in full at that time, had a voucher and confirmation for our stay, but the hotel had no record of our reservation. This kind of thing happens and I completely understand that it can cause problems in what may normally be an efficient check-in system. However, when things go wrong that are so obviously the fault of the hotel, I have certain expectations - the least of which is an apology. What we got was a long and frustrating check-in experience which included the constant re-typing of our names into their compuer system and the handing over of an inch-thick printout which we were asked to look through to see if we could find our names. Honestly - there were thousands and thousands of names in there for all sorts of different reservation periods and although the names were listed alphabetically within each list there were hundreds of lists (not related to reservation period as far as I could tell). After getting off a long flight, this isn't what you want to be doing for half an hour or more! Eventually we were told that we'd be treated as \"walk-ins\" but wouldn't be charged. Gee thanks for that. All I can say is that our experience should act as a deterrent to anyone who actually wants to \"walk-in\" and expect a decent reception! For our \"sins\" we were assigned to what my husband referred to as the janitor's closet on the lowest level of the hotel. I can fully endorse the other comments that talk about the plumbing noises and noise from the fitness centre. The funniest aspect of our room was that the closet was so small that the double sliding doors were each more than three quarters as wide as the closet - so there was hardly enough room to fit your arm through the gap when it was open at its widest! When we asked to change rooms the next morning (we had booked a king room but had ended up in a twin) the best I can say about the attitude is \"rude and very begrudging\". We were informed that there were no king rooms available, nor any queen rooms so we were stuck with the twin beds but still wanted to move to a less noisy location. You'd think we'd asked the woman at reception to hand over her firstborn! Eventually we were grudgingly given a new room - only a couple of floors higher (so definitely none of the views that had been described by others on this site) but at least it had a more standard layout (could actually open the cupboard doors for example) and it was quieter - only the traffic noise to contend with. Naturally we had to move our own luggage! In summary, the location of this hotel can't be faulted, nor can the housekeeping.

The Hotel is about 5 mins walk from Union Square, just one block away and is on the corner of Powell Street, therefore easy access to the Cable Cars. You could walk to Market Street for the Trolley buses in 15 mins easy. Never used the Bart so cannot say how far that was. We did not have dinner at the Hotel, we did try the breakfast in the Executive lounge but found Lori's Diner on the opposite side of Powell Street to be our preferred choice. I know we didn't pay for the Exec Lounge, which is probably a good job, because having stayed at many similar Hotels in the Marriott chain and other chains, we found the Executive lounge of poor value. Only open for breakfast and the evening, yes you did get access to a computer and internet free (internet was otherwise quite expensive), breakfast was complimentry but not a wonderful selection available, and evening snacks were very small in size and small in quantity and yes you could have free soft drinks and coffee but the glass of wine came with a cost of $8 per glass. We did use the bar are most evenings, quite unusually, because it seemed so relaxing with great attentive staff. There was parking and valet parking available at the hotel which we didn't use, I don't know the costs. Overall, excellant, 4 star accommodation and very good rates very close to a popular part of San Francisco. To get to the airport at the end of our stay, we had a private limo hire (Town Car, they call it) for $38 plus tips.

She wasn't as rude as what the other review described, but I can easily imagine her being like that. The \"keys\" on her uniform is le Clef d'Or. (the Golden Key) And a Concierge would have to go through several trainings to obtain it and if a staff is wearing it, they better be good! On Les Clefs d'Or USA website they state: \"The crossed gold keys on our members\u2019 lapels are the international symbol of our organization and an assurance that you are dealing with an experienced concierge dedicated to providing the highest quality of service to all. Our members, through their extensive networking, are able to provide the ultimate in service to their guests.

These concierges broaden and enhance their knowledge, understanding and contacts worldwide, all in an effort to provide the best possible service to guests while providing added value to their hotels. \" The Concierge lady was anything but what they describe. I asked her for a few pet shop locations in San Francisco, and after googling, she told me \"there's only 1\". ONE?! In the whole of San Francisco?? (earlier I had gone to Front Desk for the same question as the Concierge was not there, and the Front Desk told me after doing a bit of searching that there is none!) I went to that one pet shop she gave me, and asked the shop if SF doesn't have many pet stores and she told me there are lots! When I went to the Concierge lady for some information, while googling for it, the phone rang and she picked it up. She was still in the midst of helping me, but instead of telling the guest she will call right back, she kept on talking to the other guest, while turning her computer screen to me, and pointing to the info. My goodness, what is that for professionalism..... Maybe I should just write to the GM to inform him of her very poor service. I used to be a hotelier at a major 5 star hotel chain too, and I can say that the attitude of the Concierge is unacceptable. The bellstaff were probably the most helpful and pleasant during our 5 nights of stay. The location however is excellent being just steps away from Union Square. Although the hotel gives you a feeling of a simple Holiday Inn kind of hotel (in other words, not luxurious), it is newly renovated thus clean. The bathroom is tiny but at least it's new. Strange they provide soap, but no soap dish though. Housekeeping is not the best, as they only changed the bathtowels and sheets, but clearly did not vacuum or clean the bathroom floor as during the 6 days there, dust started pile up in the corners. So at one glance it looks cleaned, but not thoroughly. I stayed here only because it was very newly renovated, but I can easily imagine the hotel will start to wear out in just a few years time.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cSuperior Full-Service Marriott, but ...\u201d", "Author": "PDXBigGuy", "ReviewID": "UR29883958", "Content": "Just returned from a 3-night stay.

I seek out the \u201cwow\u201d experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Excellent. A few blocks from the shopping of Union Square and the nightlife on Geary street. TYPE OF ROOM: Standard Room. BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Excellent bed, high quality linens, and perfect down pillows. LIGHTING: Good lighting in bedroom and bathroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: This is the downside of the room. The bathroom is tiny and there is barely room to put a toiletry bag. They did a good job with the space but it is so small. The shower has good water pressure and can be made consistently hot if desired. TOILETRIES: Bed & Bath products\u2026. Very good. CLEANLINESS: Hotel is 3 days old and very clean. A/C: Didn\u2019t use CLOSET SPACE: Average size, but may be too small for 2 people to unpack all items. STYLE OF ROOM: Very comfortable room and some nice style. COMMON AREA: Lobby is small and not really a place to hang out. Looks like a hip boutique hotel as opposed to a Marriott. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Room was exceptionally quiet but could hear a loud car go by occasionally. Definitely worth getting a high floor for less street noise. FOOD: Room service food quality was mediocre. TV/INTERNET: TV has many channels. Internet is available for $12.95 SERVICE: Staff are nice. One person sent me the wrong direction making me late for a meeting in the city. SUMMARY:Definitely one of the best Marriott experiences since it is brand new, looks less like a Marriott and more like a boutique hotel. I have also stayed at the W and the Monaco, and this will be my top choice now in the $200 hotel range. If you are ok with a tiny bathroom, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa Ontario", "Title": "\u201cIt is changing to a Marriott on April 1 2009- Needs some fine tuning\u201d", "Author": "BigBlue52", "ReviewID": "UR26982066", "Content": "We stayed for 9 nights at Hotel 480. The first and most important thing to know is that the lobby and front door area is under construction. This was not a big deal for me as I only spent about 30 seconds in those areas each day. As it was under construction we got a great deal, (94.00 per night - expedia). The construction work is only done through the day, so for most people that is not a proplem unless you are a very late sleeper. The rooms are very nice, appears to be almost all new carpet, furniture and fixtures. Our room had two proplems. The first was that even though we were on the 19th floor there are no window curtains on the floor to ceiling windows in the bathroom. Not a big deal until the workers/window washers come by (they did, then a mad dash to become fully dressed). Really the hotel should have some sort of curtains or covering, a person with a good telescope in another building could be getting a good show. The other issue is the old story of chasing the hot water in the morning. I thought all hotels had beaten this proplem. The showers in the morning were an ongoing problem each day we were there. Ranged from very cold to too hot, with a few moments of just right thrown in. Perhaps being on the 19th floor had a bearing, but it should not be so. The hotel has to work on this if it wants to attact the business crowd, end of story! The staff were OK, not great, not bad, cleaning staff missed a couple of things during the stay, but when spoken to it was fixed. We took the advice of another on this site and asked for a corner unit on a upper floor, good advice in regards to traffic and outside noise, (it is downtown after all), The corner unit gives you a 2nd door to close that will keep hallway noise from invading your room. (Weekends guests seem to make more noise) The only proplem with ours was that we were locked in our small hallway until I pried it open, the hardware on the frame was missing, not a big deal until there is a fire and you want to leave quickly!! Once again, Marriiott is a big company and I am sure that they will fix most of these issues.

I was travelling with my 73-year-old Mother and was worried beforehand about the how far the hotel was to the shopping area but in the end she found the short walk a breeze and was making several trips back to the hotel a day to unload her shopping bags.

The only negatives were that due to the renovations the bar and restaurant had to close whilst we were there to be relocated with the new lobby.

Brought the family to S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade and festivities. We were only 1 block from the parade and of course very close to all of the festivities. I liked everything about our room. The beds were very comfortable. There was a nice, thick comfy bedspread with 4 pillows on each bed. We had a flat screen tv but didn't really have much time to watch it. There is a nice alcove that holds a small coffee pot for coffee/tea. The headboard has two reading lights as mentioned below. The colors/decorating were very nice. The bathroom has a light in the shower if you want to just have it on so as to not disburb other family members sleeping when showering. (The bathroom has a frosted glass sliding door so I was concerned the light might be too bright). We were unsure as to where the parking garage was for the hotel and ended up parking in another lot which I understand was quite a bit less expensive.

From the minute I arrived, I could not have picked a better hotel! The staff was friendly. I arrived at 7:30 a.m. (well, before check in) but Chris had a room for me within minutes. And what a room it was!! The other desk clerk seemed friendly and the concierge, bell hops and doormen were AWESOME!!! They always had a warm greeting and a smile on their face; very accommodating and helpful! My room was AWESOME!!! It didn't have the best view, but it wasn't horrible either- I was in room 1203. It was great because it had it's own little alcove entrance. The room was pretty big (king bed) and I immediately fell in love with the colors and decor. The bathroom is tiny in size, but also liked how it was decorated. The water pressure was perfect!! Maybe even a bit too much for the faucet at the sink. The toiletries are from Bath & Body Works. I loved the headboard on the bed-- it had two little reading lights that gave just enough light to read, but not enough to disturb the person on the other side of the bed. They now have flat screen tvs in the rooms. There was a nice sitting area (chair/ottoman) near the bay window in my room. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! I don't think there is a better spot in the entire city. It is less than 100 ft from the Powell/Hyde trolley and has a Starbuck's on one corner and a Walgreen's on the other. There were a lot of dining options in any direction once you walked outside. As far as the renovation is concerned, the only thing I noticed is that the front (the facade) is covered and there is scaffolding at the entrance of the hotel. I never heard any construction noise (but.. I wasn't in my room during the day). I was not at all inconvenienced or troubled by the renovation-- I can't wait to go back when they are done to see what it's going to look like! A small, but sort of important note: The elevators were very quick! I never had to wait more than a few seconds. Very nice when you come back and all you want to do is go rest in your room. I have been in hotels that I have had to wait more than 10 minutes for an elevator. I was traveling on my own (single female) and always felt safe in the hotel and in the surrounding area. Again, it was great that the trolley stop was basically right outside the hotel entrance. Some travel tips if you go: 1. Get a Go San Francisco card! I saved over $50 on attractions- I paid $79 for a 3 day pass and did: Wine Country tour , biked the bridge to Sausalito , City Bus Tour, Wax Museum, and the Alcatraz tour. You can purchase online, in advance. 2. Grayline tours (and probably all tours): Definitely ask for a DETAILED description of the actual tour. I took two Grayline tours (they were on my GoCard) and neither one really matched the brochure description. The City Bus tour and the Wine Country Tour. 3. I was told not to miss going to Scoma's and Boudin's for lunch/dinner. Both places were ok, but not worth the $$. I had Fish and Chips at Scoma's (Sausalito)- $24- way overpriced and nothing special. To be fair to Boudin's, I did NOT have the chowder; I had Jumbo Shrimp and Chips ($24.95)- the shrimp was tasty but again, not worth the money. 4. Get a pass for the trolley, MUNI, cable car system-- very convenient instead of having to carry around change and/or money for the fares. A 3 day pass (which I bought at Walgreen's) was $18. 5. If you are looking for the Real World San Francisco house, it's at 953 Lombard (not on the crooked section-- it's between Leavenworth and Jones and.. it's a very steep walk back up to Hyde- where the crooked street begins!) Again, I cannot wait to go back so I can stay at Hotel 480 again. It seemed like they had a lot of return customers. Each time I spent more than 5 minutes in the lobby (waiting for shuttles/tour buses), people were constantly saying Hi to the employees using their first names. It reminded me a bit of Cheers- where everyone knew each others names. I had nothing but an amazing experience at Hotel 480 and highly recommend it! (Definitely check out the discount hotel sites- hotels.com, travelocity, etc. for a reasonable rate-- I was happy to get it for $110 a night, but feel it's worth at least $200-$250!)", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, totally woth the money\u201d", "Author": "lupus81", "ReviewID": "UR23540248", "Content": "Staid with my family their for 3 nights.

The location is great, just a block off Union Square and along the Powell cable car line. We were first put in a renovated room on the 8th floor, facing Sutter and nearly on the corner with Powell. The room was a good size with a king bed, sitting area, great desk and flatscreen TV, and a nice sized bathroom (tub-shower combo). The bed was very comfortable too! The renovated rooms look like the new Marriott Courtyards - one of the staff members told us it may become a Courtyard at some point. Unfortunately, the street noise during the night (a Saturday) was awful. It sounded like the windows were wide open in our room. Honks weren't muffled at all, we could sing along to the music from loud cars, and we actually heard people's conversations from the street! I got up a few times to check the windows and make sure they were all closed - they were. We've stayed in many large cities and in many properties in and around Union Square and have never had this problem. I'm not sure if this issue will eventually be fixed with the renos - right now they're working on the facade of the building and it looks like the glass in the window is thin and only single pane? At any rate, the next morning - a Sunday - we headed down to the front desk to request a room change. The first woman we talked to was helpful and assured us that we could be moved but that they would like to wait until noon or so, when people would be checking out and rooms would be available. She mentioned that it would be good if we were ready to move (i.e., packed) when we came back. When we arrived at noon though - with our bags all packed - there was another woman behind the desk, an older asian lady. From the beginning she didn't appear to want to help us or even take the time to listen. We heard much \"no\", \"I don't know\", \"we can't...\" and one word answers with no explanation for the first few minutes of our conversation. All we wanted was a simple move to a quieter room, something that shouldn't have been a problem at all in a hotel as big as the 480 (and particularly on a Sunday, when many people are checking out). We weren't looking for a bigger room, a room with a view, or even necessarily a renovated room. Just something a little quieter! This could have been achieved by putting us on the other side of the building or perhaps even moving us up a few floors. From the attitude you would have thought we were asking for the moon and the stars though. We finally got her to agree that they would LIKELY be able to move us but we would have to leave our bags with the concierge and come back IN PERSON to check in a few hours - no guarantees. Needless to say this put a bit of a kink in our sightseeing plans for the day but at that point we were just happy we had made some headway with this woman. We were eventually moved - to a smaller room on the other side of the building a few floors up. The room had construction going on around it during the days (somewhat inconvenient, particularly when they started doing some glue-smelling tile work one morning at 4 AM). But it was quiet at night, which is what we were looking for. However, there was a complete lack of customer service and willingness to accommodate here. The only other time we've requested a move in a hotel - at the Grand Hyatt at DFW Airport - it happened within minutes and they came to our room and personally brought our luggage to the new room! So this experience early in our weeklong stay definitely soured me a bit on this hotel. Physically it's a nice property though and should be very nice once all the renos are completed. There are still a few finishing touches to be added - the stopper in the sink in one of our rooms didn't work, a bathroom door was pretty sticky, there was a full length mirror in one of the rooms and not the other, no mini fridges yet, etc - and they do continue to do quite a bit of rather noisy work during the day (and apparently they're behind schedule). We found most of the other staff - particularly the bellmen, valets, and cleaning staff - friendly and accommodating. A colleague of my husband's arrived later in the week and was treated very well by other front desk staff. He was even upgraded to a good-sized suite with a view of Fisherman's Wharf. But overall I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again, unless they were offering a good rate.

While I had requested a King room with a rollaway for the three of us, upon arrival the desk clerk suggested that the room would be crowded that way, and suggested a room with two doubles--this was fine, except that I am married to a big guy and am used to a queen bed. Nonetheless,, the room was very comfortable, and quiet. The decor was quite nice as well, and the room was very clean. I did know that I would need to have the car valet parked, but when we arrived, because of the luggage carrier on the roof, they informed me that they would have to charge me the oversize vehicle parking fee! Also, one of the front desk clerks (not the one who checked us in), insisted that the bellman take our bags to the room, making me feel obligated to tip him. It must have been a hotel image thing, because I did not necessarily need or want a bellman's assistance! Also, expect to pay to use anykind of computer/internet service!

A call to the front desk immediately got us an upgraded room (family suite) with plenty of apologies.

Rides to Market Street were almost unnecessary because five blocks downhill was nothing. Coming home or going to the piers was easy with the cable line. My only regret is my room looked directly at The Cheesecake Factory two blocks away on top of Macys. I think I resisted one night out of four, going to sleep without a slice of \"sin\" ruining my diet. For those needing a workout facility, the hotel's is being remodeled. They give you a \"comp\" card for 24 hr fitness five blocks away. It wasn't offered at first but seemed to be no problem once I asked. Do eat at \"Sears fine foods\" across the street and down the block (visible from the front door). Their mini Swedish pancakes are fantastic. French toast was pretty good as well. Overall, I think I enjoyed the best medium budget version of a downtown hotel. You can spend less and get a lot less. I not sure you can get much more without really turning out your wallet.

We booked this hotel through our travel agent (our agent never contacted us to say it had changed names since we booked and paid) together with our flights. It was expensive but we thought with the Crowne Plaza name and having read other Trip Advisor reviews we would be happy. I had booked our nine hotels in Europe directly through their websites after reading Trip Advisor reviews. All of them were wonderful so we were looking forward to our three nights of luxury in San Francisco to finish an incredible month long trip. We arrived after two flights from Europe, 16 hours in total and checked in with no problems. We were taken to our room on the 10th floor and were told how lucky it was that we had such a huge one. We thought it was very dated and we were not very happy with two double beds instead of a queen or king as advertised, but it was tolerably clean. It was a disabled room with all the equipment left in the bathroom. The room was also very cold. While my husband tried to warm up the air conditioning I decided a shower would help the jet lag and the disappointment with the room. However there was no hot water!! We rang reception and they said the hotel was undergoing renovations and that they would send a plumber. The longer we waited the more upset we became so we went to reception to complain about the above. The receptionist said as there was a conference on she could do little. We explained that we had paid over $400 a night and were ready to leave. She said that she would make an exception and reorganize things and upgrade us to a much higher floor with a room with a King size bed. We were very tired and grateful that we could finally have a shower and freshen up. The room was okay, very dated but clean and we had our hot shower. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and there were people working outside our window. There were ropes and men dangling just outside. The worst was to come though. When we finally got to bed that night we realized that our bed backed on to the lifts and they are in use continually until about 5am. We felt like we were still on the aeroplane. Earplugs didn't lessen the noise much because you could also feel the movement of the lifts. As it was our first time in San Francisco we made the most of the bad situation and got as tired as possible seeing all the sights. The weather was wonderful and it was great to walk everywhere and also take the lovely Cablecar. We had the most amazing breakfast at Mama's Cafe (worth the half hour wait outside) and also nice dinners at North Beach. I will never book hotel accommodation again through a travel agent as I think this may have assisted the problem.I will also never go back to this hotel in spite of its good location.

The room is cozy, but very clean and tastefully decorated. We got a king bed that was rather comfortable - wasn't the best of the beds I've slept in, but not bad. There were a couple of annoyances, however. First, valet parking at $43 + 14% tax (almost 50!) is just absurd. The second night, I found local garage parking for about $26 overnight.

This was greatly appreciated after our nerve wracking trip from the South Bay to the city. (We stayed the previous two nights in the south bay to visit some friends).

My husband sat down on a bench with our items and I waited outside for our car. Our car arrived about 15 minutes later just as all the airline employees were boarding a bus to apparently go to work. As I helped the bellman unload the car, my husband called to let me know we were checked in and ready to go. The Crowne had upgraded us to a junior suite on the 23rd floor. The view from the room was absolutely spectacular, we slept with the curtains open every night so we could see the beautiful city lights. The room was quite nice and spacious. The bathroom was against the back wall, next to that was a small table and chairs for eating or playing cards. There was a rather large living room area with a sofa, coffee table, a chair and a television in a cabinet with some drawers and a refrigerator. Beyond that was a half wall separating the living area from the sleeping area. Directly in front of the bed was a desk with a light and outlets ready for your laptop.

It was $10 a day for internet access, or $35 for the week. I understand that this is typical in upscale hotels, even though it frustrates me. That being said, when I pay for internet access in a hotel, I expect enough bandwidth to be able to conduct business (VPN access). The download speeds were frequently less than 200kbps, which is totally unacceptable. This was one of the recommended hotels for the VMWorld conference, which is a computer-related convention. A hotel should expect high internet usage when they are a participant hotel for a high-tech conference, and be prepared to handle it. Even on Thursday night, when most of the conference participants had left, the bandwidth still didn\u2019t exceed 310kbps. My expectations for $10/day internet access are much higher than free WiFi in non-premium hotels, and unfortunately the Crowne Plaza didn\u2019t come close to meeting those expectations. We opted not to use the room service available, since the cheapest thing on the menu was a $22 hamburger that didn\u2019t seem all that special from the description on the menu. A morning pot of coffee was $7, and a basic breakfast was over $15. Instead we went to the grocery store and bought a few staple items and frequented restaurants in the area. Most of the staff members we ran in to were very polite and friendly, especially the housekeeping staff. Parking was somewhat of a fiasco. It took a minimum of 15 minutes every time we needed our car, sometimes closer to a half an hour. At one point one of the door men got rather testy with me and told me I should call for the car before going downstairs, otherwise we should just go to the garage ourselves to get the car. (Which was fine with me, less tipping!) Not only did they expect a tip every time we got in or out of the car, the parking was $60 a day. (Yes, I said $60 A DAY). I understand real estate is at a premium in SF, but $60 a day?!?!? Again, no choice we had to pay it. When we went to check out my husband mentioned the problems with the internet, and how important it was for him to have internet access, he was met with a snide \u201cSorry\u201d, and handed a receipt. Overall the room was lovely and most of the staff were polite and helpful. Would I stay here again? Maybe. It surely wouldn\u2019t be my first choice by any stretch. It\u2019s very important for computer people to have reliable internet access. If it were free, we wouldn\u2019t complain, but considering less expensive hotels have better internet access this was a big disappointment. The room service menu being SO highly priced also put us off a little. The parking, well honestly it was kind of disastrous for us. So only in a pinch would we stay here again.", "Date": "September 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel.

It's not the Westin's \"Heavenly Bed,\" but every night when my head hit all four pillows, I'd be out like a light....and getting up was truly a chore. I used their aromatherapy spray and relaxation CD, too. The shower massage has six settings, which I found novel. The handicap bar in the shower seemed to be in an awkward place and I bumped it constantly. I liked that the housekeeper replenished the toiletries every day.

He was pleasant and efficient, and had me on my way to my room in minutes. My room was on the 16th floor, and although I would have preferred higher, it was all that was available. On the floor, in addition to rooms along the main corridor, there were five or six alcoves, with additional rooms off of them. To get to my room, I had to take a right, right and another right off of the elevator. This layout really cut down on the corridor traffic noise, but the room backed up to the noisy elevator shaft. The room itself was a king room, small, and dominated by the bed. There was also a chair and ottoman, large bureau, desk, and closet. The bathroom was small but efficiently laid out>>but if my wife were with me, there would have been a turf war over the bathroom size. The large window looked out over Powell St, and had a side window that opened, letting in fresh air. Street noise was heard, even with the window closed, but not as intrusive as the always present elevator noise. The room itself was immaculate...under the bed, behind the endtable, everywhere. Possibly the cleanest hotel room I have ever been in. Back to the bathroom for a minute. Nice toiletries, plenty of clean, fluffy towels, and great water pressure. Tub/shower was very narrow, and water got all over the floor after each shower. Maybe the addition of a curved shower curtain rod would diminish the cramped feel. The beds are really trumpeted, both on the website and in ads around the hotel. While comfortable, I didn't find it warranted the bragging. The lobby was functional and clean, and several in our group used the concierge, finding her helpful. As far as location, it was convenient to everywhere. Union Square was one block awayand Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39, etc is just a ride away on the famous cablecars that go right by out front of the hotel. I did not use room service, or the restaurants at the hotel, but did note that the food provided by the hotel as part of the conference was very good. I decided to attack the debate about breakfast restaurants I read about in the SF forum. I went to Lori's Diner across the street on the first morning. The food was excellent, and plentiful, and the waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful. As I walked around the area after breakfast, I noticed about 20-25 people standing on line in front of Sears Fine Foods one block away. The next two mornings, I went to Sears for breakfast, didn't have to wait, and the food and service were exceptional. Prices were comparable. My vote in the debate would be for Sears, but you can't go wrong with either. Bottom line, the hotel was everything it presented itself to be on the website and in hotel literature.

(I was fortunate enough to qualify for a corporate rate that was about 40% less than the hotel's standard rack rate.) To top it off, the view from my room on the 23rd floor was outstanding. (Rooms on upper level floors with views of San Francisco Bay command a slight rack rate surcharge. But the surcharge is apparently waived for some corporate-rate guests.) My dislikes about the hotel: A very bland, uninspiring decorating scheme, which seems to be highly typical of most Crowne Plaza locations. Inadequate air conditioning in the lobby, elevators, hallways and other common areas. (The weather was unusually warm during my stay, with temperatures in the mid 70s.) Somewhat worn and outdated room furnishings and carpenting. Would I stay here again? Yes, if the price was right. Would I stay here if I had to pay anything close to the rack rate? Definitely not.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised at the Crowne\u201d", "Author": "Ted Fry", "ReviewID": "UR6005796", "Content": "Although check-in was slow and wonky, this was to be expected during the huge convention weekend of our stay (10/20/06).

I travel a lot on business - this hotel exceeded my expectations. It was one of the best decisions of the trip. I split the holiday between two hotels in the city and really regretted leaving the Crowne Plaza. (1) Location An easy walk from the Powell Street BART station (I took the BART from the airport). Great for shopping, being two blocks from Union Square. Great for all the city-centre attractions. The cable-car stops outside reception! Takes you down to Powell / Market Street, or down to Fishermans Wharf. (2) Rooms We had a standard room. Quality and cleanliness very high. Most rooms seem to have a large bay window. My room was at the back of the hotel and I could see the bay and quite a lot of the city, including Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. The bay window is great. The room is bigger as a result and you get a much wider view from your hotel. The beds are very comfortable. Every room has a CD player and they even provide a relaxing \"sleep-advantage\" CD. (3) Food / Facilities Didn't try the restaurant - so many choices in San Fran!! The breakfast was great (Crowne Plaza's usual standard). There is also a coffee-shop / Deli in the hotel that does fantastic egg & bacon breakfast muffins - dangerous!! Lot's of coffee choices, bagels, muffins, cereals etc - I recommend it for a faster getaway in the morning. There is a friendly bar.

I was able to get a corporate rate of $130 plus tax for each night. The staff service was excellent. The bell captains helped me with a ride to the airport and were exceptional in their service, the housekeeping staff helped me with some laundry, the housekeeping staff kept my room neat and tidy, the wake-up service actually came to check on me when I was unable to get to the phone to answer the wake-up call, etc. This place had better staff service than grander hotels where I have stayed. The room was smaller than some other rooms I've had, but it had a king-sized bed, a chair and ottoman, a desk, and a dresser. The TV was set on on a stand that wasn't in front of the bed, so it was uncomfortable to watch. My room gave me a view of Powell Street and I could hear the cable car bell occasionally, but overall, being on the 10th floor, the street sound wasn't bad; the only time it woke me up was when sirens were going by. The sleep kit they give you is really, really nice; I am a light sleeper, so this was very much appreciated. The bath products are very nice. Herbal and spa like. It was one of the better lines I've had in hotels; even nicer than the Parc 55, where I stayed a year ago. The location is great. There's a 24-hour Walgreens across the street, lots of casual restaurants nearby, a short walk to Union Square, a 10-minute walk to the Moscone Center, a short walk to Chinatown, a Wells Fargo machine nearby, etc. The location is far superior to the Parc 55, the only other SF hotel I've visited. The drapes had a stain on them, and the carpet seemed old and musty, but otherwise, the room was furnished nicely. The bed linens seemed very clean, including the duvet cover, which is important to all travelers. The hotel has a Cafe Fresco, which has great hours and a nice selection of foods to go, as well as some seating. For a business traveller, like myself, this was great. My one complaint is that I could smell food smells one night. I don't know if a neighboring room had room service or if the smell came in from the heating and cooling units. It was gross though. There was no way to open the window to air out my room.
