The hotel was booked by our agents, who had never failed us before and I expected a 4 star experience. Before going, of course, I read the trip advisor contributions and was a bit intimidated. We had booked a triple room, which on arrival turned out to be a double room with an additional bed in front of the desk and TV and there was practically no room to even get to my side of the bed. This was the main drawback. The location is great, 50 metres from the Termini where there were a lot of places to eat and a shopping area. The room was cleaned every day, breakfast was OK, although the same every day but they had all we needed. The area is a bit rough in the evening. On our last night there was a big brawl in the Chinese restaurant opposite the hotel and the police had to intervene. Overall it was a nice stay, plenty of things to see. What I didn't like in general was the terrible infrastructure, the Metro is awful - a far cry from the Underground in London. I would recommend the hotel for the location and the nice and friendly staff but this is definitely NOT a 4-star hotel. What I also find absurd is the tourist tax that we had to pay at check-out - 3 more euro per person per night.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro", "Title": "\u201cReally nice!\u201d", "Author": "Laura C", "ReviewID": "UR125052379", "Content": "I stayed in Hotel Luce for a week and everything went great!

The facts: NOT a 4 Star.....2 at most....and I am not exaggerating. Rooms are small....real small. NO NATURAL LIGHT COMING INTO OUR ROOM!! The staff dont care. Rude and uninterested. Breakfast is woeful. (Maybe its all like this in Italy) The elevator fits 3 people in it...WITHOUT luggage. Old-fashioned. Wi-fi only in the lobby...for this ''4 star'' No tea/coffee making facilites in room (maybe thats an Italian thing, I dont know) Loads of Sky channels IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ITALIAN!! 2 English channles- Sky & BBC news Wardrobes are about 3 feet off the ground Bed and pillows were hard Shower is tiny; I banged my elbows many times Most unromantic hotel ever. Our Stay: I hope I remember all the details...anyway I'll give it a go... When we arrived the desk guy was taking a personal call....he continued this personal call for the entire duration of us trying to check-in...no manners, no greeting....asked for our passports...after a couple of mins he just said 'Second floor', gave me the key, and said '10 minutes'....as in 'I will be off the phone in 10 minutes, go to your room and I'll photocopy your passports and you can get them later'. We were not comfotable with the fact our passports were with him, so we waited instead of going to our room while this guy talked and talked, laughed and joked with whomever he was talking to.....he even went outside! Then a hotel maid came, and i asked her. they guy came over and mumbeled something in Italian, obviously pissed off he had to do some work. OTHER RANDOM EVENTS: After our early morning flight we needed some rest. So we slept after unpacking. After about 1 hour of sleeping we heard the door unlocking, it woke us up, it was the maid!! She was coming into the room, just as I got to the door! This HAPPENED AGAIN on our last day! At about 10am! NEVER NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE.

There was a FREE safe in one of the wardrobes which was a bonus as many other European hotels charge for this service. It had a desk with another draw and a fridge with complementary Cokes and water when we arrived. There were 2 mirrors in the room which gave it more light. There was a television but the only channels we could receive were Italian but to be honest, we were too tired to watch anything anyway! The room was air conditioned and worked throughout our stay which was a relief because it was very hot in Rome. The bathroom was big enough and consisted of basin, toilet, bedet (not sure if you spell like this) and shower cubicle. The water in the shower was very warm and could be controlled easily. The water didn't drain away as quickly as it should but we never flooded so it wasn't a problem. The breakfast was typical of a continental breakfast which I have never been a fan of. Being English, eating ham and bread in a morning has always felt strange! There were some cereals and yoghurts and best of all fruit which we took out for snacks during the day. The coffee from the machine was awful but juice was available. Breakfast is served 7 till 9 which gives plenty of time to grab a bite before heading out for the day.

My experience at the hotel to put it mildly was outright terrible. Immediately upon entering my hotel room, I knew at the very first moment that my stay at the hotel would not be a pleasant one. First off... The air-conditior did not work. Prior to me booking this Jetaway tour package my travel agent assured me that this hotel would have a working air conditioner. My travel agent did his homework by calling the tour operator (alba) and getting confirmation from them. However, not once during our stay at hotel LUCE was the air conditioner in working order. The staff/employees at the front desk apparently made it quite obvious they have their lines rehersed as what to stay to their clential. Their response was simply that the air condition was broken. In fact, one member of the staff thought he could convience me that indeed the air con was on and that I was simply mistaken. There was no way in hell it was in working order, as no cold air was coming out of the ceiling vent. The weather in Rome at the time was over 30 celisus. It was very difficult to sleep and long sleepless night were the norm. Many other hotel guest too were experiencing the same problems. Often, as I waited in line for my room key, I overheard guest complaining to the hotel employee. One guest got so irrated (I don't blame her) that she verbally fought with with the front desk worker causing so much commotion that he threated to call the police. Similarly, one night the front desk clerk informed me in a rude sarcastic nasty tone (in english) \"i don't speak english ... speak to me in Italian\". It surprised him after I replied back to him in Italian as he had no clue I spoke it fluently. Secondly, the bathroom shower is not suitable for those tall, overweight, pregnant or have a physical disability. I am average weight and found it very difficult to take a shower as the stall was extremely tight. The water also took a lot of time to drain as it was clogged. I would bet my dad's signed Babe Ruth baseball card that they haven't cleared/cleaned the drain in years. Unfortunately for me once without knowing my less then 5 minute shower would turn into water overflowing and flooding all over the bathroom floor trailing into the bedroom area. Immediately the front desk attendent became notified but he didn't seem to care one bit as he simply told me to speak to somebody in the morning. The hotel rooms were also very small in size. There was hardly any space to store personal belongings. My bed too broken as the mattress was caving in. Unfortunately, all the above negative aspects about the hotel wasn't at all my biggest worry. The morning after my first night at the hotel I was reaching for my shoes I placed under my bed. As I grabbed for them, there I few feet away was a dead mouse. I was so disguested and morified. My bedroom likely had not been occupied for sometime before I arrived. Therefore cleaning services didn't feel necessary to check up on the room. Although the hotel staff were made aware of the dead mouse under my bed there were unable to move me into another hotel room because they claimed that the all double rooms were fully booked. They refused to place be into a triple room because I did not pay for one. I couldn't not believe my ears! Moreover, the hotel staff didn't bother to deliver adequate consumer service as they had the mentality that I like the majority of the other hotel guest had prepaid our air/hotel package rate. I would not recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. The customer service was non existant and the sight of the hotel room was just so sickening. Please avoid this hotel if possible. For those potenital SKYSERVICE VACATIONS Jetaway customers, make sure that the hotel selected for the air/hotel package deal isn't LUCE.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cLeaves a Lot to be Desired\u201d", "Author": "Lococutus", "ReviewID": "UR5352222", "Content": "The star rating on the hotel plaque states 4 stars.

The one redeeming quality of this hotel was that the lobby was ok and the staff was very nice. The room we were put in was extemely small, especially for having three beds in the room. We had to push all of the beds together just to store our luggage and to walk around. Upon arrival, we tried to put on the air conditioning -- it did not work. We also tried to turn on the TV -- again, didn't work. We went downtstairs to see if, perhaps, there was a problem, and were told that the air conditioning does not go on until 8pm, and the TV is only available from 7am until 9am to watch the morning programs. The shower drain did not work, so you needed to shut off the water about two minutes through the shower, and wait for the drain to go down then quickly rinse before it filled up again. Because the air conditioning didn't work, we needed to leave the windows open -- but we were uncomfortable doing so because the balconies from the next-door building were so close that someone could have climbed right into the room. We are not very picky tourists, but this hotel was really just sub-par. We stayed in other hotels in the same area on other nights, and they were far superior to the accomodations at the Luce. Perhaps I would recommend this hotel to someone who would never be in the room during the vacation, or who did not care if certain amenities were only available at certain times. However, there are many other hotels in the same area of town for the same price, which are far superior in room size and have amenities available at any time.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cRome amazing\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4726344", "Content": "My boyfriend and I visited Rome and stayed at Hotel Luce.

Our room was as small as we expected, but clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast was fine and the location good. The room had a double bed that we found comfortable, with just enough room to walk round it. There was ample hanging space, a TV on a dressing table and a mini-bar or fridge (we didn't open it to see what it really was). The bathroom had a shower (no bath) with terrific flow and a lever to set the temperature to whatever you fancied. As well as the wash basin and toilet there was a bidet. The good size mirror above the basin had good lighting on it, too. There was a problem with the shower tray - it wouldn't drain properly. Mindful of an earlier report of difficulties with the staff, we wondered what would happen when we reported it. The helpful receptionist took a note and it was fixed by the time of our next shower. Breakfast is plain continental, but there is a good choice including cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurt, and rolls with preserves, cheese and ham. Drinks include coffee, chocolate, tea and fruit juices (also from a machine that seems to mix them from powder - not the best feature of the breakfast). You can eat as much or as little as you want. The hotel is just a block from Termini station and excellently situated for walking to many of the essential sights of Rome. It's convenient for the Metro trains, buses and trams that all go from Termini. We travelled to Rome by easyJet and used the Terravision bus to get to and from the aiport. The bus drops off at Termini, just a short walk from the hotel. There are dozens of restaurants within a ten minute walk of the hotel. The largest selection is the other side of Termini, where there are probably twenty or thirty in the neighbouring streets.

The rooms are slightly small but are spotlessly clean and even include a bidet. The rates include a buffet breakfast whilst not that varied certainly kept me going for most of the day. Another major plus point is it's location - literally round the corner from Termini station for the underground and tour buses. Do not be put off by the Termini area's dodgy reputation - as a lone traveller I did not feel at all threatened. There were a few beggars and people selling their wares but they were harmless and were to be seen throughout the city. I flew in with Ryanair and the drop off/pick up point is at a couple of minutes walk highly convenient. The Colosseum and Roman Forum for example are only approximately 15 minutes walk away down Via Cavour. Also there are plenty of restaurants and cafes adjacent inluding a Cantonese directly opposite and a couple of Italian ones on both corners of the street of which I tried and both had decent food and were reasonably priced. Now there were some minor quibbles which I have to knock a point off for. Both the coffee and juices came out of a machine - coffee fair enough but at least they could have provided the cheap carton juice. On the whole the breakfast was a bit limited - white rolls, ham, yoghurt, cheese, cake !! Regarding the rooms the shower space was slightly cramped and the wardrobe rail very high - and I'm six foot tall. I could have done with more sheets on the bed taking into account it was January. Also could have done with an English speaking TV channel for news etc. To summarise then this hotel was exactly as I expected and fulfilled my basic obligations of cleanliness and location.", "Date": "January 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario,canada", "Title": "\u201cstay away from this one\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4359198", "Content": "The hotel is certainley located close to the train station, and within walking distance of many landmarks.

The breakfast was a cold buffet but had everything from a selection of juices, tea's and coffees to a wide selection of breads, chesses, ham, spreads, cereals and fresh fruit. The bedrooms are probably the only area that could require some improvement. Although they were clean and in plenty supply of towels. They were very small which is why I feel that the accommodation is really only suitable for weekend passengers or passengers staying a minimum number of days as there is very little storage room. However saying that, the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable.
