We stayed last year during the summer and the weekly rate was HK$2888. This year, it went up to HK$3888 for a week. Nonetheless, the serviced apartment was clean. The room size was a fairly good size one. Nice swimming pool. Good scheduled shuttle service to Tsuen Wan MTR station (took about 8 minutes to the station). Free in room WiFi. Self help laundry was cheap and convenient. The gym could be improved by providing more update equipment and more varieties. As the apartment building was a little off from the city center, the overall environment was quiet.

We were very happy with our stay. Originally, we wanted an apartment with separate kitchen and living room. However, we ended up with a studio apartment and were not disappointed as it was a good size. There was a fridge, kettle, TV and hair-dryer. The bed linen was clean and the room was cleaned twice a week. The facilities were good. A gym, swimming pool, internet, laundrette and shuttle bus to the MTR. The downside to the studio apartment is having no cooking facilities and having to get the shuttle bus to Tsuen Wan to get breakfast as there are no food shops on your doorstep and the restaurant is not open for breakfast. Previous reviews mentioned rude staff but we did not encounter this.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cOverall good......but\u201d", "Author": "Bruce_Hadley", "ReviewID": "UR113816675", "Content": "The location is OK if you have business in New Territories, but is a long way from Central HK. The free shuttle to the MTR is good, and runs like clockwork. The rooms are OK. I had a 1 bedroom suite with a microwave and stove top.However, there is no toaster. Please add a toaster so you can at least make breakfast in your room. The rooms are serviced twice a week, but they dont always change the linen. This didn't concern me as I was staying alone. However, the biggest gripe is the Internet. At certain times of the day (normally from about 6 -10pm) it is almost impossible. Obviously there are a lot of people trying to use it at the same time, and there is simply not enough bandwidth. So, therefore if you want to send files, or do any work...forget it!! That is the biggest criticism, and one that could be easily fixed at low cost.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMediocre at its best\u201d", "Author": "GABA1", "ReviewID": "UR54769475", "Content": "We stayed at the Bay Bridge for the entire month. We had the one bedroom suite and leased it on a 14000HKD contract. Although it is advertised that the specials start at 13000/mth, what they don't tell you is that, that is for smoking rooms only. The room wasn't entirely that bad, it wasn't big but hey we are in Hong Kong, you can't expect to live in a standard Western sized rooms. It did feel cozy and we had an exceptional view of the water and the pier across the way. The kitchen was supplied with new pots and pans, cutlery (western and chopsticks), cups, bowls, kettle and all the necessary goods. There is a little fridge beside the sink that can be used for minor smaller goods. The stove was the induction type where no gas was needed. It is safe and clean. I must say the kitchenette was the best part of the stay. The wifi is free only if you are on the 1 month stay or 1 bedroom suite. Otherwise you will have to go down to the lobby to use their wifi which the speed varies depending on the time of day (user amount) Location - The Bay Bridge is quite a ways from the Tsuen Wan MTR. Although the shuttle bus runs every hour or half hour depending on the time of day, the shuttle bus trip alone takes about 15mins and for you to take the MTR to TST or MK per se, that is an additional 30-45mins. So an example is, its 11:40am, and you want to go to TST, you will have to wait until 12:05pm shuttle bus and get off at the MTR station about 12:20pm, and then take the MTR all the way to TST for an additional 40mins or so. If you like to be out and about, I would recommend another location. But if you are there for a short time, the commute is tolerable. The positive side about the shuttle bus service is that it is the latest shuttle bus service out of all the other places (private condos included). The last shuttle bus of the day leaves Tsuen Wan mtr at 11:45pm compared to 10:30pm for other housing estates/condos etc. The cab ride from the MTR to bay bridge is about $35-37 HKD. Service - service is a bit tricky for Bay Bridge. I think it depended on the staff. The night staff when I checked in did not seem as friendly as the day staff but then I saw that they did rotations so it was unfair to generalize the staff based on the time of the day. The is not bell service so the security or whoever stands outside the door will hardly help you with your luggage, even if you look like you are struggling. They hardly greet you nor do they make an effort in welcoming you for your stay. The ladies who work there on the other hand seemed to be more approachable and professional while the men who worked there did not. The english level of the staff varied, and some though sounded fluent with their english, did not comprehend at the level that they spoke. There were many times when they had to just give the phone to someone else instead of saying \"please hold on\" etc and then let another person speak. When we checked out, there wasn't much shown on their behalf of their gratitude for us staying at their hotel for an entire month. There were no thank yous nor asking us about our stay. It was merely making sure that everything was ok in the room, and if it was then we were free to go. We were accused by the guy with the thick black frame glasses that we took their hair blower when we didn't. The staff really needs to watch their tone in how they approach various situations and people. When we asked them to send a fax for us, the guys were conspiring in the back in Cantonese saying how they didn't really know what they were doing. And then came out and said it has been sent without any receipts or anything considering it costed $30hkd/sheet. We have no records of the fax being sent nor do we have receipts for the cost. My recommendations would be for the staff to be more professional handling their guests and be a little bit more courteous in greeting them. Though some 'jobs' may not be your job such as luggage help or whatnot, it does give a negative impression if you just stand there with your arms crossed when your guests are struggling to haul 6 pieces of luggage in or out.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Bay Bridge", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1491223-Reviews-The_Bay_Bridge-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.123 Casle Peak Road, Ting Kau</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1491223", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/bc/c0/5f/the-bay-bridge-thumbnail.jpg"}}
