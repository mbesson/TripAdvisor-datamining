The place is good value for money given its location which is 5 minutes from the Colosseum, about 1 minute from a Metro Stop and easy walking to the major attractions. The room was clean and comfortable and beds were made up each morning. The Breakfast was very basic, a packaged croissant, tea, coffee, juice. As with some of the other comments, this isn't a 4 star hotel so you do need to set your expectations. The main draw back for my family (we have two children) was the noise level. We were in room number 1 which faced the main road and even with the glazed windows shut the traffic noise was very loud through the night and into the early hours. It appeared that most of the rooms faced this same direction with the exception of one or two. Needless to say we didn't get much sleep.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value, friendly, quiet.\u201d", "Author": "Claire F", "ReviewID": "UR117627443", "Content": "The rooms were clean and comfortable.

We wanted 2 rooms but they only had a quadruple room available, so we took it. I informed them that we are 2 couples as I did not want to end up in a twin bed, and that is exactly what happened ! The quadruple room was not big enough to accomodate 2 queen sized beds, it had 1 king size, with one twin bed at the side and another twin near the foot. But for the price of 140 E for 4 people, we did not bother to complain. It was good we had asked for a taxi service from the airport for 50 E, as this place is hard to find ! However for location, it can't be beat : walking distance to the train station, the Coloseum and other attractions, eateries, etc. On check out day, we just walked with our luggage to the Termini station where we took the train to Venice. Other pluses are the free computer/ internet use, and the airconditioning . Over all, I'd say it's good value for the money because of its location. Good enough for those looking for a basic, affordable, well- located place to sleep, but not for honeymooners.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva", "Title": "\u201cCentral, friendly and good value\u201d", "Author": "Hobsbawm", "ReviewID": "UR59828850", "Content": "The quality of a place you stay depends a lot on your expectations.

The host & co-owner, Pompeo was extremely nice and helpful. Although the accomodations weren't luxurious, for the price we were pleasantly surprised - the room and private bathroom was clean and comfortable (a little small but we expected that in Rome) and even had a flat screen tv and wireless internet connection. Only being in Rome 3 days, we were not planning to stay in our room much and spent most of our time sightseeing so we did not need hotel type amenities. I read another review about the guest not realizing Tourist House did not have a 24 hour reception but Pompeo made me aware before we arrived what the check in times were and requested the estimated timeframe we would be arriving so he could welcome us. When it was time for us to leave for the airport Pompeo arranged for a car service to pick us up, which they did - right on time.

This is not a frills B&B however the service was always with a smile and the place was clean. We had a cute little room that looked out to Cavour.

We stayed here for one night as our original B&B (B&B suburbe roma) had double booked us.

There was limited signage to the B&B once in the apartment lobby but we worked out it was on the 5th floor quick enough and despite not speaking any italian. The lift was small but worked fine. We found the host to be very friendly, he showed us around the room and pointed out the facilities (fridge with free drinks in lobby area, free internet access, fridge in your room). The room was clean and comfortable, although the bathroom was very small. I fitted in the shower ok (and i am quite a big girl) and the air-con worked perfectly although it did drain into the shower which seemed a bit unhygenic.

Traveling in group of 8 (4 adults and 4 children). When we dialed the number, we got an english speaking person who was great to work with. He answered questions and arranged airport shuttle to pick us up at the airport. Upon our arrival to the Tourist House, there wasn't any sign on the building etc...just a small business card next to the 'bell buttons'... --> Good luck finding this place in the dark without guidence. Once we figured out the lift and got to the floor we were greeted by an individual (described in the first review) who did not speak English -- he attempted to be very helpful...but really couldn't verbally answer any of our questions... The rooms were very, very, very, very small and 'gross'... The ceilings had black stuff growing on them... The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the windows were not sound proof. The rooms did have A/C; however, they drained directly into the shower. My daughter walked from one room to another {almost across the hall}--the bottom of her feet were completely black... The bathrooms were very, very small and described to detail in the first review. The shower was so small you could not move around to wash yourself without hitting the shower doors (too small for my 9 year old more less an adult). Speaking of shower doors, they were cheap plastic that were cracked, soap scummed. Water was a mix of hot -- my wife's shower was more cold... One door had about 4-7 inches of scotch tape holding it to the rails; the other kept falling off.... The tank above the tolet leaked... The ceiling had black stuff growing on it too... Breakfast was described perfectly in the first review.... I have traveled in Europe for 3-years now -- definetely not the 'typical European breakfast'..... After experiencing a terrible night (we arrived around 12 am and was pretty much committed to staying the first night -- didn't want to be 'homeless' in Rome at midnight with 4 children), we decided to check out... Early the next morning, we found a very nice hotel right next to the Tourist House {Via Cavour 213-M } for almost the same prices (granted they gave us Space-A price). We approaced the non-speaking English man (who was barefoot) to check out. He called the English Speaking individual who insisted that his rooms were very nice and that since we reserved 3 nights we had to pay for 3 nights--was charged for only 2 nights (remember though, was paying for two different rooms; both rooms, same quality). Lesson for tourists, don't reserve multiple nights in advance if not completely sure you will be satisfied....", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4319311", "Content": "Good location just a couple of blocks from the Forum and Colosseum.
