The entrance to the hotel is not traditional. You have to go down a very narrow alley way (about 1 meter wide or less!) and then up some stairs. The hotel is not signed well and yes it's true it is a small laminated sign but who cares what the outside looks like. The photos on here are accurate to what we stayed in. The reception is in the sister hotel just down the street. When you go down the alley then up the stairs the you press an intercom and talk to the reception who direct you where to go to check in. The check in is located in the hotel Antica Casa Carettoni. Remember this and you will love it. This hotel was definitely worth the money (a bargain!). There is not wifi but we were able to purchase some from the next door hotels wifi network hotspot on our credit card for 9 euro (shhhhhh!). There is however an Internet cafe just down the street as well as many restaurants and shops.

The entrance to the hotel gave us plenty of laughs upon arrival as we were concerned our suitcases would not fit down the alley way to the door. Don't expect a grand entrance as this is unlike any hotel we have ever stayed at. There is no reception and you have to go to another hotel a couple of doors down to check in and get the key to your room. Once inside the room it did smell a little musty and smokey (old cigarette smell), however opening the window to air out the room soon freshened the accommodation. The decor of the room is very dated however the bed linen was clean and the shower was too. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review this is budget accommodation so you cannot expect too much for the price especially for prices this low to stay in an amazing city. You will also realise there is so much to see in Venice that you won't want to stay in any hotel for too long. The location of the hotel is great and close to the train station and water taxi and bus area which makes it easy to travel around.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mooloolaba, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean & good location\u201d", "Author": "Littlecurly", "ReviewID": "UR118341088", "Content": "Having read previous reviews on this hotel, I was not looking forward to our 2 nights at Hotel Moderno (the funniest name ever!). Unfortunately there was not much choice in accommodation when we booked so we were stuck. Surprisingly I would have to say, for the only time in Italy, our very low expectations were exceeded! Apart from the check-in process, which was VERY painful with a heavy backpack at 10pm at night, we had no other complaints. Yes the rooms are small, yes it is an old building & yes it feels like you are on a ship. BUT the room was clean, bed was comfortable, aircon worked well, bathroom tidy and smelt clean, location is fantastic & was reasonably priced by Venice standards.

We lugged our bags down there and went up the stairs, only to find out we had to check in at a sister hotel, a few doors down. Hotel and our room were pretty outdated, with carpet on the walls and doors, a couch that could have belonged to my grandmother as a child, and a stained bedspread that also sported a 6 inch gash in the middle of it! Once we stashed the bedspread in a drawer, the place seemed to be decently clean at least. If you can get over all that, it is a great location. In the middle of a lot of shopping and restaurants. Just a few minutes to walk to the train station or water busses. Also close to a great bridge over the grand canal. We stood at the top of that and watched boats and people go by while we ate some dinner a couple nights - which we'd picked up at Quanto Basta - a couple doors down from our hotel.

Having stayed recently at a fancer hotel in a \"better\" location (Rialto-San Marco), I would like to point out the advantages of the Moderno's location. You are next to the train station and the vaporetto hub, so that's all good. But I want to praise the neighborhood, Canareggio, which is a real neighborhood and not exclusively tourist oriented like Rialto-San Marco. There is an open air market on the Campo San Leonardo, a 5 minute walk away, and there are neighborhood bars where Venetian townspeople meet to shoot the breeze. The historic Jewish ghetto is a short walk away. Venetian food being generally mediocre and overpriced, you might consider taking at least some of your meals at the nearby Brek cafeteria, where the chow is no worse than elsewhere, but considerably cheaper.
