The breakfast on the weekend was a very nice buffet with cooked items prepared to order. The restaurant HIX where it is served is at pains to source Brittish farm produce (there were even duck eggs available). The atmosphere on the weekend was peaceful however come Monday morning the restaurant was invaded by local suits talking on their phones and having breakfast meetings which spoiled the ambience somewhat.

If I could give a piece of advice on where to go for an Afternoon Tea experience you won't forget in a hurry it would be \"Go to Brown's!\" I had been led to believe that no-one comes out of Afternoon Tea feeling satisfied that they've had enough. I was slightly worried about the steep price of Brown's when I compared with it other equally well-known London hotels, but without hesitation I can say that the whole thing was worth the money. I went with 2 of my friends from cookery school and our mission was to experience Afternoon Tea. The 3 of us, all tall young lads with healthy appetites, were not disappointed with the constant replenishment of the savouries, scones, sweets,and the all important Tea! I can also assure you that we were looking at every detail - It was flawless! From the simple egg and cress sandwich on white bread to the feature Victoria Sponge Cake that melted in your mouth. It is more expensive than other places in London but with the setting, the ambience, the service and the food, I think you'd go a long way to beat what's on offer here. Definitely a 10/10!", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, walking distance to tourist destinations, room service until late\u201d", "Author": "lilypad78", "ReviewID": "UR123360203", "Content": "Stayed here on busines for 3 nights in January and the service is impeccable. Checkout is 11:30 am, which was late enough if you woke up with a hangover but early enough that new clients will have their rooms ready in the early afternoon. If you checked in before your room is ready, ask to use their spa showers to freshen up and the hotel can accomodate you if they have a room free. Room = very spacious. Ask for one in higher floors and one that are even numbered (facing the back of the building). The floorplan for room 510, for instance, seems slightly bigger than room 411. The rooms generally do not have a view, but it doesn't matter. If you do face the street, the street in front is a narrow one way street and you are likely to be staring into the back facade of Tiffany's across the street. There isn't much of people watching in front of the hotel because it's not a major thoroughfare. This, of course, makes for a quiet stay at the hotel. Room amenities = walk in closet in our room (again, top floor), bowl of fruits upon arrival (although they don't replenish), complimentary bottled water during turndown service, robes and sandals (soft), and my favorite, an ipod dock with remote control. Showers = gorgeous. Rain showerheads built on top of the bathtub, plenty of towels and towel warmers that warmed our towels well. The sinks are spacious, the toiletries are top notch and my favorite part, a marble counter that is so large, I didn't know what to do with the space! I spread out all of my lotions, makeup and other knicks and knacks. Like all British toilets, the flush could be stronger but there is nothing to be done about that. There are also hidden speakers connected to the TV in the bedroom inside the bathroom, which is great when you are watching Law and Order and had to take a shower. One improvement would be installing a small tv screen in the bathroom as well. Considering how top notch this hotel was and how clear the speakers were, we were suprised we didn't find the tv screen. Room service was available until late, which we appreciated after a night out, especially because London pubs (and food places) close early. Donovan Bar = fun, good for people watching, fun bartender who recommended new drinks for us. Try the cheeseburger sliders. Teatime = surprisingly packed around 6p when my colleagues and I returned from the office. We were jetlagged so we fell asleep sitting up during teatime, but the tea selection was wonderful, the small sandwiches looked delicious. One of the things I would change about the hotel would be more meeting/lounge space in the lobby. There are stiff benches alongside the hallway coming into from the street to the reception area, but there is a lot foot traffic here so that's not a good place to sit. There are also benches/couches right in front of the receptionists but somehow, sitting there for longer than 5 minutes seem an imposition to the receptionists because you cannot help but watch them while sitting there. This is a small matter though and I only felt it because I found myself waiting for colleagues before we head out. If you are on vacation, it's doubtful that you will need the waiting area. A second thing that I would change would be complimentary wi-fi throughout the hotel. I paid 75 pounds for a weeks' worth of unlimited wi-fi and was able to use my ipad throughout the hotel and connected up 3 different devices into the same account. It wasn't so bad but I am not sure I would have paid for it had I been here on vacation. There are plenty of free wifi coffee shops along Piccadilly Street, which is about 3 blocks from the hotel. Location = from the hotel, was able to walk to Oxford Street/Circus, Piccadilly Street/Circus, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and Parliament, Chinatown and Covent Garden. High end shopping is right outside the hotel (LV, Cartier, Burberry, etc.).", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lymington", "Title": "\u201c'Brilliant' experience\u201d", "Author": "Boss17", "ReviewID": "UR123222366", "Content": "On an overnight business trip to London and couldn't have made a better choice of where to stay.

We had a trip booked around Buckingham Palace on the Sunday morning and it was great to just walk there through Green Park. From arriving at the hotel we were warmly greeted by a very friendly gentleman and the bags were taken care of without delay, after being escorted to reception we were greted by warm and welcoming staff who sorted out check in for us promptly and advised us that because it was my birthday we had received a room upgrade, which was a lovely touch. The room wasnt ready but they offered us a drink in the lounge and so we took them up on their offer. Unfortunately the waiter spilt hot tea everywhere when pouring, of course accidents happen, and the situation was made light of. When we got into the room (503) it was really nice, pretty spacious for a London hotel and was very well equipped, although I felt it was slightly tired with chipped / scuffed furniture etc. I slid the door open to reveal the minibar and safe and it came right off its rollers not the best of starts, but nothing to particularly worry about! We had several windows in the room over looking the street but no view to be honest, again not really an issue. Housekeeping did nothing about the door that came off its rollers and stayed propped up against the wall for the duration of our stay! The public areas are very nice, small and intimate but nicely funished with beautiful flowers and plenty of staff around. We used the bar before we went out for dinner and found that the staff there were a little less interested. There was a good selection of drinks, but I found them to be way overpriced by Mayfair standards. 2 Mojitos, 1 gin and tonic and 1 coke was over \u00c2\u00a350. I wouldnt have minded if the cocktails were any good but I can make better at home, with fresh lime wedges which they didnt use in the hotel!! We returned to the bar after dinner and found the atmosphere a little calmer but with another round of drinks costing too much money. Breakfast was included in my room rate, and at \u00c2\u00a329.50 per person for full English Im pretty pleased it was! It was of good standard, however the waiter forgot several things and it just made it a hassle getting the attention of the waiters / waitresses for things we needed. The buffet was great with a good selection and a wide variety of fresh fruits. If breakfast wasnt included in the rate I would have just gone to the Wolesley which is 2 minutes away and had the same for half the price, with better service! I found the restaurant nicely decorated and lovely linens etc but the atmosphere was pretty sombre, we didnt eat there in the evening so I cant comment but from my breakfast experience I wouldnt rush to have dinner in the restaurant. The hotel has 2 entrances, the main one being on Albemarle St and there is also one on Dover Street, which is pretty useful but they close it at odd times and when I asked the concierge he said that it is closed at the weekends, but it was open some of the time, so unfortunately couldnt get a straight answer out of him! All in all it was a pleasant stay, and as I booked through an online travel agent got it at a slightly cheaper rate. I would return to hotel if the price was right for the right type of room as the location is enviable but I probably would return to The Connaught Hotel as my first choice. My parents came with us and their room was a classic king and had a view of the courtyard, one small window and a drainage smell in the bathroom. If it was my room I would have complained but they didnt want a fuss.

The Royal Academy of Arts is literally less than five minutes' walk, and further afield is the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square and St Martins in the Fields.

THIS HOTEL IS A JOKE. IT IS A DISGUSTING, DANK HELL HOLE. It was by far, one of the very, very worst hotel experience that I have had in a very long time. I travel perhaps 3-4 months out of the year for both business and pleasure. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, and this one is really the very bottom of the barrel. For the $1000 per night I was charged, the owners should be arrested and jailed for fraud and deceptive marketing practices. I would have moved hotels immediately upon checking in, but it was the week of Wimbelton and London was booked solid. Where to begin, it was all so bad. I arrived late and was directed, not escorted, to my room. It was a dank, ground- floor room that reeked of body odor and mildew. The room's one window looked out on an air shaft that housed the building's air conditioning units and other machinery. I literally could have opened the window and walked across the shaft on top of the machinery. I felt like I was in the worst inner-city prison in Detroit. Because there was no sunlight at all in the room, it was humid and smelled of mold. I was just disgusted and called the front desk immediately and complained. I was transferred to the manager, an arrogant man with a French accent named Vincent, who told me that if I wanted to change rooms it would cost an additional 300-400$ per night. I then called Expedia, the on-line travel agent where I booked the disaster of a hotel. They called the hotel and the next day I was transferred to another room, that was not much better than the first. This time I literally faced a brick wall that was about 5 feet from the window. That was it, a white-painted brick wall outside the only small window in this tiny room. The renovation of the hotel is of the cheapest standard possible. The decor is hideous, and cheap, it looks like college dorm room -level furniture and decoration. During a week when it was brutally hot and humid in London, the air conditioning barely worked. The bathrooms and hallways in in the main part of the building ARE NOT air conditioned at all. The second you get out of the shower you are drenched in sweat because the bathroom are actually like saunas. The air conditioning can only be turned up to a certain point then it cannot be adjusted further . The hot water can only be turned to a certain luke -warmish level. Everything is so cut- rate and cheesy, it is really shocking. The front desk staff and other staff members are pleasant and well -meaning but totally inefficient. They smile and say \"yes, of course\" but nothing EVER gets done. I complained twice about the A/C and nothing was done. The room service food is inedible. I got a sandwich delivered to my room and lifted the metal cover that covered the plate to find the disgusting rotting remains of someone else's meal stuck under top. The lobby of this \"5-star\" hotel is like a doctor's waiting room, and a bad one at that. Narrow, ugly, uninviting. the whole experience was just a disgusting disappointment, BOOK A ROOM ELSEWHERE!!! The Holiday Inn would be a better idea.

The jam and cream for the mini scones was very nice however the scones themselves whilst pleasant were not outstanding - we had to ask for more.

Had booked the \"Romantic Retreats\" package directly with the hotel. Check-in was from 2pm and true to the package description my wife, as we were arriving seperately due to work commitments, was offered an upgrade from an Executive King to an Executive Deluxe. She was given the further option to wait a bit longer and upgrade even further to a Classic Suite and after some telephone consulatation we chose to wait for the Suite! My wife was shown to the Donovan Bar, read her book, people watched, and drank tea, coffee and a gin and tonic. Unfortunely the wait dragged on as the hotel was having a problem extracting the previous guest. The wait ended up being just under three hours but because we, I arrived two hours in, were kept informed and refreshed at the hotel's expense it really did not become a problem. The suite lived up to our expectations and was very spacious and well equipped. The bed was huge (super king) and there was even an LCD TV embedded in the wall at the foot of the bath! Fresh fruit (perfect cherries), champagne and chocolates were all forthcoming and the turndown service saw the arrival of candles, rose petals and bath salts....all very romantic. Having got into the room a bit late we then quickly got ready and went out for a meal at the nearby Wolesley on Piccadilly which I also recommend. A night at the theatre then followed and we returned for a nightcap to the Donovan Bar where live music was being played ( a jazz guitarist, so not too intrusive). Cocktails were excellent and the barman seemed very accomplished. The next morning we had breakfast in the room (included in the rate) and this was brought in in a hot trolley with the table in the room being laid by the room service staff.

Fans of Ian Fleming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sophisticated secret serviceman may already know that 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birth. To commemorate the occasion The Imperial War Museum in Lambeth is running a special Ian Fleming exhibition documenting the great man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life and featuring the fictional world of his legendary hero. Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit upon the idea of running a Bond break during which fans could take in the exhibition and experience a little of the glamour and excitement that life in Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast lane might offer. Imagine a stay in a luxurious suite at this most elegant of hotels, a chance to sip a classic Bond style Martini shaken for you in the legendary Donovan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar and then dinner in the stylish Albemarle restaurant, washed down with a bottle of Dom Perignon and a cultural excursion to The War Museum to gen up on your, I mean Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, creator. And yes, it really is as good as it sounds! The hotel, now part of the Rocco Forte Collection was opened in 1837 by Lord Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s butler, James Brown and his wife, Lady Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maid. The story that follows is amazing, Alexander Graham Bell made the first ever telephone call there in 1876, in 1871 Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie were guests and in 1886 Theodore Roosevelt stayed there. Rudyard Kipling was a regular guest, penning the Jungle Book during one stay and Queen Victoria used to pop in for tea of an afternoon. Franklin Roosevelt honeymooned in the royal suite in 1905 and both Heile Selassi of Ethiopia and King Zog of Albania sought refuge there while Mussolini was ransacking their respective countries. Agatha Christie stayed many times and based her book, At Bertram\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hotel on it and in 2003 Sir Rocco Forte bought it and organised a \u00c2\u00a324 million renovation. Today it is an impressive combination of historic elegance and contemporary modern style. The entrance and reception are discrete and unassuming, but the rooms, designed by Sir Rocco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister Olga Polizzi, have real wow factor. Huge beds, soft egyptian linen, silk cushions and angora throws, comfortable couches and sumptuous drapes plus the kind of hi-tech features Bond would have insisted on: widescreen TV with built in computer, music system and ipod dock. Our bathroom was fabulous, all limestone and mosaic with a shower large enough to battle Jaws in and a bath suitable for several Bond babes at once! To unwind from the last mission it only seemed sensible to book a relaxing massage in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small spa. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing as crass as a jacuzzi here, just three stylish treatment rooms, one a double in which you can be pampered alongside a friend or partner, and the most obliging and able of staff. The massage by Shareen was just the best I have ever experienced. Back in the room there were complimentary macaroons to sample - mmm, delicious and time to peruse the walk-in wardrobe where my selection of evening attire had been thoughtfully arranged for me. Actually I only had the one outfit, but fortunately the hotel is not at all stuffy and a smart shirt is dressy enough for dinner. It was time to pop downstairs to Donovan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar for a Bond style ap\u00c3\u00a9ritif, Martinis of course, shaken not stirred. My Vesper vodka and vermouth cocktail was very dry and extremely potent, while Amanda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Casino Royal mixed in champagne and fresh raspberry to add a fruity zest. Dinner in the Albemarle was amazing, half a dozen Duchy oysters, chicken livers on toast, treacle cured salmon, roasted scallops with hedgerow garlic, a juicy hanger steak, treacle tart with clotted cream and ginger parkin with vanilla icecream, superb. All delicious, perfectly cooked and presented from the new menu, overseen by Director of Food, Mark Hix. Sadly the Dom Perignon was a little over our budget, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure Bond would have appreciated the sparkling Italian Prosecco chosen as an alternative. Service was perfect, attentive and friendly and the interesting collection of huge photographs by Hubertus von Hohenlohe (perfect Bond villain name) were an interesting contrast to the vaulted ceiling, wood panelling and elegant green banquettes of the Albemarle. The evening was still youngish and a short after-dinner stroll led us to Heddon Street and the chilly repose of the Absolut Icebar. This is the ultimate concept bar, donning a fur trimmed cloak patrons step into below zero temperatures to drink vodka out of glasses made of ice. It sounds Bondish, but after ten minutes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d lost all feeling in my lips and was dribbling sticky cocktails down my chin. It was a similar state to Daniel Craig in Casino Royal, but he had been poisoned at the time! The next morning a spectacular Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast fortified us for our trip to the War museum and we headed across the river to Lambeth. The imposing museum is surprisingly interesting and engaging, with lots of hands on exhibits to show how frighteningly destructive mankind can be. The Fleming exhibition investigates the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, shows how his wartime experiences informed the Bond plots and gives a chance to examine some classic items of Bond memorabilia. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must for 007 fans. Sadly for me though, it was the final chapter in my Bond experience. My mission was a great success and I now know that Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is well and truly licenced to thrill. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFor your Eyes Only\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 package is a fabulous idea and back in the real world, I can console myself with the thought that perhaps I will one day return to do it all again, after all, Fleming himself said, you only live twice! Factbox: Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Fleming Centenary package includes: l Overnight accommodation in a luxurious room or suite l Full English breakfast (which is reputed to be Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite meal of the day) l Two tickets to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming and James Bond\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the new exhibition at the Imperial War Museum London (subject to availability). l Two Bond cocktails in The Donovan Bar l An exclusive, hardback copy of Ian Fleming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Casino Royale l Guests can also make use of The Spa.

In other words a very central location. Room: Fresh and modern without being arty minimalist. Wooden floors, white walls. Large bathroom. Views will never be great as it is on a Mayfair street and all houses incl hotel are low rise (5-6 floors I think). Bathroom is spacious and comfortable. Good shower pressure. The feeling of the hotel is quite unique for London I think. I find hotels like Lanesborough and Claridges be old and stuffy - one can feel a bit 'dusty' staying at those places. At the same time I do not like the modern pretensiousness of hotels like the Metropolitan. Brown's has achieved a very healthy balance between being a very dignified historic hotel that is at the same time modern and fresh. With personal no fuss service. Conclusion: the \"thinking man's\" 5* in London. The class of hotel and guests is confirmed and secure - hence both does not have to make a song and dance about their status.

Now I don't want to sound like a cocky foreigner, but shouldn't a 5 star hotel have top of the line irons - e.g. Stainless Steel Rowentas? If you're wondering if I don't know how to iron or not, I assure you being raised by my mother, I do. If you're also wondering if this iron was special circumstance, it wasn't, I asked for another one and had an even WORSE problem. But wait, the story gets better. So the next day I submit my custom shirt for dry cleaning (and go to my meeting in a wrinkled shirt). I get my shirt back that night with a hole in it. Clearly management is scared at this point because they leave frantic messages on my voicemail and door. The next day I lodge an official complaint and ask for a refund, but the response is that because the shirt was already \"burnt\", they wouldn't give me one. Wait a second, if the shirt was burnt, why wouldn't a so-called professional dry-cleaner call that out immediately? They should submit the shirt back instead of putting a damn chemical hole in it. Unfortunately logic doesn't work well with Browns because I'll now break it down to you: one successful business person to I suspect soon to be not to successful hotel. So Browns. In order to save 50 pounds on replacing my shirt, you will now lose a magnitude more.
