Since we do not go out after dark, we did not just stay at the hotel to sleep and have breakfast. THE EXTRA SPACE AND EXTRA KITCHENETTE SINK WERE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. The toilet and bathtub are separate from the two toiletry sinks, which is especially practical when sharing a room. Our room also had the beautiful backdrop of the autumn trees and Denny Park across the street. The location was also perfect, being about a 5 minute walk to the \"free ride zone\" of the downtown area on busses along 3rd Avenue, which can leave you right at the ferry terminal and the pleasant boat rides. Across the street from the Loyal Inn is a Korean/Japanese restaurant (Shilla), which we enjoyed more than once. As stated in another's review, Whole Foods is a short walk from this hotel. If you are not familiar with this upscale store, you really should find time to check it out. At Whole Foods, you can catch a trolley to nearby Lake Union, from which it returns to its other end, Westlake Center in the very heart of town. I also enjoyed evenings in the hotel's PC room where I kept up with my online scrabble buddies. If we were ever to return to Seattle, this is where we would stay. Well done, Samantha & co-workers, especially Kelly, Maria and Sean! I shouldn't really stop with those names, the housekeeping and food service staff also do excellent work.

We chose this hotel based on price and per my research, we thought the location would be fine. We did not have any issues with this hotel. It was decent for the price and the rooms were clean. The neighborhood was a little on the iffy side, but we walked to and from even at night with no issues. There were many cruisers staying at the hotel. I paid $107 internet rate for a king standard room. The room had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Loved the soap/lotion/shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the bathroom and shower. I have the same in my baths at home. Wish every hotel would use those instead of the tiny bottles. I have to comment on the mattress. It was great. We have stayed at many hotels in which the mattress was too firm with no give, which hurts the bones, but these were very comfortable. The hotel offered an extensive free continental breakfast, which was decent. The breakfast room is way too small for all the guests, so we never found a place to sit, so we would gather our plates and take back to our room to eat. They also offer free internet services with 2 computers. No issues getting to use them. They also had a small gym area and a cute indoor whirlpool. For our after cruise stay for one night, they put us in a deluxe King room for $147. I would have preferred just the standard room instead of paying the higher price. The room was much bigger though and the bathroom had 2 sinks with a wide closet area. There was also a wet bar with the frig. From research, I do not agree that the location of this hotel is the best place to be for first time visitors that really want to enjoy everything Seattle has to offer. It was a 10 block (long) walk to Pike Place Market. We walked the first day to get lunch and to look around. My parents decided they would not be doing that again. For them, trying to figure out and use the bus system or metro was not to their interest, so we took turns paying for taxis to/from where we needed to be. At least that keep our individual costs down. Additionally, there are no restaurants or bars in close vicinity to this hotel. And, by close vicinity, I mean within a couple of blocks. So in the future, I would next time pay a little more and get a hotel closer to the Market area. There is a Walgreens about 4 blocks down and the Space Needle is about 6 blocks from the hotel. It was a $10 taxi ride to Pier 91. For others that have no real issue in those features, the hotel is great and I would recommend.

However, under the circumstances she did her best and remained friendly - even with all of the phone calls! The room was very clean. It was a 2 double bed room - but compared to the other two hotels that we stayed in during this trip the double beds seemd very small. We liked the effort to be environmentally conscious. Think that having the toiletry dispensers is a great idea. It was nice to have the fridge and micro. Room size I would say was on the smaller size - as there was no table (but there was a desk). Interesting toilet. There were only 2 sets of towels, so we had to ask at the front desk for 2 more bath towels, but they saw to it right away and I would say it was less than 15 minutes before they arrived at the room. A/C in the room worked well and was quiet enough to be kept on through the night. One of the things I hate the most is having to pay for parking. It is 10.00 here, plus tax. While I understand that lots of hotels are doing this now, it is a little annoying - especially when there are available parking spots. The breakfast was fair. Some interesting eggs - looked liked pancakes and you had to warm them up in the micro. Only one micro though and there was a wait for it.

The location to all of the popular attractions is perfect. The one thing you'll learn about Seattle is that you'll get used to walking! While you can easily get around town in a rental car, it's much easier to just use your legs! In regards to the hotel, it was very clean and includes your typical amenities, including shampoo, body wash, lotion and conditioner. This hotel uses a \"pump\" system to dispense the various items in the shower as well as at the sink, preventing a TON of waste with the little bottles! There is also a safe, refrigerator and microwave in the two different rooms that we stayed in (two double beds as well as a single double bed room). The front desk staff was helpful, even though there was a little mixup when we checked in. There had been a large group that had checked in earlier in the day that wanted to move their rooms around for whatever reason. The person that had been working during that period accidentally gave away our room (two double beds) and we ended up staying in a single bed room for the night. The staff person quickly offered a lower price on the smaller room and indicated we could switch to our correct room the following night. No harm, no foul on that! One thing to watch out here is the breakfast room, especially on the weekend. We went into the room around 9am and it was a NUT HOUSE. They do not have enough seating for the size hotel that it is, so plan on getting your food and taking it back to your room. The other guests I found to be very rude in the breakfast room, acting as if it was their last meal. But, I guess that can sometimes be expected when there are free items in the room! The pool/whirlpool/sauna are all open 24 hours, which was nice, since most hotels close their pools/spa area down around 10-11pm. Parking is $10/night, but free parking is VERY rare anywhere in the greater Seattle area. However, if you use Foursquare, you can check-in to the hotel location and unlock a free parking special! (At least as of when I was there last week...) All in all, I would say that I would have no problem staying here again, especially with the location.

It's rare to get a sauna in the US, so if I can find one, I go for it. The sauna - and hot tub - did not disappoint. They were clean and fully operational. Towels were on hand and the space was relaxed and quiet. Three of us were enjoying it that evening. I called ahead to make sure that the sauna was working and the answer surprised me.. that they indeed do have issues with it but that it seemed to be fine these days. So call ahead if this matters to you. The location of the hotel is excellent for proximity to downtown attractions as well as I-5 access. It's on a busy street, but I did not notice the traffic as I selected the quiet (alley) side. This hotel is very close to the start of the Seattle ride free zone, so free bus transport is readily available from this location, a money-saving perk. The Space Needle and Seattle Center are walkable. In fact, I had a nice view of the Space Needle from my room. The room was clean and attractively decorated. The beds were fine. The shower was fantastic. Water pressure the Sheratons and Hyatts I've stayed at recently cannot compare with. These are important features in a hotel room and they are all excellent for the price. Here's my little rant: One thing I notice in this hotel as well as most others nowadays is the abominable product that passes for in room coffee. Micro coffee maker with hyper plastic wrapped coffee inserts, and chemical \"cream\" and \"sugar\"... 90% plastic unwrapping, 10% coffee? I'd have to be an automaton to call this food. I am not buying the \"eco friendly\" room marketing on that note alone. Tea drinkers? Bring your own, and expect the coffee aftertaste from passing it through the same filter. In short, in room coffee has become a degenerate experience. To pass the eco friendly test, this whole concept has to be improved. Especially in Seattle where excellent coffee, high grade tea brands and eco-friendliness are a way of life. Luckily, this hotel includes breakfast and it is filling, with waffles, toast, cereal fruit, and yes, decent coffee and tea selection. The hours on breakfast service are generous. Though check-in was a bit chaotic, the staff is attentive and accommodating On the whole I'd say it was a real hotel for real people.

However, compared to other higher rated hotels, it probably is still a good deal. We got the only suite in the hotel. The place is not meant for hanging around the hotel; better for having a place with adequate facilities (free wi-fi, hot tub, fitness facility, A/C, flat-screen TVs, community-style continental breakfast) after you spend the day exploring.

Internet was a little sketchy, so was the cable reception. No DVD players, but you can hook your own up to the TV. The location is definitely the strong point here...walking distance to all the attractions. Rental car is handy, but be prepared for city rates for parking, especially by the piers and Pike Place (you have to pay $10/day to park at the hotel as well). There is a Whole Foods, Walgreens, Starbucks, a small park for kids and a variety of restaurants nearby. If you are a fitness freak, read on...Fitness facility is barely adequate - an elliptical, stationary bike and stair-stepper...that's it. No weights or resistance training. There is a 24-hour fitness facility nearby, but the hotel did not have a discount or deal package with it.

(One negative, it was next to what appeared to be a storage area and the houskeeping staff tended to congrate outside my door but I got used to it) I balanced it by the fact that I could go right down the stairs to the whirlpool on the first floor without going thru the lobby . There is also a sauna and small exercise room all open 24 hours and only acceible by your room key. The night I used the whirlpool, I had it to myself which was wonderful and towels are provided.

Water pressure was good in shower. Other amenties included coffemaker, hair dryer, ironing board and iron. Unfortunatley there was no microwave or refrigator and I must admit this is the first hotel I have stayed in over 20 years that didn't have a least one or the other. There was wireless internet access in the room which my laptop logged onto with a problem and I never lost the connection.

Booked via ---.com. When the internet price had dropped between my online booking and arrival, I telephoned and Jacob honored the lower price. Also used that advance phone call to verify 2 people with lots of luggage needed two beds. All rooms are non-smoking. Our clean room 422 was on the quiet (er) side of the building, facing the alley and not Denny Way. It was average size, had 2 upholstered chairs, 1 square table, 2 luggage racks, the compact flourescent bulbs in the 3 lamps gave off more than adequate bright white light, bathroom sink in alcove separate from room with tub/toilet. Continental breakfast, free local calls, free local shuttle, jacuzzi, on bus line. Great location north of (and away from) the downtown skyscrapers; gives a sense of breathing room with the city park across the street. My previous stay, Nov 05, was in a kingsize room with wetbar, refrig/MW . For WELL UNDER $100/night in the off-season, when their nicer rooms are certainly available, this BW Loyal is my choice over anything Priceline has ever put me in.

Anthonys for one will validate your parking and at night has free valet, so we did not have a problem being away from downtown to stay. The staff was very friendly, the use of the internet free, and the free breakfast of waffles, cereal and rolls made it a good place to stay. The room was comfy, clean and the hot water plentiful.
