Then I was mentally prepared for a really tiny room after reading all the reviews. Size wise I think it was just nice for me. However, do note there is no window, so I wouldn't recommend this to people with claustrophobia. Whereas, for me I like the concept, it blocks away all the street sounds. If you really want to see what's outside,just go out! Its just a 2 mins walk to Jordan MTR and 5 mins walk to temple street and downstairs is filled with food stores. A happy bustling place I would say. Furthermore there is free wifi! My boss stayed in a different hotel as me and paid twice the amount i paid. So he got a room twice the size of mine, but no free wifi. It really depends on what you want. I didn't give them the full rating because the staff were disinterested half the time. But that didn't bother me too much, since I didn't have any issues during my stay.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNarrow.Good location.

So negatives: What I wasn't happy with was that the bed was clearly made for an umpa lumpa not a human being. There was enough room to put a proper length single bed into the room yet the bed was probably only suitable for people up to 5'5-5'6 max. At 5'11 my feet were hanging out the end. The shower cubicle had one of the 2 sliding doors missing so the bathroom got soaked with every shower. The pop up waste in the sink got stuck everytime it was pushed in, so after every shave i had to leave this for the cleaners/maintenance to sort, only to repeat the process the following morning. The towels are tiny and too small, there's no safe in the room, and the only safe available behind reception is also tiny and not big enough for anything bigger than a small camera. The aircon although functional seemed to slow down well before the set temperature, and the room never seemed to get cool enough, I was regularly waking up in the night boiling hot, regardless of what i set on the air con. The reception are pretty uninterested in most things. I wouldnt say they were rude, they were pleasant enough, just nothing seems to ever get done. positives: the room was clean and tidy, and the hotel well located. There's a macDs just around the corner on Jordan Road. Handy for breakfast as the hotel has no restaurant and im not fan of eating rice for breakfast. Underground is a great and cheap way to get around HK so the station was dead handy. Pick up an octopus card and airport express ticket at the airport, get express to HK/Central and then train to Jordan from central, 2mins and your at hotel. Temple night market is literally the next street too so handy to get in some last minute shopping before you leave. If you just need somewhere to lay your head for a couple of nights, this place is bearable, but tbh I think if I had the time again i would of been better off in a hostel. Most of the benefits of a hotel over a hostel are pretty much lost in this place.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLocation is excellent, but I wouldn't stay here again\u201d", "Author": "jetsetboy", "ReviewID": "UR99393564", "Content": "Though Goodrich Hotel advertises free Internet, it does not work. It doesn't work in the rooms, nor in the lobby. I even asked the front desk clerk if there was someone she could call to get it fixed, and she said 'no.' When I'm traveling, I must have Internet access in my room so that I can do work, and that's why I had purposely chosen this hotel, because they advertised that they had Internet service. Having now looked at some online reviews of the place, even a month ago someone complained that Internet was not working in the room. So at this point it's false advertising. Also, they allow smoking in the rooms, and the walls are so think that if someone in the room next to you starts smoking, your room will fill up with smoke as well. Not good at all! Carpet was also filthy. I don't recommend this hotel and would NOT like to stay there again.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but comfortable and well located. Tiny Room.\u201d", "Author": "TeamLimaBean", "ReviewID": "UR39887418", "Content": "This is the right kind of hotel for a certain kind of traveller. This hotel is meant for those who are looking for basic, clean, affordable, no frills accomodation in a convenient location. Pros: 1. It`s clean. The rooms are tidy. The bathrooms have been recently re-done and are clean and modern. 2. It`s conveniently located. It`s a quick 3 minute walk from Jordan subway Station and one street away from the thriving Temple Street Night Market. Tons of restaurants and shops nearby. You can also catch a shuttle bus straight to the airport, just up the road. 3. It`s affordable. Hong Kong hotels can be pricey. Goodrich is relatively cheap, about $50-$60 Canadian a night---even cheaper in the off-season. 4 There`s air conditioning. There is a window mounted AC unit in each room. Very necessary in the impossibly humid summer months. 5. There`s a TV mounted on the wall with a couple of Hong Kong channels and a phone with free local calling. Cons: 1. First and foremost, the rooms are TINY (really really tiny). If you have a large suitcase, it will take up all of your floorspace. Not for the claustrophobic! 2. The walls are thin. 3. No view. The rooms have windows, but they look into an alley. Tips: 1. If you`re travelling in a pair, ask for the Twin Room instead of the Double Room. Both types of rooms are very small, but the Twin Room has slightly more floor space, which makes a world of difference when you`re looking for a place to put two suitcases. The disadvantage is that you and your spouse will sleep in separate twin beds, but at least you`ll each have a place to put your bags! 2. If you`re travelling with 3-4 people, ask for the Triple Room. I chose the Goodrich because my family stayed there exactly one year before my visit and had good things to say about it. They booked the Triple Room, which apparently is quite spacious and was excellent value. In short, there`s nothing luxurious about this hotel. The Goodrich is right for you if you`re just looking for a clean, affordable, central place to sleep at night.", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cIs this run by Chinese Mob?\u201d", "Author": "fit2day", "ReviewID": "UR33983553", "Content": "The service is Terrible and room is super small.
