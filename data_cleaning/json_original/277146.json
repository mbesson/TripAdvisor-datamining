The hotel is clean, comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful, especially Michael. The meals ranged from excellent to okay-service was fantastic! The hotel is outside the city center of Rome and takes approximately 45 minutes to get into the city center by bus and metro. This was not a problem because at night I was able to sleep well because the hotel area was quiet and peaceful.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Hotel but Remote\u201d", "Author": "gladiola", "ReviewID": "UR118384395", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights in early September; booked on-line and location appeared to be within a short drive to outskirts of Rome; was I wrong! We literally could not find this hotel; there is a mixup between Via Vermicino, and the actually town of Vermicino. We wasted at least 2 hours searching for it; never brought our GPS but then again, unless you have the correct information to input, you don't get the results. Asking numerous local people resulted in several different directions until I called the hotel and asked for help. The hotel is very comfortable; the bed and room sizie is good; we had a nice balcony. Breakfast was the usual array of sweets, few cold cuts, cereal, and the fette biscottate (dried toast). Cappucino's were good. We had dinner in the hotel one night; nothing to rave about. I found most hotel food is simply mediocre so we sought some good eateries elsewhere. We had our own car, fortunately, but getting to Rome was another adventure in futility; wrong directions making what is to be a 20 minute drive about one and a half hours! Honestly, I am simply amazed at the lack of knowledge from the front receptionist people. In summary, Michael who was at the desk as well as Fabrizio did their best to direct us but obviously are not good at giving directions as they most likely just drive by instinct. We spent one day at Castel Gandolfo (Pope's summer residence); the small beach was secluded and good. Lunch was at a local restaurant and the food was delicious. Good hotel if you want to stay away from the city centre.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town Central, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cStrongly recommend that you DON'T stay here\u201d", "Author": "AP2268", "ReviewID": "UR76653747", "Content": "We booked this hotel as we saw it was a \"Hot deal\" on HRS... and the distance from the airport (Campiano) didn't appear to be that far. However, the location was really terrible. We thought that we would be able to use the shuttle advertised on the site, but that is not always available and we were not able to secure it for our arrival. We ended up traveling as per the concierge's recommendation by shuttle, and then train and then when we were supposed to take the last bus (10:30pm) we were told they don't run that late and then still had to pay over 40 Euro for a taxi (in addition to the train fare and bus fare). Basically, if you're travelling with public transport - I would steer clear of this hotel as it is just too far out and the shuttle service is unreliable. We booked it for a specific pick up at night and it didn't pitch up and the hotel staff member who was accountable was completely unapologetic (and downright defensive and rude) even though he knew it was his mistake. I also really felt uncomfortable walking to the hotel from the bus station at night and it's way more than the supposed 600m (from the bus stop) advertised by the hotel. The bus is also difficult to find, not really timeous and the bus stop information advertised by the hotel is incorrect. The room was quite grubby (cobwebs on the ceiling) and the beds were ROCK hard. The linen wasn't nice and it wasn't changed at all during our stay. The breakfast was really bad and not worth going for. The little stuff they did have was stale and tasted terrible. I would recommend finding a hotel closer to the Grand Termini so as not to waste 2 hours or more of your day travelling to your hotel. It will also allow you to stay out later in the evenings as you will not have to be concerned about public transport safety and operating times.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, NH", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, but far from central Rome\u201d", "Author": "greywolf855", "ReviewID": "UR75619126", "Content": "Beautiful facility, and excellent breakfast.
