On the way into town we requested that our rooms be changed and they were able to do that, no problem-no hassle at all. When we got there they surprised us by congratulating us on our anniversary by putting it up on their marquee. We were surprised and pleased and used this as a photo op for memories of our anniversary and our visit to Branson! They were able to give us advice on what to do at SDC, which our entire family enjoyed in spite of the much needed rain which arrived during our stay. Our daughter brought her Ipod and needed to charge it, and didn't have a way to charge it, Jodi very graciously allowed our daughter to charge her ipod and was willing to return it to our room. We really appreciated this and it was no hassle at all. The breakfast was good to have on both morning in town and then on our way out.

The entire staff is extremely friendly and willing to help in any way they can. The rooms are rather small, but are immaculate. The beds, while comfortable enough, are a tad bit worn and could stand to be replaced. The first room we stayed in had an old style, rather small television, while the new one had a nice sized flat screen. I assume they are slowly replacing all of the televisions. The swimming pool, while small, was clean and the kids loved it. Breakfast was just average, with frozen waffles (thawed and ready to toast), very good biscuits and gravy, bread to toast, a few types of cereal, and canned fruit. Very adequate for the money you pay to stay here. While more items (yogurt, fresh fruit) would be nice, it is probably not feasible to provide this and still keep costs down. As long as you realize this is a small, family owned motel, and not a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn Express (along with their higher prices), you will not be disappointed. Nothing fancy, but definitely a great little place to stay.

It is not luxurious in any stretch of the imagination, but if you are active vacationers and just need a place to crash and sleep, then this motel is more than fine. All that said, the most striking aspect of this property is that it is literally right next door to Silver Dollar City. If your plans include visiting SDC, you should strongly consider staying at this property. They have a free shuttle to the park (every couple of hours), but we were traveling with small children and wanted the flexibility of being able to leave when we wanted. When we left, we took the Indian Point exit from the parking lot. This exit \"spits\" you out literally right next to the entrance to the motel. From Tram Stop 2, it couldn't have been more than a 90 second drive! This was awesome when we had two hot, dirty, exhausted kids and wanted to get back to our room immediately! We stayed in a one-bedroom kitchenette and it looked just like the photo on the website, except the TV was updated. The room also had a small coffee table and two chairs at the front of the room. For a motel, the room was incredibly quiet - we didn't hear a peep from other rooms, except once when the kids in the room above us were stomping on the floor. Everything in the room was clean and in good shape. The shampoo - well, \"hair and body wash\" - is mounted in a dispenser in the back wall of the tub/shower. My son enjoyed the pool, which is on the small side and gets crowded after dinner. There's a convenience store within walking distance which we used to buy milk, snacks, sodas, etc. to keep in our kitchenette. Jodi in the Front Office was incredibly friendly and accommodating.

I went to the office and they graciously provided their own personal salt and pepper shakers until we could purchase our own at the nearby convenience store. Only negative comment that I have would be concerning the breakfast. Choices were cold cereal, a bowl of chunked mixed fruit, biscuits and gravy(no sausage), toaster waffles, and toast. I realize that for the money, you are not going to get a full hot breakfast, but a few changes to their menu would result in a better experience in my opinion, and not add too much expense. The biscuits were wonderful, so a little bit of sausage in the gravy would have been perfect. Also the purchase of a couple of commercial waffle makers, and some batter would be a cheap and easy way to upgrade the frozen waffles. Coffee seemed a little weak also. But overall, I would sum it up by repeating what I have as the title, as it was a clean, affordable, and convenient place to stay, and we enjoyed our time there as well.

The breakfast is average with donuts, cereal, waffles, milk, juice, etc. The shuttle though was a little bit deceiving. The shuttle was a SDC shuttle and only ran every hour and a half, starting at 9:15 in the morning. We missed the first shuttle and just decided to drive and park.
