My husband was there for a meeting, and my daughter and I went along. The hotel was OK, in my opinion. First, the layout of the hotel is rather inconvenient and awkward. We arrived late at night and had a hard time finding the check in lobby, as it is located on the 25th floor. The concierge, who is located on the ground floor, was off duty due to the late hour, and the signs were not clear. Once in the lobby, you must transfer elevators to access guest room floors. Also, you must access two elevators and walk a distance to the pool. The pool area was plain, but very nice and well kept. Towels were provided. The room was very clean, with comfortable beds. It was average size, with nice snacks in the mini bar. Also, the concierge and front desks provided free bottles of water, which was nice. However, I felt the room was way overpriced. Our basic room was $349 a night. Breakfast buffet was good. About the same as I have had at Embassy Suites, another Hilton Hotel. It was reasonably priced given the location and choices, but at $349 a night, I feel it would have been a nice touch to include it with the room price. 22% gratuity was automatically added, but the service was good, so we opted not to change it. Room service food was okay at best, and they got our order wrong. It was expensive, but no more so than you would expect for room service. The staff was excellent. Very friendly valet, front desk, and restaurant staff. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. They were the best part of the hotel! Location was fine if you are looking for a meeting place only, which seems to be their specialty. There was a lot of construction around the hotel, which made it a little noisy. Personally, I prefer South Beach area or somewhere else, but there were some restaurants and other things close by. Cab rides to South Beach and most other places we went were about $25-$35, one way, which is expected. Overall, I give the hotel an average rating, with higher marks for cleanliness and service.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cPre Cruise\u201d", "Author": "lmgreen", "ReviewID": "UR125457276", "Content": "We spent one night at the Conrad before leaving on a cruise from the nearby Miami seaport.

I tend to have very high standards, and the Conrad met every one of them. The hotel itself is gorgeous. From the modern decor to the impeccable views, I was not at all dissapointed. The location was walking distance to a lot of shopping and restaurants, and it was in a safe area of town. The staff throughout the hotel were beyond accommodating. A few examples: 1) I needed a safety pin (emergency wardrobe malfunction) and the girl at the front desk searched through their back office for at least 5 minutes to find one. 2) The waitress at the bar completely customized a food and drink order for my colleague and I because we were being indecisive and couldn't find anything on the menu that we were in the mood for. 3) The staff for our event (specifically Rosie, Ingrid and Manuel) went out of their way to ensure that our expectations were being met. If I had a request, they didn't ask any questions and made it happen. The meeting rooms were great. The windows allowed for a more comfortable feeling in the room, as most hotel meeting rooms are cramped and do not have any natural light. The food was wonderful, and they had many unique options to offer. The hotel room was outstanding. I was upgraded to a suite, and the entire layout was perfect. The bed was comfortable, and since all of the hotel rooms are located on higher floors, you are not disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the Miami streets. Above all else, the quality of the hotel and the meeting services that we received was well worth the average amount of money that was spent. You cannot beat the room rates or the service prices at this hotel. I was very satisfied with my experience at this venue.

We were given a 2 bedroom apartment compete with full kitchen, living room, 2 four piece bathrooms and balcony. It was so awesome I didnt even want to go on our scheduled tours but would rather remain in the room. Prior to going on this trip we were in contact with Alejandro, concierge with Conrad Hilton, who went over and above what we asked to arrange 2 day tours, transportation and helped with plans prior and post trip. We went on a cruise and then returned for one night and were treated with the same respect as those who stayed a week. When we returned we were given a 'regular' room which was once again very sufficient and plenty of space for the two of us. The bathrooms in this property are huge and the beds are very nice sized. The rooms provide robes and slippers for each guest. The workout room provide a wide array of machines plus snacks and warms towels. The hotel is a bit away from Bayside but a free Metromover is across the street which takes you to Bayside and a few places to shop and places to walk around.

Just know that street parking is metered from 7 am until midnight 7 days/week and you can only buy 3-hours at a time (about $5.00). Because we weren't at the hotel much, that was fine. If you are leaving your car in the hotel area for a long time, then it makes sense to pay $26 for 24-hours in the self-parking structure. Breakfast was included in my rate (hilton honors gold). Otherwise, it would have been $60 for the two of us each morning. The buffet was very good and clean, but not sure I would have paid $60 for it. Wireless in the room wasn't the best, but it was okay in the lobby. They also have 2 computers for use with free printing in the lobby.

We had a very pleasant stay in a 2 bedroom condo suite. Without question the view of Biscayne Bay, South Beach and the Cruise Port was outstanding. The room amenities were what was expected at a hotel of this caliber. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating. The breakfast buffet was expensive but outstanding and worth the price. We enjoyed the close location to the metro-mover which allowed us to leave the car and travel to Bayside for shopping without worrying about parking. There were, however, a couple of issues we found with this hotel that we felt made it not quite perfect: 1> The room, while very nice and certainly spacious, was in need of some basic repair. When we entered the room the refrigerator was leaking water from the door ice dispenser. Water was all over the floor in the kitchen area. Luckily I spotted this before we slipped on the water. I had to adjust the ice dispenser and the problem was solved. If you tried to use the dispenser again, it would malfunction again. Also, the A/C unit did not work well in our unit. We couldn't get our unit to pump out cold air. Fortunately the temps were in the low 60's as night so we were ok but there is no possible way the A/C unit would keep the room cool on an average warm day in Miami. Also, the microwave had a slight burnt smell about it when we used it to warm some water for tea. These are just a few of the minor issues we found with the room that made the stay slightly less than perfect. 2> The pool area. For such an upscale hotel, the pool area is very plain. Looking at other hotels in the area, pools are a gather spot and were more tropical, lush and offered private cabanas. The Conrad pool was plain and basic. Unfortunately even the hot-tub didn't work. Again, nothing earth-shattering but for a hotel such as the Conrad, it should be a no-brainer. A little investment in the overall area would make a big impression. While I would stay at the Conrad again, I would probably try another hotel first to get a better comparison.

Unlike many UK Hiltons who will not upgrade you unless you ask, European and Stateside Hiltons will do so unless they absolutely cannot. Also given breakfast as a courtesy, and whilst others have commented on this upgrade not including the automatic gratuity, it would be churlish to moan about paying $4 for an otherwise free (and excellent) breakfast. Especially when you have that breakfast on the terrace overlooking the bay. Room-wise, over 2 short stays here I was upgraded both times to a large corner residence room with kitchenette and huge living area. It's a seriously good room. Others have commented on the Illy espresso machine: it really is good. Beds are very comfy indeed. Huge bathroom with ample toiletries. All staff are helpful but not \"artificial\". The bar is good value for a hotel of this status: if this were New York you could easily add 50% to the cost of that martini. The in house restaurant is not cheap but is good value, serves genuinely very very good food (no seasoning required, always a decent benchmark) and the wines are excellent. If you really can't stomach the cost of that (and if you are staying at the Conrad, that does seem a bit unlikely), the Gordon Biersch brewpub a half a block away does excellent diner fare with a twist with good microbrews.

Overall, despite its business district location, a high end Hilton group hotel that made me feel welcome, a valued customer, and was uber comfy. This was my first time in Miami.

The view out towards Biscayne Bay from our 18th floor room was partly obstructed by adjacent buildings but was still spectacular. The only drawback was the noise - a slight gap under the room door allowed noise to easily travel into the room, and doors slamming loudly in the corridor were heard well into the early hours. However the staff were very kind in their response to this. We mentioned this noise issue when a staff member (Emily) happened to phone the room on our second night to check whether we were settling in OK. Obviously not much could be done to remedy the situation, but they called back to offer us complimentary breakfast including gratuity.

The arrival in the garage is very cool. Efficient and elegant. Go in the doors and to the left to the elevator up to the 25th floor and the doors open to a neat check in lobby area. It was an excellent check in for us. No delays. Room was ready upon arrival. The room was a suite on the 31st floor with a balcony and a kitchen. Full sized refrigerator that had a great ice maker, excellent coffee machine, dishwasher, etc. The room itself was very, very nice. Well decorated. Light airy, European to me. A full living room with a bar to eat and an seperate bedroom. It had a half bath and a full bath with a wonderful shower. The view on the balcony was decent. Would have been a bit disappointed if I had paid, but not enough to ruin the stay. We looked into a condo across the way, but to the right was the Bay and to the left was the city...we were fortunate enough to have a afternoon thunderstorm that was simply awesome. About 45 minutes of flash - boom. Right on top of us. Unbelieveable colors in the sky. A few things that I would like to see with the room: 1. there is only one trash can in the whole place and it was located under a table in the bedroom. Nothing in the bathroom, and nothing in the kitchen. It was very annoying to have to carry debris from the bathroom and kitchen to this little trash can in the bedroom. I did ask the wonderful staff for another and they brought me one, but why??? 2. The amenties in the bathrooms are great - for a woman. Trying to not sound sexist here, but the smell is a wonderful femine scent...not too manly! I live with my wife and 3 daughters so I just said what the hell, but I prefer the Peter Noth like in other Hiltons or even Marriotts Body Works..it seems to fit both men and women...3. No telephone in the front room...Ok...truth be told...only the trash can thing bothered me!!! Since we were going to be drinking at South Beach, we cabbed it from the hotel. Bellmen secured the cab...told them where to take us (Wet Willies on Ocean). The traffic Saturday was bad so the cost was about 30 - tip inclusive. Coming back it was 20 - tip inclusive. No problem for us getting a cab during the daytime from the beach. As an aside...South beach is expensive...18 bucks for a double gin and tonic...10 bucks for other drinks...do some asking around if this is prohibitive for you to get better deals...food was good though and at least we could taste the alchohol! OH and TIPS WERE INCLUDED EVERYWHERE WE WENT! Not sure if its city wide..just check the bill. I hate to bring expense up - but this was expensive - and I lived in Tokyo for 3 years! As a Diamond member we got the breakfast free - it was 60 bucks daily. Internet was free (not really sure of the charge, but had to have been at least 10 bucks)...Valet was a deal breaker for me..45 a night...highest i have ever paid...drinks were also pricy, but we expected that. For breakfast we were not aware that you can order omlets to made as part of breakfast until we were leaving after we finished our last day...you have to apparently ask. They ran out of eggs and sausage, but the wait staff worked very hard to make up for all this...and when they did get us sausage it was the best breakfast sausage I had... Could not eat in the restaurant because it was closed for a wedding. Not a fan of not advising a guest of this at check in. There was no other place to eat...Restaurant and Bar both closed...we walked to the Gordon Birsch and 75 bucks later walked out after having a couple burgers and a bottle of wine...you also can walk to two steak houses - one a Mortons. All over the internet there was talk of the Happy Hour at the bar on friday...great vibe, people, music, etc...get there to check it out after getting into the room...nothing. no more HH on Friday's. There were a LOT of foreign people (not all Hispanic) that made us feel like we were again ex pats in Tokyo. That was cool... Overall, the place was very cool. the staff was excellent. The room was good...location was fine. The food at the breakfast was very good...not worth the cost if we paid..Miami traffic is a pain. If you drive get there before or after rush hour. Not sure we return if we had to pay for it all though..It would have been almost 1300 just to pay for room, internet, food and drinks...NY Times on Sunday was very cool.

The hotel is extraordinary, particularly in the service area. We have stayed at Conrad hotels in Asia and Europe (see my reviews for Singapore, Hong Kong and Brussels) but never before in the USA where there are very few Conrad hotels and we wanted to see how this one compared. The major negative difference is that the Conrad Miami does not have a Concierge/VIP Lounge which is one of the outstanding features of the Asian (not Brussels) Conrad Hotels. However, as a Hilton HHonors Diamond member we were furnished an outstanding breakfast each morning with a choice of buffet, menu or even room service (which we did not use). I wrote the hotel before our arrival about my wife's birthday and thanks to Laura Padrino, VIP Relations Manager, and Sylvia Carrilo, Executive Assistant to the General Manager, we were greeted like visiting royalty. Noteworthy was the helpful welcome from the Front Desk, particularly Jenny who continued to provide outstanding service to us throughout our stay! The service throughout the hotel was impeccable - friendly and caring, yet very professional. The hotel is starkly modern, with an Asian feel to the decor. The rooms are quite large and most, if not all, appear to have gorgeous views of Biscayne Bay and the downtown Miami skyline seen through countless walls of glass (no balconies except a small one ajacent to the Atrio Restaurant on the 25th floor) All the usual amenities (fine linens, bath toiletries, turn-down service, etc) found in upscale hotels are present and at room rates which seem more reasonable than at other similar-type hotels nearby (Four Seasons, Mandarin, JW Marriott and several Ritz-Carltons). We ate one dinner at the hotel in the Atrio Restaurant which was excellent menu-wise and outstanding service-wise (Alicia was our server). Once we got accustomed to the rather odd layout (one set of elevators to lobby on 25th floor, another set of elevators to the guest rooms, and a third set to the swimming pool, tennis courts and spa on the roof-top of an adjacent building) we fell into the routine of navigating the hotel with no problems. The layout is explained to take maximum advantage of the outstanding views. In summary, the Conrad Miami is a wonderful hotel for a holiday get-away or a business visit to Miami. It is very conveniently located, valet parking is expensive but very prompt, and the Concierge service takes very good care of any transportation or local reservation needs.

First, the staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. The service was spectacular. No problems at all with that aspect of my stay. We had three meals served by the hotel. There was kind of a cuban theme for dinner and lunch. It was mostly very good, and the food stands out because it was not the typical hotel fare. But it was still pretty good. Breakfast was fairly standard, which was great. Give me bacon, eggs, and waffles and I'm happy. My room on the 19th floor was showing its age. I included photos of the layout but did not get up close and personal with the problem areas. At some point in the past this was a very nice room. But now the woodwork is scraped and rubbed around the edges, the upholstery on the chair is worn and stained, and the lamp shades won't stay straight. The curtains and ceiling have dirt or marks here and there. It's not terrible, but noticeable. Regarding cleanliness: not too bad, but whoever was cleaning my room must have been shedding. Found three long black hairs in different places around the room. Two were in the bathroom, including one on the hand towel. The view of the water was nice. I could not see a beach anywhere close from my window view. There is a pool and a tennis court, probably because the building is also a residence, but I did not use them. Had a drink at the bar. It was fine and again, very good service. Nice little patio to feel the breeze. This is on the 25th floor so there is a decent view. About the weird layout. You pull up to the front and take the elevator to the lobby on the 25th floor to check in. This is the same elevator for the meeting rooms on 2 and 3. Your actual room for sleeping is avaliable only from a different elevator accessible only from the 25th floor. So I found myself getting on the elevator on 19, up to 25, get off, change elevators, and back down to 3rd for my meeting. Bizarre, but again it's not terrible. Just takes some getting used to. In the morning I could hear the neighbors on the other side of the wall getting up and about. Not a completely quiet experience.

Our experience with Hilton's has generally been great previously (we stayed in the Hilton in Sandton, South Africa and never had a better experience) Unfortunately this wasn't the case with the Conrad. There was no concierge floor and virtually no benefits to being a Gold Hilton Honours member. When we checked in the front desk very reluctantly gave us two tickets for drinks in their restaurant/bar and let us know that we had been upgraded to a 'Bayview\" room. We were on the 22nd floor and our upgrade was to a room right next to the elevator with a filthy carpet - but we could see water! Our next surprise was when we came to the bar that first night to use our drink tickets. The drinks were free but the automatic 18% gratuity (I must admit that they do write on your bill that the 18% can be adjusted - just tell the server to raise or lower it) based on the very high cost of the drinks was added onto the bill. We were staying at this property for 9 nights and we felt too awkward to tell the server to reduce the tip to a more reasonable level. Silly us - with a built in tip the service was rude, and just about non-existent. One evening we sat for close to 30 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink orders in a basically empty bar. And when we did get the drink it was slapped down on the table. As Hilton Gold we did get complimentary breakfast buffets and the food was quite good but the service was identical to the evening bar service. After a couple of days of tolerating this I finally went to the front desk to voice my concerns. There were many apologies. And the next day when we came back to the room after our afternoon jaunts there was a cheese plate waiting for us compliments of the manager with a note apologizing for our poor experience. The cheese plate had the same effect as the room upgrade - a great effort but poorly thought out - the cheese was delicious and tasty - and it left an odor in the room that we never really did get rid of - fortunately neither my wife nor I are lactose intolerant. The next morning breakfast was a different world - we were greeted by name, the waitress couldn't do enough for us, they found a Canadian supervisor and had him come over to chat us up - wonderful Wonderful that is until a few days later when the morning crew basically changed and the service and attitude went back to what seems to be normal in this hotel - rude and flippant. When anyone at the front desk recognized us we were asked how the stay was going and each time we related our experiences - good on some days and poor on others. Having stayed for an extended period and having such a poor experience I expected to have something happen at the front desk upon checkout - a free night, extra points - something, anything to indicate that the organization cared about our experience in their building. I was not surprised to find my bill intact and in fact with a mistake on it - somehow or other they mistakenly charged us for breakfast one day - strange in that every other day we stayed there the only charge for breakfast was that 18% gratuity of $8.64 on a complimentary breakfast! The Conrad looks beautiful, seems to be well designed and organized but that is all superficial - from the beautiful, thick, embroidered towels that simulate wax paper when you try to dry with them to the 25th floor bar balcony (filled with smokers) We'll look for another place to stay when we come back to Miami.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities, MN", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, nice rooms...with a price to match\u201d", "Author": "MNetrip", "ReviewID": "UR117237824", "Content": "Stayed two nights for a business trip and got a pretty good rate to stay here in August 2011.

Brickell has really come to life as more than just the financial district. There is so much to do at night and lots of good places to eat. The hotel is in one of the nicest looking buildings on the strip. The service was very good. I'm a very low maintenance traveler and understand that with the amount of people using a hotel's facilities, there are going to be issues now and then. As long as the service is there to correct them, I'm a happy camper. After checking in, I noticed the phone next to the bed was not working so I called down and an engineer fixed the problem within 20 min. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. There were two large stains on the carpet by the door which looked like wine or grape juice and not anything disgusting that would really bother me. I did get a great rate on the Bay view room and although I got a good value, I can understand if somebody who paid a full price would want a little more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the room. The furniture was simple and elegant and the room was spacious with a beautiful bathroom but the walls were pretty bare with only one small frame hanging between the double beds. The AC control seemed to not be calibrated correctly because the room always felt warmer than the temperature it was indicating. I just turned it to a cooler setting and was okay. One of the things that bugs me is people always complaining about high prices at hotels. I guess I just always expect them. It pains me to have to join the club though because I was really taken aback two times during the stay. First, upon arriving I asked what the rate was for guest parking and the valet attendant told me it was $36 per day. I then asked about self parking and that was $26 per day. Luckily, the manager overheard the conversation and noticed my car and informed me that there was free accessible parking (I have a permit) right around the corner which we used the entire stay. Again, great service by the bell staff who were excellent every single day. My second and main issue was room service. On the first night, I was going to go out but wanted to grab a quick bite before leaving since I was traveling all day and had not eaten. We ordered a hamburger and club sandwich two glasses of juice and a Coke. After all was said and done including service charges, delivery charge, and tip, my bill was $81. Again, this was for a burger and sandwich. I have never once complained about high food prices at hotels but this one was just more than I ever expected. At least it made for great conversation the next couple of nights. Yes, the people who say at the Conrad in Miami can afford all these prices but it doesn't mean we enjoy overpaying for things. The food was good however. I had breakfast every day at Deli Lane across the street from the hotel and it was very good. On the bright side, I was given a free drink coupon at check in redeemable at the atrium lobby bar which was nicely decorated and had a great view. Drinks here were about $15 which is about what I expect at a hotel and especially the nicer ones like these. The view from here was perfect for watching the 4th of July fireworks! Check-in and checkout were smooth as can be and only took about 2 min. each. The only issue I can really find with service (and it didn't bother me one bit) was that I was offered a free paper at check in which I took only because it was offered free, but it never arrived. No worries since I never read the paper anyways. I know we tend to remember and write down the negative things we encounter just because it's easier but believe me, this is a very good hotel. I would definitely recommend it and would stay again myself.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDown on One Knee Package provides Perfect Romantic Get-Away\u201d", "Author": "archdent", "ReviewID": "UR115048858", "Content": "While looking for a \"package\" for a romantic get-away to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary we discovered the \"Down on One Knee\" package.

The service and facility are impeccable. We were upgraded to a king suite with a partial view of the bay and beautiful city views. They brought us a telescope so that we could hone in on the sites throughout the city. We visited the pool and utilized the \"free\" cabanas. They have this wonderful lotion poolside that you can use after you swim and the pool towels are the softest I have ever felt. The fitness center is open 24 hours and is more than adequate - plus it is on the spa level, so you have the locker room and the dry heat as well. There are many things to do within a walk or MetroMover/MetroRail ride from the hotel. We were there on a holiday weekend, so the schedules were not as frequent as during the regular days and weekends. You can, however, walk to Mary Brickell Village (901 South Miami Avenue- 4 blocks north and two blocks west), which has wonderful restaurants and shops-including a Publix grocery store to pick up snacks and necessities. (check hours). There is a really nice coffee machine in the room and there is no charge, but they don't really tell you that. If in doubt in this hotel, just ask. They will answer any question or accomodate any request. If you don't like the answer you get, just go over that person's head and you will probably get what you want. They really are there to please the guests. As a seasoned traveler, I have to say that this is probably one of the best two hotels that I have ever stayed in (it is in contention with the Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tennessee for No. 1). The staff here remembers your name (it's kinda freaky). The only negative that I could possibly think of is that the scrambled eggs were not up to par with my moms. Everything else was absolutely perfect. The staff is professional, discreet, yet friendly and not \"stiff\". A special shout out to Francois the limo driver who is amazing and Alejandro, who is a FIU Hospitality student interning at the hotel (a real asset). Natalia, the marketing manager, is also on top of everything from making sure that everything gets done when it is supposed to. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for the perfect staycation.

It's nice that it was open till 10pm and the deep end was close to 5' instead of like 3 feet like I've seen at many \"deep ends\" (greatly appreciated when you're 6'4!). The little terrace area off the bar had great views. We did a breakfast pre-order and it was delicious! The elevator to the lobby and then to the room didn't really annoy me that much as some of the other reviews mention. Getting to the pool was kind of annoying though, but I may have been going the wrong way! This was my first actual stay at a Conrad, but I'm very familiar with the Conrad Chicago and also checked out the one in San Juan last year.

The hotel is quite lovely, but a little confusing at first. There is a lobby on the ground floor, but there's only a concierge desk. The check in and real \"lobby\" is on the 25th floor. When I got there, attendants escorted me up to the 25th floor and a really nice desk attendant checked me in. I'd say that overall, the service experience is excellent. I was given, what I assume, was a run of the house room on the 21st floor. The room was large, spacious, and modern. The bathroom was as big as any bathroom I've ever seen with both a tub and a shower. The bed was so comfortable. There is also complimentary internet access, which is huge (at least for me). Located in downtown Miami, there wasn't a lot to do in the immediate area and it sort of cleared out (I assume because I was never there at the time) at the end of the work day. There are a couple of restaurants, including a Capital Grille and Gordon Biersch in the area. I usually like to work out when I'm on travel and the fitness room, located on the 24th floor, was adequate, with some stationary bikes, treadmills, and a couple of elliptical trainers. There were also some exercise balls and dumbbells. One of the most non-sensical things about the Conrad is the need to go to the 25th floor lobby to transit between your room and the ground floor. You'll need to get to the 25th floor via the guest room elevator then walk around the corner to the lobby to catch another elevator to get to the ground level.

Never in a million years did we think someone would have taken our stuff out of the safe in our room. The bell man was to bring out stuff up to the room well thats what we thought. We checked out 3 days later and found that nothing was in the safe...frantically i went to the front desk and they said ohh its here dont worry oh we understand blah blahhh- Amanda the manager came out and spoke with me trying to be sympathetic with me but i didnt work..can you imagine losing your wedding gifts priced over $20,000.00 NO! i was going crazy crying my eyes out...finally she made the security guy come and make me fill out a incident report and basically thhey wanted me to fill it out and they thought it would be all over. Well after much yelling i finally filled it out and gave it back..they were looking at me like i was crazy. my flight was in 2 hours so i had to get going.

If traveling for business, this is a great location! Some of the earlier reviews knock this location, but it all depends on what you are in Miami for. The check in is located on the 25th floor with amazing views of the city and the bay. The service is first class from the moment you arrive and the valet and doorman meets you at your car. You are escorted in to the building and to the elevators up to the lobby. Upon arrival in the lobby the front desk staff was outstanding. The awkward part is that the rooms are located off of another elevator bank and actually below the lobby. The rooms are nice, but are a bit worn. My room had a great view of the bay and South Beach, but the furnishings were a bit old and worn though. The TV was not up to par and needs to be replaced with a newer one (LCD, Plasma, etc). I was surprised that the TV was old and most likely circa 2000ish. The robes were very nice and the bathroom was excellent (large with a separate shower and tub). The nightly turn down service is also a nice treat, but I was surprised that there was not a mint /choclate on my pillow, as one mught expect from turn down service. Notably absent from the room is a coffee maker. I must say that I was shocked at this. In today's day of business travel, not having a coffee maker in the room is a real miss. It is frustrating to have to order room service just for a cup of coffee. The lobby bar is quite cool and offers outdoor seating where you overlook the bay. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for business travelers in Miami. The service is outstanding! The only negative is that the rooms could use some updating (especially the TV & lack of coffee maker).

We had a great, simple stay in Miami and would recommend the Conrad for travelers heading to Miami for business or a pre-cruise stay. Service, breakfast, and the pool temperature were there highlights. I was staying on Hilton Honors points, so the room was free and I almost feel guilty that the only money I spent during the one night stay was a $16 gratuity for our waiter at breakfast. I'd happily return to spend more money in the future! What I Liked: - Service was great at the front desk (Marilou) and the concierge desk (Richard) - Despite the hotel being sold out (it was a spring break weekend in Miami), the staff didn't cite it as a reason for any shortcomings; they did their best to meet expectations - I hoped to check in early and called the front desk before 6am to alert them of my early arrival and was pleased to find a room being prepared for us when we arrived at 11:30am - We ended up waiting longer than anticipated for the room since housekeeping noticed a stain on the carpet they needed to remedy; I appreciated the team being proactive! - The concierge gave us a great recommendation for brunch (Balan's), which was very reasonably priced and a nice walk from the hotel - As a Diamond VIP, I was provided with an upgrade to a Bay View Deluxe room #1721(simple, clean, a little small). We weren't blown away, but it met our needs. We also received free internet and two free breakfast buffets. - I received a call in the evening to inquire if there was anything I needed to make the stay satisfactory. I mentioned that we had four people in the room and asked if they'd be able to provide a discounted rate on the breakfast buffet for the thrid and fourth members of our party (the Diamond VIP benefit includes only two complimentary buffets). After being placed on a brief hold, the team member offered to provide a total of four complimentary breakfast buffets. This was above and beyond the service I'd expected an certainly appreciated. - The breakfast buffet was FANTASTIC! The food presentation was great. The wait staff was very attentive with drink refills, etc. - The temperature of the outdoor pool was complete bliss! There are simple cabana areas free of charge. - The team member at the front desk of the spa was very pleasant (and cute!) Items To Be Aware Of: - This property is not well-designed for people looking to party in South Beach since the location isn't very convenient to that area - The outdoor rooftop pool is nice but it is separated from the rest of the hotel and lounge chairs are limited - As other reviewers have mentioned, you'll spend a lot of time riding elevators. I expected it, so I wasn't put off by it. I must admit that occasionally I did press the wrong button a few times, forgetting that I had to go up to go down. - Some details of the room fell short: Our desk lamp was missing a leg on the base, causing it to be tilted and it would rock when touched; one of the reading lamps mounted in the headboard was broken; the bookcase used to store of the minibar snacks was tilted and not fitting correctly against the wall.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, GA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel.

We rented a two bedroom suite both years. The hotel itself is beautiful, the views of the bay and downtown miami are wonderful. The suite was very spacious and well layed out. My main concern was with the service. THe first year when I booked I was told that there was no deposit required they just needed my card to hold the room but it wouldnt be charged anything until my arrival. LIES! within minutes of completing my reservation with an agent my card was charged first nites rate and tax which was about 500.00ish. Which if I was aware would have happened I could have been prepared for it, but as advised by them it wouldnt be so I was shocked to see it when I checked my account. When I called back to find out why it was charged I was told b/c it was a suite and a popular holiday weekend the deposit was required. My obvious question\" Then why would your reps tell me the complete opposite when I specifically asked that question\"!?!?! I was given a mere \"The agent you spoke with was incorrect, would you like us to cancel and refund it to your card\"?! At this point we had already made up our minds that Conrad was where we were staying so I advised them to keep it and to better train their staff on the policies on reservations and what they tell customers. When I actually arrived in May, I was amazed by the hotel but disgusted by the manager on duty and his arrogant staff. The card that I initially booked the room on had been stolen(the reservation was made in Feb) and I had a new one from my bank. Apparently, b/c I had a different card they would require that I put down a whole new deposit!!!! He informed me that the initially 500.00something would be refunded to the account but they werent authorized to let me use a new card to pay the remaining balance on the room. So I had to basically come up with an additional 500.00 that i had already paid these people!!! and wait for the initial 500.00 paid back in Feb to be refunded within 7 business days. Completly unacceptable!!! no kind of apology, or resolution. I asked for the manager who of course was not available but I could leave a message for him, that would be given to him that evening when he started his shift. The message never got to him. The next morning I went to speak with the manager on duty and was given alot of attitude and the impression that he could care less, and I should be glad that I was even staying at their hotel. I was very turned off! It was already my second day and I wasnt going to leave to find another hotel at this point so I stuck it out. So the suite was beautiful and had a full kitchen and everything, washer and dryer and all the amenities that you would expect from a hotel condo rental. The downside is you arent allowed to use these amenities! Minus the fact that I paid almost 2000.00 for this room for the weekend and you all made a disaster of my check in experience I cant use the kitchen pots/pans and washer and dryer? it was ridiculous. Needless to say I enjoyed my weekend even with these mishaps. Like a fool I went back the next year and received very shady, arrognant treatment again! the deposit situation was fine because I was aware of it now. Upon arrival though I was charged more than what I was suppose to b/c there was an extra person in our party and according to them the two bedroom suites were made for only 4 people maximum(we had 5) So why is there a dining room table with a set up for 6? Very minor mishap and the additional charge wasnt alot but it was enough to turn me off and make me not want to return.

We arrived at 3pm, check in time, but the room was not ready. The front desk confirmed our reservation for bay view, highest floor possible, away from the elevator, and foam pillows. The front desk staff was friendly, but they were not particularly effective. We waited with several other hotel clients in the bar for about an hour. We were hungry but they stopped serving lunch at 2 pm. The front desk staff arranged to allow the hotel patrons that were waiting to order from the limited food or drink menu. The wait staff was not happy to make this accommodation. My husband and I ate, and then walked the city, still waiting for our room. We returned to the hotel and since the room still wasn't ready the front desk gave us 2 drinks comp. We had time to drink the 2 comp drinks, order an appetizer, order 2 more drinks, and watch part of a bowl game. The wait staff (the night shift by this time) noticed how long we waited and checked on our room for us. We were allowed to check in over three hours after we first arrived. The front desk did not confirm the room rate, or length of reservation. When we finally were allowed into the room, our room was facing the bay, but it was directly across from the service elevator. Make no mistake, there was constant noise coming from the area that contained a service elevator, laundry room, and storage room. We travel with an ambient sound machine so we were able to drown out the noise. We were pretty sure that if we tried to change rooms we would not have the bay view, and we would have to wait even longer for another room so we did not complain. The hotel brags a pillow menu. However, we only received the foam (not feather that were in the room) pillows we requested with our reservation, and at check in, by calling housekeeping several times. Housekeeping does not seem to be aware of the pillow menu the hotel brags about. Housekeeping did not vacuum the floors during our entire stay. We also suspect the floors were not vacuumed prior to our arrival as we never heard a vacuum cleaner running during our entire stay. Room service was very prompt, and the food was good. However, after 30 minutes no matter what you order, even hot tea, room service will call you to pick up the tray, table, or hot kettle. It was annoying. The concierge is very kind and accommodating. However, their walking directions are not accurate. If you are not slightly familiar with the city they will give you directions that will get you lost. Be prepared to ask someone once you exit the hotel. The website claims there are flat screen TV's in the room. Be aware that they are flat panel tube TV's, not actually flat screen TV's. We asked for a late check out and the front desk was accommodating. However, upon check out the front desk staff never asked how our stay was, or if we wanted a printed receipt of the charges. They were not rude, just indifferent. My husband and I are used to staying at Hilton Honors hotels that have better customer service.

I did a bit of research and was a bit wary of what I would find once I got there. Overall - the place is pretty sweet. The elevator situation is odd, but normal for a multi-purpose building such as this. The room that was assigned was really nothing special. I asked for a non-corner room with a bay view and was informed that would cost an additional outrageous charge. So I declined and was led to a closet-sized space with a mediocre view of the city. But the space was clean, the bathroom was huge (great shower!) and the bed and linens were up to par. A few things I was looking forward to, such as the ipod dock and pillow menu were painfully missing. I even asked about the ipod dock, but nobody in the place seemed to know what I was talking about despite the fact it's listed on their website. I hated (read: HATED) the feather pillows on the bed and asked room service to bring up others, or provide the much acclaimed pillow menu. Again, nobody knew what I was talking about, and if I weren't having such a good time, I probably would've made a bit more of a scene about it. I hate a stiff neck and feather pillows always make me sneeze. Nonetheless, I had other things on this trip to take my mind off pillows and all was forgotten. I went looking to get ice upon arrival - and let it be known you cannot get your own ice. If it weren't for the very gracious housekeeping woman who informed me of this and promptly filled my bucket, I would've wandered the halls for an hour. Guess she knew I really needed that champagne... Housekeeping seemed to be the most on-the-ball staffers here. They were ever present and eager to help in any way, and they do a great job at keeping things spotless and fresh. We ate at the Atrio on level 25 - fantastic views, good drinks can be had and they do have a happy hour that kept them relatively affordable. The food was meh. I don't mind paying for quality, but it was all fluff and very little substance. In other words, don't eat there hungry. I'm guessing nobody in Miami eats a proper meal, or at least not in public. But the decor and ambiance was pretty hip - and their choice in music was spot on - the service was good and friendly. One thing to note, the front desk staff seemed useless to me. Aside from standing there staring at you when you get on and off the elevator, they essentially know nothing about the hotel. The concierge, however, was very helpful and knowledgeable. I lost my phone charger and the concierge dug in the back room for a while searching through the lost and found for a compatible one. The person at the front desk had no clue there was even a box of phone chargers back there. Even though there was no match, I appreciated the time and effort. Sometimes it's the little things that make a big difference. If I hadn't grabbed this hotel so cheaply on Hotwire, I don't think I would've picked it. Overall, I'm glad that's where we landed, but I have no reason to really go back. They could definitely do better with actually providing what they say the do and training some staff better, but the hotel is on the right track.

The pool area is nice as well. Yes the layout at the hotel is a bit strange, with you having to take one set of elevators to the 25th floor and then another to your room, but whatever not that big of a deal.

The staff on check in was extremely professional and personal. Disappointments and criticisms: My assigned room (more below) was already showing signs of wear. The wood on the dresser the television sat on was beat up and the wood veneer separating from the material underneath. There was a very large, dark stain on the carpet between the bed and the closet where something had spilled and splattered. Something had been spilled on the windowsill too, and was still there. The hotel seemed quite empty given four floors of nearly empty \"valet-only\" parking spaces in the deck, and very little traffic in the bar and restaurant, but no room upgrade was offered despite Gold HH status. Breakfast and internet were provided though, so no cause to complain perhaps. I do complain though for a different reason: the map of rooms on the back of the room door (21st floor) indicated that a handful of rooms were narrower than the standard size rooms on that floor (I'm not counting the really large rooms that showed on the map, which I assume are suites or something). Mine was one of the few narrow rooms. Because of this, there was very little room between the end of the bed and the front of the dresser and television - the room had a very cramped feeling. Also, nearly half the room was an even narrower unusable/unfurnished space from the door to where the room opened up and became larger. This particular room was also right next to the elevator and so there was the constant sound of the elevator coming and going. My point: why not be aware of which rooms on a floor are less desireable than others (they are smaller; they are noisier), and make an effort to first assign other rooms without these problems if you have space? I'd recommend the hotel give that some thought to that. Had a quieter, less cramped, and cleaner room been assigned, I would probably stay again.

The service ended there, as you walk into the hotel you have to take an elevator up 25 floors to reach check -in, when we arrived there was only one person working the desk - but it was not busy. She was courteous but not friendly. I was able to overlook this by looking out at the bay - the views are beautiful. Our room was decent, a king size bed and a corner location which opted for stunning views in all directions. Upon unpacking my toiletries I almost sliced my finger open on the broken glass tray - very poor in my opinion, as well as the soaps - they were very cheap and smelled bad for what is supposed to be a upper end hotel. we had room service a few times and felt it to be lacking - and the room service attendants as well as other hotel employees were very defensive when I said something wasn't right - a very big turn off for me - when staying at a hotel I do want to worry about anything and instead of just rectifying the problems they made me to feel as if it were my fault - very rude in fact. I could have overlooked some of this with room service understanding not everything will be perfect but what set me off the most was the Spa service. I had booked a surprise facial for my boyfriend. I was told to arrive 15 minutes before his appointment. That morning we took the elevator to the 24 floor to step into noise, the fitness center is adjoined to the Spa, there was a gentleman in gym gear yelling on his phone about business, at first I thought we were in the wrong place yet we weren't there just wasn't anyone at the reception desk to greet us. We sat for 15 minuted before the esthetician came out, when I told her we had been sitting there for 15 minutes she told me my appointment was at 12:30 and that I was wrong and the receptionist was on lunch. She was very rude - when the receptionist came back I had explained the same thing and she just told me she has no control, she was on her lunch break and that she wasn't the one to book the appointment. There was no empathy or \"how can I fix this\" mentality. I was very disappointed and for $165 facial I expected much better service - I would never recommend the spa to anyone. My boyfriend did say the facial was nice but you can get nice anywhere for a lot less. It felt more like a salon than a spa.

The King room I stayed in was spacious though not that large. I have several gripes about the hotel: - the room I was given was a handicapped room which was fitted for wheelchair access, etc. Not being disabled, I couldn't understand why I was given that room however when I noticed the fold down seat in the shower, the small sink and other accomodations for disabled people, I called the front desk and requested a room change. I also mentioned the noise from the housekeeping closet next to my room. In the hour I was in the room, the housekeeping closet door slammed at least 5 times so I knew it was going to be a problem in the early morning hours. I was told the room was given to me as it was requested by my company's travel agency. This is the most ridiculous excuse I ever heard! I travel at least every other week, know my agent very well and therefore know this was just the desk clerk's way of shifting responsibility. On my request for a room change, I was told the hotel was fully booked (very hard to believe) and that I would receive a call the next morning offering me a new room. I stayed in the Conrad 3 nights and no one ever called back. You would think someone who is a VIP member of Hilton Honors would be treated better. Another complaint about this hotel is the parking fee: $27 dollars a day for valet parking! When I mentioned this was excessive, I was told I had the option to self-park but this would cost $25 and I had to pay each tie I exited the garage. How ridiculous! A friend came to the hotel for a drink and was charged the $27 valet fee for 3 hours. A couple of other complaints: Though the bed was a king size, it sunk on one side and so it was very uncomfortable to sleep in. You can hear everything from the adjoining room. I mean EVERYTHING!

Great selection of products in the bathroom, and the bedroom was equipped with a coffee machine, flatscreen tv, dvd, the works - very impressive. Although I didn't use the spa, I did go and have a look and it looked stunning! I did have the time to use the outdoor swimming pool, and although it was smaller than I exepected, the pool area is very welcoming with a lovely sun terrace and some nice views out to the sea. There is a nice bar on the 25th floor where you can take advanctage of sitting outside (if you're lucky enough to get a space as there is only limited seating) and the restaurant is nicely decorated just nextdoor. All in all, I found this hotel portrayed the true values of a five star deluxe hotel and was very impressive. Only small disadvantage is the split of the hotel between two buildings which means you need to leave the main building to go over to the fitness centre/swimming pool but this was a small detail and did not detract from my stay.

On check in the receptionists verified with us in writing the agreed room rate which was the signed by both parties. We had two rooms with 2 double beds in each. Unfortunately there were no rooms available nect to each other, or even on the same floor, in fact we were 2 floors apart. This was only a minor problem and in fact worked out quite well as one of the rooms we were given was a disabled access room so was significantly larger. The views from both rooms were excellent and the cleanliness of the rooms and the hotel in general was excellent. The bathrooms are very large and have a separate bath and shower cubicle and a large range of molton brown toiletries. Breakfast was average and quite expensive. The breakfast room is also very small meaning there is often a wait. There is a cafe across the road from the hotel which serves food all day and serves breakfast all day (but has a larger selection in the mornings) which is a better option for breakfast if u want more than a bit of fruit and cereal.

So the next day, after cheking out from Intercontinental, we checked in to Conrad at 12:30pm. They accomodated us with early check in, because we had to check out at noon from Inter. They upgraded our room to King with bayview. It was the same room we had last year. I love it. Love the view from the bathroom window looking down to the pool area. We left to go to a party in south beach, and when we arrived back to the hotel that night, they left us a bottle of red wine as a sincere apology for selling our room the night before. Awesome. The next day, we had breakfast at their restaurant. The hostess was really nice. But we experienced some problem with the waitress. The food took long (about 10 minutes). And 5 minutes after the food came, the waitress dropped off the bill on our table, without even asking if we need anything else. We set the bill aside on the chair because I just don't like seeing a bill in front of me while I'm eating. I left the restaurant to go to the pool and my friend stayed to finish his dessert from the buffet.

The outside of the building was in real bad shape because of Hurricane damage but it was being repaired while we were there. There were a lot of windows blown out and I understand all the windows have to be redone--a major undertaking. Don't let that bother you because inside the hotel is beautiful. From the moment you walk in there are fresh flowers in very modern arrangements. They were changed two times while we were there. A door person holds the door and welcomes you, and people at the downstairs lobby are friendly as well. Here is the awkward thing: You entire on the ground level and take an elevator to upper level floor (don't remember what #); that is the lobby. I guess this must be a Conrad thing because the Chicago Conrad was the same. It does make you feel safe and secure in the hotel. The odd thing is you then take another elevator around the bend down to your room. The lobby has a spectacular view and a great restaurant for breakfast. The staff at the restaurant is exceptional; the food is good! The pool area is small but nicely designed with little cabanas and comfortable chairs. There is also a tennis court on that floor. This area was never very busy, which might be explained by another awkward thing in the design of the building. To get to the pool area from your room you have to: (1) take an elevator UP to the lobby, then (2) take an elevator DOWN to the ground floor, then (3) exit the building, (4) cross the drive, (5) enter the parking lot building, (6) take another slow elevator UP to the roof top, and then (7) you made it! Just make sure you take everything you need when you get to the pool because it is a long haul back to the room! I don't know what the architect was thinking when he/she designed that. It is completely absurd and inconvenient. Despite these peculiarities, which might be an inconvenience for the elderly or handicapped, the hotel room is beautifully appointed, the bathrooms are amazing, the toiletries (Molton Brown) are wonderful, and the bed linens are a dream. The bed was turned down each night and a tray of water, and chocolates were left on the bed. Another nice touch was that the ice bucket was filled every night.

First of all, during my stay, I read that 72% of all travellers spend two nights or less at any given property. For this group the Conrad provides a very well-oiled business-centric hotel experience. The IT guys will solve any problem you have in minutes and they're all over you. The rooms are all on the small side with bathrooms that are enormous and swamp the size of the room.If you luck out and get a corner room (#s 16 or 25), you'll have a fantastic view of water and highrises and sunrises from a bathroom with a wall of glass and wrap-around windows in your bedroom. The bedding is very comfortable and the rooms are amazingly quiet. There's no noise from inside or out. The Level 25 lobby and bar and restaurant area give you a great modern cityscape view on all sides. There's a great pool and jacuzzi, tennis courts and a spa. The swimming pool is heated to near bathwater temperature so it's perfect for an early morning or late night swim. There's a bar and restaurant on site which is actually across the motor court and up on the roof of the parking structure adjacent the hotel. The food here is all grilled right in front of you and very good. However this bar closes at sundown so you're out of luck if you come later to use the pool which opens at 6 am and closes at 10 PM. That is all the good part....now for the rest. The rooms have precisely two drawers for clothing. All other clothes are to be hung on hangers in your closet. Quite frankly, this was so woefully inadequate for a two week stay that the only solution was to have the mini-bar emptied to give myself another drawer. Similarly, I had to have another storage space in the entry hall cleared of the coffee maker and all that paraphenalia that people seem to think is essential in a business hotel but which I personally loathe looking at. I like a very clean uncluttered look and this can only be accomplished by losing all the black leather menus and phone pads and gewgaws that clutter every surface in these small rooms. The huge 37 inch TV and accompanying DVD player are among the most confusing to operate I have ever encountered. There's no universal remote and instead you have to use one to turn on another to switch channels. It's very frustrating and would be vastly imporved with written instructions but I had to ask twice to have these provided. There seems to be a problem with service in the hotel. While the universal response to any request you make is gracious and can-do, the execution seems to fall short. I had several requests that were made in duplicate. Finally, the food. The Atrio restaurant is a stunning space but the food is mediocre at best, overpriced and the only option besides a room service menu. I used room service twice and was disappointed in everything but a thin-crusted pizza bianca. The breakfasts are obscenely expensive. One morning I actually paid $18 for fruit juice and a wineglass sized porition of granola, berries and yogurt. There's no other eating option in the hotel and I thank god for the neighboring Novecento restaurant which is cati-corners across Brickell and which provides reasonable entrees, wonderful wines and good service to the beat of a very persistent latin rhythm and active bar scene full of young hot looking Latinos. So why the Conrad? We got a truly excellent rate for a party occupying 8 rooms for the 2 week period. I won't divulge what we paid but it was considerably less than the Columbus Hilton where we stay on frequnet trips to Ohio. That I would say is the real reason to love the Conrad. But if I had my druthers, I'd be down the block at the 4 Seasons in as fast as it took to walk there.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat pre-cruise hotel\u201d", "Author": "CWS", "ReviewID": "UR13154669", "Content": "Booked directly with the hotel to take advantage of Hiltons Govt employee discount (about 50%) even though we are Canadian one of us works for Canadian Govt.

I note from a previous review that the lifts and layout of the hotel caused confusion and inconvenience to other guests.

All the staff we encountered during our stay were very helpful and there was a great selection at breakfast. The pool was nice and the public area around it very well maintained.

First, I had stayed in the Conrad in Chicago; it was a superior experience, with respect to price, service, room quality, etc. I expected the same in Miami. We typically stay in South Beach, but decided to give downtown a try. I got a great rate on their website by booking over the internet and prepaying the room. I paid about $270 a night for a \"bay view\" room, which was closer to $330 on other websites. (Its not a clear \"bay view\" since there is an apartment building in the way. But you do see water.) The problems started before we checked in. There was a convention in the hotel, but they did not have enough valets to park the cars. We were told to park the car at the end of the block. Not good. But, on the plus side, they did have our bags in our room within 10 minutes of check in. Once we settled in, I called the concierge to see about a restaurant reservation. We asked about Azul, a great restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental (highly recommend Azul, by the way). The concierge said he would try, but could not guarantee given the hour. Fair enough. We also talked about top restaurants in South Beach. When I asked about other options in downtown, he mentioned there was a PF Changs up the street. Now why, if I choose Azul as my first choice, would he suggest PF Changs as a second choice? That made no sense. The elevators . . . what can I say. We saw the same gum wrapper on the floor Monday morning at check out that we saw Saturday night at check in. There was a broken glass panel in the other elevator. I just can't imagine that broken panel would be tolerated all weekend at the Ritz, the Four Seasons, or the Delano. Then there was the room. It was OK, but a bit noisy from the air conditioner and the elevator motors. The worst part was the daily \"wake up call\" by the housekeeping staff. Er . . . folks? If I call the front desk for a 10:30 wake up, that does not mean I want a knock on my door at 8:30! The oddest part: as I stood near the window and looked up near the valance, I could see exposed insulation and unfinished drywall. This could be a real problem for people with allergies, of course. I communicated all these issues to the hotel when I received an on-line survey e-mail. A few days later, I received an e-mailed letter apologizing for all the problems EXCEPT the exposed drywall. That, supposedly, is the way it was supposed to be . . . whatever . . . . A week later, I received the same letter at my house. But with the letter was a voucher for two free days in a king room! This was a pleasant surprise, of course, which I will take advantage of. In all, the hotel was, as a Brit we met in the bar put it, \"hit or miss.\" They do care, but they just don't quite have it all together.

We did have a view of the harbor, which is what we asked & paid for, but the harbor is in the distance & well, your not going to feel a breeze or hear the ocean in this room. But we did want a quiet place to relax in & thats what we. For $300. though I would say it was overpriced. We also paid $30. for the taxi from the airport & another $20. to South Beach that night & the same amt. back & so on & so forth. Miami gets very expensive very quickly. I'll take New York taxi's any day over that experience & South Beach is way loud too & somewhat crazy, as you may expect. I can now better understand how Gianni Versace died.

On check in while there was 2 staff members behind the desks only one on them was dealing with guests. The other member of staff saw us waiting, did not even say sorry for the wait we ended up waiting to check in for 15 mins! I booked 2 smoking rooms, they gave us 2 non smoking rooms- there was no longer any deluxe smoking rooms left, even though I booked months ago! Once checked in, we made our way to our room. It was a lovely room. Clean with a great view of the bay and Molton Brown amenities. Noticed the mini bar in the other room did not lock and made sure I let the hotel know about this before they started charging us for items, we had not taken! Around the windows, it seemed like to window were not fixed or plastered correctly or that they were still in the process of renovating the window area. They was also construction work during our stay, this was not a problem as they was not much noise, this might have been down to the fact that it was the holiday season, but the hotel should have made sure that they informed all guests of this matter. Also after leaving our room for a while, with the AC turned onto heat, I returned to find that my room was as cold as an ice box. It seemed like the AC had broken and the display reading was not as warm as displayed. Maintenance came to the room and within 1 min, stated that the problem was fixed. Needless to say the AC remained broken for the whole stay, after mentioning this to front desk for the second time and getting no response. I decided to turn the AC completely off and try to enjoy the rest of my stay, as it was winter, so the need for AC was not that great. (something, I would not have done, if I was staying during the warmer months) The location is good if you don't mind using the PT (public transport) as you are across the street from a metromover stop and can get to downtown, cocowalk and south beach very easily. We used the bus and train and metro mover to get around, as the hotel charges too much for parking. As for food, we ate at the restaurant in the morning, as we had HHonors breakfast vouchers. The breakfast is ok, but I have had better. Hard to find a decent coffee shop in the area and you have to be prepared to travel for some food, unless you want to eat at the hotel. There is a Walgreens and a Publics supermarket within walking distance, which made getting water easier, as water which is provided in room is $7 for a small bottle. We arranged to have new years dinner at the hotel and I expected it to be over priced and not worth it, but it was surprisingly decent. A 4 course champagne meal was around $100 per person. The turndown attendants were lovely and very friendly unlike to concierge who gave off a really bad attitude, when asked where the nearest sports bar was (sorry for asking!)

The restaurant is terrible too. The food is too heavy, saturated in oil, and will give you the runs. It takes 30 mins for an appatizer to arrive when the dining room is empty. The do not have room temperature bottled water. The waterfall is too loud, and most of the waiters cannot deal with special requests. The chef claims to not know how to put together a regular eggs benedict when they have a 'lobster benedict' on the menu. The hostess was nice though, I will give the restaurant that. I could go on. Really far. I hated this hotel-it should be demoted to 4 stars. I went to the Four Seasons (which was next door) basically everyday for breakfast, even though breakfast at my hotel was free, because my hotel disgusted me so much.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Juneau, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cYou Have to be KIDDING Me!\u201d", "Author": "Akgambler", "ReviewID": "UR6572043", "Content": "We stayed here after a cruise.

There is no \"cafe\" type dining, only the main restaurant. Which had ONLY special seating available on NY Eve. My husband wanted to get us coffee to go and they made him sit at a table in the restaurant, and order it to go in order to get it. The staff keeps telling you to go across to the Marriott for services... why not just STAY there?

We stayed at the Intercontinental before the cruise and highly recommend that hotel instead. I am not a novice traveler - I know this hotel is not worth the price.

They did bring extra blankets when asked and we also got a rollaway as requested.

The help was mostly adequate but valet did not have our car ready either time we called for it and in both cases had 15+ minutes to get it.

I was upgraded with no problems and everything was delivered as promised ( from food to extra pillows)The menu is somewhat trendy but the food is well presented and well prepared. The one negative that I can say is that Hilton seems to forget that some people are actually on vacation. The gym/spa and pool ( seperate bulidings) both close astonishingly early ! The pool closes at dusk and the gym at 8pm on weekends! I had no problem with this since I spend most of my time in my room reading when I can at night.

I found a number of problems during my stay. The layout of the hotel is confusing: To get from my room to the pool, I had to take three elevator rides (from my room to the upper lobby; upper lobby to lower lobby; across to the other tower and up to the pool.) There was extensive construction during my stay. I woke at 7:30am on Saturday morning to jackhammers, which sounded like they were directly above me. While I was conducting interviews at the hotel (the whole purpose for my stay there) the loud construction continued. When I called to complain, I was met with a rude, \"There's nothing we can do.\" Thankfully, enough people complained (apparently everyone in the hotel) and they eventually did cease construction. I requested a late checkout (since checkout is at noon and my flight was not until 7pm). I called the night before. Again, a rude employee curtly told me to call back in the morning. I called that morning. Yes, a late checkout could be arranged. The time? 1pm! Gee! An entire hour! How generous. Other problems throughout the stay: I had to continually ask for a newspaper to be delivered to my room in the morning. The restaurant staff at Atrio, the hotel's in-house eatery, were slow and inattentive. And if you're looking for recreational activities during down time, there's nothing within walking distanceof the hotel. A taxi ride is required to get to anywhere worthwhile. My advice?

The bathroom was covered in marble, seperate tub, long vanity counter top, good lighting. The stand up shower wasn't all that great. Good water pressure, but there's no place to put your shampoo, soaps, or to comfortably shave your legs (ladies). Plus, all the water leaked through the bottom of the glass shower door - put down lots of towels or you'll slip on those marble floors. Turn down service brought two free bottles of water ($8 in the mini-bar). Great continental breakfast, expect to sit down and order off the menu. If you're on the go, have them box it up, bkfst is great and free (if you have a pass, ask the front desk for one). There's also a coffee maker in the room if you don't want to walk down in the mornings. Morton's Steakhouse is across the street, but there's a restaurant in the hotel, too.
