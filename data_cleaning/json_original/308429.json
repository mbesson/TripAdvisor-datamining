Located at the end of Kimberly which means that you get away from the crowd yet you are less than a min walk to the cafes, restaurants and shops in TST.

Reception service is good. 4. Concierge is helpful and will guide you to other places in Hong Kong. 5. Lighting is good in the room. Good for those on business trip. Cons:- 1. Small double bed. It will be a squeeze if you belong to the bigger size group and you share with your spouse. 2. They do not really clean the floor of the room. 3. Small toilet. (common in Hong Kong) 4. No wifi in the room!!! we are paying for such high price for the room yet they do not install Wifi. 5. Chargeable wifi. 6. Poor breakfast.

So true. But I did eat breakfast there, twice, over two weeks, and discovered the cost was $148 HKD plus 10 percent service charge (about $20 CAD / USD). Now in Canada, when one pays upwards of $20 for any buffet, one usually gets a pretty decent buffet. Not so with this hotel buffet: most of the foods seemed to be leftovers from the dinner buffet the night before. The dimsum was doughy, the scrambled eggs had me wondering what they had done to make them so rubbery and un-egglike, the carrots were drowned in water, the noodles were tasteless. The fresh fruit (two choices), congee (with toppings, a personal favourite) oatmeal and cereal were okay. Why did I eat there twice? To make sure that the first time was not a blip due to staff shortages at Chinese New Year. But the hotel itself is well located, the staff pleasant and accommodating, the room lovely. I was more than happy to make coffee in my room, then head out to a nearby McDonalds and get my scrambled eggs, sausage patty, home fries and coffee for under $4 USD/ CAD, and enjoy it a whole lot more.

The room had a \"wiped down\" look to it, and I could tell from the water stains on the sink counter that only the bare minimum had been done to clean it.

We stayed in a standard room with twin beds and were initially impressed with the way the interior designers had shoe-horned every necessity in the typically tiny space, A lot of translucent glass (including the door to the bathroom) was involved in giving guests an illusion of space. However, that could not disguise the extra-narrow luggage shelf (don't even think of bringing anything but carry-on size) nor make-up for the lack of a simple eye-level ledge (in the petite shower stall) for holding shampoo/bath gel etc. One had to stoop to the floor to use these items. My techie husband immediately complained about the \"antiquated\" internet connection. I was more concerned by the unresponsive air-conditioning controls---the temperature indicator stubbornly displayed 22 degrees C even after repeated attempts to change it to a more reasonable 25C. The beds sagged. The second day (of our three-day stay), the toilet flush mechanism failed and was not attended to after a four-hour interval. The staff offered us a new room (after 10:00 p.m.) and sent a porter to help us move. The identically sized new chamber had other problems, however. The internet connection somehow would not connect---but kudos to the desk staffer who came up to the room and did something to make it work---although this took up almost an hour. (They did not charge us for the last two days of internet.) The air-conditioning was again rather slow to change temperatures, and the beds sagged even more uncomfortably. On the plus side---the rooms were kept clean (although one morning they failed to wash our used tea cups) and the sound-proofing was good---no traffic noise from outside, no sound leaks from adjoining rooms. Also, the corridors were covered in cheerful, geometrically patterned carpeting. We opted for the buffet breakfast on our last morning---a mistake. Not up to the quality and variety in similarly priced hotels in Hong Kong. Oh, the concierge gave me the wrong screening times for a movie... Overall, a hotel we would not return to. We can do better for the same price range at many other hotels in the same area of HK. We only tried it because it was included in a Dragonair package.

The over-all service is not bad but neither is it exceptional.

Best service goes out to the guy assigned at the concierge desk, as he is the most helpful, even going so far as to look up a certain address for me when I asked about a store I needed to go to. The room is quite small, as most hotel rooms are in Hong Kong, but it's clean which is what's more important for me. There's enough closet and drawer space for clothes and a small refrigerator for drinks. There's a desk and a chair which you can use should you be inclined to do some work and they have internet in the rooms but I find this too cost prohibitive. Suggest you purchase a PCCW card at the local 7-11 shops. The bed is quite comfortable and the pillows soft. Bottled water as well as the coffee and tea making facilities are replenished daily. Bathroom has the usual amenities in it and these too are replenished daily. Although the bathroom is not cramped, considering your hotel room is small, I don't like it that there is no place for you to put your toiletries on while you're in the shower. All you have is a small ledge (if you can call it that) on the floor and putting your toiletries there while you shower is just gross. Over-all I think the reason I go back to the Empire Hotel, aside from its clean rooms and decent service, is its location. I like that it's very near the shopping area (Granville) as well as the shopping malls which I frequent, I love that the subway station is close by should I feel like exploring other areas (tip: buy an Octopus card), I enjoy the walk from the hotel to my favorite coffee shop, I find comfort that the convenience stores are close by and that the Knutsford Steps, where I usually end up eating and drinking is literally just steps away from the hotel.

Although I had requested a \"new\" room, I was given the key to an old room w/ a rattling air con system and 2 hooks that were supposed to resemble a closet. Mind you, I was staying for 2 weeks and needed some place to put my clothes. I went to the front desk to request a new room. After about a half hour of discussion, I received a transfer to a new room. #3. My new room was indeed new, with hardwood floors and a quieter a/c unit. However, the floors were covered w/ dust, as were the tables and lamps. #4. The rooms are so small you cannot open your suitcase unless you place it on your bed. Keeping the dusty floors in mind, you don't want to take a suitcase you just rolled on the floor and place it on your bed. #5. The rooms completely lack normal conveniences - like an alarm clock, or complimentary water. #6. Even though it was cooler outside, I needed to sleep w/ the a/c on set to the warmest setting. Throughout the night I would wake up because the stench of cigarettes was so overwhelming - coming into my room through the air vents. It was truly disgusting. #7. The halls are tiled w/ marble and the bedroom has hardwood floors. But this means there is absolutely no sound absorption. I was about 100 feet from the elevator - around a bend and far down the hall - and I could hear the elevator bell ring every time it arrived on my floor. I could hear my neighbors talk, doors open and close --- sound really travels here. I would wake up nightly around 4am from doors slamming. #8. The lounge - don't even get me started. There is 1 bartender who works at the lounge every night. Good luck getting waited on. She doesn't speak much English - which is the same to be said about the rest of the hotel staff. If you think you are going to the hotel lounge for a relaxing drink be prepared to sit and wait and wait and wait - even if you are the only one in the bar. #9. The breakfast buffet is sub-par compared to other hotels. The food is mostly cold - no matter what time you go to the buffet. I've been there at 7am and at 9:30 am - and the food is cold. The staff slams the dishes around when clearing tables or replenishing buffet plates -- the noise of the staff far outweighs the noise of the diners. This is not good. It makes for a tense, uncomfortable space. Plus, there are waiters wandering around, but they do not refill coffee or tea - just walk around. #10. The internet requires you go to the front desk and sign out a modem. This is so archaic. Then they charge you $30HKD per half hour. The price was really outlandish. #11. The selection of tv channels is slim. If you want English TV you are relegated to Natgeo and discovery. Sometimes BBC and MSNBC - but that it is. No HBO. #12. They state they have a gym... but it was under construction when I was there. I was redirected to a room on teh 23(?) floor which had 3 pcs of equipment that Jane Fonda may have found suitable in 1982. #13. The doorman on duty watches you as you open your own door to exit or enter the building. I am completely befuddled as to what his purpose is. #14. One night around 11pm it sounded like someone was using an electric saw - as in doing construction in the building. It lasted around 20 minutes - to be followed by random banging, etc. #15 On another day, the \"flushing water\" - for the toilet - was turned off for 12 hours. The strangest part was that I received a \"flushing water service resumed\" notice just as it was turned off. You can imagine my confusion. #16 - not that I was looking to take a swim - but the pool was drained dry. If you have any sense of standards when traveling, this is not the hotel for you. To be truly honest, it was comparable to most \"Mainland China\" hotels that you find in more remote locations. The staff was not your typical Hong Kong staff of knowledgeable service industry professionals. If I had not prepaid for the \"extended stay special\" rate, i would have relocated to a new hotel.

We have read about the small nature of the rooms, yes they are small but not so small to denigrate the stay at the hotel. We never had a problem with the rooms but someone with restricted mobility might have problems. There was around 4 feet or so space around the bed so that should be ample for most people. Hong Kong is such a bustling city we spent most of our time outside the hotel anyway!! The rooms are fine and the floor to ceiling windows ensure you have a great view wherever your room is situated within it. One thing that definitely impressed us was the great breakfast every morning and the lounge bar on the mezzanine level. The food was great (the best hotel food we had in our 4 city tour) and the bar was a comfortable place to relax in the early evening before hitting out to sample the sights and sounds of the city at night. The internet access was free in the lounge bar as long as you had a drink at the same time. Compared to the rest of China this was great as internet access elsewhere was ridiculously expensive. As I mentioned the location is great, loads of museums nearby and it's a short walk to the water front / Tsim Sha Tsui subway station. The staff were friendly and efficient. They even made breakfast for us on the last day we were there when we missed breakfast by 15 mins.

We got to the hotel after a 13 hour flight and a bit of detour when the taxi driver took us to the wrong hotel. The confusion over Kimberly Road meant he dropped us at the Kimberly Hotel about a 100 yards away. The outside of the hotel is quite tidy and the entrance hall and lobby is very smart and welcoming. We checked in and the receptionist seemed pleasant enough. My wife explained that it was our Honeymoon but the lady didn\u2019t acknowledge \u2013 I think it was lost in translation. Most staff do speak basic English however it can be a bit of challenge to communicate. In saying that though we were in a Chinese speaking country and their English is far superior to my Chinese!!! We were initially booked into a room on the eight floor and the trip wasn\u2019t too bad. The lifts were all very modern and clean and the place had a modern feel to it. The room however was disappointing. It was very small but the disappointment came with the view. We overlooked a load of very dirty buildings with rusty corrugated iron roofing. Not the fault of the hotel appreciated but still a grim view for a honeymoon. Having read some reviews on here prior to going out I got the idea that we could ask for a higher room with a harbour view. My wife spoke to reception and complained explaining that this was our honeymoon. We were told that these rooms charge a supplement and we couldn\u2019t have one. After asking to speak to the manager we were then advised that there was a smoking room on the 21st floor and we could have it at no extra cost. We took it no questions asked. And what a difference it was! We had a clear view across to Hong Kong island very nice at night. Despite the view the room wasn\u2019t that great, it was small and the windows hadn\u2019t been cleaned in years. The worst thing however was the fact that we needed a maintenance man every night!! The first problem was a leak with the toilet. This was fixed but the fix meant the toilet took all night to fill after being flushed. Despite several people looking at this it was never resolved. The next night we came back only to find the key card didn\u2019t work. I trekked all the way back down to reception to be met by a rather aggressive lady who was clearly annoyed at me being there and announced \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with this card!\u201d I insisted she come and try for herself which she did and begrudgingly got the maintenance guy up again. It turns out that the battery pack in the reader had gone, so this problem was then fixed. The list doesn\u2019t end there though, the next night we came back to find that the shower head was snapped, I can only assume that this was done during cleaning. Again the same maintenance man was sent who changed the shower head. That didn\u2019t the fix the problem as wasn\u2019t screwed in properly and went up and down according to the power. At this point we stopped reporting issues as we were embarrassed at the amount of times this guy need to visit! To be fair the maintenance man was there within ten minutes of the report every time but really should we have all these problems, or maybe it was just bad luck! Two things to avoid in this hotel are making calls from the phone; you get charged \u00a34 just for ringing out and the breakfast. We had breakfast one morning and had four slices of toast between us and two cups of tea for a sum total of \u00a310 what a rip off!! I also tried the pool which is very nice and clean but is ice cold so its not comfertable to use. The location of the hotel is excellent right in the centre of Tsim Sha Tsui.

Hotel has small rooms, expected in HK, a Japanase and Chinese restaurant, plus bar. Get a high room above 15 floor facing harbor views. Plenty of police everywhere in this area, so safety is not a problem. Internet is $40HK per hour or $120HK a day. All rooms have high ceilings, minifridge, desk, tv, free slippers and bath rob, and shower. Be sure to get money changed to HK dollars as hotel does not offer exchange services.

They can hold your luggage if you have late departure time and late check out is 2 p.m. There is a sauna, gym, indoor pool on 3rd floor. Free shuttle bus to airport across the hotel.

As of January 1, 2007, there is no smoking in all HK hotels and restaurants, but smoking is still very noticable outside and in crowded areas on the street, as in most of China wherever you go. Most people speak English very well in HK so feel free to ask for directions if you get lost. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

I was not dissappointed. While in Hong Kong- it seems that you aren't in your room much anyways because the hotel is surrounded with shops and great places to eat at any time of the day. The room was quite small. My husband and I requested a non-smoking room with a single queen bed. You literally have enough room for your luggage and 2 people- but that really wasn't the problem. The room felt more cozy than cramped. The room also had a very nice modern spacious bathroom and the bedroom had built in furniture that conserved space but also gave you everything you could possibly need! The people who designed the room are pure genious using every nook and cranny for a purpose. The rooms are very modern with clean lines and the beds are quite comfortable. This is coming from a person who has trouble sleeping in hotels. The Concierge in the hotel was just wonderful- he recommended places for us to visit, told us about the best shopping areas, retaurants and MTR stops to go to and confirmed our flights for us. Days later he still remembered who we were and reminded us of the car service appointment he had made for us to the airport. We did not eat in the hotel- but we did try the breakfast buffet one morning. It was an average buffet with western breakfast foods but if it isn't included in your room price- it probably isn't worth it since they charge an equivalent to $14US. One block away from the hotel there are various restaurants that serve both chinese and western breakfast foods for a third of the price. The MTR station is about 4 blocks away from the hotel (depending on which direction you walk) and you are very close to the park, museums and major attractions of Kowloon which are also all in walking distance.

I have rated above average as for the price i paid (abt HKD$700+ per nite), the quality of the hotel room and services have exceeded my expectations! I agree with previous commenters that the room is a little small so if you are of bigger built, you might not enjoy as much. The Good :) 1. (only if u appreciate a less busy area) Kimberley Road is a quieter street in the evening as the street is more known for housing bridal shops. Having stayed in a hotel @ Prat Avenue 4 nights before this hotel, it was truly a welcoming change (Prat Ave was a very busy street most times till past midnight!) 2. Service staff at reception and concierge were very professional and friendly. Their spoken english is good so no worries if you speak only english. 3. Honestly, i loved the room. For someone who can be quite particular about hotel room setting and cleanliness, you can almost take my word when i say it's truly value for money. I've stayed in other hotels in TST with just as good room but they usually are 20-40% costlier! 4. I managed to get a higher floor room so the view out of the window was a lot more attractive! Well, at least i didn't have to look into someone else's apt in the next building! 5. If you like Korean cuisine, there are several korean restaurants nearby. They must be quite good as I often see people queuing up outside the restaurants. 6. There is a wellcome supermarket and a 7-11 nearby so you can get some snacks and drinks at local prices The Bad :( 1. It is quite a distance to the nearest MTR exit at TST. Just treat it as your daily morning/evening exercise and you won't feel so bad afterall. 2. There is no ramp from the ground level to the hotel lobby entrance. If you have heavy luggage and if the concierge is too busy to help, you'll have to manage your stuff up/down the 5-8 steps. But not a big issue. 3. At Prat Ave (my previous hotel before Empire), i was only a very short distance to the nearest hawker snacks and main shopping area. Here at Kimberley, you have to walk a little bit more. 4. As mentioned, room is a little small. And i wished the TV was not built so high up.

The carpets in the room needs a deep cleaning as they look pretty soiled. High speed internet is pricey and works only on TV.
