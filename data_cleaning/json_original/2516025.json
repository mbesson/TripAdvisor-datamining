The room had a balcony over an inner courtyard, it was a good size and had all the usual amenities, basket of products to buy, fridge, lcd tv etc. and it had a comfy bed and no external noise issues that bothered us. The location was great - on our first morning the hotel staff gave us a map to get a bus tour which was a block down at the Beverly Centre. From here we could access everywhere we needed on a 2 day pass. Breakfasts were plentiful and I loved the evening wine and cheese. There was also a launderette nearby which was great for us as we needed to wash our clothes before heading on for the final leg of our journey.

We both thought the continental breakfasts were great. They included a lovely and sufficient assortment of fresh pastries, muffins, bagels, cereals, granola, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, juices, coffees,teas and fresh fruit that were adequately replenished.

I went with my daughter for a shopping and hanging out together trip. The hotel is small which adds to its charm. It is clean and the room was very good. The front desk staff were very helpful and personable. Check in was a breeze. It is set up well- you can easily take the elevator or the stairs as it is only 2 stories. The room was quite large, it had a king size bed, comfy pillows, a desk, flat screen tv and free wifi including 2 computers with a printer on the main floor to access. The bathroom was extremely clean the only downfall was a small counter space around the sink making it hard to put much on it. We heard a bit of traffic but no real noise, it was quite quiet. They offer continental breakfast in the morning which was great- it included a variety of bagel, cream cheese, jam, sometimes bread, different types of yogurt, bananas, oranges and apples and hard boiled eggs, juice, coffee and tea as well as baked items like muffins and danish. It was all fresh and clean. There was tables to eat at and take in the news. The good thing was it didn't matter if you got there at the beginning or toward the end, it was replenished. It was great to stat the day. They also had wine and cheese in the evening- red and white with crackers and cheese which also was replenished . Both were a serve yourself which worked out great. Very good set up for this. They also had juice and water in the evening to help yourself to in the same area. All of this was great. We did rent a car and it seemed there was no where around the hotel to park yourself , so we had to valet park . The gentleman who manned this very all personable and helpful. The cost for this was $24.00 a day which seemed like alot but overall seemed standard. There was never a delay for your car, it worked out well just seemed like a lot of money. The hotel itself is a short walk from the Beverly Center, about 4 blocks, which has some shopping and eating. There is a CVS pharmacy across from the Beverly center. Not far from the hotel is another shopping and eating area, called the Grove and the Farmers Market. Great shopping and food here, well worth taking in. It is about a 5-10 min drive from the hotel . You definately need a car if you want to take in Hollywood attractions and Rodeo drive etc. Overall I was very pleased with this hotel- friendly staff, a smaller environment, great breakfast and wine reception and clean.

All in all, a great value. I only had the complimentary breakfast once as it was typical cereal, bland muffins, bagels, juice, coffee. The wine reception was the only thing I can honestly say was not good. They served only two choices of wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Sauvignon Blanc. Both were brands you'd find in the lowest shelf at your local grocery store - really bad stuff. The crackers and cheese were rather skimpy. But, hey, it was free. The reason you pay big bucks for the Sofitel is two things - the \"name\" and the swanky bar. You pay even bigger bucks for the London W Hollywood because of location, the architecture (which is pretty cool) and the Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

All the other hotels in the area were at least $100 more! We actually booked that morning - they had a couple rooms left. This is a great area - convenient to West Hollywood, La Cienega, and Beverly Center. We arrived at 8pm, and immediately after check in took a cheap cab to the Sunset Strip as it was my first trip to LA. On a nice night you could actually walk to the Strip, but it was cool and getting rainy (plus its an uphill walk). The room was ok. Our 1st floor room had a slider to the side walkway of the hotel - I didnt like being that close to people walking by, but I wasn't at the room very long, and I dont people generally walk out there anyway. As long as you are on a higher floor it wont be an issue. the bathroom was huge and the robes nice. The best part of this place besides location was the breakfast. Wow - I was expecting coffee and a banana when they said continental, but this was great. Selection of coffees, OJ, Lemon Water and some others. Boiled eggs, Bagels (with toaster nearby), jam, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, pastries and muffins. I think I am leaving out some stuff. Anyway, I was impressed this was included as part of the price of the room. This spread at a diner or coffee shop would have been at least $15pp if they had this selection. Unlimited made it even better! For some this may not be important but I was on a long flight to get here and had lots of things planned so it was nice to get a solid - quick breakfast without having to fork out more money. A few Newspapers were available for free as well! The breakfast area was really nice too - some tables, couch with coffee table and a couple flat screen tv's. Also a few computers were available for use. Overall seemed like a glamourous budget hotel, safe, clean, well situated and staff very motivated to help. No real amenities like a gym or pool but like i said, a great base and good service. We spent the next 3 nights at the Sofitel down the street which was REALLY nice, with pool, gym, spa, and on-site restaurant / nightclub, but you'll pay 20-30% more on any given night. We got a good deal due to it being the week of thanksgiving so it was worth it. If you like to shop, the Beverly Center and Nordstrom's Rack are right there. Melrose Ave is a few blocks north. Robertson St with all the new designers is a 15 min walk, and the Grove about 25 min walk the other way. I'm not big on buses or public transportation, but did take a bus down Melrose Ave one night home from Pink's Hot Dogs (to Melrose at LaCienega) for $1.50 each, because we were sick of paying 10x that for cabs to go just a mile or so down the street.

The wine was pretty good (Penfolds) and the snacks welcome. The area near the where the breakfast and wine was pretty small, so if there were a lot of guest, you might have trouble finding a place to sit. You could take it back to your room.

There is a CVS Store less then a block away and there are several restaurants within easy walking distance. It is about a 20-minute walk to Rodeo Drive and about a 10 minute drive to Sunset Strip and Hollywood Blvd. It is about 5 minutes to get on Interstate 10 and it took about 20 minutes to get to LAX.

My husband and I found the hotel on Expedia and booked two nights over the weekend at about $210 a night. We thought the price was pretty good for the location of the hotel, and for a Friday and Saturday night. It's in a decent neighborhood within walking distance to the Beverly Center and other restaurants. There is no self-parking which is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel, so you can either park in a metered spot or valet. Valet was about $26 a day after taxes, and we thought it was worth it. The valet staff was always on top of it. We got our car in and out of valet several times and each time we would just call ahead of time to have our car ready and our car was always right outside within 15 min. Our room at the hotel was not bad. It was on the first floor and opened into a small courtyard facing other rooms. That said, it was not very private if you opened the curtains so we kept the curtains closed most of the time which made the room dark. And the fact that all the lights in the room were fluorescent lighting didn't help, but overall, that didn't bother us. The room was really tiny and the bathroom was pretty small too with virtually no counter space so I had to put all of our toiletries and my makeup on the desk outside of the bathroom. But again, this is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel and it wasn't that big of a deal to us. The light in our bathroom made an annoying buzzing sound and the bed was a little firm and stiff for my tastes though my husband thought the bed was comfortable. The walls were not sound proof as we could hear noises all around us including doors shutting and people talking constantly. When we first checked in, we smelled pot in the hallway and the smell seeped into our room because there isn't a great seal around the door which I'm sure is also what contributed to how easily we could hear outside noises. I called the front desk about the pot smell and they took care of it right away. Overall though, the room was clean and updated pretty well for, what I could tell was, a really old building. It was also nice that they provided complimentary wifi even though it was kind of slow, breakfast in the mornings, and wine and cheese receptions in the evenings. The staff was also really friendly and courteous.

In front of Macy's is the bus stop for the Tour Bus Company (if you have tickets you can use them to get anywhere in LA). - about 1 hr easy drive to Santa Monica (thru town) and even less if you take the highway. - Complimentary Wine and cheese every evening for 2 hrs - in the lobby.

When we arrived late, there was no one to park our car at the valet station. and when we went in, it took forever to finally get someone to help with the car. So, my friend is in the car at the curb waiting for the valet to come get the keys and park the car, and what does teh valet guy do? Stand there about 10 feet from teh car and stare into space?! I watched him through the hotel lobby doors, thining that my friend was on teh ohone or something... 10 minutes later I come outside and peer into the car and my friend is like \"where is the valet guy?!\" I turn to the valet and ask him what he's waiting for? His reposne \"oh, he was still in the car.\" SO GO UP AND OPEN THE DOOR AND PARK THE CAR?! I don't understand just standing there 10 feet from the car? We should have left then.

We needed to stay somewhere close in to the west L.A./Hollywood/Santa Monica area to make excursions to good food, sightseeing and a bit of shopping. We've traveled a great deal over the years and are particular when it comes to where we'll stay: Clean, safe and quiet are at the top of our list, followed by friendly staff, good location and reasonable cost. We researched hotels in the L.A. area and were impressed by the Elan. It ranked #2 out of more than 250 hotels rated, so we began by emailing them for availability and to see if they could meet our expectations. Our experience was nothing short of exceptional. Joel, the manager, responded quickly to our requests, providing us with detailed information about the property, room availability, proximity to restaurants and shopping and in general, putting our minds at ease with our decision to stay there, sight unseen. The positive experience begins at the front desk of this centrally located, boutique hotel. The staff is professional and friendly; our request for a quiet room was accommodated; our check in was smooth and the room was comfortable and nicely appointed, from the magnifying mirror in the bathroom to the artwork on the walls: it's the small touches that set this hotel apart. Sure, there's no pool or overpriced coffee shop attached, but the appointments to one's comfort have been carefully thought out. We discovered the Elan was a short walk away from a major shopping center in one direction, about a mile from the Grove and the Farmer's Market the other way. Valet parking eases the burden of driving, and we never had to wait for our car. They even provide a list of radio stations on a card left in the car.

I have been taking my daughter to Cedars-Sinai for 8 years for medical care and usually needed a room for a couple of nights during our visit. I would always use bidding on Priceline to get a bargain. Those bargains are no longer as good as they have been. I called the hotel directly for a Cedars-Sinai rate and it was extremely competitive, in fact lower than the Priceline bid and other area hotels in the same star category. The Elan provides outstanding customer service. It is apparent that is the priority. Because of the time we needed for my daughter's procedure, I requested an early check-in and late check-out and they were very accommodating. The room was spotless and comfy. Every staff member from reservations, valet, front desk to housekeeping performed at the highest expectation. The location is perfect for anyone who goes to Cedars-Sinai as a patient, visitor or for a meeting. You can walk to avoid additional parking fees. There are more restaurants than you can count that are walking distance. CVS is right down the street for pharmacy needs and Jerry's Deli is just a few blocks further for chicken soup! There is no need to spend more money on the Sofitel which is across from Cedars-Sinai(I have many other times). The Elan is much more reasonable and delivers better customer service in a beautiful room, less hassle and a comfy caring atmosphere. Sometimes the smaller boutique hotels I have stayed at in the same area were a great disappointment and I avoided that type of hotel but the Elan is absolutely the gold standard of smaller boutique type hotels. Of course the complimentary continental breakfast and wine reception were a bonus not seen many places in the US and had the quality of a fine European hotel. Easy access to the internet via wifi or the 2 lobby computers are perfect. I also highly recommend the Elan for LA travel and vacation. The location is central to so many areas.

It is a tasteful and comfortable small hotel, convenient for the airport and some local amenities, but not much nightlife. The car parking is rather expensive at $24 per night (per 24 hrs regardless how often you use your car) plus tax (which the travel agents don't mention) so it's a bit like giving your car accommodation too!

You find out early in the morning when you want to go to the gym. Come on - can't you convert one room to a fitness room?! Overall, there are many better options for the price.

So, my caveat to anyone reading this review is that I'm reviewing this hotel based on my experience as a patient and less as a tourist or someone traveling for business. I stayed at the Elan for 7 nights with my mother and husband in a 2 dbl bedroom. I will be staying at the hotel again for a follow-up visit to Cedars Sinai. However, depending on what you are going in for this may or may not be the option for you. Here are the pros and cons of staying at this hotel as a patient: PROS: 1) extremely close to hospital; w/in walking distance or a cheap, short cab ride ($5) if need be; 2) staff is extremely courteous and prompt if you have any issues w/ the room; 3) rooms are extremely clean!!! as a patient, i found this to be very important; 4) beds are very comfortable, also very important if you are recovering from something; 5) free breakfast in the morning - not a hot breakfast, but plenty of great things to eat which was very convenient and a major cost-savings 6) although they don't have a restaurant onsite, they do have a deli that delivers often to the site in case you want to eat in; 7) if you don't want to eat in, there are plenty of restaurants nearby to eat in or get take-out (note: just prior to my procedure, we ate at Grand Lux Cafe only a short walk away, and all 3 of us contracted major food poisoning!!!!!!!!!!! this almost jeopardized my entire purpose out there. Fortunately, we were so close to the hospital, so my mom & I were able to get to the ER very quickly with a cab that the hotel called for us. But don't eat at the Grand Lux!!!; 8) there is a refrigerator in the room as well as a microwave to reheat any leftovers 9) free wifi - which was great for my husband since he worked from the hotel while I was back and forth to the hospital; 10) we had a slight problem w/ our room and needed to switch after a day or 2. As a tourist, the problems (described below) wouldn't have bothered me too much, but since I was a patient and spending a lot of time in the room, they became important. Due to the inconvenience of having to switch rooms, the hotel actually comped us 1 night - which was extremely generous; 11) whenever we needed transportation anywhere, there was a cab waiting within minutes. CONS: 1) if you are staying there for an extended period of time, you may want a kitchenette which this hotel does not offer; 2) the wifi wasn't always the best and neither was cell service, but it's free, so can't complain; 3) we had some slight problems w/ our bathtub drain backing up and the keys were tempermental - sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't, so we went through lots of keys. But the hotel made up for this (see #10 above) So, as you could see, I thought the Elan was a great choice for my purpose. As I mentioned before, I plan on staying there again for a follow-up visit. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Even when we did experience problems, they took them seriously, were prompt in trying to fix them, but offered for us to switch rooms (which we did) and still comped us 1 night.

On check-out we were told we did not owe anything as our room had been pre-paid, we let them know we had utilised the bar fridge and presented the filled out list of beverages consumed. On settling the bill we were not only taxed for the beverages but charged a surcharge as well. That was a new one on us- a charge for getting a drink from the fridge!!! As we had arrived by super shuttle to the hotel and had not been pleased with this arrangement I asked about a taxi for the following evening. One was booked for us and I was told it would cost us 45USD because it had been booked through the hotel. The taxi was spot on time but the driver was quick to let us know the fare was 50USD ,which I paid and tipped accordingly. I would be interested to know who got that one wrong.

The Elan staff made sure to stow our luggage for the better part of the 2nd day of our LA time and the day of our flight and-- are you ready for this-- let us borrow a small single unit to shower and dress for our flight. The suites we stayed in were roomy and wonderful-- if you were on your own and really didn't need the space of a suite, then this tiny room would be okay, but honestly, it was almost difficult just to bring wheeled duffle bags into the single unit. It definitely served the purpose, but this would not be a chosen room for a couple. There was no charge for the borrowed room-- and it made all the difference in the world-- before boarding such a long flight. We have nothing but praise for the Elan Hotel and the staff.

Firstly the hotel was really clean and air conditioned with the added benefit of Free Wi-Fi (inc. 2 terminals in reception) and Free Continental Breakfast (Muffins, Bagels, Fruit, Cereal etc.). There was also the lovely touch of a Free Wine & Cheese Reception each evening. The staff were very friendly and helped with requests and information when required. The room was very nice if quite small. Not much room to swing a cat but I wasn't worried about this. There are a few downsides though unfortunately. I had asked for rose petals to be sprinkled on the bed sheet upon arrival as it was a honeymoon stay but there was nothing. Not really a big deal but it would have been nice to have had some sort of acknowledgement of the fact. The toilet was broken within the cistern which meant the bowl would never fill with water, you had to manually fix it each time you flushed the toilet. I had mentioned to reception and they said that they would send somebody to look at it. I don't know if anyone did or not but the toilet was broken for the entire stay. The major problem however, was the air conditioning in the room. There is no individual console to adjust your room temperature as it is part of a multiple room console. As you can imagine having the air con on all day and night made the room very cold during the night and the mornings but the worse part was the vibrating air con pipes. The vibrations reverberated through the ceiling light making it vibrate and it also reverberated through the floor up through the bed and gave you a nice buzzing noise in your ears when trying to sleep. I had enquired at reception but there was nothing they could do as the air con was shared with other rooms. However, there was work being carried out inside the hotel during my stay and they were apparently installing air con on a room basis, so this will hopefully alleviate the problem.

Location is good for LA, close to the Beverly Centre, but since we are \"public transportation when travelling\" guys, I think the next time in LA I'd rather stay in Hollywood, because of the subway and the taxis always available(@ Elan a taxi would take more than 20 min to come).

The Hotel Elan was the first hotel of the trip, and definitely one of the best. Location - The hotel was easy to find by car, just pull up at the front for the valet parking. Saying it's close to the Beverley Centre doesn't do it justice - it's literally a 30 second walk away! There is also a CSV pharmacy opposite, and a gas station next door. We ate at the Grand Lux Cafe at the Beverley Centre, and really enjoyed the food (massive portions!). The hotel is a 20-30 minute walk to Sunset Boulevard, and a short taxi ride to Hollywood. Room - We stayed in a deluxe double, and the room was a very good size with a large bed and a huge balcony looking out onto Beverly Blvd. Despite this there was no road noise at night, and we slept very well. The bathroom was large and clean, and I particularly liked the smell of the toiletries! Housekeeping were great, and the turn-down service with chocolates and the weather forecast was a lovely touch. There was a really useful information booklet in the room that included reviews and location of local restaurants. There were a large number of TV channels, and also free wi-fi. Facilities - Unfortunately we didn't attend the drinks and wine reception as we weren't back at the hotel in time on both evenings, but we did enjoy the breakfast buffet. It was well stocked with bagels, muffins, cereal, yoghurt, pastries, boiled eggs, fruit, and juices and coffee with take-away cups available. Staff - The staff were all extremely polite, friendly and helpful. The valet guys took me downstairs to the car to collect my sunglasses when I'd left them down there without any problem, and the reception staff were happy to give directions and recommend restaurants. As we only had one full day to see LA we decided to go on the Starline City Sightseeing hop on-hop off bus tour, which we boarded just outside the Beverley Centre (outside Macy's menswear entrance). We used two of the four available loops, and went to Hollywood, then through Beverley Hills and Rodeo Drive and on to Santa Monica, where we spent the afternoon on the pier. It was a great value tour which cost $30, you can buy tickets when you board the bus, no need to book. We also went out with some friends on Sunset Strip in the evening, and went to the Rainbow Bar & Grill and Mel's Diner, both of which we'd recommend (particularly Rainbow Bar & Grill for the generous spirit measures!).

The Elan has single handily has to be one of the best hotels ive stayed in the world. Ive stayed in many hotels around the world, and this I have to say comes near the top of my list. The reason I rate this so highly is because the staff are so friendly and the location is great. You have to remember this is LA and everything is not always within walking distance, still the location is great for what its worth, it just down the road from the Beverly Centre & Macy\u2019s, there is great places to eat with in walking distance. Other places such as Hollywood, Sunset, Rodeo are not so far away, however I would seriously recommend that you do the Starlines Grand tour, they will show you everything you need to see, and aswel as this you can revisit the areas of interest if you wish to further investigate. They will pick you up and drop you off from your hotel, really worth it. The \u00e9lan is also not so far away from down town Los Angeles, ensure you try and go and watch a NBA or NHL game at the staples centre, really worth while The hotel itself offers a free complementary breakfast, which is great, and will save you some serious money especially if you\u2019re a family, I\u2019m vegetarian and there was even something there for me lol. The free internet is also super, as many hotels I\u2019ve been to always charge you a hourly fee for the usage, it really helps if you want to plan your day the night before, top stuff Elan. In the morning they clean your room and leave you a weather forecast for the following day, which is so good as you know how to prepare yourselves. In conclusion I would seriously recommend this hotel to anyone, I\u2019m a person who normally goes for 5*+ hotels, but this should rated more then 3*.

But, unfortunately, there is only so much you can do with a building shell that was obviously a former motel. To provide a bit more background about my travel style, and therefore expectations: I am a TA devotee. When I travel, I always consult TA first and then make my travel plans accordingly. Everyone who knows me knows of my faith in the TA community and our honest, helpful reviews. When my mom and I were planning this short trip to LA, I told her that I would plan the hotel and assured her that she was in good hands. She is more of a hotel brand name follower and I'm sure would have preferred that we booked with Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, since those brand names give her comfort - and for good reason, since they invariably deliver on their promise of luxury, often at a price. Back to the Elan - when we arrived at the hotel and pulled up alongside where the valet station was located, I could feel my stomach drop. The website, while only providing limited pictures and none of the exterior of the entire building, certainly did not prepare me for what I was seeing. As I mentioned above, the exterior showed a two-story building that was most likely a former motel or travel lodge. The lobby was small, but nicely decorated, as were the rooms themselves. It is obvious that considerable renovations were done to this property, as the furniture in the room had little extra touches, such as wood trim and a flat screen TV. Also, the shower head and water pressure in the bathroom were superb. But unfortunately, the room itself was extremely small, as were the \"balcony\" and bathroom. I was also disappointed with the quality of the linens. Most distressing was the room's heating mechanism, or more accurately, lack there of - the instructions on the unit were extremely confusing and even when we figured them out and did as instructed, we were still left shivering in a very chilly room! Given the attentiveness of the staff, I feel comfortable that someone would have come to lend a hand if we had called, but we were so tired from being out all day during both days of our short stay, we were simply too tired to hassle with it and just bundled up for bed. Some high points - the breakfast buffet provided a lovely array of baked goods. Also, the location was right down the road from the Beverly Center and close to freeway access. Unfortunately, the road on which the hotel is located (Beverly) is rather busy and the traffic was a bit noisy at night. The free high speed internet really was free and really did work, which was a nice surprise. Overall, this wasn't a bad property - but honestly I was expecting so much more given that it is rated as #1 in all of Los Angeles! This is the first time that I have ever felt let down by TA reviews, and unfortunately I now fear that it has made a skeptic out of my mother. I would not return to this property because I feel that with the great number of hotels within the greater Los Angeles area, there is probably somewhere that I would enjoy more. But I do give kudos to the owners and management of this property for making the most of what they have to work with.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but not perfect!\u201d", "Author": "alliyance", "ReviewID": "UR50897674", "Content": "Stay there for 3 nights, Very clean, room are not big and not small, in between.

The staff cannot be faulted and were very professional and hospitable - better than we've had in some 5 star hotels!!! Even the cleaners made you smile as whilst they don't have the nicest of jobs to do, they do their work smiling and laughing with their colleagues yet managing to do a good job. Michael (Front Desk) deserves special mention. There was a small mix up on arrival - we were given keys to a room which was still being cleaned; Michael gave us keys to another room and told us to take a look, and if not, we could wait for the other one (ask for a room facing out rather than into their atrium area as these rooms can be dark. Also, following recommendations from other Tripadvisor guests, we had also requested a room on the 2nd floor). We waited for our room and were immediately sent up a bottle of decent wine as an apology. Apart from the charge for parking (discussed later), there are no hidden costs at this hotel which makes a nice change. Internet, Breakfast and wine & cheese in the evening (decent wine, cheese/crackers could be better) were all complimentary. Breakfast is decent: bagels (toaster available), danishes, muffins, hardboiled eggs (cold), yogurts, cereal and a selection of tea and coffee and fully available from 6.30am (as we found out on the morning of check-out - much appreciated). Rooms are small but nice. We had problems with the heating and so found ourselves in reception each evening, and whilst they tried tweaking their computers, there was no change in temperature; in the end we took up their offer of a portable heater - so my recommendation here is ask, and they will try and help.. Good supply of towels. Nice beds. Good location, being situated in West Hollywood; as near main road, very easy to get to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. To stay here (and probably anywhere in LA) you would need a car. Big shopping mall 2 mins walk away (Beverly Centre) and plenty of places to eat - have a look at the info pack in your room which gives you a list of good restaurants which are walkable distance, and others that you would need to drive to. The Grove (posh eating/shopping/cinema complex is also only about 10 mins away in a car). There is a charge for Parking, which with taxes is $21 a night. Whilst the thought of paying so much for parking is not a a nice one, it is worth it given the lack of parking in the vicinty (very confusing signage). They park your car away from the main road, but we never had to wait more than a few mins for our car and the valet staff were very friendly and courteous. My suggestion is to just budget this into the cost of the hotel stay and then forget about it. In summary, whilst by no means cheap, this hotel is probably very good value given the location and the fact that decent hotels in LA are not cheap.

I didnt talk much to the morning shift guys as i was generally straight out the door, but i spent alot of time chatting with the night guys after my night out and they sure are great for a chat. A quick story why they are so great - i had a hire car and needed to fill up gas before returning, but the gas station have dodgy people tryng to hustle me so i got out of there - when i told the night valet guy (john) about it, he jumped in the car with me and filled it up for me!! where do you get that kind of service? only from Elan - legends location is awesome - the beverly centre is right there and the big freeway to get you around isnt too far either. also can you say free wireless?? - everywhere else in the states wanted to charge me but Elan set the standard again :) We loved this place so much we booked it for our last leg in LA before heading back and listen up Aussies - they have vegimite! vegimite on a bagel = win general tip for LA - get a car because LA is spread out I'm heading back next year and will definately stay at the Elan.

Not only that but when the repast arrived it included a bottle of our favourite Aussie red wine! The rest of our stay was equally comfortable, the staff being just as happy advising us of bus timetables and bus stop locations as arranging for another guest's hire car to be upgraded to a Hummer! They were also very helpful in arrangingtours etc. The location was all we could have hoped for - a stroll around the block before breakfast was through a delightful residential area; we walked out at night and felt perfectly safe locating a bar and restaurant some blocks away.

The location, cleanliness and value for money are great but what absolutely sets this hotel above others is the outstanding commitment to customer service. As this was my first visit to LA I did quite a lot of research and chose this hotel due to the positive reflections in other reviews. After booking I made enquiries from the hotel regarding getting from LAX to the hotel. William suggested a fixed rate option with a taxi and made all transport arrangements for us with the whole process going like clockwork. We were met inside the terminal by Caesar (taxi driver extraordinare!) who collected our luggage from the carousel and whisked us into LA to be met at the door of the Elan by Paoulo who took our luggage direct to our room. The service remained at this standard for the three days with any request, from just general info to tour bookings responded to immediately with no fuss. The room was very quiet and clean with two double beds so just perfect for us. The bathroom was modern and spotless. The complimentary wine and cheese at 5pm each day was delightful and a nice way to unwind before dinner. We also appreciated the weather forecast delivered to our room when we returned to the hotel in the evening as we could plan clothes for the next day. This was particularly helpful as the temperature increased by 12 degrees (to 88) on our second day.

The hotel also provides free wine & cheese every day between 5pm and 7pm, which is a good occasion to meet other travellers or simply drink for free....

Valet parking is $20/night and is the only realistic option if you bring a car. Now that the positive has been covered, here's the reason for our bad rating. When the hotel was refurbished, they kept the original doors, and they block as much noise as a sheet of paper. If you stay on the first floor, expect to be woken up by breakfast from 7am and cleaners from 8 am. And if you're staying in the weekend but don't stay out too late, expect to be woken up as the late nighters return home. We were woken up at 3am by loud guests chatting in the lobby, and the staff in the 24h reception didn't do anything to quiet them. It was not until another guest asked them to go to bed that it stopped. When we checked out the receptionist told us we should request a 2nd floor room the next time we stay there. Our recommendation to Tripadvisor readers would be to call up front and make sure you get a room on second floor. Rooms 101-104 should be avoided at all costs, and 105-108 will also be noisy.

First, the minuses: The cost of the valet parking. I realize the hotel is in West Hollywood, but $19 a day seems a bit steep, especially when self-parking under the hotel seems a viable option. Then there's the noise. Our first room was next to a prep area for the buffets, so starting very early every morning, we got a blast of tinkling glasses and rolling carts. We were also subject to hearing loud conversations in the lobby. And on the second afternoon, a mysterious buzzing/rumbling began that didn't let up for the next 18 hours. It wasn't loud enough to prevent sleep -- but was just under that threshold. And cell phone accessibility is spotty. Oh, and of the three public computers in the lobby, only one is connected to the printer. Not necessarily a problem, but when one woman spends more than an hour surfing on and printing menus from seemingly every restaurant in the greater Los Angeles area, it can be a little frustrating. Those caveats out of the way, we had a great time. When we told the staff about the above-mentioned noise, they were johnny-on-the-spot about investigating and moving us to a new and far quieter room. The staff is the hotel's biggest plus; unfailingly friendly and efficient, they're gems. (On checkout, when a false honor bar charge appeared on our bill, the desk clerk took it off with no argument, and on our final night, when we arrived back at the hotel quite late, they offered us the option of a later checkout.) The beds are very comfortable and the amenities are quite nice. Showers are a little lacking, but acceptable (even if the boiler went out for a while on our second morning).

Elan was an excellent launching pad for Los Angeles - it is across the road from the Beverley Centre - has restaurants in the street (the italian Trattatoria was superb), and the bus to \"anywhere\" is on the corner. We used public transport for all of our adventures - and loved the 25c dash! Travelled comfortably to Universal Studios and Santa Monica using the buses and trains. And each day the Elan staff answered our questions - printed out timetables, maps and schedules and even helped us with elusive change for the bus! If you are looking for a central location in beautifully appointed accommodation, with friendly, personal staffing support at an affordable price - Elan should be the first place you research.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New South Wales", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding value, presentation and service, congratulations Elan!\u201d", "Author": "markandsuec", "ReviewID": "UR30867736", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Elan on two separate occasions in the past 10 days and were totally blown away by the extraordinary level of service provided by the staff and manager of the Elan. From the moment we arrived, (earlier than we should have), everything happend smoothly and nothing was too much trouble for the staff to arrange for us. (like car hire, tourist bus tickets, luggage storage for a few days, etc, etc). The immaculate presentation was a delight to find and the complimentary 'wine and cheese welcome' held each evening in the lobby was excellent.,.. a great way to break the ice and meet some fellow travellers. The Elan is just a stroll from the Beverley Centre shopping mall and various restaurants (including the superb sushi cafe just 100 metres away),. and the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus service which is also brilliant. So if you are looking for a great location to base yourselves in LA, we cannot rate the Elan highly enough in such an otherwise expensive city. It is outstanding value and we will be staying there again. Our congratulations to Joel and his staff,..this is one hotel we will defintely recommend to all our friends! Mark Currie.

The hotel is one block from La Cienega Blvd where you can catch buses any where in the city, believe me I went everywhere; weekends though are lousy for taking buses, sometimes they don't come at all. The hotel is small, not really a boutique hotel, just small, but you feel like a part of a family unlike say staying at the Sofitel up the street, paying more than double and not having anyone notice your existence. Omar at the front desk is a sweetheart, always a smile and a hello when he saw me come in in the afternoons. Check-in no hassle at all. Room 206 one queen bed, inside room VERY quiet. Room is small but I was alone so it was fine. Great bed and bedding, 4 great pillows and 4 throw pillows besides and an extra one in the closet. Iron and ironing board in closet too. Desk and chair and internet connection and a large flat screen TV. Small bathroom but adequate with very nice toiletries. Yikes!! no hair dyer and I didn't take one!! No problem, I told Karla the housekeeping girl that I had thought I had read there were hair dyers in the rooms, she said she'd see what she could do and of course when I got back that afternoon there was the needed item. There is also a free in-room safe which I didn't use, I just locked everything in my suitcases and it was fine. Having breakfast included is heavenly. If, however, you need eggs over easy or pancakes or anything substantial you'll do better going across the street to Jan's Restaurant, more on that in a minute. The buffet breakfast has yoghurt, granola, cereal, milk, orange juice, coffee, hot water for the lovely teas they offer, danish, muffins and bagels and yes, they have cream cheese. There's a toaster and a microwave and oh, on a couple of days they had the most heavenly freshly baked banana nut bread. They also have a fruit bowl with bananas, apples and oranges. Breakfast is from 6:30-10:30am. There is also a little outdoor terrace for breakfast for you smokers or those wanting to enjoy the morning sun. I never got around to the wine in the evening, I always got back to the hotel late after siteseeing and shopping. They also have one computer in the little lobby so you can check your email at no extra cost. Jan's Restaurant is right across the street, but of course you have to walk a block one way just to cross and then a half a block to reach the restaurant. They serve breakfast all day and night so one night I went all out and had a big breakfast and on my last night I had dinner there; prices are fair and the food is decent. Take a bus from La Cienega to Sunset and you have all the hot night spots and restaurants or stay on the bus and it will take to straight to Hollywood. Walk a couple of blocks to 3rd street and hop a bus right to The Grove, or go the other way and head to Rodeo Drive. You can get any where you want from the Elan by bus. For you shoppers you have within 3 blocks of the hotel, Beverly Center with Macy's and Bloomingdales as anchors; Lohmann's Men across the street and a block up Lohmann's women's. There is a Grand Luxe Caf\u00e9 where I ate twice, expensive but I was on vacation. Not only is this a great hotel but ALL the people that work there are so very nice and you can't beat the price and it includes breakfast.

We were also able to get the 25 cent bus at the end of the road to Hollywood Blvd. We were impressed with our lovely room, the bathrobe, toiletries and the breakfast was an added bonus. There was everything you could need for breakfast (as my husband and I don't do greasy food) and you could have as much as you wanted. Although we were never there for the wine reception, it was great to know that it was available. The staff really couldn't have been more helpful as we needed 25 cent for the bus one day and they were going to give it to us. There was a little conufsion on our return home as our credit card had been billed a nominal amount but I contacted the hotel and it was refunded immediately.

Negatives- The room was small, had an overpriced honor bar,(which was kindly removed when asked so we wouldn't be tempted,) no microwave,nor vent in the bathroom,the walls are not soundproofed so we did hear neighbors showering and muffled conversation in the morning, and the cost for valet parking was $19.50 a night! But being on a tight budget and hating to pay for parking, I parked on the side street (Croft) each night when we returned from our siteseeing, put a few quarters in the meter, then parking was free until 8 am when I put a few more in until we headed out for the day. The valet was so friendly we chatted every day and I apologized for not using his services. He was nice enough that he actually looked out for my car and checked the meter to make sure I was on top of it.

After our arrival, one of the Desk Clerks asked us had we plans to attend a show while in LA, he recommeded either Jersey Boys or Wicked, we opted for Jersey Boys as it's not due in Europe until 2008. He said he could get tickets for $115 which we thought was quite alot but he assured us they were good tickets, so we went ahead. With booking fee etc. the total at $245. When we got to the theatre we were very upset to see our $115 tickets actually had a face value of $60 so we paid $110 over the odds (not something we would never, ever do), we felt quite \"done\". Taxis each way were $40 plus tips so overall an expensive night. We edmention it to the desk clerk when we returned that evening and he did apologise, however, they should tell guests they are booking with an agent and that the tickets will be inflated in price in future.

For a woman a provided good iron was a must. Great bathroom with a bath-tube, nice toiletries, a bathrobe, thick towels of all sizes.

My employer usually uses Le Meridien, which is around the corner on La Cienega, but it closed on the 9th for a long renovation. Sofitel just up the street was too expensive. The Elan lived up to the promises made on its Web site. It is a clean, simple, small property in a fabulous location. I walked to WeHo nightlife, breakfast and shopping on 3rd Street, dinner, and shopping at the Beverly Center. In fact, I valet parked my car at 5 p.m. on Friday and had no need to drive again until 2 p.m. on Saturday---very unusual for L.A.! I stayed in room 209 which is on the street side, southwest corner. I recommend the room unless you are super-sensitive to street noise, as it had its own private balcony. Views weren't great, but from one corner of the balcony I could see the Hollywood Hills. Directly across the street was a Taco Bell and a Goodwill Store; to the west, Macy's and Bloomingdale's were so close, you could practically throw a baseball and hit the side of their building. Room itself was fairly spare but had everything one would need, and it was very clean. Modern, well-appointed, nice carpeting, good furniture, good bed, nice linens, and a clean bathroom with good quality soaps and shampoos. Honor bar. FREE wireless internet. Yes, FREE. You don't get that in the fancy places! I got a rate of $169/night through my corporate travel agent, which beat the hotel's own Web site by $20/night. Valet parking was $16/night, which isn't cheap but not bad, really. There are nearby meters and when I did use my car, I sometimes parked at a meter rather than go through the whole valet drop-off procedure. Not to worry, though: when you call for your car, it's usually curbside within three minutes; the garage is under the building. There aren't many amenties on-site, but, really, who cares? You can walk to shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc. There's a very small fitness center with 3 or 4 treadmills and stair machines. But it's L.A., for goodness sake, so if you want to go running, you just hit the streets. (Actually, I recommend visiting Runyon Canyon Park for a fun hike/run and incredible views of the L.A. city basin; about a 10 or 15 minute drive from the hotel.) Room rate includes continental breakfast in the lobby. This was really quite decent: cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee/tea. What more do you need? Plenty of tables and seating areas, with views onto Beverly Blvd., where you can eat. Also some seating on patio. There is a small \"business center\" room with a computer and printer, where I printed out my boarding pass for flight home, plus a small conference table. Nothing fancy, but if you needed to have a little business meeting with a few associates, it would be fine. Staff were uniformly pleasant, cheerful, helpful, from the valet/doorman guy to the desk clerk to the maids. No complaints there. One thing I was puzzled about was what the views are from the rooms that are on the inner corridor. As I mentioned, I was in a room on the exterior of the building, on a corner, but the hallway went in a full rectangle, so the inner rooms must look out onto some sort of courtyard or something. I would ask for a room onto the back alley or onto the street, myself. Again, I highly recommend room 209, as it's a corner room with balcony. So often you book a room at a hotel that looks kinda cool on the Web site, and then you get there only to have your expectations not met and your hopes dashed. The Elan was a pleasant surprise. Keep your expectations realistic (this ain't the Four Seasons, folks), and you'll be happy. Need nightlife?

Also pretty close to airpost and a quick/easy drive from the airport car rental outlets. Also felt safe walking around this area and easy bus access from outside the Beverly center to all the major LA attractions. Highly recommend using the bus service, cheap at $3 a day pass and it got us eveywhere we wanted to go, from Universal to Knottsberry, staples center, etc. Just go to their metro website, print out the buses you need to catch (and make sure you print return info also) and your golden. Free internet and printing in the hotel was great for doing this. Only real criticism about the hotel where the extremely thin walls, we had some noisy neighbours on both sides and its pretty bad. Some muffled noises I can put up with but being able to hear every word as if they were in bed next to you isnt acceptable for a hotel in this price range. Definately pack your ear plugs! Other than that, room was good size and had a safe, price was reasonable from the research we did before booking but in the grand scheme of things certainly not cheap. Staff were good, friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good too. Definately easy to start the day this way than having to find somewhere to eat. So overall a good place, if they insulated the walls I would say a great place to stay. One other thing I'll mention here because I can't find place to do so is if your using Alamo beware! We dropped off our rental car after a few days (when we switched to public transport mentioned above) and when we asked for a taxi from Alamo to get back to the hotel, they said they would call us one. About 1/2 hr later a guy turns up and says he will take us and another lady to our destinations. Clearly just a friend of one of the Alamo employees and not a registerd taxi, thought this could work in our favour but after taking us completely the wrong way he decided then would be good time to talk about the price, about 3 times what it should have been! told him [--] and (after drinving for over an hour for what should have only been a 15 minute drive). Finally got there and paid him what I thought he deserved. We gort away OK becuase we had some background knowledge but I hate to think how many people hes ripped off.

This causes a problem in the morning when the sun shines directly into your eyes while you eat breakfast. In the evening when they serve a brilliant free cheese and wine buffet you can still be viewed from the road. I found it a little too open for comfort.......consider blinds please! We stayed there on two separate occassions, both times the rooms were clean and tidy, although if you are allocated room number 229 try not to sleep in the bed near the window, as the air condition via the vent is directed to the head.

In between these stays, we were holidaying in other US locations. We were visiting the US for a vacation and are Australians. We've been to LA several times before so sightseeing in LA was not a priority. Rather, relaxing and having fun in Beverly Hills was our objective. This hotel was therefore located well for us, being very close to the Beverly Center mall and close to the \"hip\" shopping streets of Beverly Hills - eg, Robertson Boulevard, and Melrose. A downside to the location is that Beverly Boulevard (in the direction away from the Beverly Center) is sometimes a little seedy: There were some suspicious characters hanging around in the street but they did not appear dangerous (but what do I know?). There are plenty of good restaurants nearby. However, our favourite restaurant is, in fact, a diner (!!) right opposite the Elan. It is called Jan's coffee house. It has wonderful food and if you use Google you will find out quickly that it is a traditional US diner. The customers are locals and either baby boomers or older seniors. It is popular and noisy but in a fun way. The Elan delivers meals from Jan's if you request room service. A menu from Jan's is in each room. We didn't take great advantage of the free Elan morning buffet (which was fine) as we liked the bigger breakfasts (many types of omelettes and other all day breakfast dishes) and coffee (which some on the internet rate as LA's best coffee!) at Jan's. However, my husband brought up coffee and fruit juice from the buffet to get us started, first thing each morning. At the end of each day, the complimentary wine and cheese was a great wind down / wind up. The usual idiot talking loudly on his cell phone to all his great clients threatened to spoil one such occasion. What can you do? These idiots are everywhere nowadays (sigh). The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and comfortable, and all the electrical appliances worked well. Daily room service was unobtrusive and meticulous. Beds were comfy. Airconditioning was a little temperamental, but that may have been our lack of skill. The elevator was satisfactory but could use a clean. (If staff are reading this, I am sure they will immediately clean it!) We had a small balcony outside our room. We liked our room overlooking Beverly Boulevard as you feel part of the city and it really comes alive at dawn with traffic. (You can request a quieter room not overlooking the boulevard if you prefer. ) What sets this hotel apart from others, however, is the superior service provided at the front desk. Eg: Every time we came close to entering the front glass doors, a man ran to open them for us and greeted us with a friendly smile. The staff were genuinely interested in where we were from, what we planned to do for the day, and any particular requests we had. Yet they did not once become nosy. They know exactly where to draw the line. Also, every complaint we made (and yes, we did have a few minor ones such as asking for a tradesman to stop cleaning a carpet in a nearby room with a noisy machine while we were in our room) was answered with an apology and immediate attention and resolution of our complaint. Eg: When we rejected a Beverly Hills cab that they had called because a horribly scruffy, dirty looking man alighted from the taxi (he was the driver!!!) they called us another cab immediately and apologised. They did not criticise us for not caring about a scruffy cab driver or refusing to accept the cab. When the scruffy cab driver came into the lobby to ask where the passengers were, I heard the desk clerk say, \"They (meaning us) changed their mind\". He was pretty smooth! On our second stay in January we rented a car at the airport and the valet parking was perfect. We tipped every now and again and when we didn't tip (due to rushing) the man was still just as nice to us. The man who carried our bags to our room on arrival and from our room on departure was quick and attentive, and competent. Our bed was turned down each evening and the radio was on playing soothing music. There were small chocolates left on the bed for us each evening and a printed note relaying the next day's weather forecast. I had my laptop with me and so used the free wifi access which worked well. There was other internet access available for guests. The front desk staff will go to any lengths to help the guests with requests or complaints. The staff seem to really enjoy being in the hospitality game. Both my husband and I recommend this place highly for the superior front desk service and great location!

Rooms => small, but the bed is great and large. Decoration is very simple and modern. Walls are too thin as usual, so you end up hearing your neighbor's conversation. Hopefully we were on the top floor. One big problem is the central air-conditionning system => it is very loud and noisy and you cannot switch it off in your room. So we had to change room and bought some tape and cartoon to fix it in front of the air opening. Value => I won't say the breakfast is free as advertised by the hotel as for sure they factored the cost into the room price. For information, we went to the Sofitel nearby and asked for the room price and it comes only USD 60 more expensive per night but you have a truly 5-star hotel service and amenities. So good value if you take the location into consideration. Extra => mandatory valet parking (by the way check your bill carefully as we rented a car for the 1st day only and they charged us valet parking = USD 15 for our entire 9 nights stay although we had no car anymore), a small but convenient gym with a TV and a PC free to use for hotel guests. Location => great location as we did not have a car. Walking distance of Beverly Center, Beverly Connection, Cedars Sinai Hospital, Farmers Market.

After reading loads of reviews about crabby and skanky hotels in LA, I was at a wits end until I chanced upon the reviews of Hotel Elan on Tripadvisor. Based on the raving reviews, we booked 3 rooms in Oct and were totally glad we trusted Tripadvisor.com once again! The Hotel Elan is a shining beacon in a sea of really expensive hotels and really crabby motels in LA. It may be a \"higher-end\" budget place or as some term it a \"boutique\" hotel, however what sealed our wonderful experience here was really the staff at reception. Practically everyone at reception was super helpful, friendly and took obvious pride in their work. They took pains to ask us each day where we intended to go, and unprompted, printed driving maps for us and gave us very clear directions - really helpful for us as we were used to driving on the other side of the road! We felt really welcome here and got great advice from the staff about places to go, restaurants and night spots. The rooms are nicely appointed, although on the small side. And as this used to be an old folk's home before it was given new life as a hotel, the hallways still retain an \"old folks home\" feeling. We had 3 rooms - 2 were small and faced the inner courtyard, 1 was at the end of the corridor and was distinctly larger. If you prefer more space for your rooms, ask for the rooms at the end of the corridors. The location was convenient as well, close to Sunset and Santa Monica Blvds, and it was easy getting to the major freeways. I loved the fact that I could walk to Beverly Center shopping mall, which was useful since I had a free day by myself whilst my friends went to Magic Mountain. I spent an entire day at the mall and walked back by myself after dark - it was quite safe. The free continental breakfast that comes with the room was more than adequate. The lobby area does get quite crowded during peak breakfast time, and like another reviewer pointed out, it gets really hot with the sun streaming in. We tried to get back in time for the free wine reception but alas, the sights of LA beckoned and we never did made it in time. Was a nice thought though. Overnight parking for our car was $14 in an underground garage - it was great to have a valet park it and bring it around in the morning. On our second day, the guy at reception recognised us and before we could request for our car, it was driven out whilst we were having breakfast - great service! Overall, we loved the Hotel Elan!

I had a huge fear of paying a ton of money to be treated like crap or have a bad experience, so I really sweated the hotel selection. I craved a modern decor and not a chain hotel, and leaned toward the Chamberlain for awhile, but eventually decided on the Elan thanks to the reivews on this site. I booked thru Travelocity and paid $155/night from Nov 19 to Nov 24, checking out on Nov 25. This was for the king sized bed suite. We could not have been happier with the entire experience. Though the room was not huge, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable for the two of us (and bro & gf) to lounge between activities. Dead quiet at night (we had a room off the back alley of the hotel), we slept great every night (wonderful linens). Only had the continental breakfast one day (6:30 to 10am) because we overslept the rest of the week. :D You had your choice of cereals, breads to toast, fruit, hardboiled eggs, juice and milk. And every evening from 5 to 7 was the wine and cheese tasting, which we frequented a lot more. :D We never got around to it, but you could also have massage in your hotel room. There is also a small work out room, but darn, never got in there either. ;P Did duck in once to use the business room computer for some directions, which we printed. Also, we had a balcony so the boys could go out and smoke...see pic...(all the other guest pix on this site have the rooms and other views covered) The staff was friendly and polite, especially Yolanda during check in. There is an ice machine in the basement right off the elevator, and several conveniences nearby. I joked that this hotel was my destiny, as there was a Taco Bell right across the street. We ate at Jan's Restaurant Sunday night because everything at Beverly Center was closed. Did finally break down one late night when getting back to the area, and got some Taco Bell. There is also the Mexican chain Alcupulco (sp?) and Norm's diner right around the corner. And to top it off, a gas station right up the street so we could feed our Pepsi/Mountain Dew fix in a town oversaturated with Coke products, and a drugstore right across the street from there, for all those little things we forgot. There is also a Jamba Juice, Baja Express and Souplantation right down the cross street (La Cienega I think). Do some exploring b/c there is plenty around the area, but it is nice and quiet at night so you can recover from the craziness that is LA during the day. When my brother moved out to LA, my dad spent $90 to stay in a Days Inn in the Studio City area, so I sure felt the Elan was worth it...despite the crazy drive over the canyon with my brother behind the wheel... I could not recommend it more, and would absolutely book there again if needing to be in the area...it was a great trip, and a lot of that was thanks to the cute little Elan Hotel Modern.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhy stay anywhere else?\u201d", "Author": "frocha", "ReviewID": "UR6171228", "Content": "Can\u2019t say enough good things about the Elan Hotel.

However, you will find that going to the Rexall Drug Store down the street will save you quite a bit on food and other items.

However, they allow rental of a handful of movies from the front desk (didn't use). The room itself was very clean and to our surprise, classical music was playing each day we returned from our sightseeing adventures. The chocolates on the bed and the weather forecast for the next day were also a nice added touch.

The staff at the Elan were very friendly, from greeting us to ensuring that our taxi service arrived on time (they yelled at them a couple times on our behalf).

After staying at the Hotel Elan for three days I can definitely say it's a great, clean, safe hotel that is a bargain if you can get it for under $100 a night. The positives: the desk staff and cleaning staff are beyond helpful. They were 100% courteous and polite. Any time we had a question (even at 3a.m.) they found an answer quickly and professionally. There was not one time during our stay when they were less than completely professional and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was good and included; cereal, yogurt, bagels, bananas, apples, muffins, hard-boiled eggs, coffee, juice, and milk. There was always plenty of food as there is a dedicated staff member who cleans up and keeps things stocked. The room was clean, well-stocked, and in line with the 60's mod decor of the rest of the place. The not-so-positives: Parking - parking is something like $2 an hour with a maximum of $14 a day. There is NO PARKING around the hotel other than a few two-hour maximum meters. If you stay here and have a car, you have to do the valet thing. It's not that big of a pain but it's not exactly a huge positive. Basically you park your car in front of the hotel (for a maximum of 24 minutes) and one of the hotel staff takes the car and parks it in a garage. When you need your car you just call downstairs about 10 minutes prior to leaving and they'll have it waiting for you. They do not expect tips, although I did tip the guy who did most of the parking when we left. The first time I tried to tip he seemed like it surprised him to be given a tip, so I just didn't do it again until the last day, and only then because he had been so helpful in getting our car at weird hours and over and over again when we would come and go. The rooms - the rooms are very clean, no problems with that, and they are a little small (not as small as some of the previous reviews made it seem), but you can see some wear-and-tear on things like the comforter and headboard on the bed. It's not a big deal but we just took the comforter off of the bed since there were ample blankets and sheets underneath it, all of which were spotlessly clean. The only real complaint I'd have about the room is you can seriously hear everything in the room next to you. There were two old ladies next to our room who talked on the phone a lot and you could clearly hear their conversation. You could also hear the tv when it was on, and I don't think in either case they were being loud, the walls are just thin. It didn't bother us, but I could see how someone would be bothered if the room neighbors were a loud bunch. Location - there is a Taco Bell and Good Will across the street, a tire store next door, and a few restaurants within walking distance. The Beverly Center is within walking distance but there's not much else you would want to walk to. It's LA so you should have a car anyway, and most things were within a 10-15 minute drive. Overall, the Hotel Elan Modern is a nice place to stay with a courteous staff and clean rooms. The only things that might bug you are having to deal with the parking and the walls being pretty thin.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cWill Return to Elan!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4155750", "Content": "The Elan was a great choice for our 3rd anniversary stay of 4 nights!

Cereal, rolls, bagels, bread, yoghurt, eggs, fruit, tea coffeeand orange juice. Just fine to start the day rather than going out searching for breakfast. The wine and cheese reception was all very informal and fine to have at the end of the day on returning to the hotel. However it is from 5 to 7pm and may be a bit early for some.

However, the lobby is gorgeous and sun-filled. Despite what other reviewers have written, the front desk staff ranges from very acceptable to most excellent. Nate, in particular, was very helpful and sweet to us, even when he was not being tipped. He and other staff printed directions for us, gave advice, and catered to our every want and need and never stuck their hand out. Now, on to the room. The room was smaller than it appeared in the online photos, but, I quickly got used to that. We had a king sized bed, and, that was the most wonderful part of the experience--gorgeous, white, sparkling clean, long-staple high thread count cotton sheets, a double-sheeted down comforter, four gorgeous down pillows. Once you were in the bed, you didn't care how big the room was. The furniture and the carpeting in my room was just fine and seemed relatively new, with three deep drawers for my stuff, as well as a full sized closet with some California-Closets-type shelving, and, a small safe that you set a four digit code to get in and out of, for your laptop, camera, extra cash or whatever. I thought the bathroom was much nicer than \"some couple's first apartment\" although it was not extravagant at all. Nice and clean, nice black marble sink counter, very acceptable amenities. Wolfgang Puck coffee was available in room and also in the lobby during breakfast, which was pretty good--cereals, bulk granola, milk and juice, fruit, pastries, bagels, coffee...in the gorgeous, well lit lobby which had a funky retro feeling without anything being old or run down. There were plenty of lovely white cotton towels, and, a nice white robe for use in the room. The television was very whatever, I confess I didn't watch it--why bother? You're in California! I was in a ground floor room on the back, and, I recommend that. It was quiet and nice. The sliding glass doors opened onto....nothing, just a wall....but, it was still a nice place to get a breeze and sit Indian style with a book and soak up a little morning sun with your coffee. The carpet was clean, the room was cleaned daily and the radio left on softly to nice classical music.

The breakfast was hands down the best complimentary hotel breakfast I have ever seen - granola, wheat bread, bagels, real bakery pastries, fruit, fruit, fruit, great coffee. Bed was super-comfortable with high thread count linens. Bathroom was tiny but acceptable, bathrobes a nice touch. Common areas looked like they were either being renovated or in need of renovation but all in all, the Elan puts money into important stuff (bed, linens, funky decor, breakfast) and as for the rest, who cares if the hallway looks a little shabby. Finally, the front desk was phe-nomenal. I'm not usually a P.I.T.A. but I was without a car in LA and wanted to go to off-the-beaten-track places like Japantown and they helped me find bus routes to these random places even though they didn't know where they were - which means they took the time to research my P.I.T.A. requests - all with a smile.

Our very spacious room with king size bed and large bathroom was tastefully decorated in muted tones with fixtures and furniture of Art Deco/Moderne design. A nice touch was the availability of a local restaurant listing delineated by ethnicity, location and price, complemented by an abundance of recent periodicals reviewing current tourist attractions and museum shows, as well as additional dining and shopping possibilities. Bedroom and bathroom linens and toiletries were of the highest caliber and a DSL connection (which we did not need on this occasion) was available in the room, while internet access (which I did use) and a printer (handy for keeping directions to the Getty and other tourist attractions) were available in the lobby's business center/lounge. The hotel's clientele was quite diverse: straight couples, gay couples, business people and singles. With West Hollywood nearby the hotel was clearly gay-friendly. Valet parking was swift and efficient ($14.50 per 24 hrs.), with its own underground garage which minimized waiting time (almost none).

I appreciated the Business Center with its computer and printer that allowed me to check my office e-mail without charge and without dragging my laptop through airport security. The hotel has a nice exercise center, too. The location is close to the shopping of Beverly Center and Farmer's Market, and Museum Row, among others.

The rooms have down comforters, which would be nice on chilly nights. They're not stingy with their plush pillows, plus there are extra pillows and blankets in the wardrobe. What Orbitz didn't tell me about was the mandatory valet parking at $14.50 per day plus the obligatory tips. Add this cost to the room price when you do your comparison shopping. There is no on-street parking available in this area, and no off-street parking except the valet basement garage. The rooms were small, the window couldn't be left open due to street/airport noise, and I could distinctly hear the snoring (and conversations) of my next-door neighbor.

The hotel is pretty small, and although they\u2019ve updated the place to give it a hip vibe, it\u2019s still pretty easy to discern that the building itself is getting on in years. When we were greeted promptly at the curb by a friendly valet, however, and then by the professional front desk staff, our minds were soon put at ease. Although our deluxe king room was on the small side, it was quiet, clean, and comfortable. The somewhat overwrought d\u00e9cor of the hotel\u2019s public areas thankfully did not extend to the rooms which were still modern in design but more subdued. Even though our room was facing Beverly Boulevard, we were not kept awake by traffic noise save for an occasional siren (the hotel is a few blocks from Cedars Sinai Medical Center) which I doubt even the best soundproofing technology could have stifled. Linens were of high quality and soft; bed was firm. The closet comes with lots of shelf space which was so useful! Could hear some occasional chatter coming from an adjoining room but nothing too disrupting. Bathroom was small but adequate\u2014for some reason we seemed to have problems with water splashing up and pooling on the basin\u2019s countertop. The lobby\u2019s retro-modern design came across as a bit cold and echoey; carpeting would have helped. The floor-to-ceiling windows were compelling but offered little more than a view of the Taco Bell across the street. The continental breakfast served in the lobby was akin to what you might get at a Hampton or Best Western which, for us, was preferable to gorging on pancakes and eggs every morning anyway. Free internet access in the small business center right off the lobby was handy for checking e-mail or printing boarding passes. The elevator was slow and a little crude. Hotel\u2019s hallways were a bit dark and narrow. The location of the Elan is good. The hotel\u2019s small size makes stepping out of your room and going places a snap, unlike larger hotels which sometime require an act of Congress just to reunite you with your car again. Beverly Center shopping and restaurants are only a 2 or 3 block walk away. Several other decent restaurants were within walking distance. There is also a huge Rexall drug store a block away for all those items you forgot to bring with you on your trip. Beverly Hills, CBS studios, and all the Hollywood attractions are a 5-minute drive\u201410 minutes tops. My companion and I did manage to walk to West Hollywood from the hotel, which is quite a trek but manageable if you\u2019re up to it. (I suggest taking Beverly to Robertson rather than walking straight up La Cienega to Santa Monica Boulevard should you decide to walk it. It\u2019s a shorter and a much more pleasant stroll.)

But behind the worst-of-the-sixties architecture lies a little gem of a hotel with a level of service and the kind of personal touches usually reserved for the most expensive upscale chains. The hotel plays subtly on that sixties look throughout its very 21st century operation: the reception staff are dressed in fawn suits and crew neck sweaters; the lobby is furnished in modern retro; even the name evokes the era of Englebert Humperdinck and Frankie Vaughn. The rooms are a real pleasure. There are only about 20 of them, on two floors, and they are furnished in relaxing creams and browns. Toiletries are top quality, and are presented pocketed in folded towels. A dressing gown hangs on the bathroom door. There's a minibar and a stock of snacks, but you're unlikely to go hungry, because the Elan Modern includes a buffet breakfast in the very reasonable price: cereals, eggs, bagels, muffins and yogurt without the usual $15 added to the bill. Now to what's not perfect. The rooms are centered around a little inner courtyard, and for inexplicable reasons, they leave a bright light on in the yard all night. This means your room is never dark, and in fact, I ended up hanging a bath towel over the top of the curtains to block out the glare. The obsession with bright light extends to the fitness room which is oppressively overlit; it's also pretty basic, but there's a proper gym just along the road if you want a more extensive selection of kit. Despite the irritations this hotel is hard to beat, whether you're a tourist or business traveller. The attractions of Beverley Hills - the shops of Rodeo Drive and the bars and restaurants of Santa Monica Boulevard - are just minutes away, and it's a short drive to the Hollywood hills and the film studios which are a must see for every tourist.
