I put \"Restaurant\" in quotes because it would be offensive to all the other restaurants of the world for me to call it that. Once we were seated it to 15 minutes for the waitress to come take our drink order. I'm a very laid back guy but the place was more than half empty. Once the drinks did arrive ( Margarita for me, water for my mom) It was god awful. Tequila, Triple sec and lime juice...boom you got a Margarita, how do you mess that up?? My mom asked for lemon with her water but the lemon slices was so dry no juice would come out. The food came out surprisingly fast. The chicken taco's were not good. Are tacos supposed to be served cold?? The chicken would have been good if if wasn't bone dry. I still left a good tip for the waitress becasue the quality of food and drink isn't her fault.

I can honestly say that if it weren't for Lady Sunshine our children would have been miserable! There would have been nothing else for the kids to do at this hotel when it rains! When the sky opened up my 3 kids ages 14, 11 and 3 all ran into the \"Kid's Activities\" tent to find the most lovely and beautiful heart of a Lady called \"Lady Sunshine\". She is amazing. The face and body painting were awesome. Very professional and artistic! She kept them busy with arts&crafts and balloons. When the weather permitted they were outside making amazing bubbles! Our favorite activity was \"message in a bottle\". Lady Sunshine supplied everything they needed to fill bottles with sand, shells and a message that they cold actually mail to a Loved one! My Middle daughter mailed hers to her Gram in Florida! I can't say enough about Lady Sunshine and her program. She is definitely the reason we will return next year. As far as the hotel itself goes... it was fine. It's a beach hotel/resort. The building(s) are very old, rustic, it's not a bad thing! You just have to keep that in consideration. I felt it was clean, but showed signs of the Oceans wear and tear and unfortunately, even though our North Bay view room was newly refurbished it had a very bad wet, moldy smell when you walked in! The rugs felt a little damp, I assume this is normal for a beach resort... or someone overflowed the bathtub at some point and those carpets haven't dried out. Other than that... the room was clean. New furniture and bedding. Bathroom very tight and not so updated. Hotel was booked for Holiday weekend, therefore this was the only category avail.. Next time I will try a Ocean View with a balcony! We loved Coconuts bar and grill! Great atmosphere, live music every afternoon, great for lunch and drinks! 2 for 1 from 4-6! We loved the pool! They pool is an Olympic size pool with a spring board! Lot's of fun! and the The Lifeguards were all awesome! Especially Emily.. I found her out there early in the morning cleaning the pool. And what a wonderful job she does at keeping this huge pool clean! It was sparkling! And you can't say that for many pools in Ocean City! There is no indoor pool. There is a small room with some pinball machines downstairs (not worth visiting!) Actually, that is one area where I think they need to improve.. the Lower Level... along with the \"game room\" there is a restaurant. Went down to check it out for breakfast and it's just not appealing down there and I was a little turned off. Apparently the cleaning people have their storage room down there and they were in and out with there carts. Didn't eat down there! Prefer to eat upstairs, outside at Coconuts! We loved the beach and the beach access.. they even have waitress service at the beach! that's definitely a nice plus! Wish the Castle would consider investing in a jungle gym or pirate ship for the little ones to play on in the sand ! maybe near the volleyball court.... that would be nice... We stayed at another hotel in August and they had a pirate ship... it kept my little one busy for hours!!!! This is the only thing that he really missed and asked for! So overall I think this is a great beach resort! We will try it again next summer!

Well who the heck is going to sit in The hall to get WIFI? I also tried to get on at 4:45am. I doubt there were alot of people online at that hour. 2. The staff didn't tell us much upon registering.

I am used to having rather bare bones, but I also want the proprietors to make up for that with location and service. Sadly, we got neither. We made a reservation directly on their website, so it wasn't like it was a pricelined room where they stick you in a wherever - we paid them directly. Now, I THOUGHT I clicked on a king size bed room with a partial view. I didn't notice until too late that the confirmation said \" 2 queens, no view.\" Was that worth the $260 we paid for one night? Not so much. But, it was on me to check the reservation which I didn't until too late. We arrived 3 hours prior to check-in. We gave our name and were asked for a $10 cash key deposit (no where did the confirmation say this). But we had time to go grab cash - they called after about an hour. We went to the room - 28 in Castle South - and it was right by the stairs (noise issue) overlooking the pool (noise issue). The room had an ancient feel to it - so while it was relatively clean, it was far from new and smelled like stale smoke or pee or mildew. While we changed, we were greeted by housekeeping not knocking but just coming in. Honest mistake but she should have knocked (all the housekeeping staff were pretty nice). We tried twice to log into the \"free wireless\". The first time I went down, the young woman at the front desk said I should reboot (we couldn't access it via our cell phones too) because that building \"had the best reception because the front desk was right in it\". We decided to go out for a bit and come back. We did, in time for happy hour and got our 2 for 1 drinks (the only good thing aside from location) and hit the beach between raindrops. We were impressed with the grounds but just not the rooms. While the kitchenette was nice, all the utensils and such had to be washed before we ate from them. And that stale smoke smell just was hard for us. The beds were very worn and uncomfortable (there was a valley on each side of each bed) - the pillows were very soft, almost non existent. I went down later after dinner because I still had no internet (first, it was raining, nay pouring. So we had time to kill. Second, I had to hand in something due that evening). I was told first that I wasn't doing it right, despite showing them a picture on my phone of available networks and Castle in the Sand not being one of them. I brought my computer down and after 3 people trying, there was service outside in the rain by the patio (apparently the server is in the building with the restaurant/ice cream parlor). I was instructed to go down there if I needed internet. This was not really ok - but I stood on a garbage can under an awning to shield me from the rain to hand in what was due - then ran back to the room. I was awake until 2a with what only sounded like moving furniture (??) and then stomping (up the outside stairwell by our door I presume). We wanted to love this place. We really did. We love charm and loved the idea. But for $260? This was not worth it. Maybe if we had an ocean view room, or were away from the stairwell. But every room should be as good as your worst, IMHO. Not as bad as it. If we were staying longer than a night, we would have switched rooms after that really bad night of sleep (5 hours?).

The rooms are old (cinder block walls) but for a beach hotel fine. Great views from higher floors. The room attendant we had was wonderful. The front desk folks, on the other hand, were some of the coldest, least helpful people we've experienced. We made reservations six months ahead to make sure we could have three rooms together--two facing the water, one across the hall facing the bay. We did the reservation in Jnanuary for that reason. And, we called the night before to reassure that the rooms would be together. When we checked in, no such luck. We were on the same floor but the third room (bay-side) was far down the hall. When we complained at the front desk, the first fellow (who must have been in law school at some point) said that all the hotel promised was across the hall. Well, across the hall to us meant across the hall, not down the hall and across. The manager on duty said there was nothing he could do. When we explained we had made reservations to make sure we got the rooms we wanted, all he could offer was, oddly enough, to make reservations for next year--not what we wanted at that point. On check-out, the clerk on duty was equally cold. For instance, we had a 93 year old woman with us who had a difficult time getting across the street. Parking next to the building we were in is sparse. So we wanted to check out, drive the car up to the building, get the elderly woman from the room, and then bring the key down. Not possible she said. Can't check out without her getting the key. And, at that point, she snidely also said that we were also 45 minutes late in checking out (1145AM)--never could figure out why except she wanted to make some point. So, our 93 year old grandmother slowly did the walk. In my experience most hotels try to make the hello and goodbye positive experiences. Our stay this year at this hotel was the opposite. Oh, by the way, the bed that comes with the couch was incredibly old and lumpy. We got it replaced after the first night.

There are lawn chairs that you can sit on out in front of your room and there are some palm trees for shade if you want. My parents stayed on the third floor of the North Suite but they said the heat from the air conditioner blowing on their balcony made it too hot to sit out on theirs. Their was hot air coming out on our balcony too but at least we were able to sit out away from it being on the first floor. The room was clean and the cleaning crew was friendly. I also liked that we had a roll out couch along with our two queen size beds so that my 9 year old could have a bed to himself. There was a band that would play during the day at their bar and grill but we were always at the beach during that time. On Saturday night they had a nice raggae band playing while we ate dinner. For the price of the room per night I personally would check into some other hotels to see if I could find something a little cheaper. They do have condo rooms behind the main hotel that are not ocean front that are cheaper and might be worth a try. The only reason we booked at this resort was because my sister got married on the beach and my whole family was staying at this resort. I am not into the bar seen and that seemed to be some of the focus at this resort. I was happy to know that I could still be away from the action with my two kids with us though.

I was growing anxious after reading the many mixed reviews ranging from mold jumping into bed with you at night to rooms that were clean, but cost an arm and a leg. After reading conflicting reviews of various hotels for a few hours, I wasn't sure this overnight stay was worth the stress it was causing. Thankfully, this overnight stay in the Waverly Castle (5th floor, ocean facing), was nothing short of wonderful. Check-in was a breeze, our room was neat and clean, and the amenities were plentiful for what we needed (soap, shampoo, fridge, microwave, drying rack). This unit also had a little kitchenette that was a pleasant surprise. A hearty thank you to all the TripAdvisor reviewers who helped me choose this location (and who inspired my first-ever review). We did learn that there are three buildings that are part of this complex. All three are wonderfully near the beach (a short walk through the sand dunes), but they also have different proximity to other amenities. One is near the pool, another near the restaurant and bar, Coconuts, and the third a little more away from the aforementioned (Waverly Castle). As two adults who were enjoying a last-minute romantic getaway, our building was perfect (away from kids at the pool and guests enjoying food and drink at Coconuts). The view was amazing, the staff was exceptional with check-in / check-out and general help (they turned us onto the Beach Bus to get to the boardwalk [$1/way per person]), and the room was not only \"not scary,\" but very clean and allowed us to relax and enjoy our mini-vacation. The short of the long: we wanted a basic hotel that was clean, close to the beach, and would not require us to give up a life or limb. Castle in the Sand (Waverly Castle specifically) met our needs and allowed us to enjoy our getaway.

Let me also say that I have stayed at Castle In The Sand a few times and have always been happy there. I will start with the good! We arrived on Thursday morning around 11 knowing that check in wasn't until 3:00. I asked if we could check in early and although our room wasn't ready, the man at the desk said they would call my cell when the room WAS ready and that we were free to get our parking pass and use the pool, bar, changing room, etc. He must have called for immediate maid service as our room was ready in less than 30 minutes which made us very happy! I like to stay in the Waverly building as it is all oceanfront and that is a priority for me. This building I feel is the best as it has all private balconies, nice elevators, and big efficiencies! The cottages do NOT have any type of oceanview at all as they are set along the perimeter of the parking lot so if you are looking for the beachy, ocean feeling you do not want to stay in one of those. The main building is next to the bar and restaurant and the bedrooms are in the back so you have windows on the pool side not facing the ocean. This building does NOT have elevators so keep this in mind when it comes to carrying luggage, children, beach rolling carriers, etc. Also, if you are not a fan of noise, the bar, Coconuts can get pretty loud. The other building does have oceanfront rooms, but no balconies. Coconuts is a big attraction here because they have a \"speed\" Happy Hour which runs from 5:00-6:00 and serves buy 1 get one free drinks! It is a good time but it DOES get busy as it attracts people from other hotels as well as the locals so I would suggest getting a seat at the bar before 5. I always have fun at this bar but since it does get busy sometimes you find yourself fighting for service and people pushing to get in front of you in line. We got a table at the outside restaurant one of the nights we were there and sat at the table for over 30 minutes and a waitress never came to wait on us so I wouldn't suggest trying to eat during that hour. The waitresses were all running around like crazy so it wasn't a lazy issue, it was just a very CROWDED issue. Now for our problem...the cleaning service!!! The first full day we were there we hadn't yet unpacked and had our valuables scattered everywhere (we were too excited to run to the beach to take the time to unpack properly..and there are no safes in the rooms) We chose to NOT have the room cleaned since we hadn't really dirtied anything yet and did not have the room in cleaning condition with our stuff everywhere. So we put the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on the door and went to the beach. When we got back to the room the sign was on the other side of the door and the room had been cleaned! My boyfriend saw the person responsible for cleaning our room out in the hall and confronted him as to why he entered and cleaned the room when we specifically put the sign on the door that we didn't want that done. The reason given was that the manager of the hotel TOLD him to enter the rooms regardless of the sign as many people put it there by accident. We were told that he entered the room because he had knocked and we didn't answer the door.Ummm...come on people, we all know guests have different reasons for putting that sign on the door and that he shouldn't have even KNOCKED let alone keyed into the room! He then told us that we would have to let him know in the morning a \"yes\" or \"no\" regarding getting our room cleaned so we asked WHY we had to personally TELL him as that is the point of the \"Maid Service Please\" vs \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. He said \"no\" as the manager says he has to key in regardless of the sign. Well...we weren't understanding this so we went to talk to the front desk where we were told that this was not true and that they would talk to him. Well...from then on we never had a clean room! We would put the \"Maid Service Please\" sign on the door and would get our bed made (sheets not changed) and new towels...nothing else. The bathroom was not cleaned once, the floors were not cleaned, and not even the countertops wiped down! A contact solution bottle bounced out of our garbage can on day 2 and as a \"test\" I left it there. By day 6 it was still there along with the sand and everyday \"grime\" in the shower, sinks, toilet, floors, etc. I know that hotels try to conserve water and I don't know how often they are supposed to change the sheets but I have NEVER EVER been in a hotel that didn't clean the bathrooms and wipe down counters. We had to eventually ask the cleaning service man to change our sheets because they were sandy and looking a bit rough. Everyone knows what rooms can get like on a beach trip...even for the cleanest of people! I did hear a number of people complaining about the location of the bathrooms for the beach and bar as you literally have to walk through the inside restaurant and wear shoes and a shirt to use them. We were even approached for just glancing at the breakfast buffet before going to the beach in the AM because my boyfriend didn't have a shirt on. We didn't see the sign about the shirt when walking in so we immediately explained that we just wanted to look to see what was on it, not sit down and eat. It only took 2 seconds before another staff member said \"PLEASE\" so they are very strict about that. Be prepared to re-dress if you need to use the restaurant while on the beach. We didn't find this to be an issue as we just used our own room. So you have to walk a little bit..who cares? All in all I really like this hotel. It is not super fancy but it's in a great location with bar and food service on the beach along with reasonable prices, and great ocean views!

We are all in our 20's. It was a great hotel for us. We stayed on a second floor suite in Castle North. The room was a large open rectangular space that had two double beds, a full kitchen and a living room area with a couch, two lounge chairs and a flat screen. I'd guess in total it was about 500 square feet. It also had a nice balcony facing the ocean. The room was in good condition, clean and free of pests. My only criticism of the hotel is the condensate line on the A/C unit directly above us must have been broken because condensation dripped on our balcony throughout the trip, not really that big of a deal to us. The hotel has a great bar called Coconuts. The bar is outside and was busy all day. There is live music most of the day as well. From 5pm-6pm the happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks and the bar was packed during this time every day. It was mostly young people, 20's and 30's. If you buy a drink at the bar you are allowed to bring it on the beach. The wait staff will also bring you drinks on the beach. We are cheap, so we took our own beer in thermoses, but it was a nice service nonetheless. The hotel also has a large swimming pool and a nice diving board.

We always try to reserve the apartment -like suites since we normally have 3 to 4 people with us. If you want an ocean view, ask for a 2nd or 3rd floor room. The 1st floor suites open to a patio behind the dunes with no beach view, the 2nd floor has a view of the top of the dunes and beach, but the 3rd floor is the best view! And if you happen to be placed in a 1st floor suite, try asking the office to move you to an available room higher up, they are always happy to help. They also have efficiency suites available that sleep the same number of people in one room with a small kitchenette that we have stayed in. Yes, the hotel is older, but last year all of the mattresses were replaced and this year the pots, pans and cooking utensils were all replaced with brand new items. Our experience with the maids, servers and office workers has always been wonderful. Yes, some of the staff don't speak or understand English well...they're mainly from Eastern European countries but have always been very nice to us. One reviewer mentioned that there were no lifeguards on the beach....the lifeguards come out at 10:00 am and leave at around 5:00 or 6:00 pm everyday. I'm not sure just where that reviewer was, but we stayed here during the same time period and set up just behind the lifeguard stand because we had children with us and that stand was ALWAYS manned. And we enjoy renting the umbrellas on the beach because that's less stuff for us to drag out every morning. We love the Castle because it's very family friendly and convenient for us. The hotel shows a family oriented movie on the outside of the building every Tuesday night and even though our kids are a little too old for the theme of the move, we still enjoy sitting under the stars and watching the film.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reisterstown, MD", "Title": "\u201cEverything You Need Is Here -\u201d", "Author": "EllenTBO", "ReviewID": "UR116481417", "Content": "I've been staying at the Castle for years, and I still enjoy my time at the Castle.

They must be purchased at Coconuts which is a bit silly in my opinion. Their hotel restaurant located downstairs (Coconuts) plays live music which is great. The hotel also has a nice, large pool outside. The hotel is also right next to the bus stop if anyone wants to go to the store or a night out at Secrets. It really only takes about 10 minutes to bus to Secrets.. the bus ride can actually be fun. However, if you are looking to stay walking distance to Secrets you may not want to come here?

It looks like a lot of customer through the key away as a sort of expressing their anger when checking out. 8- The bathroom is very tight and the toilet is the type for kids, and not adults. 9- The blinds are very old and hardly blocking the light, so expect to wake up so early. 10- The hotel will charge your credit card a portion upon booking, and will deduct the whole amount upon arrival, no refunds will be for early departure, as guests will always complain and try to cancel their reservations. 11- The wireless internet is terrible, hardly working and when working, it is very slow. Never to mention , every time we get up and down the elevator, the plumber will always be there, with his rubber plunge dripping water on the floor. By the way, this hotel doesn't have any public restrooms. If by chance you need to use a restroom while on the beach , you need to go to your room??????

On top of that, i had forgot a treasured object that belonged to my son, and went back multiple times to retrieve it to no avail. It wasnt until we were on the road for a 3rd time that i called back and made them look in the trash. Whala! Come to find that the houseman had thrown it in the trash!!

True, this place had a moderate price. But what is gotten for that moderate price is a sub-par stay. Staying here for even one night was a very bad experience.

It's clean and the staff is VERY nice, friendly and helpful. The room is a bit outdated but if you don't care about that, then there's absolutely nothing to worry about. The only \"negative\" I would say (and mind you, its not really a negative) but I feel like I should mention it, are the \"oceanfront\" rooms at Castle South (which is the main building-where the office is). Technically, the rooms ARE oceanfront because they DO face the ocean but realistically if I am booking an oceanfront room, I would not stay in this building. The building has 3 floors (we stayed on the 2nd floor) and the balconies that are advertised as \"oceanfront\" are DIRECTLY in front of the outdoor restaurant Coconuts and the \"hang out\" area which has beach chairs and a beach volleyball court. Now this is nice..you can sit on the balcony, listen to the music below (on the weekends live music) and watch all the action but you can barely see the ocean. You see a little bit of the ocean in the distance and what you see are the sand dunes. So I just need to mention this because if I had known that the \"oceanfront\" rooms are really in front of the restaurant/music/hangout area, I would have booked a room in another building. And just to repeat, this is not a deciding factor in terms of choosing this hotel.

The water was so close that we could go out at any time for a quick dip in the ocean and then come back to our room and get changed for the night-life (plenty within walking distance) - We also had the breakfast and dinner buffets so I have to admit we didn't leave the hotel building at all one day (which was perfect for the wedding couple we met there ; ) There is also the Coconuts Bar and beach volleyball and a big pool on the ground floor for even more things to do.

Not the year before, nor ever. She went on to tell us that we gave her \u201ca bad vibe.\u201d Taken aback and sensing hostility, I made sure to note that a window and screen were already broken and that I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t charged for it. We went on to request an iron (the one in the room was broken) and a hair dryer (there was none even though there was supposed to be) and thankfully they all arrived promptly. The broken window, however, was not fixed until four days and equally as many calls to the front desk later. Later in the week, the same housekeeper returned to \u201ccheck in\u201d and to take two of our six dining room chairs to \u201creupholster.\u201d The icing on the cake came on the final afternoon of our trip when the hotel manager arrived to \u201clay down some ground rules.\u201d We were informed that the Castle in the Sand \u201cdoes not do parties\u201d and that the housekeeper informed the manager that she feared we were planning a party for the final night of the trip. It was also at this time when the manager opted to let me know that he would be charging us $120 extra for having too many people staying in the room. I went on to explain that I was never asked for the total number of guests in the room when I made the reservation and assumed that since the hotel website and brochure note that our room fits six that having six people in it would not be a problem. Evidently I was mistaken and would be charged for the additional guests. After he left the same housekeeper returned to \u201cremind us\u201d that she didn\u2019t have time to clean up after us. I told her that there was no mess that would take extra time to clean. I only noted that we ate a lot of junk food and spent a lot of time at the beach so, as a result, there were crumbs and sand that would require vacuuming. She responded by returning an hour later WITH A VACUUM and suggested that I run it through the house. Our group was comprised of mid-twenties professionals not \u201cSenior Week\u201d-ers. We do not complain about less than stellar accommodations, often accepting a few problems (like a broken screen door) in the name of saving money. This is why we opted not to complain about the many problems we encountered with the property including the broken screens, missing window, bugs, dirty lamp shade, broken stove, broken iron, missing hair dryer, dingy carpeting, cable static, or the upstairs toilet that broke near the end of our stay (and we opted to fix ourselves, rather than wait four days to use the bathroom.) Also, admittedly, we spent a lot of time outside during the day and often arrived home after midnight. However, we have visited Ocean City each of the last three years together and never once had a complaint from any other property, let alone been visited multiple times by management or housekeeping because of a \u201cbad vibe.\u201d I should note that there were some bright spots. The \u201cCoconuts\u201d outdoor bar was excellent and the guy who they sent to fix the broken window was extremely helpful (granted he didn\u2019t come until four days after we called, but I pin that on the front desk, not him.) However, this does not make up for the treatment we received from the aforementioned members of the staff. We loved Ocean City and will return next summer, just never again to the Castle in the Sand. Others here seem to have enjoyed their stays. Good for them. We\u2019ll opt to stay somewhere else in Ocean City\u2026perhaps a property that doesn\u2019t \u201cgive us a bad vibe.\u201d", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe", "Title": "\u201cGlad we came back!\u201d", "Author": "donnasuerote", "ReviewID": "UR34739434", "Content": "I love several things about the Castle in the Sand Hotel.

I cannot say that the front desk did not treat us well. Our room was not ready and they called me on my cell phone when it was. We had a suite on the first floor between the pool and the restaurant. Things got off to a very bad start the first evening when we found that the sheets left for the pull-out and the ones on our bed were visibly dirty/stained. While we did have two rooms and a kitchenette, it seemed like there was very little space to stretch out. Basically, there was room to walk around the bed and the open pull-out took up all of the living room space. The drying rack supplied for wet clothes took up the kitchen space. I should mention that the desk was more than eager to replace the dirty sheets but then we realized that the LOUD music from the bar blared right into the room our children slept in...through the bathroom and into our room which was already bombarded with noise through the VERY thin Florida windows (slats open and close) coming from the pool. You can pretty much count on music of one sort or another permeating your room from noon-10pm. We returned to our room daily to find that it had been vacuumed and cleaned but don't expect your mother's \"clean\". There was a lot of smoking in all public areas which proved bothersome. Maryland doesn't have the same \"no-smoking\" legislation that many states do. The restaurant had a very popular 2-for-1 Happy Hour but beware that ordering one drink means they will bring you two. On some positive notes however, the two ladies who run the children's program in the afternoons were fabulous. Clearly, they themselves, keep many families returning to this hotel.

The place is not a four star resort (not that I saw one during my entire stay) and looks from the outside a little outdated but the inside is totally different. It looks as if was somewhat recently redone and I cannot stress the cleanliness. The office staff was helpful and pleasant. It is a ten minute walk to the boardwalk where all the attractions are but the bus is two bucks a day for unlimited rides and runs all night so that was really not an issue. I can imagine a hotel on the boardwalk would be a bit noisy at night so we liked not being on there and having some seclusion. The website for the hotel does not do it justice. The view was worth the price which was cheap compared to everything else especially those right on the boardwalk. The wait staff at Coconuts (the local eatery on the premises) was some of the nicest people we have had wait on us and was as good as the several cruises we have been on and how can you complain at all you can eat crab legs for two people for fifty bucks? You can't. Overall if your looking for a nice clean place for a laid back vacation RIGHT ON the beach this should be one of your picks.

There was plenty of parking, which they gave you a gate pass to get into the lot so they did not have other people not staying there filling up all the spots. The beach was pretty and there was limited beach partying going on at night. The pool was nice too, and my kids enjoyed it. The only thing I wish was different was the size of the refrigerator, I would have prefered a full size one instead of the \"under the counter\" one, because it was impossible to keep icecream cold. I like to cook to help save money, and it was hard with such a small fridge. (But this stated when I reserved the room, so it was not a fault of the hotel.). We enjoyed our stay and the kids were sad that we had to come back home!", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culpeper, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay at Castle in the Sand!\u201d", "Author": "norm911", "ReviewID": "UR5429549", "Content": "My family and I just got back from our 4th annual 4th of July trip to Ocean City, and as always we stayed at Castle in the Sand.

There was some good some bad. First the bad the outdoor pool is NOT heated. It was to cold for my kids to get in. Also there were a large number of young people not controlled. The management said they had talked with them making noise at night but they wouldn't listen. I did not get much sleep. Between the noise, door slamming, loud talking, and them waking my children, it was not a fun night. Maybe it was the time of year but I've stayed in OC before at this time and didn't have as much of a problem. Now for the good. The check in is awesome. The people are nice, fast, and even let us know when the room was ready early. They told us to use the hotel amenities until the room was ready. The beach is only a few steps away with easy access. If you need anything towels, etc. they get it right away. When I did complain about the noise the person listened said they would talk to the teenagers again and would try to fix the problem.

I did not know what to expect as we have always rented a house in Bethany in the summer and this was our first time booking a hotel in Ocean City. I discovered an internet deal for the Memorial Day Weekend that seemed too good to be true...3 days/2 nights for $260 in a 1 bedroom cottage/apartment. I can safely say that our experience at the Castle exceeded my expectations. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly and knowledgable front desk person who had us registered and ready to go to our apartment in under 3 minutes. There was plenty of parking in front and behind the cottage. The place was very clean and homey, and we had a very nice kitchen complete with large refrigerator, coffee maker, dishes, and silverware. We saved money by being able to prepare some meals in our kitchen. The kids were very happy to have a full selection of cable TV offerings and a VCR. The shower was always hot and stayed hot. I appreciated how fast we were provided with additional towels and blankets once we called the front desk. The staff really emphasized customer satisfaction. The hotel offered a very delicious breakfast buffet that was very reasonably priced...2 of our kids ate free. The hotel sits directly on the beach and there is always activity there including volleyball and socializing with direct access to the beach. The pool area was very neat and clean and our children made fast friends with some other children staying there. The hotel is located just 10 blocks from the end of the boardwalk and a few blocks from a great putt putt golf center. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great value and very good hospitality.

Castle North suite 1st floor, although our view was obstructed by the dune, we had been warned of that at the time of the reservation, so no big deal. Easy beach access, all the basic amenitites and above all surprisingly clean. I was so afraid that we'd arrive and it would look like spring break-ers had been there before, but it didn't.
