{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great stay Stayed for three nights. Everything from check in to check out was of a high standard. The building is beautiful architecturally as it was formerly the headquarters of Pearl Assurance and original features are kept. the lobby area is very impressive. Concierge on arrival very efficient and helpful, check in was efficient. We had two rooms one king executive which was of an adequate size, no view, shower over bath but still very powerful. The children had been assigned a fabulous room (326) which had two double beds a seating area and bathroom with separate shower and bath. The rooms were on the lounge floor so we had access until 12 midnight for coffee, tea, honour bar later in the evening, cookies and lovely canapes from 5.30 in the evening. No children under 16 though meant that we could not enjoy as a family. The hotel is in a great location, 10 minutes to covent garden, 20 to oxford circus. We also went to see Oliver at the royal theatre in Drury Lane which was a 10 minute walk away and well worth seeing. We ate on the second evening at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster which was fabulous though a bit heavy on the pocket. Beautiful Indian food in stylish surroundings. London was bursting at the seams and we left on new years evening to return home.

As you walk towards it, its magnificence dominates the landscape. To add to the sense of mystique, you have to negotiate both an archway and an alleyway before you reach the haven of the entrance to the hotel. The courtyard is punctuated by a large Christmas tree and the hotel had a tellingly seasonal look to it.The rooms are very large by London standards. The front-desk staff tried to get me to upgrade to an Executive room. But I'm glad that I stuck with my Deluxe room (which had large windows overlooking Lincoln's Inn Fields and afforded me a sweeping panorama of London). It was also very good value, at Euro 195 a night, all in (but exclusive of breakfast). And the bed was so comfortable it almost called out to you to sleep in it. And I must admit that I stole a couple of relaxing afternoon naps there after frenetic mornings racing around a festive London. The bathroom is also capacious, with room to shower and shave in both space and comfort.One word of advice. If you want peace, make sure to place the 'do not disturb' sign on the outside of your door. The lever on the door which says For privacy, please turn seems unworkable. Either that or it is honoured in the breach instead of in the observance.I tried the Pearl Restaurant for breakfast. You can get a cooked English breakfast there for \u62e225. Nothing exceptional. But it hits the spot if you are set on roaming around London for several hours (as I did most days). When in London, I went to see Twelfth Night with Derek Jacobi and a gifted cast of actors. If you want your spirits raised at Christmas (or in January/February 2009), this show is a must see. Also went to see the Andre Previn/Anna Sophie Mutter concert at the Barbican. Previn is beginning to wane somewhat as he nears his eigthtieth birthday. But Mutter is as magical as she always been on her lilting violin.There's always something beguiling about London during the days just before Christmas (encompassing the 18th to 23rd of December).", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR793261424", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Insightful"}, {"Content": "Great Location Nice property \u9225?great location. Fantastic looking lobby and marble staircase. Good sized rooms (for a London hotel). Comfortable beds. Housekeeping was a bit disappointing as we checked into the room just before 3:00 pm, but they had only left one towel, no slippers, and only a few toiletry items. We managed to locate a housekeeper, who gave us the missing items. In addition, there was a large dent/scrap on the outside of our wardrobe and there was some wear  tear on the bathroom door. Our 6th floor room was also incredibly hot, and while we tried to adjust the temperature, it always felt like a steam-bath.I would have been very disappointed if I had paid for the breakfast at this hotel. They would have charged us 49 pounds for two people. It was a very average buffet \u9225?some nice items, but all of them stone-cold.

The hotel is very close to Hoburn Tube which is fantastic because it is an interchange for the picadilly and central lines so you have direct access to most of London's sights.The hotel itself is very impressive and is a beautifully restored building which I find is far more interesting than new hotels. The check in was efficient and we had our room requests as per booking. The room was quite large for London standards and the beds and pillows are very comfortable, a turn down service is also provided.We tried the champagne afternoon tea which was very good and we also had a meal at Pearl which is a restaurant at the hotel and the food was first class, Pearl is connectly allegedly to Marco Pierre White and the food is definately to those standards at the Criterion if not better.Breakfast is served in a strange location which is similar to a lounge/foyer/sitting area. There was adequate choice of breakfast items but it was a little cold the first morning, on the whole breakfast was quite good and the service was good but the food was nothing special.The staff in the bar were very attentive and there is an offer that if you buy drinks in the bar you get 20% off you meals in the evening at the hotel restaurant if you show your receipt (dont think this includes pearl)The doormen were excellent and always were very welcoming and efficient, and on the whole I would recommend this hotel because it is convienient and a very good option by London standards.

The booking went very smoothly. We were particularly desirous of a hotel with very comfortable beds and great showers, as some of our group was coming from a year+ in a less-than-luxurious (an understatement!) location/living arrangement and were looking forward to some Western amenities as they put it before returning home. The hotel completely met our expectations. By way of background, we are Marriott people. In NY, for example, we have stayed at the Renaissance, Marquis, Courtyard Midtown East and Residence Inn. We've previously stayed at the Marriott Grosvenor Square in London. We also like Westins. We don't need the Four Seasons, but prefer not Motel 6 either. Nicely appointed, in good condition, pleasant and halepful staff, comfortable beds, great showers, that's what we look for. The hotel is in a great location. We took the tube to and from the airport (and everywhere else we wanted to go, if not walking). The Holborn tube station is a 2-minute walk.Two of us arrived first. Our 2-bed room was not ready. I don't know what would have happened, since the 1-bed room was ready, so we just put our bags in there and went out to lunch. Upon return, our room was ready. By way of comparison, both rooms were nice size and nicely appointed, but the 2-bed room was quite a bit larger than the 1-bed room. The neighborhood is business-oriented. There are lots of restaurants, coffee spots (I think I counted 7 or 8 coffee spots within 2 blocks -- Costa, Starbucks, etc.), Sainsbury, Books Etc., Pizza Express (surprisingly good), Cafe Pasta (ditto). Walking distance to the Aldwych Theatre (we had tickets for 2 of us to Dirty Dancing the night we arrived). Near the British Museum. Walking distance to Russell Square (we had a particular reason for visiting, and always like to see new neighborhoods. We ate at a very good, but pretty pricey, Indian restaurant on Southhampton Row between Holborn and Russell Sq.)My only complaints: 1) the towels are way too small and they didn't always leave enough towels even though I asked for extras; 2) the hotel is built around a courtyard, and the signage once you get off the elevators is not good. For 4 days, I never knew which way to turn to get to our room most expeditiously!; and 3) some (very little) of the woodwork in the elevators could stand to be refinished as could the painted ceiling in bathroom (cracked from moisture). These are small complaints but for me to give it top stars, those things would need to be fixed.FWIW, they put down those dirty-shoe towels by the bedside only 1 of the 4 nights we were there. Obviously, inconsistent! (not that I cared - I wasn't even sure what they were for until I read another review here).Special kudos for: 1) having umbrellas for borrowing (even though we learned that too late to do us any good; 2) when I asked one of the doormen where there was a trash can, he took my trash from me and said I'll take that.
