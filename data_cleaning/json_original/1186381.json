Expected much the same, but was very surprised. I was only staying for a 23 hour layover before returning to Australia and didn't want to hang at the budget terminal that long, so came into Regin Hotel. The taxi driver found it a bit hard to find - his GPS took us to 250 Sims Avenue instead of 56. Maybe if you tell the driver it is near the corner of Sims Way and Sims Avenue you might get here quicker. Once inside I was warmly welcome by a very friendly elderly Chinese gentleman, whose name escapes me. Very obliging. The only shock was when he asked for a $S50 deposit in cash, as I had not been aware of this. I looked in my wallet but after the taxi fare had only around $40 so he said $20 was fine, and this was returned to me in the morning immediately upon checkout, where once again I was greeted by the reception staff in a warm and friendly manner. The room itself was small and it is an older style hotel, but there was no bad smells in the room, and there was no mould in the bathroom. Shower didn't get really hot, but was passable. Like many Singapore rooms there is no curtain in the shower, so the whole bathroom gets wet - toilet, sink, bathroom floor etc, but not really a drama. Bed was very comfortable. Got two free small bottles of water on arrival and 2 small toothbrush and paste sets. Aircon worked very well. Tv has a wide variety of channels, even if few in English. Small mini fridge in wardrobe to keep the water cold.

I got informed that you could smoke in all the rooms. As a non-smoker I found the smell too much. So I asked if they could do anything about the smell. The lady behind the desk said she would send the cleaner with some airfreshner. I then went back to my room were my husband was waiting. He had then established by this point that the windows would not open, the air con was broken and made an irritating noise and the tv had no channels that worked. There was also lots of different splash marks across the Walls, I'm just glad I don't know what they where! When the cleaner arrived she only had a bottle of some sort of cleaner. She proceeded to spray behind the wardrobe, desk and curtains. It turn out that she was spraying bleach everywhere! So then we were then left with the strong smell of bleach and cigarette smoke. It was horrible, so much it made me fell sick! This was the last straw for me and I sat on the bed and cried! My husband then decided that he was not happy seeing me like this and said we were leaving regardless if wether or not we could not get our money back. The management kindly gave us a full refund and we left to go and stay somewhere else. We ended up at the novotel Clarke quay, which I can highly recommend - it's worth the extra dollars!

The Kalang MRT stop is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel, will take you anywhere you want to go, and fast. The staff at this place is hit-or-miss: Sonny (\"look at the Sun, and remember my name is Sonny\") is a gas and helps with anything you might need, another guy (didn't get his name) who was working the desk when I checked out, wouldn't even call me a taxi-he just told me to go stand on the curb with my bags during peak morning rush hour and stick my hand out, and hopefully someone would stop. Thanks much for that.... I am a single guy and walked the area at night, I wasn't harrased by anyone, and never felt in danger in the least - it's far enough away from the red-light district where it doesn't feel seedy at all, although there were plenty of Singaporean men coming in and out for most of the day and night paying the \"in-transit\" fee with their \"companions\". The room itself, while a shoebox, did the job fine - it has a little fridge, small LCD TV on the wall, and AC, but it looked as though someone took a golf club to the AC controls (see pic), so the temp couldn't be adjusted. Wifi, in room, worked well. While I didn't hear any shenanigans going on by the temporary guests, it was annoying to have about a dozen chinese tourists check in at about midnight, and begin screaming to each other from the various floors they were assigned to. This went on for about an hour before I told them all to shut the hell up (I doubt they understood me, but they could tell I didn't appreciate their form of communication).
