This hotel is perfectly fine for the price - the rooms are comfortable and very clean, with a fridge and microwave. The front desk staff are very nice and helpful. The breakfast is adequate, nothing to write home about but better than some I've seen - fruit, bread, bagels, waffels, etc as well as juice and coffee. The airport shuttle is very good, we actually used it multiple times as our conference was near the airport, and this was much appreciated. The area isn't the best, but really nothing wrong with it, perfectly safe walking around etc but you are on a fairly large boulevard so be careful of traffic when crossing. It's an easy 15-20min walk to Old Town, which was great. Other than that, not close to the action downtown, but if you're in San Diego for some other reason then that's fine. There are several restaurants nearby - the mexican restaurant attached to the hotel is decent, with really delicious strawberry margaritas, get a coupon for a free nacho appetizer from the hotel front desk. Across the street there is a wings place, a fast-food mexican, a Chinese/Asian place (Pick-up-Stix), and a Carl Jrs (burger joint), as well as Starbucks and Jamba Juice. A few more places around within walking distance. I'd stay again depending on reason for being in San Diego.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Haven thankyou Dave\u201d", "Author": "Sd500", "ReviewID": "UR127440259", "Content": "Booked in late at night, greeted by \"Dave\".

However, when I walked into the lobby I noticed it was very clean and the front desk person was extremely friendly and helpful! He asked us where we were planning on eating and we told him we were meeting family at Cafe Coyote. He ended up giving us a coupon for a free appetizer to the restaurant! We received a room with a single queen-sized bed. The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. It had 2 seating areas, an area for clothing, a refrigerator, and a good sized TV. Once we were settled in, the front desk called to welcome us again and to make sure we were pleased with the room.

When we returned from a day of touristing, the carpet was steam cleaned, good as new. \u2022 Front desk staff were all attentive and friendly and knowledgeable about where to go do tourist stuff. \u2022 Location provides easy access to any and all beautiful places a tourist would want to go to. \u2022 We attempted the courtesy breakfast on the first day, but it was uninspiring, and once and an item is finished, they don't replenish it, even if there are still a couple of hours left for the free breakfast. And, way too many people were vying for the food. It would have been easier to use if they placed all of the plates, cups and utensils in a central area, rather than have them all spread around the room\u2026the cereal bowls here and the spoons way over there on the other counter, etc. \u2022 But\u2026there is a great IHOP walking distance away, and an even better Du-Pars a short drive up Sports Arena Boulevard - a really good Mexican restaurant upstairs in the hotel \u2013 their seafood is the freshest! Handcrafted Margaritas!! \u2022 Lots of other good affordable restaurants within walking distance\u2026like a Starbucks, Einstein\u2019s and Jamba Juice, all in a row, just across the street. \u2022 Excellent computer is available to use to clean-out your junk email and to print out your boarding pass before you fly home. \u2022 The free airport shuttle was great and the driver was awesome! \u2022 I think I could live in this place if it was that kind of motel\u2026but it\u2019s not.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake CIty", "Title": "\u201cWalls thin, too many homeless in neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "srmurrayut", "ReviewID": "UR29022173", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here from 5/26-29 2009.

Got the room for $40, plus tax. I arrived at about 2 am, and asked at check-in for two beds. The guy said OK and gave me the keys to room 244. I was exhausted, so I didn't go back to argue when I walked into a room with only one king size bed. At 7:30 or 8 am or whenever it was, though, I woke up suddenly to someone entering my room. Luckily, I had secured the top latch, but it turns out the lock didn't work at all. The automatic electronic lock was completely out of order -- just turn the knob and you're inside! I went to the front office to complain, and was told that the \"manager on duty (Jessica)\" wasn't there yet. (So how was she \"on duty,\" I wondered to myself.) She did call me back at around 10 am, and I explained the situation. Regarding the one bed for me & my friend, she said that Priceline automatically books you into the cheapest room. OK, fine, but couldn't the guy at the check-in counter have told me that? Secondly, she apologized for the inconvenience about the lock. I guess I didn't expect anything, like an offer for a free night in the future or anything like that, but \"I apologize for the inconvenience\" seemed a little weak to me. The other comments about the walls being thin are true, too. I head a baby crying many times throughout the night in the room next to ours. I guess if I stayed there again -- and the room was nice, to be honest -- I would really, really check to make sure the room was safe.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cVery Impressed with the HoJo SeaWorld\u201d", "Author": "moni0121", "ReviewID": "UR21751615", "Content": "A couple of family members and I were in town for my brother's graduation from MCRD San Diego, and stayed a few days after to take in some sights, etc. This was quite possibly the nicest chain-type hotel that I've stayed in before.

It is close to all the major attractions ( e.g. Sea World, Zoo, Legoland etc) and is perfectly located across the roads from shops that include chemists, supermarkets and food centres. The rooms are very good. Comfortable beds, coffee-maker, safe and a shower that works well. Noise was not a problem on the second floor. The free breakfast was great - toast, juice, muffins, coffee and even a waffle-maker for those who are into them! ( As an Aussie I am not sure about it for breakfast!!!!!) Found all staff to be extremely helpful - in particular Shane was full of useful information at the desk. They have a deal with Sizzler across the road where you receive a 15% discount. The kids loved the food so we went there four nights in a row!! (Yes, I know we need to get a life!!!) The hotel also has a mexican restaurant that looked lovely, but I didn't get a chance to check it out. They did have the two best waitresses in the world - Paola and Fantasia. (If you go there please say hi for me!) The hotel also provided access to a computer which had internet access in the foyer which was great to check up on e-mails or find directions.
