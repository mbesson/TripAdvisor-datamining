The three great art museums - the Prado, Thyssen-Bornimiza and Reina de Sofia are within spitting distance. The airport bus stop is an easy 300 metres away and the delightful cafe/bar next door also provides wifi access and a fantastic breakfast. My room was small but tidy with clean towels provided daily. It could however have been cleaner. The bed head had not been dusted for some time, and I did find the cigarette smoke that drifted up into the room when I opened the windows into the central well of the apartment building, in preference to using the air-conditioning, disconcerting. For people who don't mind dust or cigarette smoke this will be an ideal pension. It does offer excellent value for money.

This was 12 years ago and although it's not as cheap as it was, it's everything you'd want, if you want the real Madrid. Going east it's 5 minutes walk to the Prado and 10 to the Retiro: west it's 5 minutes to Pl Sta Ana and 10 to Sol. Turn left outside the front door (west) and at the end of the street (50 metres), turn right and you're in the heart of a fantastic area for tapas. In the other direction, Plaza Santa Ana is wonderful and you can spend hours watching the Madrilenos go by, drinking natural brown beer (tostada) at the Naturbier bar. All the hostal's facilities are adequately and fully described in other reviews. What may be helpful is that, although no breakfast is provided, the bar Casa Merani is right at the foot of the stairs and owned by the wonderful Alfredo. He's really friendly and helpful and full of laughter. I don't think that either Alfredonor the patrons of Dulcinea speak much Engliish, but this needn't put you off, as there's always a way, and you want to experience Madrid, don't you? You can get to the Hostal in about 20 minutes from Barajas. Catch the airport bus from outside the terminal building (5 Euros) and look for the 'stops' on the neon sign. You can get off at Cibeles or, if you're brave, wait until you leave Cibeles and ask the driver to drop you at the next stop. This bus doesn't normally stop at these stops but it works for us, and the next stop is right at the end of Calle Cervantes. All in all I didn't want to recommend Dulcinea because each year it gets harder to book, but the owners really deserve the praise!", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!

Close to metro and bus stops and all the main attractions. It's almost across the Prado museum! Once we figured out the narrow little streets surrounding it (which was a lot easier than anticipated), it was easy to walk to all the main sights and even to the Puerto del Sol and the palace! This is a great place to stay if you want to have the ideal Madrid experience. It's in range of unique small shops and bars with a Starbucks just 100ft away. The owner was friendly but did not speak any english at all. He just smiled at us. The rooms were clean and we had a small terrace looking out over the narrow street below. Beds were nice. One thing to know is that the bathroom is small, very small and a grown man of 1.7m might have trouble moving around in it...

Wi fi was difficult to establish at first, but on our third day, we were able to access it easily from our room. Our hosts offered us an inside room, but recommended a balcony room, which was nice & sunny. It was nice to have fresh air with the double doors opened. The balcony itself is small, no room to sit on, but fine for our purposes. Our balcony overlooked a safe side street. Street noise is as expected in a city. Beds are comfortable, no problems sleeping. Room & bathroom were cleaned daily. Bring a round-shaped 220 converter so you can recharge your electronics. Packets of shampoo & small round soaps are provided. Small room safe fits wallets & cameras, not iPads or laptops. The room also had a key-locked built-in wardrobe for our luggage. There is a flatscreen wall-mounted TV with remote. You can walk around the corner to a VIPS or Starbucks, both of which offer free wi fi for 45 mins with purchase. Plenty of relatively reasonably-priced restaurants were also very nearby in any direction we walked from the hotel. Expect to pay about 50 euros for a decent dinner for two, including a pitcher of sangria. We walked a little further to Plaza de Santa Ana, where we found Tablao VillaRosa, a restaurant with live flamenco dancing. It made for a fun evening. We're not night-clubbers, but plenty of clubs were to be found in the general area. And oh yes, it's very convenient to the 3 most popular museums, the Prado, the Thyssen, & the Reina Sofia. Reina Sofia is one of the few attractions open on Mondays.
