The darkness of the room (it's almost a basement, with next to no natural light) really depressed us. The good stuff...the rest of the hotel was quite charming with it's dated, 'Orient-express' decor. The bar was very reasonable - the cheapest drinks anywhere - but yes it did close at 9.30 so a nightcap was out of the question. Breakfast was quite good - actually much more varied than most continental style breakfasts. The staff were quite nice. While the location is not great, barely 30seconds walk away was 'Ristorante Africa' - a cosy North African/Middle Eastern style place which served excellent mezze-style food, apart from the wierd flatbreads. We really liked it there, and it was very busy after 8.30pm. Overall, we would stay here again, but would insist on an upper floor room.

My wife and I selected the hotel based on the reviews found on this site, but what we found was not as had been described. We traveled with friends and were allocated rooms 101 and 103. It's possible other rooms in the hotel are better but I can only review what I saw. Both rooms were clean but in poor condition. The rooms were small and the shower room tiny. The door on the shower was held together with insulating tape and the tiles were badly cracked. There were wooden shelves fitted in the bathroom beside the shower which made it difficult for an adult to access the shower without scrapping ones back against the shelves. The bedroom had a bad smell of drains which meant we had to leave our window open at all times, luckily there were shutters on the outside as a security measure. Our friends in the next room had the same problem. There were twin beds but the bases were 3' but they had 2'6\" mattresses. No duvet I'm afraid. The furniture is dated and tatty. There is a charge of 18Euro a day for the TV etc. On checkout there is a tax charged of 2Euro per person per day. Breakfast was good as long as your happy with continental style. The staff were pleasant enough. Tea and coffee making facilities at this hotel equals a kettle, when I enquired about tea and coffee the person on reception laughed and directed me to the supermarket. The bar prices are reasonable but it does close at 21:30. Location is convenient for the Termini(bus & train) but there is a limited choice of eateries in the area. If visiting Rome for more than two days I would recommend purchasing a Roma Pass from the tourist information office, this pass will give give entry to some major attractions and bus and metro travel. You will recover the cost in entry fees alone. You will be offered a hop-on / hop-off bus as an alternative by street sellers I would not recommend purchasing them. These buses are expensive and most of the sites are within walking distance of one another. There is an airport shuttle bus every 30 minutes for 6 Euro each way which takes approximately an hour journey time.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cOver rated\u201d", "Author": "clareandjamie", "ReviewID": "UR127870475", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the hotel Andreotti in March for a long weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. After reading some of the reviews on Trip advisor we were expecting great things from the hotel. We arrived at 11.30 in the morning and found the hotel with ease. It is round the corner from the main terminal station in Rome. We checked in with no problem and were given a slight upgrade on the room which was nice. The lady that checked us in was polite and gave us a map and information on trips. Our room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was new and the room was a good size. To be honest we came to Rome to see Rome and not spend time in the room. After getting changed we went out for the day and had a wonderful time. Upon returning to the Hotel that evening we decided to have a couple of drinks in the bar - However, no-one was available to serve us as the barman we busy tiling in a bedroom. We asked at reception if they could call us in our room once the barman was ready and were told 10 minutes. However 30 minutes later my husband went back to reception and then they got someone to serve us. Anyway we didn't mind too much - We were on Holiday after all! The next morning we went to breakfast and it was pretty poor. There was no hot food and the cold selection was rice with peas, garlic ham, bread (that you couldn't toast because the toaster didn't work) rock hard croissants or yoghurt. There was tea - but the water was warm not hot and juice which was okay. I usually do not moan about food (please see my other reviews) but this was particualy poor for Italy and a 3 star hotel! The facilities at the hotel were dated and or did not work. The bar area was very small and dated. We met some other guests in the hotel and enjoyed a drink in the bar - However, the staff were rude and kept asking us to be quiet. Not great service! We tried to use the internet to check in for our return flight - but the screen didn't work and when the man at reception went to find out how to fix it - he just started checking people in and forgot about us! And at 3 euro for 30 minutes its not cheap! The lift was very old and I was a bit worried if it was safe or not. Apart from 1 broken computer, a small bar area and a tiny breakfast room - There was no other facilities to speak of. Overall I would recommend Rome but not this Hotel. The hotel is in a great location and could be a fantastic place to stay but It really needs an update - Not just on the d\u00e9cor but also the staff and facilities.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atherstone", "Title": "\u201cUnusual Decor but clean and excellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "AramisTonks", "ReviewID": "UR127461823", "Content": "Our room was decorated with soft cloth dark blue floral wallpaper, walls and ceiling with dark purple curtains and a very dark bed spread! without the feeble light from the single bulb it was incredibly dark. though a bit apprehensive at first, the dark room made for an amazing nights sleep, warm, quiet dark and very cosy!

We were very impressed with the appearance in the lobby area, sitting room and breakfast room. Lovely period furniture, decor and flowers. The breakfast room is clean and well presented, serving a tasty continental breakfast, with plenty of choice. Our room (period style decor), was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was modern-ish, just a few little complaints. The walk in shower door was broken, and kept opening during the shower (to be fair, we did overlook reporting it, room 210) The bathroom was very small, and so the toilet was rather awkward to get to, and too close to the sink. These were minor things, so the good, outweighed the bad ! They do supply shower gel etc, presented in a nice box. Small irritant, is that we could not get any English channels on TV, not even the usual news channel ? I don't know if we were doing something wrong ? Nice to have something on, first thing, and late evening ! The position of the hotel is excellent. About 5 minutes to the Termini, to get trains and buses (including the hop on / off tourist buses). Also coaches, serving both airports. Turn left out of the hotel, and a few yards up the road, for the nearest chemist. There are quite a few restaurants near the hotel. We loved Rome, so much to see and do (but very expensive !!) We would stay at this hotel again. WARNING....beware of pick pockets ! They work in pairs or groups. They approach you, begging for money, using a a folding piece of cardboard. While one is talking, the other goes behind, they use the cardboard, to hold near the bag etc, while the other hand is under it, undoing the zips etc. They are very persistant ! Luckily, my husband spotted it, shouted at them, and they left, empty handed. This happened to us, as we were leaving the wonderful City. I know that it can happen in any City, so don't let it put you off going, just be aware ! Overall, we felt very safe walking around, even in the evenings !!

The rooms are clean and are decorated in an elegant style and charming. All staff in the hotel is nice and helpful. As we first stayed for one day before approaching to Naples, the hotel receptionist allowed us to leave our big luggages in the hotel storeroom for two nights. After travelling from Naples, we stayed one more night in this hotel again. One strange thing we encountered is that the hotel receptionist required us to present our passports and register our information again when we check-in after travelling from Naples. After we settled down our luggages in the room, we asked for our passports back but the receptionist told us that he has not yet completed the registration and he said he can only return back our passport after 2-3 hours. It seems to be nonsense if we don\u2019t possess our identified documentation in Roma being a tourist. On the other hand, we need original passports for tax refund purpose. We then strongly requested to have the return back of our original passports. The breakfast is perfect, there are many choices of bread, croissants, cheese, eggs, ham, cakes, milk, yogurt, fresh fruits, hot dishes and juices, etc. You can also make your own coffee & tea from the machine.

When arriving in Rome by plane (in Fiumicino airport), take the shuttle bus cross Terminal 3, it's only 8 euros/person to take you to Rome. The Termini station is the final stop. TIP 1: Find the exact location of the hotel on maps on the net, so you won't miss it. The hotel looks recently renovated, the inside looks just like the interior of a castel. I liked it. No heating system, just the conditioned air (a whole system inside the hotel, you can't raise the temperature of your room yourself!). The single rooms of this hotel are pretty small and the bathrooms are pretty small as well. I had no enough space in the shower to wash myself. It was pretty cold in my room, only when a group of Italian children arrived in the hotel and stayed over the week-end, my room was at last properly heated. TIP 2: The hotel offers a very good shampoo (and bath foam). It makes your hair smooth and silky! The breakfast consists of a large variety of food. TIP 3, for eating out: Eat your lunch and dinner in Termini station (go upstairs), at Autogrill's. The prices are very reasonable, and... THE 'COPERTA' COSTS ZERO EURO!!! Large plate with pasta (looked like for 2 persons) only 3 euros! You'll find VERY good pasta there. Plus, many other dishes: meat, pizza, salads, sweets, fruits... at very reasonable prices! Plus, the place looks very clean. TIP 4 for the shopping: Inside the Termini station (right next to the first train line!), there is a good shop at reasonable prices: they provide discounts for week-ends, even 30% for cloths, cosmetics, toys... The hotel is very close to Rome attractions. TIP 5: Take a hop on-hop off bus and go arond Rome. It's the best way to see this city! I took such a bus and it costed me just 8 euros/person/day. All those busses stop at the Vatican city and close to Termini station. TIP 6: If you intend to visit many museums, the price for the entering tickets is very high, as Rome is not a cheap city! If you think about going shopping in Rome... your credit cards must be very fat! TIP 7: When leaving Rome, to go to the airport (Fiumicino, I had a plane to catch at 2 P.M.), I left the hotel at 9 A.M., and it was a good idea, because it took the bus a lot of time to arrive to the airport. Plus, the airport is very big, so I needed time to get to know where my flight was! Overall, I would recommand this hotel for everyone who wants to go to Rome for visiting in extra-season (perhaps not exactly during winter, it was cold when I was there) for short stays.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "DotMiami", "ReviewID": "UR114773579", "Content": "Hotel Andreotti is conveniently located just 10 minute walk from the main Termini train station.

On the check-in day (March 26th, 2011) the receptionist was not able to read correctly the voucher containing our reservation and concluded that we have a reservation for 1 night instead of 5. In vain we provided even the reservation reference, he bluntly told us that we either stay for only one night and check-out the next day or do not check-in. No \"let us check and come back tomorrow with an answer\", nothing of polite nature... Our \"luck\" was that another receptionist looked more attentively into the reservation list and confirmed that the reservation was for 5 nights. Still, this was nothing in comparison with what happened next... Considering the totally unprofessional way the reservation matter was handled, I insisted for our check-in formalities to be done swiftly and our ID's to be returned expeditiously, not \" in one hour or tomorrow morning\", as the receptionists claimed that it can be done. This triggered a reaction I have never met before: the first receptionist started to speak in Italian (until that moment the conversation was in English) saying words that I cannot put here.

So it's very easy and fast to get for example to Vatican for just 1 EUR. A taxi trip close to Trasvere or Ghetto areas cost about 10-12 EUR. The hotel staff will call you a taxi when you need one. Anyway, for those who want to walk, the hotel is a bit far away, 30-45 minutes walk away from the ancient Rome. We walked a little less than one hour to the Colosseum in traffic hours. (Of course, women are window shopping which can slow down your walk.;) The next time I'm going to Rome I'll choose a hotel closer to older areas, maybe Trastevere.

Coffee and juice are only available from a a machine, something that's unfortunately becoming more and more common in Italy. Andreotti's staff was very friendly, although they didn't speak English very well. No problems anway. It's worth noting there's a wall-to-wall carpet in hotel rooms and public areas.

Afterward, I was a bit hesitant when reading about the Termini area of Rome and knowing that this was close to that area. Well, let me say that it was an amazing experience all around. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with classic Italian charm and warmth. And it didn't stop the entire time we were there. Breakfast was amazing (AND included) in the way of fresh juices, coffees, milk, water, pastries, bread, meats, eggs, cereal, yogurt....you name it, it was there and it was fresh and good. Any and all questions were greeted at the front desk and everyone was in a good mood and willing to help offer suggestions and tips. The room itself was small (but average in compared to rome standards) but very clean and presentable. And kept so daily by the maids. The insides are classic rome....very well laid out and very nice detail at all turns, including the stairs, lobby, breakfast room and bar. Clean at all times, quiet, tucked away off an alley of sorts. If you're going to Rome, GO FOR THE ANDREOTTI. I'm not kidding. After being there and staying in two hotels as a first timer, the Termini area is awesome. Sure, there are some parts that seem sketchy, but you can say that about any large city's subway system. The best part? Termini is THE crossroads of Rome to go north or south cheaply and conveniently. With the dollar so low and euro so high, the subway is basically a free ride to wherever you want to go and quickly. For about 16 euros, you can ride buses and subway ALL WEEK. And that, my friends, is a STEAL. The Andreotti was safe (literally, a safe in the room and attentive desk workers), charming, clean and cozy. Do not hesitate...take the word of someone who was searching feverishly for all of these qualities as a first time visitor to rome. We made a brilliant choice and will definitely stay there again if we go back. Even paying the bill upon checking out was a pleasure and a bit sad to say goodbye.
