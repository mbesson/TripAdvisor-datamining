It was too early, 10 am, so we left our luggage at the reception. When we returned from the city at 14 h, we found out that our luggage had been neglected while we had been away. But given that nothing strange happened, nothing had been taken from our luggage, we did not give it more importance. We had booked a double room five months before and what we found at the check-in was a corridor converted into a bedroom with twin beds, one at each side of the room. It was necessary to cross the dining room in order to get there. We were told that there were no more rooms available. We complained by showing our reservation confirming a double room. After threatening to call the police, we were shown another room behind the reception desk, which was very different to what show the photographs on the website of the hotel. We spend the whole afternoon to see if they could cancel reservation and we went to another hotel. We should mention that the treatment we received from the lady Shirpa was outrageous, if not miserable. The price they charge does not correspond to the standards expected. For the price of a 3* hotel you find standard of a 1* hotel.

The manager is nasty if you ask for something. If you complain you get a tirade of insults in Italian. (Which I understood because I told him I speak Italian,, it didnt matter to him.) You must carry your luggage up 3 flights of dimly lit stairs. We reserved 7 nights in Rome and choose this hotel because of the 120 price and terminal location on a main street. We could only stand it for 3 nights. My wife had an asthma attack. Probably because of the dusty , moldy walls. That are covered with some type padded fabric that was popular 50-60 years ago. covered with dust fuzzies, A bad place to stay, however The cold self service breakfast served in their little kitchen was pleasant attended by 2 nice ladies who made coffee. NO fresh fruit, no boiled egg just cereal and rolls. For 20 euro more right around the corner we found a wonderful place On via Palermo, The Hotel Virgilio saved our vacation.

If you're looking for luxury, this is not the place for you though - on the down side, the building is old, so the plumbing was a little dodgy with intermittent hot water in the shower and slightly dodgy looking plug sockets.

I got verbally attacked and insulted in the morning by a balding middle-aged guy with a goatie (the owner?), as my business partner was late for breakfast. Can you imagine that?! It was totally surreal. Finally the guy tried to stop me leaving the hotel grabbing me and shouting, god knows why. I guess it was related to the fact that he wanted both me and my partner to leave at the same time. Hard to tell really. Pretty bad experience when you have to meet a client after half an hour. Somehow I managed to keep my cool and in the best Italian I could manage I threatened him to call the police. He kept swearing but he let me go.

At night time and in the morning the traffic outside was so loud it kept us awake - it was constant, apparently the window's were double glazed but you wouldnt have thought it!
