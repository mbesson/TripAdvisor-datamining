I stayed for almost a week from 05-10 Dec 2011, and recieved poor service from the get go. I chose this location because i use La Quinta frequently and because of its great location in Mission Valley and easy access to highways. However, this location DID NOT live up to the standards I've come to expect from La Quinta. First, our rooms were VERY cold and we were provided nothing but bed liners for our beds. I requested comforters three times before an attendant delivered bed liners to my room saying they didn't have comforters. He then asked me, \"How many times did you request these Sir?\" I thought maybe he was going to apologize for the inconvienience and then upon my telling him \"Three times,\" he mentioned, \"I only need to be told once, not three times Sir. Here are your liners.\" I was left dumb founded as i did not give any attitude nor grief to deserve this maltreatment. My family and I set our heater but that didn't work and only blew room temperature air. Mind you its winter and nightly lows are in the 30's and 40's... I notified the front desk on several occasions and even payed them a friendly visit, but no one ever came to attempt fixing the heater. Third, house keeping is a joke and rarely if ever cleaned our room. The two times they did, dirty towels were left on the floor and trash cans were left without liners. I got to the point i was using recycled Target bags and just putting them outside the door when full since they were never taken out in the first place. I got tired of chasing down the house keepers. Fourth, as my family and i were relocating from CA to TX, the last day we brought in a moving truck and car trailor. Upon driving into the parking lot, a front desk employee came outside and told us we were ok to park our truck and trailor in addition to my car in the parking lot. So we left the car and car trailor at the hotel and took the truck to the storage facility to pack it up. Upon return, i was told by my younger sister, 22, (who is a small framed girl by the way) that she was told by the same employee that we were no longer allowed to park there due to the hotel being fully booked and that (the employee) didn't care how it was done, but the car trailor had to move immediately. So my younger sister had to ask another customer to help her pick up the front of the trailor and move it out of the parking lot all on their own without help. Mind you this thing is VERY heavy and it took them over an hour. I ended up paying the guy $50 for his troubles. I couldnt come help as i had a deadline that afternoon to have my storage emptied. We kept an eye on the parking lot that afternoon and during the night, the parking lot NEVER filled up, and in the morning had only 6 cars parked outside. Fifth, Internet at this location is slower than dial up, and finally, the pillows were thinner and worse than ones you would expect at a very cheap hotel. Overall, this ruined my last days in San Diego and I DO NOT recommend ANYONE stay here!!!

The pet rooms are across an alley from an auto-body repair shop. The noise was unbearable, and I asked to move. Unfortunately, with two dogs those rooms were the only ones available to me. Combined with the noise from the busy I-8 freeway, the din was unbearable. I had an enormous amount of work to do that required concentration, and I could not concentrate at all. La Quinta is a wonderful chain, though, and as soon as I complained to the desk (and said I wished I would have stayed in the quieter Chula Vista location), the desk manager offered to move my reservation over there. I was staying in the room on points (I'm a dedicated La Quinta Returns member), but he got me on the phone with the Returns reservation people, who promptly gave me back my points and moved them to a reservation at the other place. The whole process took about a half hour, and everyone was friendly and helpful all the way through. Not bad for what's really a budget business hotel. I'm not sure the Sheraton would manage things that well. If you need to stay at this La Quinta because the location suits you better, it's not bad. The rooms are a little small (at least the pet rooms were), but they're clean. If you're traveling with pets, though, and have to be in the room before 6 or 7 p.m., I wouldn't recommend it. I often stay in La Quintas when I need to work, and the desk and chair here was inadequate for that. But I do thank La Quinta people for helping me out. Everything turned out great.

With the AAA rate we paid $99 per night. The room had two decently comfortable beds (we brought our own softer pillows), a microwave, mini fridge, free wi fi and free breakfast. And free parking. I love having a fridge in the room! I brought my own organic milk and made tea in the room. We were on the top floor in the back. so we heard absolutely nothing from the road or any neighbors. In most hotels I hear doors slamming starting at 7am, but not here. Maybe it wasn't very full. It is a 2-star hotel, so there wasn't much that was fancy about the room. It was just barely big enough for two, and everything seemed clean enough. There was one sink with a just a little counter space, a tight squeeze for two women! But it was separate from the toilet/shower, which is great. The breakfast is served till 9:30am, and as others have reviewed it is VERY crowded. Honestly it's too small for the amount of rooms. We were generally there between 8:45am and 9:30 and you really have to hustle around the crowds of people and kids. Still, my travel mate always got her waffle, and I got my oatmeal. There was milk, juice, different breads, hb eggs, fruit , cereal coffee etc. With the addition of yogurt I had in my fridge, it was a perfectly good breakfast. The parking can get a little tight if you arrive after 11pm, but even on Friday night we got a space. Make sure you check out with plenty of time, because they don't staff the office very well! The location is great! There is a large shopping center on the other side of the freeway if you need a grocery store, ice cream, Best Buy or Target. The hotel is on the side of the freeway that heads east, away from the city. But it's a fast and easy drive with a stop light to get on I-8 west. In light traffic you can be in Old Town, Mission Beach, the Gaslamp, Seaworld or Balboa Park in 10-15 minutes max. Using I-8 and Hwy 163 you can easily find your way around. I recommend a stop at the Whole Foods in Hillcrest on your way to the Zoo to pick up a healthy smoothie and good sandwiches. (-: I have no idea if the trolley or a bus comes out to this location.

He said that I would have to find out at the hotel after our stay. We checked into a suite, and imagine my surprise when there was no door to the bedroom suite. I called the front desk, and they said they don't have any suites with doors on them. The living area was directly through a large doorway, with NO privacy.

The maintenance man was the person who came with our blankets, and helped figure out the fridge. Kudos to him. He was nice. Upon checkout-I receive a bill for $694.00. ??? REALLY? I informed the man at the desk that my husband had several free nights coming to him as he had almost 100,000 points on his member rewards account. Of course, He said he didn't know anything about the rewards points, and that I had to discuss this with them. I asked for the day manager, and of course, he wasn't present that day.

Right around the corner from the UCSD Extension building if you're in town for classes there. It's close to the beaches/SeaWorld by car, but don't try walking to the shopping mall like they advertise unless you are all in shape and adventurous - you have to cross the busy bridge over I-8 to get there. Parking was not ideal, you have to park near the front of the parking structure to get to the elevators and the support poles obstruct several spaces. If you park closest to the elevator, make sure you have a small car or you will need a lookout to back out without damaging anything. We had a Chrysler Pacifica and parked fairly close, but another guest parked his Honda Ridgeline right next to us and we couldn't get past that truck's rear end -- I had to back out like I was going deeper into the structure and do a 3-pt turn just to come back to the exit! We had a 2nd floor suite w/ a king size bed, which meant an odd-numbered room (even numbers were on one side of the floor, odd numbers on the other). You can hear every noise on the concrete walkways leading to the rooms, so when you're trying to sleep you will hear the late comers with rolling suitcases and the cleaning person's cart when she's nowhere near your room. My kid was on the hide-a-bed couch, which he said was fine. The main bedroom is separate from the couch area, but there is no privacy door so people on the couch that need access to the bathroom have to pass by the bed - keep that in mind if you sleep with little to nothing on. The toilet cycled on and off every 10 minutes or so, very annoying. Maintenance never came to repair it after I reported it - I finally got my pliers and fixed the flapper myself to get some sleep I asked for extra towels since there were 3 of us in the room - we didn't get them until the last day of our 3-day stay. The bathroom vent/fan is wall-mounted above the toilet, don't get too close because it is full of dust. When we first arrived, the windows had sheers and privacy shades. On the 2nd day of our stay, we came back to find the sheers removed! Apparently the maintenance man did this to all the rooms, but now we had to either leave the shades open and have anyone walking by look into our room, or close the shades and turn on all the lights! So much for the view. Friday was strange because the flyer guys are all over the place. If they can tell a room is occupied (lights on, noises inside room), they shove flyers into the room through the gap in the side of the door. The 1st time they came, I thought someone was trying to break into the room they were so loud. After the 4th flyer came through in an hour (3 local pizza joints, 1 chinese food place), I complained to the front lobby. Then it magically stopped. Breakfast was pretty good, get there early because it is like a train station with all the guests eating there. If you don't like the basic waffles/cereal/bagels, you can take a 3-minute walk up Cam. Del Rio S to Denny's. Starbucks is across the street in the mall, too far to walk but a short drive. Room service food quality was good, but the prices in the menu were incorrect...they charged an extra $1 on EVERY ITEM we ordered, which was not cool. Laundry was pretty good, the dryers actually got clothes dry in one cycle. Don't bother buying the soap/fabric softener from the lobby - bring your own or go to Target in the mall across the street. The wi-fi worked well, no complaints there when we needed to look up places to visit or restaurants. I normally don't stay here on business trips to SD, even though it's right down the street from the UCSD building I normally am in town to visit. I wouldn't have stayed here this trip except that I got a great deal on a SeaWorld package, which included stay at this hotel.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lg1955", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, clean, good location, pets stay free...\u201d", "Author": "lg1955", "ReviewID": "UR109981429", "Content": "We stayed here last week after a horrible experience at another hotel.

The rooms are just fine, clean, and comfortable. Front desk staff is friendly and helpful at check-in. My stay at this particular inn, however, was a disappointment, principally because of management and service issues. 1) The biggest issue is that there is no process to ensure that every room possible is serviced by room attendants. If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door when they come, they will not come back unless you specifically request it. Same if your pet is in your room. Thus if you leave the hotel under these circumstances you will come back and find your room has not been serviced, and hotel management will tell you the maid had no way of knowing you wanted service. Management should assume that every guest wants their room to be serviced, unless there is a clear demonstration otherwise. 2) The breakfast room is completely inadequate in size and staffing. Even on the Monday morning following Easter when the hotel had low occupancy the night before, the room was uncomfortably crowded, people were packed 3 or more deep at the waffle makers, and the one attendant was running herself ragged just trying to keep tables clean. Each of the two buildings should have a breakfast room. 3) The pet area is poorly lighted and apparently is never cleaned. Even if you want to pick up your pet's waste as I always do, you are likely to step in something another dog has left behind. 4) Maids will not clean your room while the pet is there, which is perfectly understandable.

This was great for my sister, as she didn't have a to share a bed with her dad (plus, her TV in the living room was bigger than the one in the bedroom... she was quite pleased).

The receptionist who checked us in made me feel very good about continuing to choose La Quinta whenever possible. The sole complaint I have about this hotel was the super crowded breakfast room. Of course, that's not really the hotel's fault, but it should be noted. I had better success the second day, so it may have just been a function of it being a Friday morning. The breakfast was actually quite good, and included cereal, do-it-yourself waffles, bagels, toast, yogurt, fresh fruit, etc. I couldn't ask for more. The hotel is located very close to various restaurants and gas stations. On our second night there, we walked to an El Cazador Mexican restaurant that was just around the corner (good thing... the restaurant actually had valet parking, as there was very little parking available!). There was also a Wendy's and an ARCO just down the street from the hotel... super convenient. My GPS had a hard time finding the hotel as it sits right off a major highway, and the various exits get kind of confusing. But, once we got there, I had no problem figuring out where to go.

We were told the rooms were separate and adequate for two adults and two children. After settling in we realized that the rooms were indeed separate but there was no door between the two rooms (Wide open). There was noise from above and outside the room all night long. It was so disturbing that I tried to call down to the front desk to complain (I'm not a complainer). I sat for a very long time waiting for someone to answer and finally hung up out of frustration (This was between 8:30 and 9:30PM). Later in the evening/middle of the night there was another round of loud noises from outside the room (Exterior halls) and upstairs. I was tempted to call the front desk again but figured it would get me nowhere and I didn't want to add additional disruption to my family trying to sleep. It gets better... In the morning we went to try and enjoy the included continental breakfast... The place was a mad house with people lining up the complete distance of the room to get food. The tables needed cleaning and we just happened to luck out and grab a table big enough for the four of us as others were leaving. It was disgusting yet amusing at the same time to see the mayhem in what is supposed to be a relaxed environment (Breakfast). We got the basics and out of there asap since it was not something I wanted to submit my family to. Upon checkout, I explained my frustration with the experience and the only words I received in response was \"I'm sorry to hear that\". Nothing was done to try and remedy the situation. Even after mentioning that I would never stay at a La Quinta again. NOTE: There is a automatic and required deposit for a safe that is in your room. You have to ask for the refund at checkout if you don't use it. It's not much money but the fact that you have to ask for it back... Out of frustration I completely forgot about it until we were back on the road. Upon our return I utilized the company's website to file an official complaint about our stay. We are receiving a credit due to the problems but the manager made it sound like we should have expected all of the noise and mayhem over a holiday weekend...

I stayed at the hotel during a conference I was attending because it was less expensive than the conference-sponsored hotel, and I couldn't have been happier with my decision. When I initially called to inquire about the hotel rates, I spoke to Chuong, and she was amazing in helping me to get the best rate possible. Then, when I arrived at the hotel, I ended up getting there a little earlier than expected, so my room was not ready. I was completely prepared to leave the hotel and find something to pass the time until my room was ready, but Chris was so accomodating and actually upgraded me to a suite (for FREE!) so that I wouldn't be inconvenienced. That was completely above and beyond the call of duty, since it wasn't their fault the room wasn't ready (I was the one who arrived too early!). I was able to check in immediately, and my entire stay was very comfortable and enjoyable. The free continental breakfast provided was wonderful, and the free parking and wireless internet service were definite perks in an area where most of the hotels charged for parking. And if you aren't afraid to walk a little bit, the location of the hotel is quite convenient. The mall and various restaurants are only about 1/2-3/4 of a mile away, and the Town and Country Conference Center is only about 1.8 miles away, so it is definitely \"doable\" if you bring a good pair of walking shoes with you! In fact, I think I walked about 24 miles during the week that I was there, and I loved every minute of it, since the area is so nice and walker-friendly. I am hoping that my travels will bring me back to the La Quinta Inn at Mission Valley again soon, but even if they don't, I will definitely recommend the Inn to all of my friends and family who visit the San Diego Area. Not only was the hotel a great value for the services provided, but they treated me like someone \"special\" from the time I walked into the hotel until the time I left, and I definitely don't think I would have received the same attention at one of the more expensive hotels! Thanks so much to Chris, Chuong, Veronica, Janice, Reyna, and the rest of the staff at the La Quinta Inn San Diego - Mission Valley for such a wonderful stay.

As for the hotel itself, check-in was quick and easy. We used the parking garage to park our vehicle, and while the parking spots were pretty small, there was plenty of parking each night we were there. There was an elevator from the parking garage to each floor of the hotel. The room was clean, the beds comfortable, the bathroom small but adequate, and overall a joy to come \"home\" to after a day filled with touristy stuff. My only complaint was that the fridge in our room had been turned off before we arrived...not sure if it was done by the cleaning staff or the previous residents of the room, but it did take a while to cool down once we turned it on. We bought some snacks and drinks at the Target across the highway. There is also some grocery stores within a few miles as well, if you need to get some snacks/food items.

The room was extremely clean and we were happy to have the added convenience of a nice sized mini-fridge and a microwave. The TV was bigger than the ones we have at home, but we were a little disappointed that there were only 35 channels. There was a safe in the closet which we didn't use, but it was nice to know we could use it if we needed to. The decor was very up-to-date and the beds were very comfortable. I think this is the first time ever that I've been comfortable in a hotel bed. They were not too soft but not rock-hard either. I slept really well every night, which is very rare for me. We didn't even realize there was a continental breakfast until the last two days and we did use that service those two days. There was a very nice selection and the gal working there was very pleasant. We had spent the first 5 mornings with friends and gone out to eat. There were lots of restaurants nearby. My hubby enjoyed the hot tub and the pool every morning even though the temps were in the 40s and 50s the whole week. My only complaints would be that the key cards weren't very reliable and that the \"ground floor\" had several steps. When I called to reserve my room, I asked for a ground level room because I can't walk very far and walking steps is very difficult for me....my disappointment was that, even though there is an elevator from the parking garage to the first floor, our room was halfway down to the end and I still had to walk a long way. I left housekeeping a note that there was no need to change the bedding every day because we were going to be there for a week (in Minnesota it's very common, to save on water and laundry soap) and I believe they changed the linens daily anyway. You'd think that with the recent drought and fires, they'd want to conserve all the water they could. It was nice that there was a computer in the lobby for public use so I had a chance to check my email while we were on vacation. The staff was very pleasant and friendly. It was surprisingly quiet since it's right next to the freeway! Since the weather was so cold, we had the heater running almost the whole time, which probably helped to block out the road noise.

Let's start off with the pros: We booked a King Studio Suite on hotels.com for about $50 less PER NIGHT than booking through La Quinta or other travel sites. Give it a try! When traveling with children, I would always recommend getting a seperate sleeping area no matter where you stay. In this case, it was wonderful to have 2 t.v.'s! Our daughter loved that she had her \"own room\" even though it technically was the room with a couch, tables & t.v. Location, Location, Location...it was minutes from all the things we wanted to do or see. We chalked up the $200 to rent a car through Hertz that was equipped with a GPS 'NeverLost'. Let me tell ya - it was SO worth it! We ventured out more than we would've w/o it. La Jolla Cove aka: Seal Beach(a must!), Seaport Village (---), Coronado, Sea World, Legoland & even Tijuana Mexico! We drove to the border, parked & took the bus to Tijuana for $8 pp round trip. Personally, after witnessing the city as you cross the border and the line to get through customs on the way back - walking is not the way to go! You can save $8 pp or be happy (safe, too) and fork over the money to enjoy Tijuana without all the hassle of border crossing and the walk itself. Ok, more hotel details to tell you about.. The pool was heated..not just luke warm but actually enough that you could plunge right in. The hot tub was plenty hot - sometimes a bit too much. Still, it was a welcome sight after long days on the feet. Breakfast is simple yet satisfying. Free USA Today too. To help cut the cost of eating out, we bought food at Target & Food 4 Less. Stocked the 'frig & (very) small freezer 2-3 times. It's amazing how creative you can get when you have to! Because there is not enough room for a 1/2 gal. of milk, we each took a cupful of milk back from breakfast with a cover to have later on. I also made our daughter a PB&J for later on. Ya gotta do what ya gotta do! They offer underground parking. We chose to park outside only because I didn't care to be in a parking area in the dark. I like the lighted parking area where you can actually see people & even your own room. (if you're facing the parking lot, that is). The staff was friendly & really did the best they could when we did have an issue come up. And yes, we did... And now for the cons: Our hot water seemed to not work every day. It was hit & miss b/w 7a.m. - 9 a.m. That did become frustrating. Especially when you need to be somewhere & 3 people need to shower. They did offer us keys to an empty room to shower because the maint. guy was off that day. (never heard of that!) A short time later, we ran the hot water in the sink & then the shower warmed up...??? It became a joke after awhile. We just decided to make the best of it. ;o) Another bummer - the pool was under repair on our last day. Not that they could help it - but it was a bummer! Suggestions - ask for a room facing the parking lot NOT the car dealership next door. I would rather heatrsuitcase rolling down the outside hall than pages over a PA system all day. Also - we used the AAA card. Saved lots of money at Legoland & Sea World. No deals at Disneyland, though! Overall, it was well worth the $91.00 per night.

There was a popcorn machine in the lobby, and both my girls loved having a little popcorn. I thought that was a nice touch, and initially had a good impression. My opinion changed when we got to our room. Both keys did not work. We were tired after walking all day at the zoo, and trying to get working keys was a huge hassel. My parents were booked next door to our room. Only one of their two keys worked intermittently, but they did not complain. My husband called the lobby, and we waited, seemingly a 'long time' (though in reality probably about 10 minutes) for someone to bring my husband and I two new keys. The second set of keys also did not work, so we called yet again. Finally the maintenance man came, and he also fiddled with the keys. And then I think he tinkered with the lock and looked puzzled, saying the lock was not working. By then, probably 20 minutes had gone by, and my kids were getting quite antsy, as were my husband and I, and my parents. My husband called the front desk again; that time he complained and requested another room altogether. The desk person replied, \"Sorry, but we don't have another room available at the same level.\" My husband said, \"Ok, then could you upgrade us for all the hassel we're going through?\" They agreed to upgrade us, and our kids were so pleased to have a 'big' one-bedroom suite with two televisions so they could watch their own shows. However, they had to sleep on a sofa bed, which probably is not as comfortable as the two double beds we were supposed to originally have. Everything looked nice, but then we noticed that there were big tears in our comforter. We notified the desk staff; we did not want to be charged for the ripped comforter. They offered to bring us another comforter and an extra blanket for our girls.The shower was hard to turn off completely to keep it from dripping. This place provides the combined shampoo/conditioner in a single bottle. Maybe that's good for the guys or people with short hair, but I would've preferred one shampoo bottle and one separate conditioner bottle. Hallways face the outside of the building, so we could hear people going up/down the hall with their suitcases. My mom said that they were going to charge her for using the safe, even though she did not use the safe; not sure how that got resolved. My dad went to go fill our ice bucket; the machine did not put out any ice. My dad said the machine appeared broken, but when I called the desk staff, they said that the machine was not broken and that it just takes awhile to fill. My dad laughed and said that machine was dry as a bone. My husband went to another floor to get ice. Continental breakfast was quite nice, though a little crowded with regard to finding a table since there were 4 adults and 2 kids. This place was on a busy street with not much to do; to do anything other than go out to eat at El Torito or Benihana's, would've had to get on the freeway. There was no view of anything other than the freeway. Bottom line: I don't think I'd return to this place based on our experience. My parents seemed quite disappointed with all the hassels, and they are generally easy going people.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coolangatta, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for Families\u201d", "Author": "Biddleonia", "ReviewID": "UR7285916", "Content": "We stayed at this property for four nights and were very impressed. It is located just off the I8 Freeway and you can get into Sea World, San Diego City and Balboa Park very easily and quickly. The room itself was slightly small but had a separate bedroom. The condition of the room was good with clean bathroom and small kitchen. Also included is Continental Breakfast comprising fruits, cereals, toast, bagels and pastries. Good start to the day. Hotel also has heated pool and spa which kids enjoyed. Across the road is a shopping centre which you can walk to. Heaps of restaurants on the immediate area.
