The rates are very low for a property so close to the beach. We were four adults in a double queen room and we were VERY comfortable! We had hoped to have a double queen room upstairs with an \u201cL\u201d shaped double window (lots of sunlight) and a balcony with a table and chairs to enjoy coffee in the mornings, but the hotel was completely booked. Management graciously offered to move us the next day, but we decided to stay where we were (besides, it turned out that the weather was rainy and windy and too cold to sit outside anyway!!) Our room was huge and had vaulted ceilings which made it look even larger; and the d\u00e9cor was very pleasant and most important - it was super CLEAN! There was a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room as well and we enjoyed brewing coffee in the room daily (coffee/filter combination packets are available at the desk \u2013 just ask!) Every morning there were freshly delivered pastries, coffee, juice and tea available in the office \u2013 perfect to start the day. It was also nice to have an iron and ironing board and there was a hairdryer in the bathroom. As for toiletries, we always bring our own, but I love that there was Bath & Body Works soap and shampoo available. The beach really is just across the parking lot and we felt totally safe walking out there after dark. As other posts mentioned, there are many restaurants, bars, shops, etc. within a few blocks \u2013 the Pacific Shores is very convenient to everything. We walked around and explored every evening and found cool places every time. However, since we had a car, we drove around quite a bit and got lost on purpose just to explore the area! We ate at The Menu, The Broken Yolk, Ciro\u2019s Pizzeria and Bar (which were all within a short drive) and our last night we went to World Famous just a few blocks from our hotel which was recommended by a local couple we met at The Menu. We had a great getaway and the Pacific Shores was perfect base to come back and rest. Housekeeping does a fabulous job (they were even washing the sidewalks and patios!) and the front desk staff was always friendly, courteous and helpful. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel \u2013 look no further \u2013 the Pacific Shores is perfect. PS \u2013 I am one who researches hotels on TripAdvisor exhaustively and I drive myself crazy second-guessing my decisions. I was so happy to find that the reviews on this property are absolutely spot-on. I also was impressed that the manager actually reads the reviews and personally replies to the guests \u2013 that played a huge role in deciding on booking the Pacific Shores!

If you pay more than $100, you'll probably be a little upset. Also, if you book your hotel via a booking service (e.g. Orbitz), make sure you print your reservation out, along with the rate, as the clerk was unable to find our reservation. We had to show him the email confirmation. The Great: -AMAZING location is a beautiful area (Mission Beach). If you have never been to Mission Beach, add it to your to-go list. The motel is right on the beach. -Value - I am pretty sure I got a steal due to it being off-season (got the place for around $90) and if the rates stay that way, I'd consider this a great value. -Big rooms, very spacious, comfortable and clean. The ceilings are SKY HIGH on the second floor above the parking spaces. I loved how high the ceilings were. Very comfy beds. The Bad: -Incredibly thin walls and windows. I was on the second floor and I could literally hear people on the street coughing. It's unfortunate how thin the windows/walls are. However, at night, I did find peace and quiet and didn't hear any activity or loud noises. I did turn on the heater unit just for the \"white noise.\" -No free WiFi! Terrible. They charge $8 a day for WiFi and the signal is bad. -Poor cell phone reception in the motel area. No one in our party had good reception and we were all on different networks (this is obviously NOT the motel's fault but it's worth noting). The motel is in a great location, central to several wonderful bars and restaurants. We recommend Fat Fish, as it served great food and margaritas, and Taco Surf Shop. You'll find plentiful bars/restaurants to check out, along with chain restaurants, Ralph's, CVS and shopping stores all within walking distance from the motel. Parking is free.

The rooms were great, clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only complaint was the shower door did not fit properly and water sprayed through a gap to leave the bathroom floor very wet and slippery so we kept having to put towels on the floor. Apart from this Jim Silver and his staff were brilliant. The receptionist even charged my ipod up for me whilst I went to dinner so that I could go for my early morning run with music. The coffee was good and the pastries even better. The pool was clean, the location is 1 min walk to the beach and plenty to do nearby and many places to eat and shop. I have no hesitation in recommending this place, clearly it was very popular as it was fully booked the weekend of our stay.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "abtravel4fun", "ReviewID": "UR77171065", "Content": "Just returned from a 6 night stay in San Diego at Pacific Shores Inn.

The cost was great, it was $87 a night then but i see the price has gone up quite a bit and im not sure i would pay any more than i payed. When we got there no one was at the front desk and we found a maid outside who went in and got a key for us which we were a little concerned about (isnt the manager supposed to do this?) the room was really humid and had very bad air conditioning but it did come with a box fan, and the floor was really sandy but i understand this because you walk outside and the whole parking lot is covered in it. When we first got in the room we were a little confused as to where the promised microwave and fridge was and we found them hiding in the closet, which im not sure i liked because it was a cramped space and only 1 person could fit in at a time. Also we knew they didnt have a coffee maker in the room so we brought our own but there were no availabe plugs left in the closet and most of the ones in the room itself did not work so we had to unplug our microwave. and the bathroom is tiny i mean REALLY tiny! just a shower sink and travel trailor sized toilet and the window next to the toilet had no shade and opened up to a back ally where many kids would walk through and peek through them so we had to put a towel over it. The maids made sure the rooms got cleaned at least twice a day which was nice to be able to leave for the beach (which is right next to the hotel) and come back to a clean room. The pool was very green and smelled of pee in the area but it did have a shower to use after the beach so you wouldnt have to use the public one on the beach. One day we did have a 20 dollar bill go missing but we didnt complain because we were not sure if it was the maid or one of our family members who had taken it.

Check-In: We booked through Expedia and got a rate with a coupon of $87 per night. When I arrived at the hotel check-in took no more than 5 minutes and our rooms was ready to go in the location we requested through Expedia. We requested a room on the end of the hotel closest to the beach. It also ended up right across from the pool. The Room: It was recently remodeled so everything looked new. The bed was amazingly comfortable and made for a great night's sleep! The room itself could have been a little larger as the door to the room hit the bed when you opened it. There was ample room at the ends of the beds though (we had 2 queens). The room had a separate room that was a closet/microwave/fridge room. This was nice as we stored our luggage and food in there which got it out of the way. The bathroom was very clean and updated. However, it was a bit small though. It also only had a shower (no tub). Very small counter space for the sink. We also had a flat panel TV with cable, a large dresser, and a small breakfast table with 2 chairs. Overall, the room suited us pretty well as we stayed there 4 nights with a 1 year old and a 4 year old. The room could have used a bit more lighting, but it wasn't really a problem. The main thing is that the beds were pillow-top and super comfortable. Other Amenities: The pool area was very nice and had a gas grill for use. The pool was \"heated\" but barely. So swimming in May was not a super easy task. The breakfast was probably the only major disappointment. Even to call it continental is a bit of a stretch. It basically consisted of a small selection of pastries, watered down coffee, and pulpy orange juice. Nothing more. Also note that the rooms have coffeemakers but if you want to make coffee you have to go to the front desk and get coffee, creamer, and cups. However, they give you as much as you ask for. Location: Incredible location for the price! There is only one small condo building between the hotel and the beach. It takes about 3 minutes to be on the beach after a walk down the ramp/steps at the end of the street. And there are many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

That said, if you want to be more centrally located to the main San Diego area you may be disappointed here. It is just off of Pacifc Beach which is directly North of Mission beach.

We found the drive to Sea World to be easy with routes to Mission Bay right down Mission Boulvard or over Grand Street to Ingrahm Ave. We tried the beach both off of the motel at pacific beach and down near Belmont Park on Mission beach. The Mission beach area is a little better for kids. Both are well patroled by lifeguards and the ocean surf is warm and fun to play in. We spent three nights at Pacific Shores. The motel is going through some \"growing\" pains with upgrading going on. One afternoon after returnign from the beach we were kept oput of returnign to our room while maintenance was replacing a light switch with sensor switch. This was late in the afternoon at a time when they should expect the guests may want to return to thier rooms. The timing was bad. The last night we spent the smoke alarm batery gave out around midnight and the device began emitting loud alarms. A call to thew dsk brought someont tot eh room aroun 1:00AM, We had to small boys with us trying to sleep. The man replaced the bsattery in the smoke dector and wehn away. A hald horu later it began letting off a short blast every hour or so for the rest of the night! We has a restless night and the kids were not happy. Complaining to the manager lead to the expalnation that the battery was probably not put in properly, sorry about that. No adjustment was offered on our rate but he did say if we come back again to call him and he would give us a better rate next time. Overall while the location may be out of the way to some we enjoyed the proximity of the beaches, the overall casual atmosphere of the area.

There was no where to put your toiletries in the shower except on the floor. Perhaps some wire shelf hangers to slip over the shower nozzle could be purchased? And twice the maid had left our fresh towels sitting on the toilet which was rather unpleasant. The other 3 times they were hung and fanned out.

We weren't disappointed as the room was clean and a decent size, with 2 queen beds, table/chairs and sofa plus a small kitchen. There is also a small on-site self service laundrette which was handy. Therefore you would be comfortable staying for a longer period of time if need be. On site parking was available and free, something you wouldn't necessarily get if staying downtown. There is also a small pool which is in reasonable condition. If you're keen on surfing or the beach scene, then the Pacific Shores is an added bonus as the beach is a minute walk away. We enjoyed a walk along the boardwalk although there weren't as many shops/restaurants as we expected. Downtown is a 15/20 min drive away, La Jolla is 5/10 mins in the opposite direction. There are plenty of bars/restaurants within walking distance from Pacific Shores which attract a younger, surfing crowd. If you're looking for a decent breakfast, go to Hennesey's (also saw some fab live music one evening there), and if you're a fan of burgers you must pop into the Kiwi bar.

This is not a romantic place, it's a very functional place at a great price in a great location. I booked it solely based on reviews read here. We paid AAA rate of around $90. for week-end and $85. for week days. We had a top floor room (it's a 2 floor motel) with 2 queen beds and a partial view of the ocean (room 35). I booked with the hotel directly and was told that a partial ocean view was their maximum view. This was the case. We stayed 6 nights. Our bathroom was completely renovated with a window that opened. Beds were comfortable, Towels & toiletries better than you'd think at this price. A/C noisy but we ran it during the day when we weren't there and turned it off at night. The room had a ceiling fan, which was sufficient. FYI - outiside temperature was around 80 - 90 degrees F. during our stay. We had an outside table with seating. The balcony is like this: a long open area that fronts your room and all the adjoining rooms. If you have one of the first rooms in the row, you will have people walking right past your outside area. If you have the last room in the row, you have total privacy. Each room door is slightly angled so that you don't see your neighbour when sitting outside. No problem with maid service, parking or noise. Our room was probably 3/4 of the way down through the property (in the direction of the beach) so we were probably a bit further from the main road than many rooms. We could hear the ocean though! I didn't see any other rooms however, I think it's fair to say that some might not be in an ideal spot on the property, i.e. with the front of my car parked up against their front door.

We're both in our 60's, so by experience I mean, watch. We stayed for three nights Saturday-Monday after previously staying in Point Loma for three nights. We choose Pacific Shores Inn based on Travel Advisor reviews and the Inn's website. I was somewhat concerned when there was no way to verify my reservation via email (which I made directly by phoning the Inn, since their website did not offer me all the room choices I knew were available.) I wound up calling the Inn prior to leaving on vacation to verify the reservation. Once we arrived everything was exactly as requested. We asked for an upper level 2Q N/S room with kitchen, and a view of the ocean, if possible. The room was huge, with a separate kitchen area and table, a large main room with another table, and a very large walk in closet. The bathroom was above average, but the door was right next to one of the beds. About four rooms shared an outside balcony and each room had its own plastic table and chairs set outside into a little alcove by each room's door. There was a view of the ocean from the balcony, but since the boardwalk and beach was less than a half-block away we simply walked through the parking lot and there it was (except for one other property in front of the Inn). A pleasant surprise was the coin laundry. The Continenal breakfast was the standard rolls, coffee,fruit and juice, but the coffee was very good. One wing of the Inn was being extensively remodeled, the rooms were essentially being gutted and rebuilt. I would strongly suggest that you request an upper level room, and the one's with kitchens don't cost a lot more and appear to be a lot larger. Housekeeping was good, the staff was pleasant (I learned that the motel did not have an internet connection in the office except for the reservation system, which explains the lack of email confirmation.) The Inn is located near the northern end of the beach/boardwalk, which was great because it was less crowded and noisy, yet in a block or two you were right in the middle of the beach scene. We were fortunate to be there when the surf was unusually high and saw high waves, and dozens of surfers up and down the coast. Some of the surfers had come from long distances to take advantage of the waves and a few were staying at the Inn. The weather was perfect, sunny and in the 70's which was what we were seeking after a tough Wisconsin winter. The mid-January price was great , the room was perfect ...... but, I wouldn't want to stay there from Spring Break until the end of the year unless I was much younger, because Pacific Beach is striclty a youth-oriented destination most of the year. We had a few times where the outside noise in the parking lot was excessive, I imagine most of the time the area has a college-town atmosphere. I didn't see any children at the Inn, and almost none in the entire area. Along the boardwalk on the beach bluff there were numerous restaurants and bars, and the shopping area was eclectic.

The manager was elusive with me which I didn't appreciate, but he did talk to someone who worked there and said he would give me a discounted rate at the other property he managed - The Holiday Inn in La Jolla, which turned out to be worlds better. However, if someone had offered this the first night I arrived there, I would've been spared the grossness of staying there at all. I was too tired and busy to switch at the time.

The desk clerk told us that he could put us in a room at the Diamond head inn for one night and then they would figure it out in the morning. The next day they sent us to the Pacific shores inn, and this place was terrible. We needed a 2 room suite with a kicthen, they just gave us a room with 2 beds and a microwave and mini fridge. First of all the mini fridge was leaking and the carpet was soaked and had mold growing on it. The shower leaked into the closet and got some of my clothes wet.

The location is terrific--literally half a block from the beach, restaurants, and the boardwalk. The staff was friendly and helpful. And the best part was the price--I paid $200 less per night than beach front properties only blocks away! As others have mentioned, unless you love pastries, skip the free continental breakfast (and the early birds get the jelly doughnuts, anyway.) Instead, walk to Konos for breakfast. Don't be deterred by the long line, it moves quickly and the food is amazing. Gringos is great for Mexican food. Try Pacific Beach Surf Club for surfing lessons, bike and skateboard rentals, and friendly advice--they repaired my son's skimboard without charge.
