Internet access is free, the room size is average, the batghroom fully equipped and clean. Breakfast is fine, the menue at the resturant is short, food not too impressive, but quality was ok. You won't have to bring your own alarm clock, as someone around you will have brought his and someone will have programmed the time you need. Room next to the eleavator can't be recommended, as a) you can it well in operation and b) all lively guests leaving the elevator can be well heard. It is not a downtown hotel, but if you leave the taxi and trun to the right you'll find taxis.

The location of the hotel from the metro station isn't great.It's a 12 min walk but because it's up on a hill, we find it quite tiring to walk back to the hotel after a long day of exploring the city. The rooms are clean but i hated the wall of the bathroom. felt like a prison wall to me. It's grey ,dull and there's no tiles on the wall but just cement? I am not fussy when it come to hotel. As long as it's clean and comfortable, i am happy! The worst thing of the hotel is they don't change your bedsheets everyday.they only change the sheets every 2 days. Even if you ask them to change it, they refuse too! Apparently it's their hotel policy and they didn't even listed on their website nor in their room. I only found out they didn't change my sheets when i accidently spill a lil bit of my eyeliner on the bed ! (how disgusting rite?) this incident really put me off and i would never stay in this hotel again even though it's slightly cheaper!", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "tuoberg", "ReviewID": "UR64742223", "Content": "Good but not better than that.
