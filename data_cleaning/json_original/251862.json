We only stayed one night which was a good thing...I have allergies and this place is a musty old hotel that is in desperate need of updates - carpeting old, outdated furniture, upholstery, bedspreads...everything needs attention. Slept with window open to air out room. The staff was nice - but that does not account for a price that was competitive if not more than nicer places in the area.

The staff were actually very friendly and nice and down to earth (translation: local twenty-something types with a somewhat laid back attitude, plus the parent-like managers). Reservations can be made online and it's all convenient. They also still use room keys which is a nice, classic touch. It's a little outdated with the tube TV, simple decor and bedding but it's not what I'd call shabby. Just simple. For example, our king room was spacious and equipped with a tiny kitchenette (stove! microwave! fridge! sink! very 70's!) but it didn't have a duvet on the bed, plush pillows or a comfy armchair. (There was a table with 3 sitting chairs, bench, closet, pullout ironing board in the room, iron, hairdryer. Make sure you request a room on \"the quiet side\" which means away from the pool area where people can hang out into the evening.) When my hubs and I stay up in Wine Country we're usually prepared to spend at least $200-250 per night + hotel taxes. Our usual place wasn't available (Indian Springs Resort and Spa), so we had to check out something new. We weren't disappointed in the John Muir as mainly a place to crash, get ready for the semi-formal wedding we were attending and spend just a little downtime before and after. A very reasonable deal for the Napa Valley considering Wine Country premium costs. This is perfect for adults who will be too busy hiking, wine tasting, dining out and shopping (and want to spend their $$$ on that rather than a hotel room). Or, a decent choice for posse on a budget (it's right off the highway with cheap eats nearby) who want to chill and don't mind the well-attended but dated atmosphere. The good thing is in California, stuff is slow to decay... I would recommend this place to friends that just needs a simple room versus a romantic high end hideaway.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pass1421", "Title": "\u201cYikes!
