The hotel was in our view excellent. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The room temperature can be controlled from the reception desk if you are too hot or cold. We didn't use the bar or the restaurant and therefore have no comment. The area is residential but not as sometimes stated shabby. Nor is it in any way sinister. The breakfast was fine, but with Nescaf\u00e9 from a machine supposedly Americano. British tourists really must get over this issue with tea. Why in the world should Italian hotels take us as their norm? The nearby restaurant Da Michele is excellent quality and, as one might expect from a smart place, not cheap, although the wine list is not at all pricey and offers some good bargains. We never ate at the pizzeria but by all accounts it was fine for the price. The metro is indeed 10-15 minutes from the hotel and gets into Rome quite quickly. The Colosseo stop is a little to the east, but Rome's centre is not big. The 'uphill' walk on the way back is very far from arduous and is not to our knowledge prone to extreme criminality. Should the hotel or the tour company have insisted on the district being flattened out? The 715 bus is convenient but not quick. It does after all serve local people who have the right to exist. Other buses in the centre can take you to the north end of the Corso. You just have to sus the system as in all major cities. If you want to stay in the centre, either you will have a less good hotel, or you will pay a lot more.

Often I just took my time walking to the station as there were shops and department stores on the way. Location wasn't a problem, if we had been staying at a hotel nearer the centre the cost would have been considerably more!! The hotel was modern and clean. I cannot fault our room. We were towards the back of the hotel overlooking apartments and the church nearby...the church was so close we could hear the organ playing at mass. We had a spacious balcony; it would have been nice to had some chairs to sit out on. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant in the evening but rather went to the nearby 'Michele's'. Good restaurant (although limited choice for vegetarians). Note that you may have to pre book here especially if there are a couple of tour groups at the hotel. Breakfast was fine, lots of choice. The usual- cereals, yoghurts, pastries/cakes, scrambled egg, bacon. Tea/coffee, juice. Sometimes you have to wait a couple of minutes for the staff to replenish but it wasn't a problem.

Be warned that the walk back in the dark from the metro is not well lit and you will walk quickly! The reception area is modern and spacious and the staff are very helpful and all seem to speak English. The dining area is also comfortable and modern, the breakfast was plentiful and varied too. My only criticism is that being in Italy tea making facilities are poor with tea bag and water being on one side, milk being on the other and sugar on your table. Why do they not understand tea pots? We did not have an evening meal because it was expensive but others in our party did and were very pleased. Rooms are excellent, quality furniture and fittings, good bathrooms with ceramic bath and excellent shower. Well lit, large mirrors too. Large comfortable bed, air conditioning, fridge with complimentary water, sweets every day, tv with English channels and deep carpets. I did not want to leave! Staff, especially on reception, were really helpful and friendly. Taxis are available in minutes and info is provided on bus and metro times too. The local area is very inner city, jammed with parked vehicles and rubbish strewn everywhere, scary at night but I guess this is Italy! There are two restaurants nearby of note; Michelles which is classy, quality Italian withh good food and wine with a price to match, or Pasta and Pommodora which is a locals Pizzeria with fixed price menus and you are guarateed not to leave hungry. Both less than 5 minutes well lit walk away. So on the whole a great hotel and I reccomend it. Less than 30 mins drive from Fiumicino Airport too. All the facilities you could need.

I also need affordable and wanted to be able to take public transit. This was the only hotel (on those hotel sites) that really fit the bill and was affordable. Location: It's close in, but well outside the historic corridor. If you're plans demand a visit to St Paul's outside the walls, then this is your hotel. It's a long walk to the metro, but again... 10 lbs! So I walked to the metro station then could zip around the city. I failed bus 101, and just stuck with the metro. The hotel is a nice business class hotel and \"congress\" center. Well it turns out the gym is a real neighborhood fitness center (co-located in the hotel).

We had one evening meal at the Oly and it was quite good and served in a professional manner. The room was reasonable and clean, but perhaps a little smaller than we were led to believe. Our bathroom facilities were reasonable, although it did take a while for the bath to fill. A number of our fellow travellers, however, did experience some problems with both the toilet and bath.

All these places had good reports from our group although the Michele was thought to be a bit expensive. The food in the hotel was poor. Breakfast was what you would expect when it is described as \"continental\" but that does not excuse the \"orange \" juice that was a purple pink colour and tasted of water, nor the eggs which were not just hard boiled but refrigerated and the coffee machine broke down. The croissants were the best things there. Almost all of us opted to eat in the hotel the first night - the set meal was 30 euros. I suppose it was not too bad but very ... s.l.o.w. Most people went out the next night but we stayed in and wished we hadn't. The pasta was cold and tasteless, the main came with \"salad\" which turned out to be wet, refrigerated green beans, served late. This meal too was very slow and that was strange with so few people to serve. We sat there for about three and a half hours, taking advantage of the free wine. If the meal had been better and efficiently served we would not have had so much. We heard that one group had refused to sign for the meal. We complained to the manager as we were leaving and he said he thought it was good value for money. No, it was not! We asked if anyone else had complained and he said, rather revealingly, \"Not this morning!\" We didn't like the bar, it is below ground and does not have a relaxing atmosphere, being all black polished surfaces with hardly any chairs, not the sort of place you would want to spend any time at all, in fact it was bleak.

I had to ask three times and waited half an hour. The food was mediocre at best. The roast potatos were chips so hard that you could break your teeth on them and the salad did not arrive until we had all finished. My wife left most of hers.

Many of the other hotels in Rome are a lot more expensive, however an many cases you are paying for location rather than service.

My wife and I decided to celebrate our first and special anniversary in Rome, Italy. We booked our flight and Hotel online thru Expeida and although we read the travelers reviews to be moderately low about Oly Hotel we decided to give it try. Let me mention that my wife and I are world travelers (Platinum airline mileage members) and we have stayed in many hotels all around the world. The Oly Hotel by far is the worse experience we have EVER had. I like to remind you that Oly Hotel ranks itself to be a 4 star hotel!!! And their base price for two people is $291.00 Euros. They located 20 kilometers away from Rome City Center and the closet metro station (sao paula basilica) to the Hotel is 25 ~ 30 minutes unsafe walk from the Hotel. Oly Hotel located in a very unsafe surrounding neighborhood with prostitutes walking around and drug deal takes place in the side walk. We arrived at mid-night in Rome after a very long 20 hour flight and train ride. To start we had to stay 1 hour for the Hotel manager to find us a key to the room. Even though we had requested a queen bed-Non-Smoking room, the hotel manager provided us double smoking room with two separate beds and a broken window without a lock. We asked if we could change the room, so he put us in another room with a broken door and window! We asked to change the room again for the third time; he put us in smaller smoking room with two separate beds with a both broken door-lock and broken in-room safe. Lastly, he suggested that we should change our room the next day, cuz he did not have a clean room available...as if we had nothing better to do to stay around the Hotel the next day for a clean room. What concerned us the most was the broken lock to our room. The cleaning people are extremely Rude and less than helpful. You basically have to ask for everything:\u201d Shampoo, clean towels, and even request them to change the sheets- we complained once to the maids to leave our hotel room door close after they were done, they got pissed off and decided not to CLEAN OUT ROOM the next day or provide us clean towels that we asked numerously. The breakfast is lousy, as well. The bread was old and moldy. The fruits are rotten, the ham and cheese which suppose to be the highlight of the meal are warm smelly and tasteless/scary to eat. The coffee machine is a generic coffee-maker with usually a long line in the morning. You\u2019re lucky to get anything to eat after 9:00 am!! even though the breakfast is suppose to end at 10:00. So, save yourself to asking for refill on anything because it\u2019s impossible to get anything replenished. We decided to complain to the Morning manager \u201cJulio\u201d about the housekeeping not changing our sheets. He looked at our face straight saying he did not believe the housekeeping didn\u2019t do their job. It felt like they were all in it together. The front desk attendants are useless and rude and DO NOT TRUST their recommendation on tours they suggest. Most tours they offer are overpriced and the Hotel gets some kick-back out of it. You can go to and tourist information anywhere and get a better deal. We are going to write to the Italian Hotel/tourist bureau about our experience. We like to ask Expedia to not refer them on their website.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cEasy transport into Rome\u201d", "Author": "LizNorthampton", "ReviewID": "UR7276696", "Content": "This is a fairly comfortable hotel with a good bus service from across the road into the centre of Rome.Metro about 15 minutes walk-not so good on your return after a heavy day's sightseeing.
