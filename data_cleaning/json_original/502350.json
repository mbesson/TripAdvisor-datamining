Hotel management is watching all the corridors via CCTV so I doubt they may be watching or listening the rooms as well. If you are a male, it is forbidden to visit the room of a female guest and a female can not visit you at your room as well (measures against prostitution) In my room there was no space between the toilet and shower cabin so I could sit only wit h 90 degrees angle - very uncomfortable. I could not sleep all night, I would better walk on the streets of istanbul till morning than staying in this hotel", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cluj-Napoca, Romania", "Title": "\u201cDirty rooms and a little strange stuff\u201d", "Author": "RedRoseRo", "ReviewID": "UR22916795", "Content": "We were staying in Beyaz Kugu hotel, me and my friends, we knew it's a three stars hotel, but we couldn't believe our eyes when we saw that dirty windows...we even couldn't look outside. The room was also not very clean, but the towels from bathroom were really white and good smelling. And the bathroom was ok too. The breakfast was poor, but we couldn't expect too much anyway. And it was not very cheap as we expected. The location was perfect, near major touristic attractions. The other guests from hotel were very bizarre, we started to be afraid, but finally nothing happened. The stuff from hotel acted also strange, the telephone from room rang often, but they didn't speak, maybe they wanted to check if we are in room, and this because we were girls. I also had the impression that they survey us with cameras which i could see to every floor. We decided that it was a very strange hotel and we will not come back. The last day to hotel was good because they helped us with the taxi and they wake up us in the mornig for catching the plane, but they didn't speak too much english, just turkish, we decided that they could be also friendly in the end.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Beyaz Kugu", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d502350-Reviews-Hotel_Beyaz_Kugu-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$75 - $105*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gencturk cad. no:60</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "502350", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2d/56/2d56549616239234aa31700deb3f11993large.jpg"}}
