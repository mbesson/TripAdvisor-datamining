We arrived at the hotel at noon but we couldnt check in till evening. They said we should come back later. And you never see somebody at the reception. You must go to the restaurant next to hotel and find somebody there who would help you. They dont care about customers. Rooms are dirty and very small. The bed they give as ' double bed ' is very small, it's like a single bed. The breakfast they provide is very little. Just 4 little slice of bread, one very small butter and little jam and coffee/ tea. And they dont provide much milk. I booked this hotel on booking.com and the photos they show there has nothing to do with the hotel. It's completely different. We've been cheated. The photos look nice and that was one of the reasons we chose to stay in this hotel. But the reality is different.

The hotel is not a five stars but the most important is that it's quiet, the room was very clean, with en suite, comfortable and the staff absolutely great.

So we were not off to a pleasant start at the A to Z Hotel. Upon entering our room, the floors were covered in stains of a questionable nature, there were toenail clipping on the floor, the room reeked of fried chicken (thanks to the chicken shop, read breakfast room next door adjacent to the room). On top of this we discovered 17 \"Noodle Snack\" brand Pot Noodles hidden in a drawer, along with 7 Energy drinks. Clearly this room was not cleaned prior to us staying in it. It's in a bad location far away from central London. This was a good weekend spoiled by a terrible choice in hotel. Do not make the same mistake I did.

I'd booked a single, but was put in a double room. It wasn't huge, but if you were a couple or pair just looking for a place to stay, it was big enough. The room had clearly been refurbished recently; the walls were clean, bar a few scuffmarks, obviously down to being bashed by luggage; the carpet had a couple of flecks on it, but that was all. The bathroom (ensuite) was extremely small, butr I'd say it was spotless. The grouting between the floor tiles was a tad discoloured, but, well, anyone who has ever tried to keep a bathroom looking nice knows it's impossible to keep grouting brilliant white. The bathroom had toilet paper and guest soaps, and two bright white towels. As for the room, well, I had a TV (even if I couldn't get the remote control to work), a central light, each red had its own light, controlled by a switch easily within reach of the bed, a fan and a radiator. And, boy, did that radiator work, perhaps a little too well, as I was actually uncomfortably hot sometimes. Some kind of chair that would have allowed me to use the dressing table as a desk would have been good, ditto some kind of bedside table. I did find one stain on one of the bed covers but it was a stain, as in dyed by something that had been spilled on it many washes ago, not actual dirt or spilled food; the covers did look grotty from a distance, but they were nylon or polyster, both of which pill badly. The sheets were obviously brand new and freshly laundered. The big problem with the room was that it was right on the road, and extremely noisy all night, and I could have done without the floodlight seemingly directed at my window as well. On my first morning I went down for breakfast at 8.45am, and found a couple of disgruntled people waiting to be let into the 'breakfast room' - ie the takeaway next door - and although the staff arrived and started setting up, it didn't look too exciting, so I gave it a miss; I didn't bother going down the following morning becase I'd got my own supplies in, so I can't comment on what it was actually like. Apart from the proximity to the road - I suppose you can always ask for a room at the back - the other major difficulty is that it's a bit of a trek from the tube and train stations. But if you don't mind walking, and are prepared to risk missing your breakfast or porovide your own, this really is a good value place to stay.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cThe word dump doesn't describe how trulyawful this place is.\u201d", "Author": "NailbiterEngland", "ReviewID": "UR54950951", "Content": "Wasn't expecting much at this price.

The only other option was to walk 15 min down the road to Action Town station. The rooms were small and the bathroom was even smaller. There needs to be a shower mat as when your taking a shower water goes everywhere. They only gave us half a toilet roll for three days. The mattresses on the beds need to be thrown out ... we could feel the springs and it was three very bad nights sleep. The sheets were clean but there was only a very thin blanket on the beds which meant my father ended up sleeping in his clothes as it was so cold.

The room was very dirty: the carpet with hairs and dirt, the walls and the old bedspreads with unidentified stains. Only sheets and towels was good. Broken and insecure door. Views were blocked by the bright sign of the hostel. Under our window, a shelf with garbage and used underwear. A lot of noises at the street, we had to buy earplugs to be able to sleep. The small bathroom was horrible, to take a simple shower was an odyssey. Showerhead was fixed and very high, the watter keep falling far and to be under the watter I had to go beside the toilet. Service was not very good, two days they gave us clean towels and only one day of seven they made our beds. Our garbage cube wasn't cleaned any day. Breakfast was in a kebab communicated with the hostel by a backdoor. To arrive, you have to go by one corridor with a full of towels and dirty sheets on the floor. Breakfast was served on the same kebab with the removed shutters. Wasn't juice, but it was water with taste of orange, cofee or tea, two toasted per person, a bit of marmelade and a misery of butter.
