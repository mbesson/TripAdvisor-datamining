Had I travelled alone then my review would have been more positive as on the whole it was good value for money.

There is a reason it is way cheaper than other Mercure hotels in London. It not feels like a Mercure at all. Would be more honestly if they re-brand it as Ibis. But this not means it is a bad hotel. In fact it is quite good with comfy beds, nice shower with plenty of hot water, nice TV with premium channels and outstanding location. The room I had stayed was quite big with a king size bed, good sized bathroom and bathtub. It was recently refurbished so the room itself felt like brand new but the bathroom have a tired look with some stains from the age but nothing that would bother me. In the room you will find the usual: safe, ironing facilities, kettle, coffee and tea. In the bathroom toiletries as soap, shampoo, shower gel, etc. Polite staff but not really proactive. But it is not a problem for me. Location is superb. Close to Earls Court tube you can reach anywhere in London easily. Also if you are coming from Heatrow this tube station is part of Piccadilly Line. So you can travel from the airport terminals 1,2,3 and 5 to the hotel without change lines, what is very convenient. Also not far you have the Gloucester Rd Tube and High Kensington St Tube besides several buses. Speaking in High Kensington St, it is 10 min walk distance from hotel. Also It is a few stations away from Westfield London. So if your thing is shopping this is a good hotel to stay. Yet related with location, nearby you will find a Sainsbury (one block away) and a Waitrose (more less 10 min walk) where you can buy groceries, sandwiches, etc. Also inside Sainsbury there is a Starbucks but I recommend the coffee from the Coffee Republic in the hotel lobby. it's way better than Starbucks and the price is right. Nearby the hotel you also will find several restaurants of Thay, Indian, Italian and several other cousines and some pubs. I recommend the King's Head for pub. Nice atmosphere, nice prices and no attitude. The brand Mercure may misleaded my expectations but it is in fact a good value for money in London. A huge downside is the charge of 20 pounds for 24 hours internet access. If you need internet don't buy it and maybe these chains stop to charge for something that should be part of the deal. Just go to a mobile phone store and buy a pay as you go SIM card. With 10 pounds I got a T-Mobile SIM with all the internet I needed in my mobile with possibility to use it in other devices. I would recommend this hotel to friends.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cNot up to Mercure usual standard\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124278956", "Content": "Having been patronized Mercure/Accorhotel for yrs, never had such bad experience.

Unfortunately, I had not realised (as another reviewer has since pointed out) that it was simply an old hotel that had been given a lick of paint and rebranded. There was nothing really awful about it, but nothing much to recommend it, either. The one word which springs to mind about the room is \"TINY\". The bed was very small (OK for one person, but I would not have wanted to share it with my husband), with only a tiny gap at the foot end to get round it. The desk was barely wide enough for the television that stood on it - certainly no room for working. The safe, predictably, wasn't big enough for my laptop, and was also up above my head, which made it difficult to check that I had taken everything out of it.

I recently stayed at the Quality Inn in Kensington and although the trip to London was great, the hotel stay was awful. I booked through a major airline vacation package and searched high and low for a room that included free internet, which this one did. I should have taken a screen print of that screen saying free internet because when I got to the hotel the receptionist said this was not true. She told me it was my problem to solve through whoever the airline contracted through. She was rude. So I ended up having to purchase their internet service to contact the airline who responded that indeed I was correct. I took my laptop to her to show her the email and still there was no comment, not a please forward this email to me so I can take care of this and follow up for you. She just said oh. Upon checking out my bill reflected the internet charge had been removed which the airline said they would try and accomplish, if not they would reimburse me upon my return. I asked the desk attended for a copy of my bill so I had evidence I indeed owed zero, he wouldn't give it to me, said it was against policy so now if there is a charge I have nothing to prove charges were supposed to be removed. I have never been to a hotel where upon checkout they wouldn't give me a copy of my bill even if I had prepaid. As for the room, thinnest walls ever. We heard everything from neighbors as though there were no walls at all. Toilet - I realize toilets are different in London but never was I required to lift the lid forcing water to fill up so there was pressure to flush. I complained for 3 days to which they responded they would take care of and adjust, then I just gave up and considered having to manually force the toilet to flush was just another part of this stay. Breakfast - continental breakfast was included in our room rate. They served the exact same thing each day and when we sat down we were reminded by the staff we were only allowed to have cold food. I didn't want their hot food which did not look good, but there is a way of saying where the continental food was located vs 'your room rate only allows cold food'.

Upon arrival we were met by a very surly \"receptionist\" who needed to brush up on his customer service skills. We were asked to leave a \u00c2\u00a320 deposit - despite having already paid up front for the room. When we asked what this deposit was for, the reply was \"for the room\". We explained that we had already paid for the room and he told us that it was to cover any \"extras\". When we asked what extras - he said that it was for the use of the fridge or mini bar . We paid the \u00c2\u00a320 deposit and then found that we had neither of these facilities in our room! The room itself was extremely small and even had an adjoining door to the next bedroom. This was of course locked but it was rather unexepected. We had requested a \"quiet room\" but were situated next to the lift and the noise from the adjoining room late at night and in the early hours was also unexpected. Whilst the breakfast was adequate, it was not what we would expect to receive from a 4* establishment - the first morning it was cold infact. Upon being seated another uninterested, clearly bored younger member of staff placed a pot of tea on our table - without asking if we would prefer coffee. We didn't get any toast offered and had to request toast twice before it finally appeared 15 minutes later. Our request for coffee was also treated in a similar way and we then had to go and find a cup ourselves! We were fortunate to have arrived early for breakfast, as other hotel guests were queuing for some time before they could eat. There are insufficient tables when the hotel is full, for everyone to eat at the same time. Efforts have evidently been made to modernise the hotel and we cannot fault the cleanliness of it.

Hash Browns sitting in 2 inch of water? If you want poached or fried egg then dont bother asking the waitress, they have to request it and it took 20 minutes for me to receive a fried egg. You are seated and get given a rack of cold toast, a drink with the similar resembalance to coffee but tasted foul. There was a bread basket there which was like a vending machine, whatever was at the bottom you got, imagine this, croissants, white bread, wholemeal bread & bagels all mixed together in a basket, the croissant I got was flat and after taking a bite I am very lucky to still have my teeth.

We booked into our room which, although was laughably small, was clean. Dropped our bags and went out. On returning after 11pm, we discovered the toilet didn't flush properly and that the bed springs made ridges in the mattress pushing into our back when lying down. Also only 1 flat pillow per person on the bed. We called Reception to complain and asked if it is possible to move to another room with a better bed. The night porter informed me that he was busy running the night audit and will call back in 20 minutes as he couldn't help me at this time. 15 minutes later I had to call him again. He said that he did not have a similar double room but could show us a compact double or else a twin. We asked to see both. We ended up seeing 4 different rooms, all of which had equally uncomfortable beds and burnt smelling towels. We wanted to check out immediately and asked for a refund. The night porter said that he could not do that. When we asked to speak to a manager we were told we could speak to him in the morning only. At this time it was already after 12.30 at night. It was clear that he couldn't/wouldn't do anything for us. We ended up taking cushions from the couches in the lobby to make our own bed which was much more comfortable than the mattress on the bed. When speaking to the Front Office Manager the next morning, he couldn't do anything either as it was a pre-paid rate. We asked again to speak to a manager. He managed to get an area manager on the phone and explained our situasion. When we spoke to the manager he said he will do his best to sort a refund out for us but would call us back later that day with an answer. We checked out immediately. We never received a call back at all. We did receive an e-mail the following day from him to say that they never had complaints about tha mattresses but will refund us one night.

I explained this was unacceptable to us. We had only booked the hotel for its central London location (as I had an appointment in the city in the next morning), and it wasn't exactly what you would call cheap! Wimbledon was hardly the central-London location we had paid for! I asked why no one had phoned us to inform us of the supposed 'computer problem' earlier, and no explanation was forthcoming. Whilst we were stood there trying to get our head around the disaster, others were checking in without a problem! We were extra frustrated as we had just spent an hour trying to find the supposedly 'close' NCP car park in order to park our car nearby. (One of the other main reasons I booked the hotel was because it had been advertised on several websites that it has its own car park - beware! It doesn't anymore! It will refer you to the Mariott's car park across the road, which is really tiny and you'll be lucky to get a space...) To cut a long story short - we had a manager down to address our complaint further... (been travelling for 7 hours at this point, and trying to check in for around an hour too!)and, after a long debate, they magicially came up with a room with us for the Friday night. Funny that, considering the hotel was 'full'. It wasn't great - very small room indeed as others on tripadvsior have warned of, but it just about did us as we were pretty desperate at this point to be given any room!! They still maintained they couldn't put us up on the Saturday night, despite the fact I had booked and paid for this in advance, so we ended up having to cut our trip short and come home early. It completely ruined what was supposed to be a nice weekend break in the city. We were promised a full refund (for both nights) which seemed reasonable. However, a week later and my credit card has still not been refunded.

The QCH is a great compromise and I have stayed there, mostly for business, for a few years now. It is a fairly modern property with everything you might want in a small modern hotel including an iron in every room. Free Wifi is also provided so thats a big plus for me. Some rooms are pretty tight but, as I was staying there with my wife for 6 nights, I requested a larger version. Room 206 fitted the bill perfectly. The only downside, and we coped fine with this, was the bed was two singles put together. Normally that is OK but one was really hard and the other semi-soft, so you fell down a minor cliff if moving from one to another. Also the staff, by and large, were very friendly and helpful, patrticularly in the breakfast room. Our \"deal\" included a continental breakfast and I'd stick to that in the future also. As for location, you just can't beat this place. Five minute walk to Earls Court tube station. Number 24 bus at the door to Baker Street Station, and busy Cromwell Road outside full of black cabs. Also a 24 hour sainsbury's supermarket virtually next door in case you need anything. My tips would be to buy an Oyster travel card at the station as soon as you get there which works on trains and buses. When you are leaving you can cash them back in for all moneys remaining. This one act will save you heaps of time and frustration. Local restaraunts include \"The Little French restaraunt\", on the shortcut walk to the tube, and Bistro Benitos on Earls Court Road. Both very reasonable. The first with a set price GBP 9.95 3 course menu. Recommend the Lamb Wellington (not very French). At Benitos a massive menu at a family run business since 1979, recommend the King Prawns in Filo starter.

You can purchase a card that will cover the entire city or only certain sections, but as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from previous trips, Zone 1 is where ALL the major tourist attractions are located. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the mistake of buying a more expensive travel card than what you really need. We booked into the Quality Crown Hotel Kensington because of the cost, easy access to the Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court Tube Station and because we trust/use Choice Hotel chains extensively. [Another word of advice is about Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court Tube Station itself. It has two entrances/exits and therefore you have to choose wisely which one to use.] We stayed for about a week in August 2003. The hotel is very close to Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, The Royal Albert Hall, Prince Albert Memorial, the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the general area of the tube station are a large number of chain restaurants. You shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any difficulty in finding an eating establishment that pleases you. We would also strongly recommend Dall \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Artista Restaurant located at 243 Old Brompton Road. It is a small family owned/operated Italian restaurant. We had stayed in the Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court area in the past due to the large number of gay establishments in the general area. This facility is air conditioned, which is a great benefit at certain times of the year. We had breakfast included in our booking and were never disappointed in the variety on offer. There was a safe in our room which was large enough to store everything we wanted. The facility was very clean and the staff very helpful/friendly. Since our trip in 2003, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been back. We decided not to stay at this hotel because of its distance from the main attractions of London we wanted to see most.

We came back to the hotel and had a beer or two at the Cafe in the lobby. The staff (other then the head manager) is largely Eastern European, but that didn't bother us. We actually had a chance to speak to the bar tender awhile about his background & it was interesting. Some of the staff are not fully proficient in English, but if you are patient & speak slowly they will take care of you. Our room was located on the 4th floor facing the street. It was large by European standards. It was one of the rooms that had been renovated. We had about 2 feet around each side of our bed, a large closet, a safe, and a bathroom. The bathroom was clean and well-kept. (and had some extra soap and etc...) The only downside to the room is that you can hear everything next door & in the hallway. So if you are saying something you don't want everyone to hear, then speak softly! Our room was serviced everyday and we had no complaints. Our goods got stuck in the safe so we had to call and get someone to help us out. A young lady arrived right away and helped us out, so it wasn't a problem. I do, however, maintain that the safe was dysfunctional. Breakfast was very good. Somedays we had the regular continental, and other days we had the full-english breakfast. (you have to pay for the full-english breakfast) We found the food fresh...and especially enjoyed the cheeses that were set out. Unfortunately, somedays it became very crowded in the hotel during this time of day! My advice is arrive as early as you can for breakfast so you don't end up being squashed among others while eating! We didn't have any problems with the elevator (\"lift\" as they call it) while we were there. Everyone was pretty helpful when we needed directions & etc.. around London. The best part about the hotel is that it is located near many restaurants (Thai, Italian, etc...). We ate somewhere new everyday. It's also conveniently close to an internet cafe in case you need to write emails home or anything. Overall, it was a good experience.

Sure, the rooms are smaller than hotels in America, but I would not say they were too small. There was enough room for our 2 big suitcases and for us to walk around. Check in and check out both went smoothly and quickly. As for the continental breakfast, we only made it up once. It was fine. It was free.

My experiences were OK then, so I booked this hotel (single room) for 4 nights for a business occasion. As prior reviewers indicate, the hotel has a good location (Kensington near underground station Gloucester road) and the renovation ensured that the room (despite small) was well maintained and clean. However, there were some definite downsides to this hotel. An odd feature of this hotel is that every room besides a door to the hallway also has a room to the neighbouring room. The door is closed (so you do not have to be afraid for unwanted visits) but is not very well isolated with respect to noise. So if a couple in the neigbouring room is talking with each other, or one of them is coughing, it sounds like they are doing this in your own room. Basically, noise is a problem in this hotel (not only for me, but also for a collegae who accompenied me during this trip). The next issue is breakfast. My secretary ordered this hotel through internet and also ordered breakfast. Breakfast is divided in a small section that they label to be continental breakfast (limited number of bread, one kind of cheese, one kind of ham, some jam, all very basic) and english breakfast (eggs, sausages, etc.). Beware of the fact that when you order breakfast, it could be - as in my case - that you have only subscribed to the continental version and not the english version. So basically you have to pay about 5 pounds extra for each breakfast to be able to also enjoy the english breakfast (which you might really need considering the very basic choice available at the continental breakfast). But my main concern is the poor (!!!!!) customer service from the (mainly east-european) staff. Some examples: At the first morning we enjoyed both the continental and english breakfast until some waiter came to our table and made us very clear that we were not entitled to the english breakfast and therefore we had to pay. It was not so much the content of the message, but the schoolteacher kind of way this was announced to us. Another example, most items at breakfast are out-of-stock at a certain moment and questions whether they had some jam, cheese or brown bread were not adequately answered (basically, they looked at you, murmled something that they would check without ever returning) or when the breakfast room was full, they just said that you should try it again later. But the most striking example was when we checked out: they added a bottle of champagne to our bill. As we replied that we did not order any champagne, their reply was: you did and they showed a form with my room number with a signature that was not mine. I tried to convince them that there was an error made but he looked not even remotely interested and replied that he was not interested in arguing with me and I had to pay.

I spent countless hours reviewing hotels and locations and finally decided the Country Inn would do because it had a/c, an elevator and was within walking distance with heavy luggage of the Gloucester tube. We arrived at the hotel around 11 a.m. and did not expect to be able to check in but wanted to leave the luggage. The man looked up the reservation and said the room was not ready but we could check the bags and come back at 2:00. So we left and went sightseeing and came back around 5:00. The receptionist them informed us there were no more rooms available and they had found us a room at another hotel in Paddington. Needless to say, I freaked out after choosing this hotel for its location. Paddington is about a 20 minute taxi ride from Kensington and also requires multiple train changes to get to Heathrow. the receptionist was such a [-] and totally did not care about us making it to the airport in the morning. While we were standing there arguing with her, another British man checked in and got his room! I could not believe it. I think we were given such poor service because we are Americans. Anyway, after insisting that another hotel would not do and I could not be carrying my luggage all over London, she called a taxi to take us to the Quality Inn in Paddington. In the morning they were supposed to have arranged a cab to take us back to the Gloucester tube station in Kensington which was not done and we had to wait 30 minutes for the cab, meanwhile worrying we would miss our plane. And the staff was so bad they gave us a big f-you and did not call us with the wake up call! Thak God I had brought my alarm clock and set it. There is no alarm clock in the room. So, to say we had an awful experience at the Country Inn would be an understatement. They were too cheap to put us up somewhere in Kensington and expected us to get a cab or take the tube across town with our luggage.

It didn't help much that the conversation was about the lousy management, angry guests, how guests didn't understand that the staff weren't to blame for all the problems (again, blame the management!), etc. I spent a little bit of time in the bar every night, and this happened several times. On one occasion the receptionist even came over to my table and gave me a speech about all the problems, again blaming the management. I have never experienced anything like this before. Why would Country Inn & Suites even want to put their logo and name on this hotel??! It beats me. Apart from the 'lively' lobby, the elevator wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working (and from what I heard, hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been for quite some time) and I was told to use the staff elevator. My room was clean and OK, but nothing special. Summing up, I guess the hotel was nice enough considering that I didn't pay all that much. At least not for London and this particular area. That being said, I doubt I will stay there again. For the same rate you can get a better room and much better service at other hotels in the area.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Md", "Title": "\u201cAdequate\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4252843", "Content": "We stayed here for our first trip to London.

(The young man who helped us with our luggage - since the lift was out-of-order - was pleasant) We had booked a non-smoking room and were first assigned to a smoking room.

Continental breakfast was included in the price but each morning we had to ask someone to go get more bowls for cereal, more milk, or glasses for juice for the buffet - they were always out of something.

If you are flying into London via Heathrow the Country Inn & Suites will take you 20 to 30 minutes by train to get to the either Earls Court or Gloucester station. Both stations are approximately 3 blocks away from the hotel but in opposite directions. Gloucester station is the stop beyond Earls Court station but it has elevators you can use to get up to street level. We saw elevators at Earls Court but they only seemed accessible from street level... we could never figure out how to get on them when we were getting off the train. Either way plan to walk several blocks to get to the Country Inn and Suites. If you are mobile or your bags have wheels it is not too far. We found the staff at the hotel to be very accommodating. One thing that you need to be aware of before you arrive is that check in is at 11 am. If you arrive on a morning flight you will need to check your bags behind the desk prior to being allowed to check in. We found that this was not a real problem and if anything it forced us to stay up and do some exploring in the surrounding areas. Kensington palace is only a 20 minute walk away as is Albert Hall and other attractions within Hyde Park. Harrods is a 30 minute walk up Cromwell road. There is also a Starbucks (double the price we pay over here) in the large grocery store a block and half to the east of the Country Inn and Suites. This place is definitely worth a stop if you are looking to stock up on munchies (even beer) or that sort of thing. We stayed on the third floor in the room at the end of the hall as you turn right off the elevator. The elevator is quite small and if you have never been on a european elevator before you will be in for a bit of a surprise... we found the elevators elsewhere in Europe to be even smaller. My wife and I were very happy with our room. It looked exactly like the photos we had seen prior to our arrival. The bathroom seemed small at first but looking back it was okay. You will get a kick out of the toilets. The water does not really swirl around when you flush... but there seems to be a great deal of water moving all at once when you decide to empty it. Word of warning, many of the bathtubs in europe are set six inches higher off the ground than you might be used to if you are visiting from North America. I remember almost falling flat on my face on several occasions but if anything this added to the experience. The beds are softer than we expected but they sure sleep well after walking all over London. There are only four or five television channels available (CNN Britain I think was one of them). Our room was always clean and we found that the cleaning staff took great care to make sure they did not try to bother you if you were in your room. One thing we learned during our stay is that not all rooms are the same. Some of the rooms have long hallways between the bathroom and sleeping area. There is a large seating area and a pub in the lobby. We never tried the breakfast but the restaurant look quite nice. I would stay in the Country Inn and Suites again if the opportunity ever presented itself. My wife and I were there the morning of the train bombings and we found that the Country Inn was a very accessible and safe place to stay under the circumstances.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cAwsome hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3809650", "Content": "Well there are no complaints for this hotel, here are all the things i liked.

This was my 6th trip to London and I stayed in that area before, so I knew pretty much what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the hotel as nice as it was. I usually stay in much more expensive hotels and this was just as good and in some cases better. When I checked in, I asked the Front Desk Clerk (very nicely) if I could possibly have a quite room. She replied, just as nicely, \"certainly\". Well, I think she must have given me the quietest room in the hotel. I didn't hear a sound the whole time I was there. I was between the stairwell and a utility closet, so that helped. The staff was efficient, the room was very small, but I expected this - this is very typical of Europe. I was by myself so it did not matter. The room was like new and very clean. The air conditioning worked perfectly. I was glad of that, because I was there during the heat wave.
