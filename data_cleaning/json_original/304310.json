Needless to say we were all looking forward to our trip to Barcelona immensely. Four of us arrived from Birmingham on a Thursday night approximately 11pm. to be greeted by the hotel porter who informed us that the hotel was full. We explained that we had made and paid for our reservations months ago. He explained that the computer system went down the day before and had lost all bookings. This was quite obviously a lie. He explained that he would have to try and find us a local hotel in the area for the night. He spent one hour on the phone ringing around but to no avail. Eventually he offered us a drink at the closed bar, no other staff in the hotel. He was very rude and adamant that this in fact was no fault of his. Finally at 1am. he contacted a sister hotel and found us two twin rooms, how convenient. We are still wondering why he didn't try them in the first place and it would of saved us two ours of an already stressful night. He explained that we get a taxi to the hotel and back to the original hotel, to keep the receipts and we would be reimbursed and that our rooms would be ready the next morning. The sister hotel was approx. 15mins. away by taxi, when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who had our keys ready. We took the lift to the fourth floor where our rooms were and when we got to the floor we founf that there were no lights on in the hallway, once the lift door was shut it was complete darkness. We had to use a mobile phone to find the room number. We came back down for a very well earned drink and explained about the lights, she had to bring us back up with a torch. 4* I don't think so. The next morning we got a taxi back to our original hotel Sansi Diputacio only to find that the rooms would not be ready until 3pm., this was 10am. At this point we have yet to see any of Barcelona, hang up our clothes or get settled. The receptionist then blamed the incident on the travel agency we booked it with which was nonsense. We couldn't understand why there were no rooms ready knowing that cleaning staff started at 7am. only to be told the staff were on a training course. At this point we just could not believe what was happening. We then explained that we needed to be reimbursed for the taxi journey. After much negotiation they agreed to pay for the taxi to the hotel the night before but not for the return journey as it was not company policy. At this point we felt it best to leave the hotel and go for a walk. When we eventually got in to our rooms we were told that we could not open the windows as it was against the law but the only problem was that the air conditioning was not working. The hotel was boiling. I cannot express enough how badly treated we were. I would never recommend this hotel chain to anybody if it was the last place on earth.

On arriving we were greeted by 3 members of staff, our cases were immediately taken from us and carried to our room for us as we checked in. A map was produced where one of the staff members pointed out where the hotel was and gave us information on where all the main attractions were and how to get to them. We were then taken to our room where the helpful staff member showed us how to work all the amenities. We were very pleasantly surprised at our room as we had expected to find no toiletries, no towels and broken windows from the reviews we had read. The rooms are lovely, if a little on the small side, all done in wood panelling. There was every toiletry imaginable in the bathroom, along with 4 large towels and a bathrobe and pair of slippers which I was very impressed with. The rooms were cleaned daily and we were even left a second robe and pair of slippers after the first day - we were also given fresh robes. I'm sure if you were looking for things to complain about then you could find something. There were a few tiles missing from the shower and the rooms could probably use a little more maintenance but overall I couldn't find fault with the place. The breakfasts were perhaps not the best I've ever had - there was not a huge variety but we always left with full stomachs. The staff were lovely, always making an effort to speak to you when you left or returned, asking how you enjoyed your day and helping you find places. I would advise that you take advantage of the Bus Turistic which is 21 euros for a 2 day pass and you can get on or off at all the major sights as often as you like (you can pick the bus up at Plaza de Catalunya) There is also an airport bus from just outside the airport that takes you directly to Plaza de Catalunya so the hotel is very conveniently located. We did find that eating out was a bit of a problem - most of the restuarants tend to be more cafe/bars where u sit at the bar and eat your food there. We had been looking forward to splashing out on some nice meals in restaurants. If you try further down La Rambla we found a few more places there. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend this hotel.

A small over-priced bar in the lobby. No restaurant except a rather average breakfast room. Room was the noisiest room I've ever stayed in & I've stayed in some very noisy places in my time! Even for a city hotel, noise was incredible. Sound insulation was non-existent, the club opposite generated loud noise some nights (not music but people in the street shouting and whistling as only over-exuberant young people & drunks can) and overnight deliveries to the bars nearby involved the dropping of many metal beer kegs and crates of bottles. Traffic noise until 3 or 4 am. There were occasional periods of comparative quiet between 5 & 6 am before the traffic started up again. In the bathroom (with its glass door!) you could hear the seagulls on the roof 6 floors above as well as every flush and emptying sink. The noises came down the service ducting. Noisy airconditioning too!

It is in a fantastic location being a short walk from Plaza de Catalunya and the Ramblas but still situated in a nice quiet area. We found the glass bathroom door quite amusing but it does give some privacy as it is patterned and does not look directly on to the main part of the room. It wasn't particularly luxurious for what I would have expected of a four-star but it was very clean, bright and modern. The staff were excellent. Most spoke English and were so helpful both in hotel matters and more general advice about the city. We were made to feel very welcome and one receptionist even took time to help me with my limited attempts at Catalan.", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem", "Title": "\u201cCareless and hostile management\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3999412", "Content": "Think twice before booking !

True having a glass bathroom door is a little odd but at least it was an amusing conversation piece. The air con for all 4 rooms we had worked perfectly well and the beds were extremely comfortable.
