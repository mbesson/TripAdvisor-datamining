The man at the reception desk was brusque and indifferent. He did not give us his name. Right away things did not get off to a good start. He yelled at my son for putting his backpack on the couch beside him. Fair enough, but he had to continue to berate him for having done so. After demanding two pieces of photo id, why I don't know, he suddenly became irate because there were 5 passports. He said we had only booked a room for four. I had booked all our hotels in Italy, always getting two rooms, but I had mistakenly thought I was renting a spacious quadruple family apartment which could have a cot added. He became more and more irritated because the copier wasn't working properly and he couldn't copy our passports. I explained that obviously we were wrong but could we rectify the situation by getting two rooms. He mumbled and grumbled, but said we still had to take the quad room. After much prodding he said he could give us a single for 140 euros. We agreed, however, we later checked online and found that the rate for this room, was between 96 and 120 euro. When we got into our rooms, they were swelteringly hot. The single room had a horrible mildew smell from the bathroom. The so called spacious family quad was just a normal room with 3 beds packed next to each other. We figured we would be out all day and we could handle this, however, the A/C wasn't working so we could not sleep. My wife went down to talk to them about the heat and it turns out they control it with a switch underneath their desk. I had booked this hotel because they said they had A/C. For a while it worked then it stopped. The kids couldn't sleep and the next morning we were tired and not at all rested. Unlike most of the reviews, we found the breakfast to be exactly as advertised. Nothing great, just a continental breakfast. The server, Antonella was very nice. The next night was also sweltering, with no A/C. When my wife went to talk to him, he insisted on checking out the room. Our kids were lying on the beds in only their shorts, totally lethargic. He declared it wasn't hot and then said he couldn't make the room cold enough to satisfy Canadians. Yeah, right, obviously he hasn't been to Toronto in the summer. I wanted to check the internet, he said it wasn't working. We had picked this place because it supposedly had A/C and internet. The next day my wife went to see him and told him we were leaving. He told her we couldn't. After much arguing she asked to speak to the owner. He told us that the owner, Roberto was unavailable. Then he said he was in Russia. When we continued to press, he was suddenly able to get him on the phone. We thought the guy we were dealing with was rude but he was nothing compared to Roberto. Within a minute of talking to him, he asked my wife was she really wanted, and when she said an air conditioned room, he replied, \"maybe you would like me to sprinkle rose petals on the ground where you walk\". My wife replied that she considered herself a nice and fair person, and as he didn't know her, his comment was unwarranted. They still insisted we couldn't leave, and then said if we did, they would charge our visa for the full four nights. We negotiated and settled reluctantly on paying for the third night in order to get out of the contract. So beware when you give them your visa, it cost us an additional 190 euros to leave but much as we hated having to pay this, it was worth it. Finally we could enjoy Rome. Out new hotel had real A/C and very pleasant staff. Roberto told my wife he couldn't care less about negative reviews as he had loyal repeat customers. Perhaps thats what keeps them going and explains why the reviews are so polarized, but why take a chance on getting terrible customer service when there are so many hotels that value your business. For the life of me, I can't understand why this hotel is not even further down the rating list. The next street over has the Hotel Lancelot and the Hotel Capo D'Africa, both would be wonderful alternatives. This location is excellent for the Colliseum and though most of the restaurants are tourist traps, there are a few gems.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "traveller423", "ReviewID": "UR33389625", "Content": "We just got back from Rome and a cruise.

As my wife is disabled I contacted the hotel beforehand and received a prompt reply from the Hotel Manager, Roberto. He was very helpful and upon our arrival assisted in every way. The Hotel is in an excellent location in the ancient part of Rome. From the reception, and throughout the small hotel, the decor and ambience is wonderful. The room was luxurious, with an excellent view of the Colosseum (see photos). The service was impeccable. The rooms were clean and very well presented, with fresh towels daily. Roberto and his staff were very helpful. Roberto has an excellent command of English and although the other staff could speak some English, being able to speak some Italian helped break the language barrier. The Staff even helped me try to get tickets to a concert at the Vatican, which I had been trying to get. They also recommended some places to visit and eat and these turned out to be good recommendations. Locally, the best place to eat was the 'Triclinium Ristorante' which was just around the corner from the Hotel Celio, on the via di Giovanni Laterano. We went there every morning for Coffee and to try our Italian on the locals. It was (is) poor but they appreciated it. So much so that one morning we found that our bill had been paid by a lady we had been talking too, Thank-you Suzanne! We also ate there a couple of evenings; their pizzas were quintessentially Italian, wonderful! To be honest I would avoid some of the other restaurants in the area, being close to the Colosseum is not an excuse for poor food quality. Rome is an incredible place, a chaotic fusion of Ancient, Renaissance and modern Italian life, which happens to work well. I would forget public transport and walk everywhere, there is so much to see in the back streets and behind the scenes. We found some lovely streets and Piazzas. Hotel Celio is a romantic and excellent place to stay in Rome. Thank you to Roberto & Nadine, for making our stay as easy and as wonderful as possible.

Breakfasts were basic, yoghurt and a croissant + coffee/tea in comparison with other equally priced hotels in Rome. The worst example came from the owner Roberto who was rude, unhelpful and keen to overcharge us at every event, lacking integrity and with no idea of hospitality or excellence in service levels - I can't honestly believe he is allowed to run this establishment and the Italian Tourist Board should investigate his practices!! If looking for a hotel in Rome, I'd suggest the Radisson SAS which at roughly the same prices as Celio is charging and three times the room size + great service it's superb in comparison!

As a three star hotel, the place lacks some of the services and large-scale facilities (e.g. restaurants, bars, conference facilities) found in higher class hotels, but more than makes up for it with an abundance of unique charm and character. We stayed in the Pompeian Suite on the top floor, which although pricey was absolutely beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The attention to detail in the floor and bathroom mosaics was lovely, and the room is also decorated with renaissance style paintings and canvasses. Our room had a separate lounge and two bathrooms which were both spacious. There was also a well-stocked mini bar (not too over the top price-wise). The suite also has three private roof terraces - one of which has a view of the Colliseum, and we loved coming back to sunbathe, chill out and enjoy a drink after a day's sight-seeing. There is also a public roof terrace for anyone staying at the hotel. There were quite a lot of stairs to walk up to our room, which could be a problem for some people, but the other rooms are located on the ground and first floors. The included continental breakfast is adequate but nothing special, served in a covered courtyard. We found the staff to be helpful and polite at all times. The location is ideal for exploring ancient Rome (Coliseum, Fora, Palatine Hill etc), but is otherwise a little further away from other tourist areas such as the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navonna etc. Personally we found it an advantage to be located away from the crowds in the Centro Storico, and nowhere was more than a 25 minute walk or so at the most. There are also quite a lot of nice non-touristy restaurants, bars and cafes within a few blocks of the hotel, as well as a supermarket and grocery store opposite. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Celio as a lovely memorable place to stay.

It is a long walk from the centro historico but this was probably a good thing considering the amount of pizza we were eating!

The Vatican is 30 minutes walk, the station is 25 minutes and all the other main attractions are within minutes. Even for non-walkers like myself and my wife it was easy to do so.
