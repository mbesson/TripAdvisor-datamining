After checking-in, the agent \"buzzes\" you into the central courtyard, where two levels of rooms surround a not-bad pool and spa. The agent advised me to take an upper level room, since the squeaking floors are noisy for those on the lower level. My room had a firm king-size bed adorned with the expected shiny synthetic bedspread. There was a table with two chairs, a small refrigerator and a wall-mount TV with a good-enough selection of cable channels... including HBO. The small bathroom featured a good-sized tiled shower with ample hot water and surprisingly good pressure--actually better than at the 5-star resort I had just come from.

The manager was very friendly; the motel is just a half-block from the Hollywood-Western Metro station (with a Starbucks on the corner), and it's a quick drive to most other points of interest. The bed was comfortable, and while the room was in need of a major rehab, it was clean and had all the basics I needed... and all for $63/night plus tax. Yeah, the extra blanket in the closet had cigarette burns on it, but I needed to be on a budget for this weekend add-on to a business trip, and for that the Coral Sand fit the bill.

Then we discovered that the second floor balcony surrounding the pool was essentially a cruising area. The second surprise came when we were handed our TV remote and two key cards, and informed that our bill was being charged $20 for the remote and $10 for each key card, charges which would be refunded if returned at checkout. The third surprise was the \"Visitor's Policy\" statement which was given to us after registering. An abbreviated version follows: 1. $10 plus tax for visitors between midnight and 6 AM 2.All guests and visitors must provide photo ID and visitors must leave the ID at the desk until departure. 3. All visitors and registered guests must be over 18 years of age. 4. Management has the right to refuse admittance of any visitor. Also, Nudity is not allowed within public view whether in or out of your room. (A rule which was obviously not observed in actual practice.) What was good about Coral Sands? Clean bathrooms with an abundance of nice towels. Clean sheets. Attractive bedspread with coordinated drapes. What was bad about Coral Sands? Broken light fixture in bathroom with badly rusted medicine cabinet. Insufficient lighting from lamps that are under-powered and dirty. Pillows so flat (worn out) they barely mattered. Terrible TV with only about 8 channels seriously fuzzy and distorted. Dilapidated Sauna which the night clerk didn't know how to operate. Soiled room carpeting. Minimal breakfast with only black coffee so strong the cream barely cut it. No decaf. Only donuts. All-night cruising and noise on the balcony. Summary: This is a place where men can cruise for partners. A bath house would be more \"efficient.\" As a motel it has serious shortcomings. Coral Sands tries to do both and doesn't do either very well, considering the cost.
