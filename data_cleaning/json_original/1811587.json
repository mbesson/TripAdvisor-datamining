To go to the Navonne place, 30 minutes walk are necessary, or it is possible to take the bus which stoppes very close from the apartment.

Wi-fi is available and the connection works fine. We had arranged a car pick up from the owner and it turns out to be cheaper than taking public transportation from or to the airport. So, I suggest if you have 4 ppl on the trip, order the car pick up and it is cheaper, faster and easier. Please let the owner knows that if you arrive early in the morning, or otherwise you will be standing at the door waiting for the owner to come. As it is not a hotel, there's no check in counter.

When we told Alessandro about this issue he indicated that he would come and give us the key but failed to do this throughout the weekend. So each time we came back from our excursions we had to ring the tenants of the building to get them to open up the building for us. Another disappointment was that the hot water did not last very long while taking a shower in the morning. The hot water would go in and out several times. For two people staying in the Blush apartment there was not enough hot water for both of us. Another annoying point was that there was no toilet paper in the apartment when we arrived. So we had to dash out and get some right away. For these reasons, I rated the service very poor. These are little kinks that made me contemplate whether I should have spent my money on staying in a hotel instead of at this place. The best part of this place was the location.

Always having stayed in hotels when traveling I was a little reluctant about this new experience. We decided on 2 apartments at Purple Home based on the reviews both here and other sites. If my experience at Purple Home is representative of an apartment stay experience I won\u2019t hesitate to do it again. From the beginning I had a good feeling, as the hosts, Valentina and Alessandro, were very responsive when I communicated with them prior to our arrival in Rome. Alessandro made arrangements in advance for a van airport pickup, which given that there were 6 of us was far more economical and convenient than taxies. The hosts, a young couple, greeted us upon our arrival at Purple Home and made sure to explain everything we needed to know about the 2 apartments that we were staying in (a 2 bedroom/ 2 bath and a 1 bedroom/1 bath). Purple Home is in a residential neighborhood very conveniently located to many of the important sights of Rome. Our apartments were fresh and contemporary, and most importantly clean and comfortable (we had the 2 ground floor apartments, so our views were not quite postcard worthy; this was not a problem for us). We felt very safe staying there, even when walking back late at night. There is a nice supermarket just down the street, and while we did not have the opportunity to try them, there are a number of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. Valentina and Alessandro were perfect hosts and always responsive when we had a problem or needed information. Shortly after our arrival at Purple Home I realized that my ipod was missing and suspected that it had fallen out in the back of the van when a bag fell over. Valentina called the driver and sure enough it was on the floor of the van. She made arrangements for the return and there it was in my room when I returned from sightseeing! Another time we were stuck for a place to eat and called Valentina for a recommendation. Even though I could hear the baby crying in the background, she took the time to discuss what we were looking for and came up with the perfect restaurant!

Alessandro and Valentina take a lot a of pride in welcoming their guest in these very well decorated and stylish flats in the centre of Rome. The flats have been completely re furbished, they are brand new and very clean. They are also very well equiped with Wi-Fi Internet, flat screen TV (including all the international and movie channels) as well as a modern kitchen.

Alessandro and Valentina are a young and very welcoming couple. They are extremely friendly Romans and it was a real pleasure to meet them! They both know the city extremely well and speak English perfeclty. Alessandro knows all the best and non-touristee restaurants and bars where you will meet only Romans and little tourists. This is from my exprience one of the real plus of knowing someome in a city like Rome: to advise you places where Romans actually go. You will find better food and services for cheaper prices in a more characteristic place. Follow Alessandro's advices and you won't be dissapointed. Also, Purple Home offers additional and a complete set of services for its guests ranging from car services to a special chef to cook in the flat or they can organise massages in the flat which are very nice after a long day walking across the city. The website describes all this very well, just ask Purple House to arrange anything for you. Overall this is to me the best compromise to visit a city like Rome: stylish and modern appartments which are very well located and with the independancy of your own flat but with the services of an hotel - should you require and ask for them.

The address is below for anyone checking the location. It is a 5-10 minute walk to the Vatican on a nice street with numerous restaurants and bars (for coffee, mostly). There is a laundromat on the street about halfway between the apartment and the Vatican, although, if you want anything pressed and not just dump in a plastic bag when your clothes come out of the dryer, you will pay extra for that. Name of apartment Purple1 Place of check-in: Apartment Address of check-in: Rampa delle mura aurelie 9 (this is the tiny side street and not the main street that is less than 50 feet away). The apartment was comfortable with two bedrooms and two full baths with stand-up showers only. Small kitchen with mini refrigerator and small stove-top. Could use an American style coffee maker if you want a regular cup of coffee in the morning (there is a \"Bar\" that serves coffee about 3 minutes down the street, but you will not be getting a regular sized cup of anything). Excellent secure front door with elaborate locking system if you are concerned about security (we weren't as the neighborhood seemed fine). Grocery store less than five minutes away. The exterior of the building and the immediate surroundings are not designed to impress but the interior was perfectly fine. Alessandro, our contact manager for Purple Home, met us at the apartment and let us in. He was very helpful well before we arrived with suggestions for restaurants, etc. We really liked him and he was excellent in providing a great level of service. No onsite management, but Alessandro was remodeling an apartment next door to ours and we saw him often. We would stay here again.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, chic and convenient apartment\u201d", "Author": "Rachel A", "ReviewID": "UR117141132", "Content": "We stayed at this stylish apartment at the beginning of August for three nights.

It is also extremely conveniently located, just 5-10 minutes walk from the Vatican and about 20 minutes from Piazza Navonna and there is also is a bus which stops just down the road. There is an excellent supermarket in walking distance and various shops and restaurants within the immediate vicinity. Alessandro and Valentina were fantastic hosts - nothing was too much trouble. Our taxi mistakenly dropped us around the corner and we were soon rescued. Alessandro also gave us several recommendations for eating places.

The flat was beautiful and had everything that we could have wanted. It was lovely to explore Roma by day and come back to the flat to relax and chill then change and walk in to Roma and experience the night atmosphere. The flat sits in a lovely area with a one of the nicest restaurants a few 100 metres away and walking in to the heart of Vatican City couldn't have been easier. It was spotlessly clean and the lifts and walkways were cleaned daily.It is equiped with everything that you could possible need. The neighbours were very friendly too! Walks along the River at night were memorable and it gave us a taste of what it would be like to live in Roma rather than be a tourist and stay in an Hotel. There is a superb supermarket very close by and we were able to buy local cheeses, meats and breads for breakfast before setting off on our days out! We loved the decor in the flat and the Purple theme and we felt at home and very comfortable there. As a city base it couldn't be better and from the balcony one could see the windows of the vatican. Thia flat is to be recommended for a family who want to experience Roma from a leisurely start each day;to come and go as they please and not be tied to meal times and formality!

This trip was to celebrate my Grandma's 80th birthday by exploring Rome, doing Palm sunday at the Vatican, and traveling to Pescara to see where our family came from. Valentina worked out a great deal with me for 8 days and was more than accommodating. The location is within a few blocks from the Vatican, main bus lines and the train station. A block away is a grocery store, bar, restaurant and walk a few more blocks and lots of cafes, restaurants, gift shops, almost anything you could want. If you have a car or decide to rent one, DO NOT park up by the main grocery store. The guy is an A#@! The sign says 20 euros all day and he took advantage of us, telling us that since we didn't have cash it would be 40 euros for the night. When we came back ten minutes later with cash, he raised the price to 70 euros and pretended to not understand us. We took the car out which he charged us 10 euros for the 10 minutes. After pulling it out of the garage we discovered parking it on the street was a better deal and less of a chance of being ripped off.

The 64 bus (St Piedro - Central Termini) takes you there even quicker and it stops outside on the street (min. 4 buses/uur)..
