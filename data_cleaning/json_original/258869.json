The room was quite large and well appointed with a king bed, flat screen TV, large marble bath with amenities, mini fridge to hold our own snacks, and a large window overlooking the rear of the hotel. I suggest you ask for a rear-facing room to avoid the darker street front and noise and to also avoid the rooms that open to the internal atrium which has no natural light or air. We were able to open our window to the sun and fresh air because we faced the rear. The rooms are quiet, but a bit hot - not sure why and I've seen others complain about that, too. The staff is very friendly which is good because you have to visit the front desk every 24 hours to get a new WiFi password.

I was a little worried because I had used Airmiles and thought I'd be given a dump of a room. How wrong was I? The Hotel room itself (room 508) was small but perfect. It had a wonderfully spotless bathroom, mini bar, flat screen tv and the bed had lovely crisp white linen. The hotel is well located and within walking distance of the main sights (Casa Mila, La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia, Museu Picasso) and is ideally placed for Placa de Catalunya which is where the airport bus starts and terminates. You can also easily walk to Las Ramblas and to Barceloneta which is where the beach is. Being a Londoner, I was on my guard for any potential muggings but I can honestly say that I felt completely safe especially where the hotel is located. I got caught in some football traffic on my second day and got back to the hotel really late. Even though the hotel is on a side street - I didn't fear for my safety at all. The only negative comment that I would make (but didn't affect me personally) is that I would not have paid 20Euros for the breakfast. Luckily my stay included the buffet breakfast and it was more than adequate for me. It kept me so full I couldnt eat again until the evening!! But 20 Euros is a bit steep in my opinion. There are numerous places in the area where you can buy breakfast a lot cheaper. If you are on a really tight budget, empty your mini bar fridge - and stock up with goodies from the Carrefour supermarket on Las Ramblas.

We arrived at the HCC Covadonga about 4pm, this was after trekking it from the Hospital Clinic Metro station (which incidentally is about 15 minutes away - a bit too much especially with luggage and in 30 degrees celcius!). From the reading the reviews here, it appears that the HCC hotels havea habit of \"upgrading\" their guests to the so called 4 star hotels - Covadonga is listed as a 3 stars and we were told on arrival that the hotel was double booked and so therefore, we were to be transferred to St Moritz. The taxi was called and paid for by the hotel and to our surprise a doorman greeted us. The staff were very friendly but we did get annoyed when they told us that they didn't have a double bed room available (especially when the staff at Covadonga assured us that our booking would be exactly the same but in a 4 star hotel!). They originlly offered us a non-smoking room with 2 beds pushed together. However, after not much wrangling, we were given a smoking room on the top floor which had a double bed. Despite the room being a smoking room, it did not smell (although, the hair dryer was blowing out smokey hot air - have no idea why this was!). The room is a little worn around the edges, it does get hot in the room because you have to use your door card to activate the power (incidentally, we were given 2 door cards and so we left one of them in the slot to keep the room cool) and it is on the small size. However, the main problem with the room was the noise. The street outside constantly has traffic and if not traffic, the bin collection will keep you awake untill 1am. We also had the misfortune of having a dodgy window which didn't close properly. However, luckily for us, we're not light nor early sleepers and so sleeping was not a problem. Travelling to the hotel: This hotel was better located than Covadonga. It's location in fact is excellent. We didn't use the buses but instead used the train and metro system. On arrival from the airport, take the Renfe train (you need to walk all the way to the end of Terminal B, go up the escalators and walk through the overhead walkway to the train station) to Passaig de Gracie (one stop after Barcelona Sants). The hotel is located on the street with the shops \"Camper\" and \"Vogue\" on the corner (make sure you're walking away from \"Zara\". The great thing about Barcelona and staying at this particular hotel is that if you take a wrong turn, you don't need to back track - the checkerboard roads just mean you need to keep turning right or left and you get back to where you were - a good trick if you're too embarrased to walk pass the doorman because you've taken a wrong turn! Travelling tips: We bought ourselves the Barcelona Card which gave us free travel on the metro, train and bus system for the duration of our stay. It had various free coupons to be used for the museums and sites. Food: We recommend the restaurant Salamanca in Barceloneta. When you get to Barceloneta metro station, keep walking straight towards the beach. Once you are there, turn left and keep walking about 100 yeards. They do the best seafood paella in town and at a good price and HUGE portions! A meal for 2 (without wine) cost us around \u20ac50. Sites: Tibidoga - this we found by chance! Everyone goes to Mont Juic but this place is just as good - without the masses of tourists!

There are good tapas places within a few blocks, but we did most of our eating in Ribera so if in Barcelona again we would probably look for a place in the old city. However, this is an excellent location for Eixample which is very spread out so we were pretty happy with the location.
