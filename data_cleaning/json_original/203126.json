The guy was incredibly rude, it was a borderline between speaking in a raised voice and shouting. In reality it was a miscommunication between the hotel and the booking agency BUT the hotel refused to resolve the situation or do anything about it, you are left alone with the problem in a foreign country where people do not speak much English including the hotel staff. They do benefit from the booking agencies and they should not leave their guests if a problem occurs. If you do not mind finding yourself in a situation when you are told to pay some ridiculous price or leave (even though you have a written conformation on your hands that you have already paid) go ahead and book this place.

Previously, we had stayed at the Guibileo, just across the street, which we really liked, but they were full so we settled for this one despite less-than perfect reviews and prepaid it through an agency. When we arrived at the Hotel D'Este, we were told that the hotel was fully booked and there was no room for us, even though the receptionist had a document on her desk with our booking clearly shown on it. She said that the problem was the agency's fault because the booking was received too late (a total crock as I had booked at least six weeks earlier) and all the rooms had already been filled. It was a case, she said, of 'first come first served'. We knew this to be a lie. For one thing, it was still afternoon and also another couple arrived after us and were able to check straight in. They would not give us a room, but sent us by car to another hotel they own (The Repubblica) which is so basic that it felt more like a backpackers hostel than a hotel. I had avoided booking the Repubblica because I had read reviews of it which were almost all bad. We've stayed in some pretty grim places in our time, but not at these three-star prices!! I guess the only way they can fill the Repubblica is to overbook the D'Este and then 'walk' the hapless guests like us who turn up with pre-paid vouchers. Obviously, the only people who get to stay at the D'Este are those who have not pre-paid, who have booked more than one night and are thus more likely to walk out if not treated properly. These people own the D'Este, the Repubblica and the Augusta (next door to the Repubblica and looks like another fleapit).
