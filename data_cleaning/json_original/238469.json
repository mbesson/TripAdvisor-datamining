I read the reviews, reserved it and hoped for the best. We arrived in Marco Polo airport on a Friday, took the airport express bus to Piazzale Roma, then the Vaporetto to San Marco. Hotel Al Di Mori was located just a few meters off Saint Mark's square in the surrounding shopping / dining avenues. You walk up a half flight of stairs to reach the small reception room, then up a few more flights of stairs to get to your room, depending on which floor you are placed. Like many low cost Europe hotels, the hotel does not have a lift and the staircases are narrow and steep. If you packed light, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you brought a large rolling bag, I imagine it would be difficult to get it up to your room. We were on the third floor, which required quite a hike to get up to the room, but it also meant we didn't hear noise from the streets below. Our room was clean and very basic, the bed was comfortable and the showers were also clean and functional. The rooms did have air conditioning, which is essential for humid Venice nights in July.

If you do have someone in your group with any mobility problem, you can call to see if they have a ground-floor room available (you'll still need to go up a half-flight of stairs to get into the building) or search elsewhere. I highly suggest you pack light for a Venice trip or leave most of your luggage at the baggage drop in Piazzale Roma. In a city without cars, you'll find transportation is pricey, walking is generally necessary and the Vaporettos are very crowded.

The location is PERFECT, just a 30 second walk from St. Mark's square. To arrive we took the Aguilera from the airport (~1 hour, but we had a terrible driver so it felt like forever). It was probably about a 8 minute walk over two bridges (one had a ramp) and thru the square to get to the hotel. I highly recommend one person staying downstairs to see if you room is in the annex or not before dragging all your luggage upstairs:) The room wasn't huge, but fine for a couple. There was even nice little table and two chairs. The room furnishings are by no means modern, but simple, country, and comfortable. No breakfast *but coffee and tea in the room), but I couldn't find anything else this close to St. Mark' square for anything near the price, so I think it more than evened out.

The price was very reasonable for what I was looking at for Venice, and not having been there before I wanted to book near Piazza San Marco. The cost was about 110 euros per night- does not include breakfast. Be sure to write down the street name for the hotel as while they are 10 meters from the Piazza it is sooo big, and the streets are so small this will save you some headache. However we found it relatively quickly. You have to buzz yourself in , and then walk up stairs. The ceiling is very low so of course my husband smacked his head on several occasions. After having taken the train from Switzerland to Venice, then a water taxi to San Marco (with large backpacks) we were exhausted and it was in the mid-30's temperature wise so we were hot! The hotel is quite warm as there is no air conditioning, and no real lobby, just a room on the second floor of the building. Luckily our room was only on the 3rd floor because there is no elevator - not the end of the world but after walking all day in extreme heat it was a little tiring. Rooms are clean, quiet, and very basic. I would have loved a microwave as Venice is very expensive so its nice to buy at the grocery store and stock up your fridge. There are in-room safes but we took everything and used a money belt instead. Decent service, staff were friendly, but I would spend a wee bit more on a return visit, and actually stay a bit further away from Piazza San Marco because it was just so crowded all of the time, but as soon as you walk away from the square the crowd thins and its much more enjoyable. There is truly more to Venice than Piazza San Marco :) One little negative was the nightman- while very friendly, he was in the bar next to the hotel every night instead of in the hotel ready to buzz you in. So we had to track him down first before we could be let back into the building. I understand the need to turn your keys in when you leave the room, but its nice to be able to get back into the building when you need to. My parents are headed to Venice in the fall and just to ensure they have a great visit, I will be researching other hotel options. There are 2 Best Westerns (at least in Venice) that I might try since you can expect a minimum level of service from chain hotels. When in Venice make sure to walk every where, and take the water ferry/taxi , there is sooo much to see and its also worth a trip to the Lido if its hot. If you buy a ferry pass this will also take you across to Lido, and when you get there just follow the crowd to the beach :)", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roskilde, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cLike a dollhouse - a perfect gem!\u201d", "Author": "DanishTraveller2009", "ReviewID": "UR65497639", "Content": "We where staying at Hotel Ai do Mori for 5 nights.

The hotel was a little hard to find on arriving but that can be said for most places in Venice! It is easy to reach by taking one of the water ferries number 1 or 2 to San Marco square, and it is within easy reach of many important locations and places to sightsee. I would recommend buying a travel pass for the boats (24, 48 hours etc) as we found some ferry travel essential, particularly for getting too and from the station and seeing areas such as Murano, Giudecca and San Giorgio. Also avoid a number of the restaurants located near the hotel!! Many of them charge extortionate service charges (12% on top of 3 euro per person service charge) and the food is of poor quality.

Our biggest beef with the Annex was that even though the windows are double paned with shutters, you still hear the throngs of tourists that join together at 8 AM and roam the streets of once-quaint Venice until past midnight. Furthermore, if you're in the Annex, you're basically on your own. This was bizarre at first, but by the end, we didn't mind. It was kind of fun actually. But there's no lobby in which to hang out, no communal hotel feeling. Just you and your three keys which get you through the several layers of locked entry ways en route to your room. And again, we didn't mind. But if you're the kind of traveler who likes to mingle with the other guests, this ain't the place. All and all, Hotel Ai Do Mori is perfectly decent. Would I go back? Probably not. But that's more because I don't want to stay near the thousands of tourists that descended on St. Mark's like seagulls diving into the ocean. Actually, this gives seagulls a bad name. The parade of tourists was more like a flock of vultures pecking away at the last scraps of peaceful Venice. I guess I was one of the tourists too so I shouldn't talk. I'm part of the problem. But I do know a decent hotel from a really good one, and Ai Do Mori is simply a decent one.

It is literally just a short passage way from Piazza San Marco, and a five minute walk from the Allilaguna jetty for the boats that cross the Lagoon to and from Marco Polo airport - quite the most romantic way to get to the city. So, very convenient for getting to the Basilica and the Palazzo Ducale first thing ahead of the bulk of the other tourists, and situated as it is right in the heart of Venice, it is an ideal spot for reaching all the other tourist attractions as well, although the biggest attraction has to be the streets of Venice herself. Warning -take your most comfortable walking shoes, preferably two pairs. There is no alternative to Shank's Pony unless you want to spend a fortune on vaporetto Tourist tickets (currently 6.50(!) euros a journey, although there are 12, 24 36 etc hour versions which work out slightly cheaper!) or the even more expensive water taxis. This rapacious grabbing of tourist cash is a new development. Locals pay a fraction of these prices, which I suppose is fair enough in a way, but can leave a bad taste in the mouth , especially when a conductor gets stroppy because you haven't been able to buy tickets before boarding because the ticket booth is closed, and he is convinced you are trying to get a free ride. I know that must happen, but it is not pleasant to experience such mistrust when you are not actually trying it on. The hotel itself is two floors above ground level which can be a pain when you're lugging cases up two flights of narrow stairs. However, it means that noise from the street isn't quite so intrusive, and, in the event of the acqua alta, you are well removed from the rising waters. The rooms are all comfortable (some smaller than others) with excellent en suite facilities, reasonable clothes storage space, efficient heating in the cooler months and air-conditioning in the summer. You can see (and hear!) the bells of the Clock Tower in the Piazza from most windows. The staff are friendly and extremely helpful, being anxious to make you feel at home, and the rates are reasonable all year round, considering the location. We paid 135 euros a night for a twin room during our most recent stay over Easter weekend. In fact, on another trip, we paid almost as much staying in Mestre and travelling into Venice every day. I made our bookings by email and received prompt and clear replies in English - made me quite ashamed of my lack of Italian! No food is provided (apart from the two very much appreciated tiny easter eggs on our pillows when we arrived!), but when there is an excellent cafe - one of the stand and eat/drink ones that abound in Venice - opposite the entrance that seems to be open all hours, why worry? Once you've had your wake-me-up coffee/tea/whatever and croissant (chocolate or apricot jam - yummy!), you are ready for the fray, or at least until the next coffee shop/gelaratia/pizzeria comes into view. And when the day get too exhausting, your room is always easily reached from most parts of the city for a welcome rest, before sallying forth to continue sampling the delights of Venice.
