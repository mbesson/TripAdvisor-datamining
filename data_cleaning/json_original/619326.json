The apartments are located in Islington which turned out to be my favourite part of London by far. St. Mark's is about a 3 minute walk to Angel tube station, which is surrounded by restaurants and little boutique shops. The two bedroom apartment we stayed in was beautiful. Very clean, very spacious with a kitchen, two bathrooms and a large living area. The room also had a washing machine and dryer. The front desk is manned until quite late at night - we never arrived home after a night out with nobody to welcome us, so I imagine late check-ins wouldn't be a problem. The apartment complex is also situated opposite both a mini-mart and an internet cafe which was especially handy. One thing to consider is that the rooms aren't serviced while you are there - or at least this was the case when we stayed for our 7 days. This may be a service available at an extra charge. I'd definitely stay here again, and I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cTired Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Jim L", "ReviewID": "UR123480427", "Content": "Nothing much of the luxury apartments here.

And while, yes, the staff are very polite and accommodating, there are some serious issues with the building itself. For example, within my first week the dryer was clogged and could not dry clothes, ergo the maintenance attendant had to be sent up; the hot water stopped working, ergo the maintenance attendant had to be sent up; there were no instructions for the oven and--as our welcome book suggested--we called reception but THEY didn't know how to operate it, ergo the maintenance attendant had to be sent up; there is no air conditioning so we had to specially request a fan in the unseasonably warm weather--but it couldn't be sent until the following day, leaving a night drenched in sweat. Several issues we have dealt with were simple (the dryer, the fan, the oven) and could have easily been taken care of BEFORE we arrived if they performed due diligence and checked their appliances etc. Their \"welcome package\" is subpar compared to other residential options we were given (I regret not choosing them now!). The package contained a couple instant coffees, tea bags, dish soap, a sponge, and gel packs for laundry. You will most certainly need to go grocery shopping if you plan on staying awhile, and note that while you get a couple pots and a pan, you have no baking dishes. Additional things to consider include: 1) Each apartment has a different layout. There were some issues with our first apartment, and so the second apartment we were given was a much better layout for us and what we wanted. Don't be afraid to ask if they have another option at which you may look. 2) Although my apartment didn't face the street, it was very easy to hear street noises. Coming from a city, this does not annoy us so much, but it may annoy other patrons (bring earplugs?). That said, I rarely heard anyone in the building. 3) The mattress and pillows leave something to be desired. 4) Be aware that it is an old building with long, winding halls. If walking is an issue for you, I'd suggest requesting an apartment closer to the entrance. I had to walk quite a bit to my apartment. While I'm certainly not expecting a five-star hotel, I expect the basic amenities to be there and functioning with relative ease--especially if they advertise themselves to be perfect temporary lodging for business executives.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip to a great City\u201d", "Author": "arischeridan65", "ReviewID": "UR110829825", "Content": "Traveling to Europe is always expensive because of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate, but London is such a great destination it has history and modern attractions, it well deserved some of our vacation time and money. We stayed for the whole week at the St. Marks Hotel which provides good looking and well located accommodations at an affordable price. I read a comment about the carpeting but I can\u2019t remember them, so I can\u2019t comment on that. Sorry. We loved the building and the great view it offered from the outside, and the rooms were clean enough and well equipped. The kitchenette saved us some good money because we could do some meals specially lunch and breakfast and we could keep some fresh food in the room for a late night snack and the internet connection was good and included in the price. The units had a great and spacious space to move in, and we had really rested after hours of walking throughout the city. We always look for well located hotels because transportation in Europe is expensive so we use public services like the trains and buses and the soo English tube. The St. Marks has to be one of the best located hotels in that city, we could come and go at will, walking distance to everything you should need, restaurants, and shops and of course a tube station we used to get everywhere we wanted. So convenient. Staff was friendly and helpful and nice. We enjoyed our stay very much and will remember our trip to London for a long long time, and although we did get to visit most of it, I would definitely go back and revisit some of my favorite attractions again, I will go back to the St Marks Hotel anytime.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Engelhartszell, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGood value--still...\u201d", "Author": "krugerfriend", "ReviewID": "UR83114590", "Content": "We spent about one week at the St Marks last July. The building is impressive on the outside, and provides a good idea of Victorian living on the inside.

The apartment we rented was very spacious and well furnished, and the kitchen was new and nicely equipped. It was a relief to have internet access included in the price, for once! On the negative side, the internet access (by cable) was installed in such an awkward place that we had to bow more than half way to the floor when working on our laptops, and the connection was at times painfully slow. Also, the apartment was in clear need of (cosmetic) renovations, although the overall impression was still good.

The carpet in the bedrooms were disgusting and covered with food/beverage stains and were filthy. The walls were all scuffed and dirty and I mean scuffs were no furniture could have even reached. The drapes had pink food or beverage stains on them. The hall bath shower looked as if the ceiling were on the verge of collapsing. The shower tiles had been half re-grouted. The other half looked to be stained with old red mold. I couldn't even stay one night.
