We had also read that they had recieved some awards for being the best mid range Hotel. For a four star hotel it did not disappoint us at all, in fact, it was very good and it would be hard to find a hotel in this range that is better. The location was not good but we made the best of it and managed to find our way around and it gave us a chance of exploring a different area of Singapore. There are plenty of buses that are very close to the Hotel and we caught the SAEX from the nearby Miramar Hotel to the Zoo. Our room was modern but small and the bed was very hard. The staff were great in finding us a bed topper for the mattress which helped. They were also willing to move us to another room with better views but as it was a bit of messing around we stayed where we were first located. The club lounge is set up differently to what we normally experiance and was on the second floor. The setting made it very pleasant for a change. We found the club lounge to be excellant and felt spoilt. The evening snacks couldn't have been better. The variety and quality was amazing, so much so that we deliberately did not go there on one of ours nights so as not to spoil our dinner. There were four hot dishes, a wide selection of sushi with all the trimmings, two desserts and a selection of three different very small dishes as well as a few good quality cheeses. For drinks they offered the usual, including a choice of two beers and even teh tarak. Breakfast was good and pretty much standard, there was plenty to choose from and they had different asian selections each day. The only thing lacking was honey but on asking the staff they were fantastic in getting some for us from their kitchen. There is an adjoining nightclub (if that is in fact what it is called) with plenty of pretty young girls coming in and out of it and frequented by elderly men. We had a look at it but felt unwelcome and were advised that they just had small private rooms for karioke.

Our first impression was of a very grand hotel with imposing lobby and foyer, huge bar/lounge area with a feature waterfall outside, visually pleasing and elegant. As a stop-over holiday with Singapore Airlines our room was a standard one. I asked if we could pay for an upgrade and was told they would not know what to charge me (?) as they did not know what the agent had charged. The gentleman said he would give us a complimentary upgrade, which was nice of him although I think it just made life easier for him! I asked about Internet access and was asked did I have a laptop. I advised them that on this trip I had just brought my iPad, \"too bad, laptop access is much cheaper then Wi-Fi\", excellent! The most you could book at a time was 60 minutes at a cost of $15 Singapore dollars-daylight robbery these days when the majority of hotels are offering free broadband and Wi-Fi internet. I was told they did have an internet room that I could use. However it operated on Wi-Fi so the cost was the same $15 per 60 minute block. The internet was extremely slow and barely worth using except for basic email. We then headed to our 'Superior' Room on the 10th Floor. The first impression when leaving the lift on the tenth floor was a stale, musty smell that was very evident in the corridor. The walls of the corridor were gouged with pieces out of them and poorly repaired .The bottom of the front door to our room was broken and the veneer lifted. The room was ok, thankfully it had a nice view of a small park opposite although you did have to peer through the filthy windows. The room also looked tired. There were crayon lines on the wall obviously from a previous guest\u2019s child. The power points were discoloured and old. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a shower over the bath. The downside was the mould that was at the bottom of the soap tray, the corner of the walls and below the taps. There is no excuse; this is simply poor housekeeping practice. The towels were thin and worn and quite rough.The bed was extremely hard and the pillows likewise. Our room had an adjoining door which meant that noise from guests in the room next door carried through into our room. On several nights we were woken in the early hours of the morning by guests talking loudly in the corridor and banging doors. There was a bar fridge and the hotel did provide two complimentary bottles of water daily which was very handy when you are sightseeing in the humidity. The coffee provided was horrible as was the powdered milk. Have they not heard of long life milk? On the up side of our stay was the Waterfall Lounge and dining at the Four Square Restaurant. From 3pm to 8pm every day is Happy Hour in the Waterfall Lounge, which with the lovely waterfall outside the massive glass windows is a very pleasant way to spend an evening. Each night there was entertainment by a local singer and musician. They were fantastic and the range and variety of music was wonderful. The staff in the lounge are very friendly and attentive. We had opted to include the daily buffet breakfast in our package so each morning we ate in the Square @ Furama. A modern pleasant restaurant with helpful and friendly staff the breakfast was great value. Providing both Asian and Western food options you would be hard pressed not to come away feeling very satisfied. The Singapore Airlines Hop-On-Hop-Off Bus stop is two doors down from the hotel outside the Miramar Hotel which is quite close and convenient. Overall I would only rate the Furama Riverfront as average. It is advertised as the business class hotel on Havelock Road, however that is not my impression. I guess if the little things do not matter you will be happy at the Furama.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casino, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat\u201d", "Author": "gidgetsurf", "ReviewID": "UR124553405", "Content": "check in with ease. lovely rooms with amazing bathroom. room was clean and roomy. everything was to our satisfaction. we were in an excutive room which entitled us to free drinks and canapes at night which was enough for our dinner.

While there I hosted a no-frills seminar for work for which I needed next to nothing in the way of accommodations. The room was clean and the bed was terrific. The wireless internet was a little pathetic, but it was included with the cost of the room, which is merciful compared to similar hotels in the US. I only have two issues with the room itself. First, the hardwood floor of the meeting room was badly scratched. Second, the walls were bare. There's an antiseptic quality to a large room with bare walls that was apparent after just a few minutes sitting in the room. For the expense, it seems like it wouldn't be too great a hardship to put perfunctory prints on the wall. The Furama RiverFront's location is excellent. It sits minutes away from a bunch of Singapore hot spots. If you're taking MRT, you're going to be disappointed though. The cab rides from the Furama are typically short, but they are more or less mandatory. It's not that the walks to any given point of interest are far, per se, nor the walk to the nearest MRT station. It's just that you have to brave a lot of traffic and walk in a very roundabout way. I never had to wait long for a cab-- usually no time at all-- but it's something you probably should know ahead of time. One thing I'd like to highlight is the service here. The quality of customer service in Asia is better than what I find in the USA generally, but the Furama stood out among the places I've stayed. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful when addressing my very few needs, whether I was addressing parking issues for one my seminar attendees or walking in the front door at 4am. I greatly enjoyed my stay at the Furama RiverFront, and I expect I'll stay again when I return to Singapore later this year.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liphook, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA really good mid-range business hotel ...\u201d", "Author": "GB01", "ReviewID": "UR123116702", "Content": "There are two Furama Hotels in Singapore (City Centre and RiverFront) and several others across Asia. There is quite a mix of hotels in this area of the City State, mostly built in the 1980\u2019s. Furama RiverFront is in easy walking distance to the rather touristy Singapore River but doesn\u2019t actually front on to it! The hotel is somewhat outside the city centre although in truth nowhere is that far in Singapore! The taxi fare from Changi airport is around S$25 (Jan 2012). The nearest MRT is a bit of a walk but a courtesy coach runs to and from these hotels to Orchard Road, a world famous shopping area voted just this year as the \u2018Best Shopping Street in the World! I think for me the most enjoyable aspect of this hotel is the 10 minute walk in the evening along the beautifully lit river to the many bars and restaurants at Robertson Quay and a little further on at Clarke Quay and then on to Boat Quay. I can certainly recommend the small Italian pizzeria, Da Mario at Robertson Quay although I was disappointed by the rather poor steak and soggy frites at Les Bouchons Rive Gauche a little further along. I stayed in the Tropical Wing. The bedrooms have both been a good size with extremely comfortable supersize beds - the width of a football field - covered in pristine white linen (the beds that is, not the pitches!). The rooms are, in my experience, clean, quiet and very dark having solid wood shutters, not curtains. This is preferable particularly when you are adjusting to a new time zone. Oddly, there is no BBC World on the TV but no matter because when I\u2019m in Singapore I prefer to watch Channel News Asia. The in-house Wi-Fi is not free but it\u2019s fast and I had no connection issues. The buffet style breakfast is truly excellent with a wide choice of Western and Asian food. The major plus for me is great tasting coffee with the beans ground at the serving point. This is obviously an airline hotel with a lot of crews coming and going. There is also a good \u20187 to 11\u2019 type convenience shop at the petrol garage adjacent to the next-door Miramar Hotel. This was my second stay in this hotel on business and this being Singapore; the thing one notices is the super-efficient level of service from the staff: especially from the front desk, housekeepers and door people.

At check-in I was asked to charge my CC for S$400 or make a deposit of \u20ac200. They said it was to cover the minibar charges. I forgot my CC and thought it was absurt to make such a large deposit... My BF complained as well and (because we never use minibar) asked them to lock the minibar. After giving us a strange glare the frontdesk lady (forgot her name but she was super snobby) phoned a collegue to lock the minibar and proceeded our check-in. She told us she gave us a upgraded room free of charge. We went to our room (nr. 1232), opend the door and were very disapointed... The room was small with a queensize bed. The bathroom was dated with the shower/bathtub with showercurtain. If this was een upgrade I can't imagine how standard rooms looks like... It almost seemed like they just tell you you get an upgrade so you feel special but in fact you just get a standard room. But this wasn't the worst part... The bathroom smelled like mold and there were small flee-like insects jumping around... My BF killed most of them, and since we were meeting some friends in town, we didn't want to go back to the frontdesk. When we came back at night the room still smelled like mold, but we didn't want to complain and thought it might be our imagination. Next day we went to our parents room (also sleeping in this hotel) to \"smell\" their room. It was now clear it wasn't just us. So we decided to complain at frontdesk. This time we were assisted by a lovely young lady who felt really awful when we told her our room conditions. She immediatly gave us a real upgrate to a CLEAN large room with a kingsize bed and bathroom with seperate shower and bathtub (nr. 1517). The day after we also received a fruitbasket as apologies, which was a sweet gesture. But there were a few other incidents which resulted in my rating as \"poor\" for this hotel. We decided to eat at their restaurant The Square one evening with our SIA-voucher (50%off). The voucher was only applicable on their a la carte selection and The Square was mainly a buffet restaurant. We were still accepted and were able to order 2 dishes. I odered laksa and my BF hamburger and fries. Many dishes came out if the kitchen but they were all for the buffet... After we waited half an hour the waitress gave us some fruits from the buffet so we could eat something... After 15 more minutes my BF got irritated and asked the manager where our food was. Directly after complaining the (fake friendly) manager came with his hamburger and fries. His meal was cold, apparently they wanted to serve both mine and his dish simultaneously... He asked the manager if they could reheat it and she told him they would make a new order. After this my laksa arrived and now he had to wait... Finally his meal was ready, but the fries were not newly prepared (as they said) but fried for a second time...they were full of oil because of that.... The only thing the manager offered us as compensation was to select one dish of the buffet... That was such a weak offer so we passed.... Another incident was the last evening at their Waterfall Lounge. A friend of ours wanted a small snack, so we ordered potato wedges (with homemade tartar sauce and tomato sauce). It took 30 min for them to prepare them! And the waitress only served the potato without the sauces. When we told her she said she could serve us some chili sause. We asked her to bring us the sauces that were suposed to be served with the potato according their menu. She eventually went to the kitchen and arrived 10 min later with the correct sauces. By now we already finished half of the potato's...

Beware the $20 beer (i'd advise going to the bar in happy hour only) but even here the prices weren't higher than in other similar establishments in Singapore. What let the hotel down for me were the exorbitant wifi prices and issues with connectivity, which for a business hotel is a central requirement. When you're connected, it works well, but due to a room mix up on the first night, I had to pay again, despite having paid for seven days' access (your wifi account is linked to your room, not your device or a log in). Reception did remove the charge, but it took some negotiation. During the course of the week I heard numerous other people having a similar problem and I would urge them to look at the wifi provision. Wifi for a week is $140. Secondly, if you're checking out early for a meeting, but flying out late and intending to work in the bar, be aware that no matter when your room related wifi is due to expire (you can use wireless in communal spaces), it will be shut off after you check out. At this point, the only option is to buy extra time from reception, but the maximum time allowed is an hour at a cost of $15.

Some may wish to be closer to a MTR station (Outram park) but there are busses that takes you there just outside the hotel. The Hotel by itself turned out to be quite good even though I had a bad start. I was booked in an executive room which is great because breakfast is included as well as access to the executive lounge that serves drinks an light meal for free between 6 to 8 pm. However, the room I fist got on 17th floor was very small, had a clear smell of smoke even though floor was supposed to be smoke free, a flickering light and only one very small window. The response to my complaints was immediate and I was moved to another room on 19th floor (top floor). The new room was only a little bigger but had more windows and most important, was very clean. Being in an executive room, you can choose to have your breakfast either in the executive lounge or in the Square (the main restaurant at the hotel). I would certainly recommend the Square since the buffet is really extensive and to some extent also changes from day to day, which is important if you stay several nights. The lunch buffet is also very good and contains everything needed to taste people from everywhere, including Japanese, Chinese, Western and things I have absolutely no idea about what it was. For an even more interesting food experience, go to the near by China town but skip the tourist traps on e.g. Pagoda St. and head for one of the many food courts where many small outlets compete. One strange experience in such food court was that you have to order beer from one of the many ladies representing different beer companies competing about serving the guests but then you have to order food separately either directly from the counter of your chosen outlet or from another server that might work for one specific restaurant.

The greatest part of this upgrade is the internet. In this era of time, internet is a right not a privilege and not to be free. However, hotels still tend to charge absurd prices ($25+ a day) as it's profit margin is quite a bit and they are willing to forgo loyalty & customer retention for profit. Anyways, getting back to the Furama, remember it's a 4 star property and that is what it delivers. If you expect the rooms to be of a 5 star at a 4 star price, well in Singapore, that isn't going to happen. However for a 4 star it delivers what it promises and the pictures are true to the expectation. The only slight drawback is it's location. It's a bit out of the centre of town but then again Singapore is so small and taxis are cheap that nothing is over 10 minutes and over a $7 ride. Try it if you are looking for a good value for your money.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA great stop-over\u201d", "Author": "Marcel_Overseas", "ReviewID": "UR119600094", "Content": "Stopped over at the Furama on the way home from Malaysia.

She pushed the responsibility to the online agent and I begged to disagree. I suggested she check it out with the agent as the excuse given was unacceptable. To our delight, they informed us of the great news that we were entitled to a bonus breakfast. Apart from this incident, the room was spacious and clean, and my kids simply love the pool. Everyone from housekeeping to the counter staff to the concierge was extremely polite, welcoming and very friendly including the manager who handled our dispute. We definitely felt at home and made to feel like VIP guests. A special thanks has to go to the concierge team who relentlessly greeted, smiled, served and offered good advice whenever we were in the lobby entrance area.

The hotel only had us down for 3. I showed the girl the paperwork & she said she would check with the agent & get back to us. This was late afternoon so the agent in Australia would have been closed at this time. The receptionist who checked us in failed to inform us of breakfast & of our location or supply a map of the city. These I had to go & enquire about later & even then I was told very little. I wanted to go to the Singapore Bird Park & I was told we had to take a taxi to get there yet the very next morning when waiting for the Singapore Airline hop on off bus a bus for the bird park pulled up. This bus does a pick up everyday, as does one for the zoo, at the bus stop just up the road from the hotel yet we weren\u2019t told about it as the hotel appears to really push you to use a taxi. There is no tourist information on display (not known if available) at Furama & I believe the hotel is more interested in the business traveler or tour groups. Not independent travelers. Need to improve their local knowledge for tourist & display that information as well. Anyway back to the story of the room. After going out for a walk we returned to our room to find a message that stated that our booking has been confirmed for 3 nights only & that if we wanted to stay another night it was going to cost us a further S$328. Being a bit annoyed at this I returned to the reception where I spoke with another girl who understood what I was talking about & also couldn\u2019t understand why we only had 3 nights. I also expressed my dismay at how could the previous person have checked the booking when the Australian offices were closed. It would appear to me that this previous girl was not interested at all in the guests or going out of her way to help. The 2nd girl took details & would get back to me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026in the mean time I emailed my agent about the drama\u2019s. The following day I contacted my agent (& she emailed me a reply) that she had sorted out the hotels mistake. At this stage I still had not heard from the hotel. 2 days later we still hadn\u2019t heard from the hotel about our booking so I spoke to the assistant manager to express my displeasure & complain about the service. She was understanding & I\u2019ll give her credit did do something about it in that we received complementary internet access for the remainder of our stay & fruit baskets delivered to our room with an accompanying note of apology. However this error should not have occurred in the first place if those 2 girls had done their jobs properly. On the email subject \u2013 WHAT IS THE GO WITH EXPENSIVE HOTELS & INTERNET? Furama has a fee of S$25 a day for access!!!! $25 a day is down right theft! In all the hotels we have stayed at this trip, none prior to this have required a fee. None of those hotels were over S$80 a night. None gave us poor service! Hotels like Furama just want to make money ahead of guests\u2019 enjoyment no doubt! Look at the prices they charge in the mini bar for a 2nd reference to a rip off. You can go down the street get a coffee & get free wifi, go into a shopping plaza/mall & get free wifi but pay expensive room rates and not get it!!!!!! As for the hotel itself it was beautiful \u2013 the rooms were fantastic, clean, comfortable & quiet.

I had to extend my stay twice and was advised by the hotel to book via Expedia to get the better price. They were right. Once booked, I went to the reception and arranged to stay in same room and have continuity as if I'd originally booked for the duration. Hotel staff gave good advice to save me money and made this very easy to do. The main point I want to make about the Furama is regarding the Executive Club rooms. Only a small difference in price but the benefits far outweighed the additional cost. Main extras included in Exec is:-1. Late check-out of 16:00 hrs free, 2. Free breakfast buffet (excellent choice, plentiful and good quality), 3. Top 3 floor rooms with good view, 4. Free internet (wired in room & Wifi in rest of hotel.. usually \u00a38 - \u00a312 per day) & 5. Free drinks and snacks in Exec club between 6 & 8 pm every day. I can't say how good this was. The 'snacks' were plentiful and quality. Different menu each night but included Dim Dum, Satays, Noodles, Cakes, Sushi, Soups, etc, etc. All unlimited. If really on a budget there was plenty enough to be your evening meal. Drinks unlimited and unrestricted. The staff just kept offering. Even if you still had a full drink, they'd be round offering another. Getting Exec club is financially genius and I would recommend to anyone. As for the rest of the hotel, the staff are it's main asset. Very friendly and helpful. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and, unlike other hotels, they will clean your room anytime you ask between 07:00 and 23:00. If you like a lie in, or a day in the pool, they'll come and clean your room at a time you specify. Brilliant. Location couldn't have been better. Clarke Quay just 10 mins stroll along the river. Chinatown just 15 mins walk. For a balanced review, I must mention the Indonesian Restaurant. Poor service, unfriendly staff and menu very limited. Got tricked into buying an additional meal that I didn't want. \"Would you like boiled rice. yellow rice or fried rice?\" Boiled and yellow was $6.00 each. Fried rice was actually Nasi Goreng.. a $17.00 main meal. Thanks for letting me know. Had to waste the lot and they wouldn't listen.

Minor annoyance, trying to get 3 months of updates done this way. Laundry, nowhere within walking distance I could find had a laundromat, and the hotel laundry room (2 washers, 2 dryers) cost $8 EACH. MRT is at least half a mile away, and walking in the humidity is dramatically sweat-causing. The upsides, however: Amazingly comfortable bed, and chairs, and couch - just very great place to relax. Room service was prompt (<30 minute wait both times we ordered) and good, though pricey (but expected because hey, it's room service). Breakfast buffet had a good variety of American and local foods, fresh juice, and no rush from the staff. Always taxis waiting downstairs, no wait to get out and go see the city. Internet service was great speed-wise and no difficulty to set up. Did require ethernet cable in the room, but wireless in public areas (like the buffet).

Everything about the hotel was average, from the dated hotel rooms to the the service. The room was of average size with big windows, a mini-bar and safe. The towels were very thin, though they did provide a gown and slippers. Breakfast was quite good, though the waitering staff service not so good. Local phone calls were cheap from the room phone. They were very good with wake-up calls even sending someone to your room to wake you up if you didn't answer the phone. The luggage storage service and message service at the concierge was also very efficient. Checking in was a bit of a process, and they required a deposit for extra charges, which I considered strange since the room was already paid for. Checking out was very quick. There was very cheesy hotel lobby music daily, by not very talented singers. For entertainment I recommend the short walk to the nearby Robertsons or Clark Quay. The main disadvantage is that the hotel is not very centrally located and is a fair walk to the nearest metro station. There is a bus stop outside the hotel, however the bus system is difficult to navigate. Taxis regularly stop at the hotel, though it can take a while to get one in the evening. The hotel was used for a number of functions while I stayed there, so many evenings there were long queues for taxis. There are also some KTV bars/clubs next door, which means that there are some very drunk people stumbling around on weekend nights. One big disadvantage was that there was no free wifi in the rooms, only a very expensive internet cafe in the lobby or a cable in the room that required you to pay a ridiculous daily rate.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWell trained, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "TravellovingAussie", "ReviewID": "UR94447968", "Content": "First trip to Singapore.

However, when we got our room keys, the room I was in had 3 single beds, crammed in the same room, and the room was dark, damp smelling and musty. It was also a smoking room, and as a non smoker I found it very difficult to breath in there with the smell of stale smoke! I complained to the reception, who advised that the hotel was full, and that this room was a superior tower room.... I commented that it was not of a superior standard, being dark and damp and smelly with 3 beds crammed in! The manager then came out to see me and I explained my concerns, she advised that she agreed perhaps the wording of superior was incorrect, especially for european people! In a bid to solve the complaint she moved myself and friend to an executive room on the 18th floor.... well, what a change! airy light rooms, great bathrooms and bedroom areas, space to move and no smells!!!! With the room came a lovely selection of benefits, one of which was access to the executive lounge for breakfast in the morning, and also between 5-8pm drinks and nibbles also - all free!!!!!! Ok, so these were added extras, but it does highlight that they seem to mis-sell the superior room, it really was no more different to the Travel Lodge in the UK, basic, dull and non inviting..... Be carefull if you book this room type, and I would without a doubt ask to be upgraded to the Executive Rooms.... The rest of the hotel was fine, nice and clean, food very good, staff very nice.

We had a fixed itinerary to follow which included Universal Studios along with other Sentosa attractions and hence didn't spend a lot of time in the Hotel. However, comparing it with the hotels from my earlier trip to Singapore, this hotel definitely has a few positives. One is definitely the location. Its about a 5-10 mins walk (and about 5 SGD by cab) from Clarke Quay and the Outram Park MRT station. Thus traveling to Clarke Quay and Harbourfront (enroute to Sentosa) were extremely easy. We stayed on a twin sharing basis and my room was on the 8th floor. The rooms (including the bathroom) were quite comfortable and not at all cramped. There is a decent sized bathtub with a shower. The TV was not an LCD or plasma which I found quite surprising. Also, there were too few channels (english) available. The breakfast at the hotel is the bare minimum that one would expect and I wouldnt call it lavish. Also, the staff were polite and courteous but lacked that extra warmt that one is used to receiving in Singapore. I guess that had more to do with the huge crowd that they had to deal with. Since this was a fully sponsored trip, I dont exactly know how much we paid for the night but considering the Expedia price (INR 6500 a night), i think it was completely worth the price. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Singapore.

Generally anything I requested was rather slow. The cleaning staff however were excellent, checking with me what time of day I wanted my room serviced, and doing a sterling job.

I don't pay anywhere near that in San Francisco, an expensive city, even at a nice restaurant. I almost had a heart attack when I saw the bill. To be fair, they tried to get us to order the buffet but we weren't very hungry. That would have been somewhat cheaper, but still pretty expensive. The other thing was that the exchange rate the front desk gave us when we changed money was outrageous. We got $1.46 at the airport but the hotel only gave us $1.27. I expect them to make a profit, but come on!! I didn't remember Singapore being this expensive when we went a few years back and I am thinking it is only at this hotel that we have experienced this sort of thing, because we went on tours and had other meals and went to clubs and didn't have that same feeling of being ripped off. If you get a reasonable price for the hotel room and avoid the restaurants and other hotel services, it is fine to stay here.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWhat a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "pungpui", "ReviewID": "UR23720189", "Content": "We needed a cheap hotel to stay in overnight in Singapore between a cruise and a flight to Hong Kong, so we chose this hotel with the Singapore Stopover package (offered by Singapore Airlines). We had stayed in this hotel before in 2004 with the same package, and found it to be quite OK. This time around \u2013 what on earth happened here!? In 2004, we stayed in the \u2018Tropical Wing\u2019, while this time we stayed in the main tower. What a difference! Check in was quite efficient and we were issued with room card immediately (before the official check-in time). After spending a few hours on Orchard Road, we returned to our 2 rooms (interconnecting, non-smoking). The corridor has a permanent damp smell (how can this be? This is Singapore! Not London!). The room was nearly as bare as a youth hostel. Virtually a table, a chair and the most bare looking, low beds I\u2019ve ever seen. They were just too hard (like they\u2019ve been slept on for 20 years \u2013 probably doesn\u2019t help that a very seedy looking karaoke club is right next door within the building!) and the pillows gave me a headache that night trying to sleep on them. Toilet was OK, but only just! At least it was clean without traces of hair (as I would have expected looking at the rest of the room). As I said before the hotel shares the block with a very seedy karaoke bar where you see lots of girls in short skirts downstairs at around 9pm. Apparently this is an upscale area for hookers (lower paid ones stay around Gey Lang), which explains why all these men come out of expensive cars as I saw looking out of the window. For Singapore Airlines stopover guests, the hop on bus stop is just conveniently around the corner, and Zion food markets is a short 5 minute walk away as well as some restaurants also 5 minutes away in another direction (ask the concierge). Orchard Road by taxi is probably at most 10 minutes away so relatively cheap to get to, while Vivo City and the cruise centre (for Star Cruises) is also about 10 minutes by taxi away in the south direction. So locationwise it appears to be quite OK if you ignore the seedy club. I didn\u2019t hear much music as expected from that place \u2013 so either the rooms have very good noise insulation or there isn\u2019t much dancing and singing going on down there if you know what I mean! The lobby also has a tours desk so you can approach them to ask about day tours around Singapore. Note the Singapore Airlines stopover food discount only applies to A la Carte at the Square Restaurant, not the buffet, while the cafe downstairs offers coffee for a whopping $SG12 per glass! What a rip off! At least it was cheaper than other Singapore hotels and one night is OK \u2013 anymore than one night I would probably chose somewhere else!", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "jwyh", "ReviewID": "UR23301697", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights 11th - 14th December, 2008.

But for the price we paid, it was fine because accommodation is usually so expensive in Singapore. We used the gym and pool a few times. One night there was a wedding going on in the function room overlooking the pool. Location - didn't really have any issues with it... It isn't too close to MRT, but its only a 15 minute walk to Outram station. Not far at all! My major complaint would be the staff. Sometimes they were nice and accommodating, other times they would barely look at you. The worst was when we were waiting for a taxi outside the hotel to send a friend home. We waited 45 minutes. Now that wasn't the issue. The issue was the concierge staff were huddled around the front of the hotel, 4 of them talking to themselves. There were about 10 people waiting in line for a taxi, with 4 concierge staff doing nothing at all to accommodate the customers. After vetting our frustration, they finally decided they might try and get a taxi. My boyfriend asked to speak to the general manager. The concierge went to get duty manager, who apologised profusely. We asked for the name of the general manager, she gave an incorrect name. We asked to get his email, and she said she would call us in the morning which she never did. In the morning, a man came to apologise and gave us a signed letter from the staff, as well as a portable mobile phone charger. It was disappointing.. my boyfriend had stayed there once before and thoroughly enjoyed his stay. He made friends with the staff.

The room was clean and in very fine condition. Can't fault the staff for friendliness and professionalism - I tried to leave a small tip for the maid to thank her for doing a wonderful job and not only did she not take the tip but on returning to our room she had left us some complimentary chocolates. Location: At first glance the hotel seems like it is away from anywhere, but in reality its actually in the middle of many of Singapore's key attractions. Its only about a 15min walk or $3 cab ride away from Chinatown, and their is always a surplus of Taxi's out the front, so its sometimes much easier just to get in and pay the $3. Also we ate at Clarke Quay one night and had a very leasurely 15min walk back to the hotel which was quite pleasent. The hotel offers a shuttle bus to Orchard road and Chinatown during the day, you just ring down the night before and put your name on the list - it stops at a couple of hotels so sometimes gets busy, but we never had any issues getting a seat.

As I don't use it often (only for the safe) I don't bother changing the room, but at this rate (I paid SGD200 or so) it shouldn't be that bad. Food-wise the given breakfast (not the superior side one) cannot be considered as good. The choices were limited. Nothing was really fresh (I had some cold cut 1st day and it smelled weird/bad so I didn't try anymore). Since then I only limited myself to fruit and bacon. If you really don't like the food there, you still have a choice - there's a nearby food center called Zion Riverside Food Centre which serves many local food nice and cheap. It only takes 10 min. to walk there. Location-wise yes in fact it's not convenient if you rely on subways (MRT) more often so taxis is prob. the only options around because there are no stations around. And the only major complaint I have is the reception lady. I cannot make any 800-number call to use my phone card. I tried to tell her to help around but she just thought I was dumb and didn't press the buttons right. So she helped me make the call. But I had many calls to make so she was feeling disturbed w/ all the requests. I asked her to ask somebody to come up to \"fix\" it but she just ignored.

Of the room itself, I had a few complaints - the bathroom was leaning toward antiquated, perhaps a renovation in the next year or two wouldn't go astray...the toilet was slowly but constantly creating a river between the bottom of the bowl and the drain in the middle of the floor. However there was a shower and a bath, which was good. TV and other facilities (most importantly a personal safe in the room) were provided and appreciated. The room was nice and clean.

We then had a nice stay and the pool area at the hotel is one of the best I have seen is Singapore - pool is huge and nice spa attached. Service was great and the foyer staff excellant. We then returned 10 days later and once again given horrible little rooms (1202 1204) for 6 people. These even number rooms are just way to small for a family of 6 compared to the odd number rooms.They state in the brouchure Family suite in Tower wing.... well all it is, is two rooms adjoining and that is it.... I loved the pool here and would tell families to stay just for the pool area, but make sure you get odd number rooms in the tower wing on the non-smoking floors otherwise you will be very disappointed.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent rooms+Excellent Service+Excellent location=Excellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mmmmja", "ReviewID": "UR5856932", "Content": "When we arrived at the hotel after a very long flight the hotel staff notified us that our stay had been booked for August instead of September! It could have turned out bad but the hotel staff organised everything and we were even upgraded to the 18th floor! It was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in! With very very large beds, great views, huge TV, a safe and very clean bathroom. They also had a shuttle bus into orchard road and China town for free. The breakfast was nice, very large buffet slection and a little expensive when you have a family. We would highly reccomend this hotel and will be staying here again for sure", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Furama RiverFront", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d300321-Reviews-Furama_RiverFront-Singapore.html", "Price": "$203 - $285*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">405 Havelock Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">169633</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "300321", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2d/a4/86/facade-night.jpg"}}
