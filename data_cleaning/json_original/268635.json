The hotel was recently renovated and features the new Courtyard lobby and new guest rooms. My room was very nice and comfortable. Small flat screen TV and everything was very clean. Shamora at the front desk was very friendly and had a great personality. The guy working the bistro was more interested in watching the Olympics than helping guests. I also found the food from the bistro to be very poor quality. The chips were stale and felt like they had been left out for days. Every food item they served with the exception of the drinks were just plain microwaved food.

What disappointed me most was the fact that they do not have an on-site restaurant (except for breakfast), or room service and that the linens were pretty rough and low quality. But that's kind of par for the course at this level of hotel. On the good side, all of the staff members I interacted with were exceptionally nice, friendly and helpful. The housekeeping was quite good - my room was always thoroughly cleaned, but with respect for my personal goods (where at some hotels it feels like they just sort of throw your stuff around to get the cleaning done as quickly as possible). Despite the ugly Courtyard pattern carpet and the not-so-great bed and bedclothes, the room was pretty good - very large with a couch and free wired internet. The hotel is crazy close to the speedway, airport and Embry Riddle. I realize this will be a pro for many people, but it wasn't for me and I was woken up most nights by some kind of loud engine noises from one of those places. There are many places to eat in a short driving distance, but they are all chains like Outback and Longhorn or fast food. On the negative side, the heating/cooling system was just crazy and seemed to have nothing to do with any settings I chose.

My only complaint is about the beds...on both visits, the king sized bed is one of the worst I have slept on...feels like sleeping on a stack of cardboard, a real bummer because otherwise the hotel is one of the best I stay in during 25+ weekends of travel per year. More comfortable beds and I would rate the hotel 'Excellent.'
