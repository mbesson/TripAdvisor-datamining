We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this beautiful hotel. Lovely accommodations -- we were traveling on a moderate budget and it was the nicest hotel by far that we stayed at in Italy. A travel company booked our hotels, so we didn't research it much, but we were very satisfied. It apparently was built as a home in the 1500s, was apartments, and then renovated as a hotel about 5 years ago. It's in the Dorsodoro area, so is a bit off the touristy area, but we enjoyed the quiet location and got to see areas that we might not have otherwise. Large windows look over an open area and a small canal. Getting there was a little tricky rolling our suitcases behind us! (We got to use the \"Universal language\" in asking some locals how to get there--we had good directions, but missed a turn and went too far). If you go, download a map and look for detailed directions (\"streets\" are often very narrow passageways between buildings). Note: Google maps may not show the exact location of the hotel. Nice friendly service. Delicious breakfast goodies served on fine china. A true Venetian elegance. We found a couple of good restaurants nearby (although most close during the afternoon.) I will add what I tell anyone who goes to Venice -- be sure to visit the Gesuiti church (Santa Maria Assunta). It's not on most of the \"must sees\" but is simply breathtaking. It's clear on the other side of the island near the Fondamente Nuove vaporetto stop (where you get on the water bus to Murano) in northern Cannaregio. It was the last church we visited -- sort of a last minute decision -- and our favorite in Italy!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake city, ut", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way, but we loved it\u201d", "Author": "barbizondamazon", "ReviewID": "UR125518909", "Content": "The Hotel Tiziano describes itself as \"close to the train station,\" but it was a bit of a hike (over 6 bridges) with our bags.

The hotel is located in a quiet residential neighborhood of Venice. As much as this could be of benefit, this is also the ONLY drawback of this hotel. As it is located fairly in the interior of one of the six districts of Venice, getting there on foot could be a hassle if you don't have a comprehensive map of Venice. If you don't mind spending, you could take Venice's water-taxi and easily get there from Venice's train or bus station. If you travel from the airport by the Ali-Laguna boat, you need to get off at the stop called \"Zattere.\" From there it is about 10-15 minutes by walk, provided you don't get lost in the smaller side-streets. These side-streets could be tricky for first-timers as you could either be going round and round without making any progress or reach a dead-end and may need to walk all the way back or you could be walking in a totally different direction. Barring this shortcoming, this is truly a great hotel to stay. The lobby itself suggests that it is a cosy place to stay. The room was very comfortable and clean. The bath/toilet was fairly spacious. The small drawback of the bathtub is its half-door (a door that extends from one end of the wall to half the length of the tub) causing water to spill out of the tub when you shower. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were nice enough to make free print-outs of some reservations that I had made after I reached Venice. I know many places in Europe where they charge a minimal fee for similar services. Internet was free and came in handy to make museum reservations online. Their breakfast is awesome. This came in handy as I was mostly traveling seeing places. After a good breakfast, I could postpone my meal until early in the evening concentrating more on sight-seeing and worrying little about where or when I would eat next. If I needed, I could grab a quick bite and go on. However, eating in Venice was not at all an issue as there are plenty of places with a wide range of prices! Overall, this was a pleasant and memorable stay, worth the price I paid for, barring the tedious walk to the hotel from the pier (upon arrival) and from the hotel to the train station (when I departed) carrying my bags across the numerous bridges of Venice (bridges connect to sides of a district as Venice is built on water).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and welcoming\u201d", "Author": "Peter L", "ReviewID": "UR118950145", "Content": "We enjoyed our four night stay at the Hotel Tiziano.

A little apprehensive beforehand as my wife had booked it (!) and, looking at 'budget' hotels myself before we went, there were many with shared bathrooms, and others which looked unclean. However, fairplay to my wife, and much to my surprise this hotel was great! Our room was very clean and well equipped (TV, safe, Aircon, BATHROOM with shower, hairdryer and even a bidet!! - we even had a well stocked minibar). Our room even overlooked the canal at the side. Needless to say we were very satisfied. Staff were polite and friendly and all spoke good english and breakfast, although a bit basic and boring was adequate. All in all we couldn't grumble. The only thing that we could perhaps moan about was a time when we came back to the Hotel at about 6.30pm all hot, sweaty and bothered after another day of exploring every nook and cranny of Venice only to find the door locked and nobody on reception. After 10 minutes of banging on the door and constant ringing of the doorbell without success my wife knocked on the window of one of the groundfloor rooms and asked if one of the guests inside could come and open the door (which he did). When we got in i was gobsmacked to see that there were at least 8 guests sat in the breakfast room just opposite the reception!! They can all think themselves lucky for escaping a severe tongue lashing as i had, by that time, both nearly died of thirst and melted away! But, apart from that, The Tiziano gets a massive thumbs up and it's only a 10 minute walk from the bus station. As for Venice: loved it. Get yourself a token for the Vaporetta (canal bus) - it's well worth it as you can get around so much quicker and see all the sights. Visit the islands of Murano and Burano, and also take your Swimming costumes (if you visit in summertime) as there's a great beach on the island of Lido (also a short ride on the vaporetto). We had read that it's very busy and hot in july / aug - you're not kidding! Loads of japanese and americans, with several huge cruise liners in the port. But this wasn't a problem. What WAS a problem though was the heat and humidity. It was unbelievable! WARNING: do not wear any other colour top than white or black as it's only going to get drenched in sweat during those months - not nice, and rather uncomfortable, but at least you won't look like someone's thrown their pint at you. I'm sure i came back 6 pounds lighter than when i went! Thank god that we didn't have to share a bathroom back at the Hotel as that shower got some serious usage!! Also beware as 95% of restaurants / cafe's, etc add a service charge (which can be quite sizeable). Now, i don't object to giving a tip, infact much to my wifes dismay, i sometimes give one when it's not deserved - but what i DO object to is having to pay for the meal AND the staffs wages!!!! Not happy with that at all. On top of that a 'pint' of beer costs around 6 or 7 Euros (many of the prices are not shown on the food menus - again, beware). We weren't even eating in the more expensive locations either ( we had read somewhere that the quality and quantity of the food in Venice was poor compared to Italy in general, although i didn't really find that to be the case). We later went to a supermarket where the beer (for a large bottle) was priced between 45 and 75 CENTS! But \"Hey\" we all know that Venice isn't the cheapest place on earth, and a holiday wouldn't be the same without a bit of a winge, would it? Would we recommend The Tiziano?

My wife and I had a double room on the second floor overlooking a small, quiet canal, and our friend had a small single on the ground floor overlooking the same canal. Our room was large, comfortable, and attractive with wood beam ceilings. The hotel staff is very helpful in giving advice and making reservations. They have a basic knowledge of English, and our Italian is very limited, but the language barrier was not a problem. The hotel is in a very quiet residential area. Several excellent restaurants are within a 10 minute walk. The San Basilio vaporetto stop is about 5 minutes away. The Ca' Rezzonico and the San Marta stops are about 10 minutes away. Piazzale Roma is a 10-15 minute walk, as is the Accademia Bridge. The breakfast room and tables are small but we were always able to find a table, even when the hotel was full (about 16 rooms). The breakfast buffet is pretty much standard at all European hotels frequented by tourists. The Tiziano's buffet is supplemented with a couple of homemade cakes each morning. On 2 or 3 mornings, there were no more croissants left by the time we made it to breakfast, but this may have been due to the earlier diners taking more than their share. Still it was disappointing.

First time, a pricey hotel near St. Marks. Second time, an apartment in the Dorsoduro. Third time, used this site to search and decided on the Tiziano, which turned out to be perfect for us. We chose to disregard the complaints in some reviews that the hotel is \"too far from Saint Marks\" or \"hard to find\". Complaining that a Venice hotel isn't near Saint Marks is a bit like complaining that a New York Hotel isn't on Times Square. As for the \"30-40 minute walk to Saint Marks\" that one reviewer groused about, that's like saying that Times Square is difficult to reach by boat. Besides, everything in Venice - other than Saint Marks - is hard to find. The Tiziano is simple but elegant, spotlessly clean, air-conditioned, and efficiently run by a charming group of young signorinas. No, they did not offer to hump our suitcases up to our room, which would have been embarassing. Otherwise, they were cheerful and helpful. Observations: We splurged on one of their \"junior suites\", and got a nice-sized room on the second floor with windows on two sides, a little reading area, minibar, good bathroom and nice furnishings. The neighborhood is picturesque, residential, and very quiet. Tip 1: Since there's no way to see Venice without using the vaporettas, buy a pass as soon as you get there, and use it to get to the hotel. If you were driving or busing into Piazalle Roma or taking the train into Santa Lucia station, you'd hop onto the #2 boat, get off at San Basilio, and follow the directions the hotel provides from there. Flying in, you could take the 18 euro roundabout boat to Saint Marks via the Lido, or spluge 36 euros on the posh little boat which gets you there nonstop. I guess the economy option would be to take the bus to Piazalle Roma, and the splurge option the water taxi. Tip 2: Saint Marks is about ten minutes away on the same #2 from San Basilio. After exploring several delightful walking routes over to the Grand Canal, we found the fastest and most interesting was to cross the canal near the hotel at the Chiusa Sant Angelo Raffaele, follow the paving stones through the Campo past the Chiusa di Sant Sebastiano - just as if you were heading back to the San Basilio vaporetta stop - but when you cross the bridge on the other side of Sant Sebastiano, directly ahead of you there is what looks like a narrow alley, but quickly becomes a street with a lot of good restaurants and shops. It starts out as Calle Dell' Avogaria, changes names several times along the way, but takes you right down to the Ca' Rezzonico vaporetta stop on the Grand Canal in a straight shot. Less than 15 minutes for an aged, shambling, out-of-shape American. Tip #3: In the piazza behind the Chiusa Sant Agelo Raffaele, there is an outdoor restaurant called Pane Vino which became our favorite, as it obviously is with the local residents. Interesting menu - liked everything except the breadcrumb gnocchi - friendly service, excellent cheap house wines, and the best prosciutto I've ever tasted.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hudson, New York", "Title": "\u201cUnspoiled Venice\u201d", "Author": "Italyeveryyear", "ReviewID": "UR14685379", "Content": "This charming small hotel still manages to give one a sense of Venice before it was overrun by tourists.

En route to the \"main\" sites is the Accedemia and Peggy Guggenheim's house - two of the delights of Venice for us. the other delight was simply walking around, exploring the less busy areas.
