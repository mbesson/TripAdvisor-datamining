The hotel is presently undergoing some important (and needed) renovations, so it will be interesting to see and stay there after work is done, which is slated for end of 2012: new lobby & bar, bigger restaurant, revamping rooms and hallways. For now, its biggest feature is certainly its location, in the heart of Montreal's downtown core, nearby the Centre Mont-Royal where there are lots of conferences, including the one I was attending. Staff was very friendly, in particular during check-in and check-out. Breakfast was OK, with a choice of either hot or continental buffet, but nothing to write home about.

For convenience to the train station, we often stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth, but Omni had a fantastic promotional rate of $99 a night so we decided to check it out. If the sidewalks had not been so icy, it would have been an easy walk to the hotel. As it was, a short cab ride did the job for about $8. The location of the Omni is excellent, bordering McGill University, right on the edge of Mont-Royal, and right in the middle of excellent shopping and restaurants. The room wasn't overly impressive, but it was very clean, big enough for what we needed, and had a very large bathroom with lots of marble. The TV was old (and not flat-screen), which seemed unusual for a high-end hotel, but no big deal. As it turned out, my husband came down with a virus while we were there, so we spent a lot more time in the room than we planned. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast. The food was fine, not extraordinary, but it came promptly and was served with care. I booked a last-minute massage at the Amerispa downstairs. The massage was excellent, but the facility looked pretty tired. It could use some updating for sure. I also used the hotel hot tub on our final morning there. The health club that is beside it looks very good, with plentiful equipment. But the hot tub, change rooms and especially the \"steam room\" were not very appealing. I think there is a renovation coming up, and it definitely needs one. I didn't try the sauna because it was down the hall near the men's change room. I looked in and it was quite small and filled with some chatting men, so I took a pass. So while some aspects of the hotel could definitely be improved on, we would stay there again with no hesitation. I am a stickler for good service and the hotel aced this aspect! Everyone we encountered, from the front desk to the concierge, to the room service waiters, to the doormen, to the health club attendant, was extremely friendly and helpful. We felt welcome and relaxed and that makes all the difference. If you're staying here, make sure to sign up in advance for the Omni guest program. It gives you free WiFi, newspaper, a large bottle of water delivered to you after you check in, and \"morning beverages\" delivered free each morning. We ordered orange juice and it was brought on a tray with two apples. Finally, you should know that less than a block away is a great breakfast/lunch/coffee spot called Vasco de Gama. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and espresso and the staff were very friendly. On the morning we left, I walked to Au Pain Dore, a bakery also a little more than a block from the hotel, and picked up fantastic sandwiches for the trip home. I also bought a box of pastries...eclairs and lemon and chocolate tarts. They were insanely good! All in all, if you can get this hotel for a decent rate, it is more than worth it!

First, it must be noted that the rooms are in need of a re-fresh. The carpet, while clean, buckles in spots and the bathrooms, while large and with marble, need an updating. Yet everything is spotlessly clean, the hotel staff are great, delivering wonderful service, and the hotel food is also of top quality. Considering that Montreal is a city with wonderful restaurants, that a hotel kitchen meets that quality standard is very good indeed. The location of the Omni at Peel and Sherbrooke, right downtown across from McGill University, is also attractive. Everything is close at hand, including (as winter approaches) the entrance to the underground path system where one can escape the elements. The hotel front-desk staff are very friendly and helpful and will provide you with all information you need regarding your stay, be it for business or pleasure. The Omni \"select-guest\" program, to which anyone can join, provides complimentary morning coffee and juice delivered to the room, along with complimentary wi-fi access in the room. Not every hotel provides such complimentary wi-fi (but all should) so kudos to Omni for doing this.

To say the least, it was an awesome view of Montreal and the harbour. A beautiful site!!!! Montreal is a beautiful city with lots of history, shopping, and amazing dining.

We came up to Montreal from the states for a three night stay (and then moved onto Quebec City for three nights). I did a lot of research on hotels prior to picking the Omni, but kept coming back to it as we had stayed in an Omni in Philly and had a great experience. We are part of their premier club (forgot the actual name) and it comes with some nice extras. In addition, I LOVE the way they treat kids. We arrived around 12:30pm and were greeted with great panache by the bell men. Ready smiles and quick attention were so appreciated and we felt welcome. We quickly checked in but were informed our room was not quite ready. They did take all our luggage, store it for us, and present my daughter with her \"arrival\" backpack (yeah). We headed over to the Concierge who gave us some nice lunch choices and provided us with a map and some quick pointers. MUCH appreciated. The hotel is really well situated close to McGill university (make sure you walk around and visit their free science museum), shopping, tons of restaurants and the Metro. We came back a bit before 3pm and the room was ready. We were on the 18th floor and the room was lovely. It had a nice big King bed and a large sitting area with a little table and a wardrobe. The hotel is obviously older and carries with it the charm of a hotel from another era. That being said, it does not, in any way, feel in need of an upgrade. Our bellman helped unload everything and offered to get us ice. He gave us a quick tour of the room and then said adieu. We came and went quite a few times over the next few days and were ALWAYS greeted with smiles, open doors and even, once, when we were walking out, my daughter asked how we were getting to the museum and I said \"by Taxi\", by the time we had exited the hotel, the bell hop and run around through the door and had a taxi waiting ... so sweet. We also had great help from the concierge who gave us a discount to one museum and her card to get us speedy service at a restaurant (it was a HUGE help). One night, we had very loud neighbors that woke us around 1am. We waited a bit, but things just escalated, so we called down to the front desk. They were \"ON IT\" .. security was up within minutes and there was never another peep from the room next door. But, the most amazing thing was that by the next morning there was an email from the hotel manager apologizing for the incident (as if he had any reason to) and asking me to let him know if there was anything else I needed. What fabulous service. We also visited the pool and walked through the fitness area. It was all great. The pool had a neat little tunnel thing to get you from the hot tub out to the pool. It was nicely graded so my daughter could enjoy it and they had designated lap lanes so swimmers could do their thing, but kids could also splash around. I was THOROUGHLY impressed and will absolutely stay there again and recommend this hotel to my friends.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "G\u00c3\u00b6teborg", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back\u201d", "Author": "Sverige2", "ReviewID": "UR117003794", "Content": "Location next to McGill.

Old Montreal is about a 10 minute cab ride (or 30 minute walk) @ 10.00 CAD one way plus tip, or you can take the metro for about 3.00 CAD. Don't miss Notre Dame in old Montreal, a certain site to see. Rooms are decorated in a old world style, but very comfortable and very clean. I can certainly understand some reviewers complaints on the rooms however it is the style of the hotel and if you know going in you should not be leary. We had a total of 5 rooms all were different yet all clean and suited our needs perfectly. The beds were all very comfortable we all had good night sleeps. Rooms were cleaned in a timely manner and housekeeping always came by to check on things. The hotel will be going under a complete renovation soon, including all the rooms. The hotel staff was very attentive including the conceirge. We had a issue with a cab driver who dropped us off at a destination that was not where we were going, when we told the conceirge, she alerted the hotel manager and he reimbursed us for the cab ride on the spot, we did not even ask, he offered.. Great customer service. There is a pool/gym/spa, we did use the pool on a couple of occasions. It is a small pool and I do agree with a reviewer that the pool/lounge chairs are in desperate need of repair, but we were not there that long so we just dealt with it. They have food and drink service by the pool if need be. I highly recommend joining Omni Loyalty Program, you can join online @ Omni's website for free. There are some perks, and the best perk was a beverage/coffee for two each morning brought to your room at the time you specified (for free). When you check in you get a welcome packet, in the packet is the form to fill out for the beverage you want, time etc. It was there every morning without fail.

You feel that you are in a really top accommodation with all the bright colors. The check in sequence is very very fast and you get directly provided with your room key. the check out is even simpler as the bill is taken care of for you and slid it under your door. You of course get the chance to review it and inform front desk of any discrepancy. I really liked the loyalty program offered as for just being a simple member you get access to free high speed WiFi which for once is actually really high speed (thank you for living up to your promise) and free morning beverages delivered right to your door each morning. I had a room with breakfast, you should try the Opus breakfast, it is so simple and tasty, just what is need to kick start your day. What I really liked is that they don't just throw food at you but actually offer you with what you would be expecting regardless of what your expectations are. Staff Splendid and wonderful, always smiley always around you to provide you with whatever you need 24/7. Whether it is the really nice door men, the concierge, the front Desk staff, all are 5 stars and can't thank enough for a really nice service. Rooms They are very spacious with a desk area should you need to have some work done. Rooms might be a little old style but they are definitely very relaxing and very pleasant. they are equipped with all what you would need for your stay. The only remark I would have here is the safe box. While it is great to see a safe box embedded in the wall, it still feels safer to have a combination lock rather then a simple turn key. Location This is 5 stars, the hotel is located on Sherbrooke avenue in the heart of Montreal just a block away from the famous St. Catherines Street, Crescent, Villeneuve and other key landmarks in the city. Everything is 3 or 4 blocks away. Whether it is the metro station, the train station, great pubs, restaurants, bars... all are within reach in just minutes by foot.

We booked through Hotwire (shudder) and found a fantastic rate to a program they don't run anymore saving us lots of money. I had never stayed at an Omni before, they remind me very much of a Hyatt. Our room was clean and comfortable, we enjoyed the view from the 25th floor. All staff from the front desk to the doorment were polite and courteous. The concierge, who has been mentioned on her before, is wondeful. Go to them with any recommendations you may need. They mentioned restaurants, things to do (bike tour, whitewater rafting) and we took them up on all of it and enjoyed it. Pool and hottub are nice and relaxing, great view from the pool. Spent time at the bar as well and had breakfast. Got wake up calls too, one mistake but mostly very pleasent. As for the decor, compared to the more edgy and modern hotels like the Opus I can see why people might think the Omni is dated. Still, we found the decor tasteful and nice. No issues at all. There is a spa downstairs for those so inclined. We had such a great expierience here that we woudl give it 5 stars. However, when we checked out and got our bill we found we were charged for valet parking each day of our stay. We hadn't even used their parking lot! This was a big mistake and would've cost us over $150 in false charges if we hadn't caught it. Once we brought it to their attention they were very apologetic and fixed it right away, but I do have to take a star away for it. Overall though, a great stay and an awesome value.

To start with, when we arrived we were told that our room was a smoking room as matter-of-factly as if we had requested it. Neither myself nor my partner are smokers so I asked that our room be changed to a non-smoking room. We were told that the hotel was \"fully booked\" (which I find very hard to believe on a random weekend in February), and that the room should not smell like smoke. We opened the door to our room to the stentch of smoke which filled the room. It was disgusting. The furniture and decor in the room were atrocious. I have never seen such old, worn-out, dirty and out-dated furnature in any hotel EVER. The carpets were stained, the chair was sagging, the curtains were awful and the vents were clogged with dust. In addition to this there was one window which did not have standard curtains but instead a slated wooden cover which let in a tonne of light both at night and in the morning. We could probably have survived given the above, but in addtion to the disgusting smoke smell, bright lights and bad furniture, we were also placed in a room right next to the elevators. It was VERY VERY loud, and I barely slept all night as a result. We woke up in the morning feeling stuffy and sick, probably a combination of the smoke and dust in the room.

Our first impression when we walked in was, \"What have we gotten ourselves into?\" The room we were in had some kind of a chemical detergent odor. Almost as if the carpets had just been cleaned, or someone had been in there spraying Lysol for about an hour. Besides the odor, and the out of date decor, the room was fairly clean. The beds were small, but appeared to be brand new. There was a phone right above the toilet, which, we thought was odd, but we have our own phones anyway so it's not like we had to use it. Upon turning on the fan, we were overwhelmed with the smell of cigarettes. And eventually, the room started to fill with smoke. After making a complaint to the front desk we were moved to another floor. Apparently, you can smoke in this hotel. And since smoke rises, being on the floor directly above where you can smoke is not the floor you want to be on. (#24). Our second room was much better, and had no chemical (or smoke!) odor. The decor was still out of date, and the beds were still small, but again they appeared to be brand new, and were actually really comfortable to sleep on. Both rooms included a fridge, a heat lamp in the bathroom, and plenty of space for a couple of people. In terms of service, staff were friendly and helpful. Our bath tub wouldn't drain, but repairs were made right away. Toiletries and towels were re-stocked daily which was really nice. Use 1/10 of a bottle of shampoo? You get another.

It's not like I needed that extra shampoo, q-tips, soap, etc. But it was nice that it was re-stocked in case I did.

My expectations were high given the customer reviews, but my stay was somewhat challenging. Good: - service was excellent; staff were incredibly friendly and prompt when I had requests - room service was fast and the food was decent - the location is great - the hotel is downtown, so you get the tourist experience, but it's also a quick cab ride north to more authentic Montreal - the room was huge Needs improvement: - glasses in the room were dirty (not that I ever use hotel glasses, but still...) - the robes in the room were rough and itchy...I'd rather not have robes unless they're soft - right beside the bed was a window that didn't have a curtain, but a slatted wood blind. It let a lot of light in. - the TV was right beside the bed, but high up in a cabinet and hard to see even when sitting up - I wish it had a mini bar. I realize these may only be in certain rooms, but why not give me the option when I make my reservation? - free coffee in the lobby would have been a nice touch Huge headache: - no really; I ended up with a terrible migraine that ruined an entire day of my trip.

Except: the controls for the heat were broken, which I didn't discover until I woke up the next morning with my head pounding. The radiator was blowing out hot air. While the hotel fixed it quickly, it still seemed to blow out hot air even when we turned the air conditioning on.

Also the manager, David Kanter, provides outstanding and rapid service.

The suites are on high floors are especially nice: it is a good idea to ask for high floor rooms as we did. The included buffet breakfasts were also perfect: plenty of selection and nicely served. So, even though renovations are planned for late 2011, we still had absolutely no regrets about staying at the Omni right now. Last but hardly least, the location is ideal as other reviews have indicated. It is easy to get to good restaurants (try the Taj for Indian and a Chinese restaurant with Orchid in the name which is right on Rue Peel), great shopping on Rue Saint Catherine and two subway stops are within one or two blocks.

For the price and location, this hotel is simply unbeatable. Sure, it is in need of some updating, but along with that will come an increase in nightly rates. The Omni is located on Rue Sherbrooke, which is only a couple streets north of Ste. Catherine and a leisurely 30- minute walk from Old Montreal. Of course, you can always hop on the Metro, which is two blocks away on Peel Street. The metro system is incredibly efficient and easy to navigate, and it is especially useful when exploring the (slightly) more distant parts of the city (Botatincal Gardens, Olympic Parc, Plateu area, etc). There really isn't much else that needs to be said here, the location puts hundreds of restaurants, bars, shops and myriad other kinds of entertainment all within a short walking distance. Okay, so the price and location are unquestionably great, but what about the rest? Well, rest assured because the Omni Mont Royal passes with flying colors in all categories. Upon arrival we took advantage of the valet parking ($26.50/night, the norm for a major city), breezed through a simple check-in, exchanged some money at the front desk and found ourselves in our beautiful room on the 27th floor all within 10 minutes of arriving at the hotel. The room was incredibly clean and also very large. Some of the decor needs to be updated but all things considered it wasn't unattractive at all. Plus, the bathroom was massive and our bed was extremely comfortable. We tried out the pool, hot tub, and breakfast buffet and found each to be above expectations. The buffet, while both delicious and convenient, is quite expensive ($17.50, I believe) and I would suggest just walking around and finding a small cafe, There are plenty and we ate at some great ones on Rue Stanley. Overall, a great stay at a great hotel and we will most certainly book a room at the Omni next time we are in Montreal.

I got a really good rate that was hard to turn down considering the hotel is in an amazing location. What worried me most before we arrived was the various reviews about the outdated decor, ect. We arrived at the hotel and was immediatley greeted by the bellman when we pulled up. We agreed to valet our car which allows you to have in and out privillages. Its about $26.00 for 24 hours. This is a really good deal considering it is very hard to find parking anywhere, and why would you want to park in a garage elsewhere when it will be more and without in and out privilages. I read a few reviews about people complaining about paying for parking. YOU ARE IN A MAJOR CITY, YOU WILL ALWAYS PAY FOR PARKING. If you don't want to pay for parking, don't visit metropolitan cities. I recently went to NYC and it cost me $50 a day at the hotel WITHOUT in and out privillages. The $26 is a good deal. Anyway, the very friendly bellman took our luggage inside and we checked in. The front desk workers where also very courteous and welcomed us with a smile. We signed up for the free frequent customer program. This gets you free WI FI. We then proceeded to our room. Eventhough, the decor is not modern and a bit outdated, the room was very clean and cozy. I did read that they were going to have a major renovation of the hotel soon. To our surprise we had a wonderful cheese and fruit plate waiting for us. It was obviously a mistake made by room service, but it didn't stop me from eating that yummy cheese. However, about an hour after we had checked in, room service delivered us a nice bottle of aqua panna with a nice personalized card thanking us for signing up for the club membership. BTW, if you open the water thats available in the room, it will cost you $7. The standard room also had a small sofa and dining table, along with a desk. The hotel also has an indoor and outdoor pool, as well as a pretty well equipped fitness center. There is also a restaurant, louge and spa. However, we need used any of these facilities, so I cannot comment on them. The best thing about this place, is the location. We walked everywhere from this place. The weather was beautiful so walking 5-10 miles throughout the course of the day was great! You are only a few block to the major shopping district. Its about a 25 min walk to old town Montreal. You are also close to St Catherine which has many many bars and restaurants. In fact, there are hundreds of restaurants within a 20 min walk. Overall, for the money, you can't beat staying at this place. You are not traveling to stay in a room all day. If you are more concerned about the staus of staying i a nice room, then stay at the Ritz down the street and pay $500 a night.

We decided to stay at the OMNI Mont-Royal because of its proximity to Mont-Royal Parc and downtown. It is also considered one of the better hotels in the city. Before we left, our reservation was confirmed by staff at the hotel. The day of arrival, I called to confirm again, to let the hotel know we would be arriving in the evening. Again - no problem. So imagine our surprise when we arrived, weary from the drive from Toronto, to find we did not have a room. The hotel had overbooked. They offered us a \"boutique room\" - literally a fold-out double couch.. or we could spent the night at the Best Western across the street. As you might imagine, the three of us could not sleep on a fold-out couch... so we had no choice but to go to the inferior hotel where the OMNI had got us a room. Well without getting too into it - the room was horrible. A few examples: the bathroom reeked of smoke, on a non-smoking floor, and was in desperate need of renovation. I asked for a quiet room, and they put us on the third floor with our window facing a VERY noisy Sherbrooke Street. It was so noisy, I had to go downstairs at 12:30 AM to ask for earplugs. We got little sleep. While David Kanters at the OMNI offered his apologies and we didn't have to pay for the night we spent at the Best Western... that is cold comfort. We were in Montreal for only three days ... and one-third of our vacation was ruined. I was exhausted. We heard all kinds of excuses: \"Expedia overbooked\", \"All the hotel rooms in Montreal were full; we had to send you there.\" First, it is not believable that ALL the hotel rooms in the city were booked. And even if they were, a good hotel would not treat their guests like this. Especially when small children are involved. Needless to say, I would never stay at this hotel again. There are enough other hotels in Montreal... why risk having the OMNI \"overbook\" and send you to an inferior place I would never have my family stay at. I think a good test of a hotel's quality is how they react when there is a difficult situation. On this - the OMNI failed horribly.

Our room was a little spacious, but nothing in it stuck out to us. The room decor seemed a little outdated. The bathroom was a decent size, but nothing out of the ordinary. Internet was $10 CAD. The pool and fitness area looked very nice although we didnt get an opportunity to take advantage of the pool due to the rain. The hotel is situated just 2 blocks (steep uphill blocks!) from Mont-Royal Park, which we never experienced before. The hotel actually had a card showing a 2-3 mile path/route to take in the park, which we took advantage of. It was a nice hike and gave us a good workout.

We arrived at the hotel at 9 am assuming that we would have to check our bags and go explore the city while waiting for a room to come available. Amazingly we were able to get into a room immediately, even though this was on the weekend of the Grand Prix auto race. The room was very large and welcoming, and the air conditioning was quiet, something that often seems hard to find in hotels. The thing that impressed us the most about the Omni, however, was the responsiveness of the staff. We were on a non-smoking floor, and at first everything seemed OK. Late in the afternoon, however, when the air conditioning unit started, the air coming in smelled of stale tobacco smoke. Very unappealing! We mentioned it to the front desk and they promised to investigate and also offered to move us to another room if we preferred. We opted to stay in the same for that night and see what happened. By the next day the air coming in through the air conditioning was fine, but the best thing was that early that evening, the hotel sent us eight chocolate covered strawberries and a half-bottle of a very nice French white wine. There was also a note apologizing and explaining that they had found a patron who was smoking in their room on an adjoining floor, which was also supposed to be non-smoking and which was tied into the same air system as our floor. Their response made us feel that they had taken our complaint seriously and cared about our business. The hotel is ideally located right next to McGill University on Sherbrooke in an area that has many galleries, restaurants, boutiques, and museums. It is also very easy walking distance to the primary shopping and commercial street, Rue Ste.Catherine. It is a bit of a walk to Old Montreal, but not bad, and there is always the Metro.

We selected this location for our meeting because of the wonderful service the staff gave us, and overall the experience was great. I arrived earlier than planned to the hotel (around 1:00 pm) and within 30 minutes, was given my room. A large, spacious room with a view of Mont-Royal. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. The only odd thing about the room was that the bathroom had a phone in it and when you got a wake up call, it rang in the bathroom. Strange, but effective in getting you up in the morning. The location of the hotel is superb. It is a few blocks north of St. Catherine's street, so it isn't that noisy and is right by McGill university. It is within easy walking distance of many restaurants, and the subway (Peel station is the closest). They had a fitness centre that is accessible 24 hours (with your hotel room key). I checked it out more than a few times and found that it had a lot of equipment choices. We stayed at the hotel for a business meeting and the staff there were beyond compare. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure that our meeting was a success. When I arrived, the staff had a plate of fruit and bottle water waiting in my room to thank us for having our meeting at their hotel. It was so thoughtful and really appreciated that. The staff at the front desk and concierge were equally as helpful and gave us excellent restaurant suggestions. A tip: sign up for the hotel's select guest program. It is free and will allow you to get free internet access in your room, a free newspaper each morning and a free beverage delivered to your room. We bought cereal from a grocery store and ordered milk each morning, and voila...had breakfast ready to go. The only complaint that I had (and it is minor) is that I felt that the staff were in our rooms quite a bit sometimes. I would leave for the day and sometimes return midday to drop off purchases. Obviously the room would have been cleaned by that point. Once I returned in the evening for the night, someone else would have been in the room again because I noticed that some lights were on and a robe placed on the bed. I mean, I really did appreciate the gesture. However, it made me think twice and realize that my belongings did need to be secured. Again though, this was a very minor complaint. I have been to Montreal several times and before this had always stayed elsewhere.

Having read one scathing review, below, I thought it best to offer a different perspective. Yes, the rooms are dated, in that the carpet is wearing and the TV, while still fairly modern, is not a brand new \"flat screen\". But the rooms, and carpet, are very clean, the amenities are all present, the service generally very good (and far better than some hotels that I stay in for business), and the food, either room service or down in the informal dining room, is of excellent quality and well served. While some new furnishings in the room would be nice, along with updated mechanics, by no means can it be said, from my perspective, that the hotel is dumpy or unpleasant. My wife and I are very picky and have walked out of some hotels over the years--that has never been a contemplated response at this Omni in Montreal. The beds are comfortable, the showers roomy, the soap of good quality and the towels plush--plus very pleasant staff, who seem to stay with this hotel as we recognize the same folks from stay to stay. Given the excellent location right in the heart of the city (no need to rent a car or to drive your own, just give it to the doorman and walk and Metro everywhere), plus reasonable room rates that are probably a reflection of the fact that room renovations are needed, we find the Omni hard to beat, and always enjoy our stay.

Even so, I got there, stayed for a couple hours and couldn't bring myself to spend 3 nights there - even though it was such a good deal - you have to put a price to your enjoyment. If you are going to Montreal and don't plan on spending any time in your room - just a place to shut your eyes at the end of a busy day and not spend a lot of money then I would say go for it. It is a good location - right on Sherbrook and Peel - close enough to the shopping on St. Catherine (just a couple blocks - totally walkable), can walk to Mount Royal, the art museum and Cresent St (probably can't walk to Old Montreal though - that might be a bit far). But there are TONS of hotels in Montreal that are a great location!!!! Montreal is a very walkable city - everything is pretty close to each other - so if you stay at the Ritz, Sofitel, Hotel de la Montagne, Hyatt, Sheraton, Marriott, etc you will be in a great location - it's nothing that JUST the Omni has. I also have to say that the staff people WERE very nice as all the reviews said. They tried very hard to be helpful. The concierge was always smiling, they gave my kids \"kids packs\" on check in with little toys, offered to send milk and cookies up the room - and with signing up for the free loyalty program they send one hot and one cold drink for each guest to your room in morning and you get free wi-fi - but even so - THE ROOM!!!!! I just couldn't stay in there for 3 days. It was so dingy - low, low ceilings, cracked baseboard, dirty carpet, old furniture, old little tube tv. It wasn't dirty - like the sheets were clean the the bathroom was clean - but the furniture is all scuffed and cracked and wobbly, and just stains from wear and tear everywhere. Yuck. When I asked if there were any 'updated' rooms they said no, they were all like that and the hotel will be undergoing an renovation. They REALLY need one!!! The pool is closed till May but they did advertise a hot tub so I thought \"ok, no pool, but my kids can go in the hot tub to splash around a bit at least\". The hot tub was TINY and also gross. It was all cracked around it and attached to the empty pool that was all gungy and ugly to look at - I don't know who would sit in there. The gym is ok at least - but nothing great like the website makes it look. If you don't care about a pool or the quality of the hotel and you get a good deal then I can see how people like it and gave it great reviews - good location, friendly staff, cheap compared to other \"4 star\" hotels, good loyalty perks - but there is NO WAY it should be rated a 4 star hotel - I don't see how a hotel in that condition can be rated 4 stars??? Unless it's historic and gets extra points towards the rating system for that. I would compare the rooms to an older Best Western at best. For me I prefer to stay somewhere that's a bit more modern - that at least has furniture that's not all mashed up and clean carpet - and like I said, the location is nothing unique to just the Omni (nor is the view - lots of hotels face Mount Royal as long as you get a high floor) so I would give it a pass if I ever went back to Montreal. :-(", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cGreat place treat you life a star\u201d", "Author": "DennisD2", "ReviewID": "UR58296368", "Content": "Great Place Treat you like a star... has alot of things to do right in the hotel fitness center, spa, massage, pool, bar, valet parking, and restaurants.

We have stayed at this hotel numerous times before and I am a Select Guest (Platinum level). We have opted for this hotel in the past because of its location and the hotel amenities. The Omni has historically had an outdoor heated pool with year round access. this can be important if you have children who need to have an activity to pursue (one that will burn up some energy). One of the nice things that the hotel does is provide complimentary cookies and milk for children upon check in. We arrived quite late on Friday night and were advised that they had run out of cookies. We agreed to cookies and milk for a subseuqent night of the stay. First thing Saturday morning, my daughter was up and dressed for the pool. Off we traipsed to the pool only to discover that the pool had been drained for the winter. Given that it was closed last Spring for repairs, I inquired if the reason for the pool's clsoing had been for repairs. I was informed (by health club staff) that the closure was a cost saving measure. When I asked about the basket of fruit that was usually present at the health club in the morning, I was advised that this too has been discontinued. I indicated my displeasure with the new cost savings policies and asked why I wasn't informed of the pool's unavailability when I called to make a reservation. The desk clerk asked me if I had asked if the pool was open. To me this was akin to having to ask if the elevators were working. While the front desk staff arranged for passes for my family and me to use the Montreal Amateur Athletic Club across the street, they were visibly unhappy that i asked for passes for more than one visit. During out visit, housekeeping was spotty. One day the repleished shampoo and soap, one day they did not. One day they left mineral water, one day they did not. Finally, we arranged for delivery of the cookies and milk for my daughter, the last night we were at the hotel. The cookies and milk were to come at 9:30 p.m. When we called room service at 9:10 p.m. to see if we could get the delivery moved up, they advised us that this would not be a problem. Unfortunately, room service did not show up until 10 p.m. (by which time my daughter was asleep). Not a huge deal, but indicative of the lapses that appear to be ocurring with regularity.

When you charge more than the airport charges for something, you KNOW you are overcharging. I understand that you also get access to a printer / copier / fax machine, but please. It is still a bit much. 2. The batteries in the remote control needed changing.

The finish on the wood furniture was worn in several places and the bathroom exhaust vent was clogged with dust. The service at this hotel was the most disapointing aspect of our stay.

Any person that can do a 15 sec. Internet search could have gotten that list. IMO it is the job of the concierge to give actual recommendations of places in the area that are good, not simply hand the guest a piece of paper w/ names.

The night of our wedding reception my husband had tried to use the nearby parking lot and got lost coming back to the hotel to pick me up, and when Ramzi saw me waiting there, he refused to leave although he was already off duty, until my husband returned eventually and we were off to our reception. I also had medical items that needed refrigeration, and Ramzi got us a fridge for our suite, which helped me enormously. I have dietary needs and one day asked room service if they could toast my own wheat-free bread, which they did cheerfully and delivered to my room in a little basket.

The stay was for a friend's wedding and we were given a fair rate of about CAD159, I think. Check in was a breeze with no paperwork as we were \"preregistered\" as members of the program. Bell men and valet were friendly and efficient. The room was very spacious - I believe we had a King Dlx or something - on a high floor with views up to Mont Royale. There was a desk and table and sofa. Closet space was very good. Plenty of hangers. No mini bar - just a non-functioning refrigerator (used to be the minibar, I was told by the bellman). When informed I needed to keep some medications cold, he quickly ran for ice. It turned out that this was a big help as I would later find that the ice machines on my floor and the next THREE down were out of service. Bed is very comfortable with good sheets. The frequent guest perks continued with the daily pressing of one item of clothing (though there was an inroom iron, if needed). A complimentary bottle of Evian was also provided. And coupons for the delivery of free \"Morning beverages\" of choice and the offer of adding pastries/toast for a nominal charge. They brought a large pot of coffee and 2 large glasses of OJ and ice water each morning at exactly the time requested. membership also offered free WiFi in the room. The bathroom is fine - though a little dark and the ceiling is rather low, as I recall. I did my makeup in the bedroom area, as a result. The safe operates with a key rather than passcode, which is a little outdated, but fine). I think that a tighter security system would make me feel better about staying here alone in the future. Late one night a very shady character approached as we returned from a late dinner and then proceeded into the hotel, ahead of us, and wandered around the lobby before he spied the elevators and decided to go up. I am certain he was not a guest or even a guest of a guest- but there was no one in the valet area or front desk to report him to or to question him. A bit disconcerting. We had a drink in the bar on our way out on Friday night. I didn't think that the barstaff had the usual sense of spirit one might expect at a big city hotel watering hole. They were a little slow and disinterested. Overall, however, staff was uniformly courteous and housekeepers were friendly and cautious (no propped open doors, etc.). The pool area is quite nice and well protected from the breeze and the indoor/outdoor hot tub area was amusing. Amerispa (separate management) is the spa located in the lower level of the hotel. I had 3 different treatments here and all were good - though at the end of my facial, she tried to sell me more than $600 worth of creams with dire admonitions about the aging process - never a nice way to end a relaxing 3-hours. And that's all. Check out was easy. The location is fantastic - and there is an entrance to the underground city from directly under the hotel - which would be great for a winter weather trip.

I would recommend the place, especially if obtained at a price of less than USD $100. Room The room was mid-sized and included a King-sized bed and a television dating from the 90's. Standard cable package. Bathroom was clean and plenty of towels (3 large, 2 small, and two washcloths). Bathrobes were included for use during our stay. We had a view of Sherbrooke St. and some of the McGill campus. Location The hotel is centrally located (on Peel & Sherbrooke streets) and is opposite the Peel Metro station and McGill University campus. Shopping begins on St. Catherine and food and entertainment venues can be found two blocks west on Bishop and Crescent streets. Gym & Pool The gym was pretty extensive for a hotel gym. It is open 24 hours. Three modern treadmills and a host of older equipment. Lots of free weights and weight machines. The pool is open 12 hours a day and outdoors but has a connection to an indoor hot tub. The hot tub fits six comfortably. Parking Parking is complicated. The hotel wants $26 for valet parking. Nearby garages want about $15-20. There are metered parking available on Sherbrooke (and more realistically, on the up-hill streets like Peel St. running perpendicular to Sherbrooke). The meter costs $6 for 2 hours; however, you can add more time using any meter-station, including the one right in front of your hotel.

She informed us that it would be cheaper for the 4 of us to get a 10-ride card on the metro as we could share the card. WRONG. The card is per person and it costs $3.50 for the card and you top it up after that. Useless for a weekend trip. 2. I asked about parking at Jean Talon Marche. She said that it may be difficult to park as there was only street parking and that there was no lot. So the 4 of us took a subway there (very easy) but after purchasing tons of stuff, had to try to take a taxi to haul the items back. Would have been better if we could have driven there....why?

The closet contains a very small safe (not big enough for a 13\" laptop) and I was pleased to find two convenient bathrobes (a big bonus for me as I think all hotels of a certain star rating should at least offer bathrobes with the room). I do think that the placement of the TV in the cabinet is awkward in the room, but apart from that, there's absolutely no complaints about the room. Our room looks onto rue Sherbrooke with a nice view of the hills. I am especially pleased that I was offered free wifi by simply joining the Omni's frequent visitor's program (otherwise it is $9.95/per noon to noon). I have paid upwards of $14.99 US for the same privilege at other hotels and I think this is a great way to add a little extra to a stay. Also, the woman at the concierge was helpful and friendly when we asked for directions and an umbrella during the continued downpour on Saturday.

I liked the Omni though despite that - probably because I don't want to live in the room too much and there's the price-value combination to consider. I got a good deal on priceline - it pays to join the Omni Select program to stay here, free beverages in the AM and free wireless internet if you need it. I did however get the room next to the elevator and the ice machine which had heavy use on the weekend - and maybe in part that's because of the price I paid and so too the lack of window view. However it's not all negative - the location is pretty darn good for getting around Montreal, easy walk up to the Mont itself, by McGill University, lovely views of the city. Lots of restaurants nearby and the main shopping drag on St Catherine's St/Rue is very close too. Old Montreal is a fair walk, OK if you are reasonably fit, or short cab ride. There is an STM Metro station on the next block, station 'Peel.' As soon as it warms up a little, the cafe culture kicks in - and you can eat, drink, chat on the sidewalks in a European scene. The staff at this hotel were pretty darn good too, all speak excellent English if you do not speak French. Montreal is a complicated city, quite cosmopolitan with its ethnic 'quartiers' and social structure - so it's always entertaining. Food is a speciality here, you are spoiled for choice, Jazz is big here in bars and at the summer festival, on the streets people play classical guitar, sing arias or small jazz quartets perform around Berri-UQAM station in spring and fall too- it's a classy town in many respects. The old town by the waterfront, the Biodome, the gay village even amazes Americans - because it's all mainstream and presented with some 'je ne sais quoi.' It is very safe for tourists and you do not need to speak French - although Bonjour and Merci get you a long way :) Montreal has its own flair and it's definitely worth a look. What you think out the norm, they take for granted - it is a different culture in North America - and different is good! As the home city of Cirque du Soleil you can always try to land on dates when there's a new show launch - as there is right now. Their hockey team is a current bone of contention, so best not to mention them. Montreal is not cheap to eat, it does have its problems as all large cities do, but is presented downtown with a certain degree of uniqueness that make it worth a stop.

Again at check-in, we reiterated that we needed somking rooms to which they replied \"just take these\" with a wink. I don't know how you'd interpret that, but to me that meant just take these rooms but keep the smoking to a minimum. Within the next 2 days we were herassed by the hotel management on 4 separate occasions. The first time, they complained that the smoke detectors in the room went off - we told them we had asked for smoking rooms - they still refused to put us in a new room. The second time was at 11:30 on a Friday night (please note the time and day of the week) and security came up to say there was a noise complaint!!! I was alone in the room at the time and listening to music at about 1/2 of the maximum level you'd get from the TV. Still I was nice enough to turn the music off. The third time, security woke us up with real loud banging on the door. We opened the door and they asked us how many people are staying in the room and forced themselves in to check!!! The 4th time they woke me up again apparently because my friend was smoking a Djarum (Indonesian clove) cigareete and said we had been given 3 warnings and had 20 minutes to vacate the premises!!! This was the most embaressing thing I have ever endured in my life as they stood there for 20 minutes while we packed our stuff. I should mention that the manager refused to talk to me and didn't even know who the hotel room was registered to. She said it's not under my name! After 20 minutes she finally sent someone to check and they came back saying it was under my credit card. At this point the manager accuses us of smoking Marijuana in the room!!!! Imagine the nerve on some people. Needless to say, we had enough and agreed to leave on the condition that we would not be paying for the rooms at all (we had got very little sleep in the past 3 days and this was supposed to be our down time, before we hit the town again on Saturday night). There were 4 witnesses present and the so called manager understood clearly the condition under which we agreed to leave. I just found out through my credit card company that the whole length of the stay was charged to the credit card, even the nights that we didn't stay!!! This was by far the single worst hotel experiene I've had.

Room service was delivered more promptly than promised - food was decent and reasonably priced. I had a great pedicure in the hotel's spa, again at a reasonable price, and we also enjoyed the hotel's swimming pool and whirlpool.

First, the MiniBar can become a hidden fee on your credit card unless you make sure to check all bills and get a copy of the checkout charges. We got billed for the MiniBar from the prior patron at the room. We were never told of the charges at time of checkout. And, not until we returned home, many many miles away, and checked our credit card - that a charge for $120 was added. If we slipped on checking the credit card bill - we would have been at a loss. The Omni did not correct the bill immediately - because it was unable to verify the MiniBar charges were NOT ours. And, because we did not have a paper copy at checkout, we had less credibility. So, forget the nice smiling faces and the joyous grandure front desk -- make sure you get a checkout receipt of all your charges. Or else you may get charged AFTER you get back home. Don't forget -- they have your credit card on file -- and can charge you. Chasing this error back -- to being a MiniiBar Attendand error cost us (the customer) two long distance phone calls, conversations with family members -- to make sure we did not make a mistake, calls to the credit card company, and emails to omni hotel. Anytime you stay at a foreign country -- make sure you get all necessary documents -- do not rely on nice hospitality . Everybody makes a mistake. Careful if you are traveling with Kids. They will eat the candy and not say what happened. So, Omni makes sure the candy is just about the level kids can reach -- and no LOCK. Both are recepit for disaster. And the patron will pay --- for this trick. We were lucky not to have kids with us, at this stay. But if you have kids, get all the Mini-Bar stuff out of the room.

The concierge's advice with respect to restaurants, travel times and the weather report was poor. The quality of breakfast and room service was weak by 4/5 star hotel standards. It took the hotel staff 20 minutes to check us out because they couldn't figure out how to let us pay in part with excess CAD we had. Adding insult to injury was the fact that the hotel manager walked by us as his staff was visibly having trouble checking us out and said/did nothing.

The king-sized bed was really really comfortable, and the curtains (though slightly outdated) did a nice job of keeping the sun out. The TV had plenty of channels and the small guidebook in the armoire was helpful in finding nearby places to eat. We never made it to the pool or gym but free access to guests is a very good deal. The hotel was quiet and the housekeeping staff kindly respected the \"do not disturb\" sign no matter what time of morning it was. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Omni.

Although there is really not much of a lobby to speak of, it was clean and had a few chairs and tables but certainly nothing that would invite you to spend any time there. The carpet in our room was quite stained and dirty. I needed to plug in an electrical appliance and was disgusted at what I found behind the headboard along with years of dust. The one sitting chair was stained and the furniture scratched and chipped. The beds were quite uncomfortable although the comforter and sheets were way above average (perhaps to disguise the rundown beds). The front desk although courteous seemed understaffed and abrupt. Several times throughout our stay I was put on hold only to give up after five minutes and recall. Calling the concierge I found them to be friendly however, they needed to refer me to the front desk as they could not address my questions. The bellman was very pleasant but told me he needed $20 cash to park the car overnight. I also tipped him five dollars for taking my suitcase out of the car and $10 to a second bellman who brought it to my room. The kids were excited to take a swim in the pool only to find out that it was closing in five minutes (9 p.m.). The following morning we did go down to the pool and found it to be very \"kid unfriendly\" consisting of three roped off lap lanes clearly designed to cater to the gym crowd. The swim tunnel had chewing gum stuck in various places in the plexiglas was so scratched and dirty it was hard to see through. Although I did not use the gym I did walk through and notice all of the usual machines seemingly in good order. Unfortunately I did use the men's locker room and found it to be in less than acceptable condition. The hotel apparently derives additional revenue by opening this up for local gym membership to the outside as 70% of the lockers had padlocks on them. The showers appeared moldy, the ceiling stained, doors under the sink unhinged, hair dryers caked with soap and old shaving cream, a feeble attempt at putting out a few paper cups for mouthwash some combs one can of shaving cream but no razors, one scale and it was broken, no additional towels other than the undersized frayed towel issued at the check-in desk. I could go on and on.... the entire facility seemed old ,neglected and dirty. On the day of our departure we attempted to get a late check out and were told that the hotel was sold out for that evening. In the end they did reluctantly tell us that we could stay until 2 p.m. keyword being reluctantly. As we did not have much luggage to begin with, we carried our own bags down to the car and found that it was just as well since there appeared to be only one bellman who was attempting to help 4 different people.

It was a good rate compared to other hotels listed as 4 stars. When we arrived the man at the check-in desk, who turned out to be the manager, informed us that we had booked a \"parlor room\" which had a sofa bed. If we wanted a room with a proper bed we would have to pay an additional $35+taxes per night. We decided to check out the room. The room was filled with furniture - table and chairs, coffee table, lounge suite, dresser, TV armoire - but for a bed there was a cot. The cot was 3 feet wide and not big enough for 2. We went back to check-in and asked that they give us a room that was suitable for two people. When my wife politely asked why we were sent to a room that clearly sleeps one, the manger asked her why she was being rude to him. This was not the type of response that we expected based on the hotel's description of itself and its service. After 15 minutes of front desk confusion we were sent to another room. This time with a pull out sofa bed. We accepted this room, mainly because we were late for a show we had booked. This bed was terrible. The mattress is very thin and bowed toward the center. Springs poked into my back. I should have slept on the floor. After a lousy nights sleep I am looking into my options. We booked and pre-paid for 3 nights, but if I can get my money back for the remaining nights I am leaving. I am a frequent traveler and have never encountered beds like these in a 4 star hotel. I think most travelers would agree that the two top criteria for a room would be \"clean room and bathroom\" and \"comfortable bed\". I do not understand why the Omni chose to fill these rooms with superfluous furniture and leave out the most important part - a comfortable bed. I looked again on-line and the description of the \"parlor room\" was indeed parlor with sofa bed. I naively assumed that any beds in a so-called luxury hotel would have been acceptable. Caveat emptor. I would avoid this hotel because of its beds and its poor service. Instead of trying to offer a better solution, the manager tried to up-sell us on another room. If I had known that the beds were so terrible when I was booking I would have factored in the additional $35/night to get a decent bed and booked elsewhere.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cExtremely impressed\u201d", "Author": "JeremyK", "ReviewID": "UR8042481", "Content": "We stayed at the Omni in late June 2007 for two nights on a family vacation in Montreal.

Walking from outside you will never expect to see the incredible surprise about the great Lobby they have. Not only very classy, but also beautiful. From the furniture to the lighting. Check in was very easy and the staff was very friendly. (That is a plus for me). All staff was bilingual, especially Julie at the Guess Services desk, she was very helpful and very friendly. We had a room in the 31st floor. Having a room in the highest floors helps regarding the noise outside. However, all is part of the experience. This is a hotels located in the middle of downtown Montreal. Listening to the outside noise is part of the great experience that is Montreal. Any hotel located in Downtown will have the same noise background. The room was very clean and perfect. The bathroom was huge, and very clean. We called several times the housekeeper for different reasons, and they helped us every time. A+++ for housekeeping. The view from the room, PRICELESS. There is nothing to describe the view from our room. We decided to go and have dinner at ZEN, the Restaurant at the Hotel. Another GREAT surprise. ZEN Restaurant was not only very nice and comfortable, but the food was \"INCREDIBLE\". We eat so much, and tried many different plates, also the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. Did I mention the free wireless Internet? ohh yes. In addition, if you are a \"Select Guess\" (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free), you get free coffee and newspaper in the morning, delivered to your room. WOW. Also, if you decide to go out and try one of the many restaurants in Montreal, you are just feet away from them and the metro station is next door. We did not go to the Spa, but everybody knew is the best around. Maybe next time. I travel a lot for work (IM a flight attendant) and for fun, and stay at great Hotels around the world, including other Omni Hotels, but I have to give the Omni Mont Royal another star and Diamond for such a great time we had there.

What most disappointed me about my stay was when I was leaving Sunday morning, I wanted a soda for the car ride home and there were not any stores open before 9am. There was also no vending machine in the hotels - so I went to the cafe where breakfast was being served and asked for a soda to go. I was charged $4.50 for the can of soda. I was outraged by this and can't believe that the Omni would take advantage of their customers in such a way. If you don't provide a vending machine then you should not charge anymore for a soda to go then if i sat and drank it in the restaurant. This really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

We were on the 30th floor and the city view was marvelous..we moved our couch across from the window and enjoyed the night skyline .

King bed was very comfortable with a nice down blanket cozied between two sheets. Bathroom was basic but very clean with an added bidet perhaps? hahaha could have been for the guys to use..I'm just not sure. We took advantage of the outdoor pool the next morning as it was a nice sunny day. A dip in the hot tub afterwards was just what we needed.The spa/gym pool area is quite nice, especially the locker room that carries the little extras such as shaving foams, hairspray, body deodorants and washes , cotton balls q-tips , hair dryer etc.to use after a workout. The only downfall was at the time of check in they ran out of minibar keys which we could have used after our drive however we just scooted to the bar and had a drink there instead and forgot to ask for one on our way back to the room Also..we didn't receive bathrobes which I could have put to use, but no biggy ! Our room was very clean and service all around was great. It's those little touches mentioned above that make the Omni a wonderful place to stay in my opinion.

One much need upgrade since my last visit was the in room wi-fi - which thankfully was included in the room rates. Beds and pillows were comfortable as always, but the noise levels from the street remain an issue - as is true in most Montreal hotels. I had a Jr Suite which is very spacious and has 2 full baths, 2 TV's, a VHS/DVD player, a large sitting area with a smallish desk. Live plants make the room feel more personal. Even though the decor is very formal, but the hotel isn't stuffy and staff is much nicer than at the Ritz Carlton. The Omni sits on Sherbrook just a short walk to St Cathrine's and the shops. Maybe 4 blocks from the restaurant area around Rue de la Montagne. The Grey Lines bus depot is also just five minutes walk. You are a taxi ride from Old Montreal. Room service is prompt and decent food, but as usual it's pricey. They have the Opus Bar where you can catch a sandwich or other light meal B/L/D and Zen, a popular Chinese restaurant on the lower level. The drinks at the bar were OK, but seemed a bit weak. The bartender was a delightful man and very helpful to all the guests, even making dinner reservations for a group when the concierge was busy. They serve a small selection of hor dourves between 5 and 7 PM included with drinks. They do need to upgrade their TV to something more modern and bell staff was surprisingly absent, as was the doorman most days.

I got to the room, took my shoes off and the housekeeping person was there instantly with the rollaway bed and offered to set it up right away but we declined, wanting to keep the open space in the living room available. The room was very nice, great view of Montreal-the mountain and MacGill Univ. Typical suite with mirrored french doors leading to the bedroom. Had room service one night, don't recommend that. The gym and other facilities were nice. Didn't use the spa, they were booked solid for two days but it looked very nice. Bell person and concierge were all very helpful, staff was A++ all weekend. Parking was 75' away for $15CAD/night, not too bad. Hotel's location is great. I've read some of the reviews that say how \"tired\" this hotel is and it does show some wear but overall, it is still very nice, even the first room they gave me was larger than a normal single/king bed room. I would definitely stay here again if I got the great rate that I did ($129/night for Sat. and Sun.-New Year's eve).

We only asked for directions to the casino and the area Outremont and not much else, since I have been to Montreal numerous times before, and their driving directions got us there without much problem.

Then the next day parked next door at the open lot for $21 Cdn. (But you need to get up at 7am to move the car! Because otherwise they would charge you for another time period.)

When I asked them to give us another room, I was told it was the only one of its type available, whereby I suggested that they had 3 choices - 1. they could upgrade the room; 2. they could call the manager; 3. we could go to another hotel. They found the equivalent room on a higher floor. One day we returned from sightseeing to find that the beds had been made, but that was about all - the coffee pot and used cups were left dirty; the ice bucket was brimming with melted ice instead of being emptied and replaced with a new plastic bag; one of the used terry robes supplied by the hotel had been removed and not replaced. On the first night of our stay when we had inquired at the Concierge desk about restaurants in the area, we were given the names of some restaurants but little else, and it was my opinion that the concierges behind the desk were unprofessional and not well versed in what was available. (We live in Boston, where, on several occasions, I have been in hotel lobbies and overheard the concierges giving information to guests in a thorough and professional manner.) Montreal is supposed to be a sophisticated city. As it turns out, I do not believe that Concierge is a regular position at the Onmi Mont Royal; rather, I think the people at the Front desk rotate to the Concierge desk, because one of the people with whom I spoke about the poorly cleaned room was behind the concierge desk on the last night of our stay and actually gave us INCORRECT information, pretty much ruining our evening. We had asked if there was a restaurant atop one of the hotels where we could see a view of the city, as we had done in Quebec City. She gave us the name of the Delta Hotel, where she had said we would be able to have a drink and dessert, since we had already eaten dinner, which we had seen others do at a similar venue in Quebec City. However, when we arrived at the Delta, we were told that such was not the case, that there was only a complete buffet dinner served, leaving us without a plan for the evening. Montreal is known to be a city with lots of jazz - with a yearly jazz festival - and when we requested some venues, the same \"Concierge\" supplied us with only 2 locations and little information about what was offered at each. To top everything off - there was a power outtage on the last night of our stay. The hotel lost power for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, depending upon with whom you spoke. As a result, we were forced to leave the room earlier than planned and before we were really ready to leave. Nothing worked and a horrendous noise was blaring from the loudspeaker. By way of explanation, we were later told that the electric company had cut a cable. The Omni was the only hotel affected. In all fairness, we were given complimentary continental breakfast one morning and reimbursed for the taxi fares to the Delta and back, plus some compensation for poor service, but the loss of power they considered to be \"an act of God.\" When we received our bill, they had overcharged us $20 per night above the contracted rate, The explanation for the overcharge was that the rate \"had just jumped up,\" to which I replied that, if anything, the rate should have \"jumped down.\" In short, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - and how anyone could give it the 4 star review upon which I based my decision to stay at the Omni Mont Royal is beyond me.

In general I am not sensitive for sounds and through my Omni Hotels select guest membership I had asked for a quite room away from the elevator and on a high floor. Unfortunately, I got a corner room on the 22nd floor with a connecting door. During the weeks when nobody else was staying in the room beside me it was ok even if I could clearly hear the elevator and the ice machine. But during the weekends when the room beside me was occupied it was like having those people staying in my room. The connecting door did not stop any sound at all and the last night my neighbors were partying all night long and I could not get any sleep at all. If you have stayed at Omni in San Francisco you will probably be disappointed with Omni Montreal.

From the torn & tattered carpet and scratched furniture in the rooms to poorly maintained common areas this would struggle to meet most national chains standards. The \"health club\" facilities is an odd arrangement of various rooms filled with antiquated equipment and the restaurant is much too small for a hotel this size.
