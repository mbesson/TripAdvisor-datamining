The hotel has an ideal location for that, just a five minutes walk from the Messe Berlin / ICC south gate. For a business traveller, there was an affordable internet connection in rooms. It mostly worked very well. Breakfast was better than average even though I went as late as 10:30 am, continental with bacon, ham, sausages, salami, cheese, cerials, yoghurts, very good fresh juice, coffee served to your table and so on. There's a nice small bar with some drinks and small snack. The closest metro station is less than five minutes from the hotel. I found enough good and affordable restaurants nearby. This is a good place to stay for anyone going to the ICC or Messe Berlin for work. However, as the rooms are small and there's no air conditioning and the bed wasn't that good, I wouldn't choose this hotel for one week's trip or longer.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland TX", "Title": "\u201cOK except for no air conditioning!\u201d", "Author": "trustenp", "ReviewID": "UR18365867", "Content": "I stayed here in June and July of 2005. OK, so I'm an \"ugly American,\" but in the U.S., we expect air conditioning in the summertime, vending machines with snacks and soda, and comfortable beds. This hotel had none of these things. True, Germany is at the latitude of Newfoundland, and air conditioning may not be necessary, but the sun was absolutely ROASTING this hotel when I was there, and I had to sleep with a wet cloth on my face to get any rest. Soda was available, but only in a \"mini-bar\" (actually a kind of cooler with no power, so the soda was barely cool). The only snacks available were from a convenience store across Kaiserdamm, and then only through a little window after hours. The bed felt like a prop from a window dresser's equipment shop: very thin, fit for placing a mannequin on, not a hotel guest. I will say that the room was clean and the bathroom also quite clean and well-equipped. I suppose you could call it a bargain in Berlin for EUR 65 (at the time, USD 76 per night), but had I known what was missing, I'd have sought a better spot to stay for some extra money, since this was my first visit to the country. A friend in the city chose this hotel for me, because it was near her house.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cOK for low budget\u201d", "Author": "WorldwideTraveler001", "ReviewID": "UR6724464", "Content": "Stayed there during the world cup as it is very close to the underground which takes only 10 min to the city and Olympic stadium.
