Also, our room was right across the elevator and we were able to hear people knocking or talking louder than average in the hallway. Overall impression: It's affordability won me over. I only needed a place to stay for 1 night so I booked the cheapest room. If you're staying for a few days, this may be the hotel you're looking for.

That is what it is and that is what you get. Small (10 x 15 ish) room with a tv, dresser, desk, closet, bathroom, nightstand. It feels more like a room in someone's house than a hotel. It is in a very old building. So, if you are looking for a brand new room in a brand new building - this is not it. There are some cracks along the floor boards and the caulk might be a little old. But, the furniture has been updated a bit, and the rooms have been painted. I thought small cottage room. They were also laying new carpet in the lobby when I was there on the 6th. The lobby was already nice. I had NO view to speak of , but at the end of the hall the door was open to the fire escape which I walked out on to hang out and look down at the vagrants in the middle of the night. Breakfast - which is seldom offered at downtown L.A. hotels was adequate. The standard make your own malted waffle machine, bagels, toast, cold cereal, oatmeal packets, yogurt, orange, pineapple & apple juice, coffee, fruit. For free - perfectly acceptable. If you wanna spend, there is an 24 hour IHOP directly across the street. You can also walk over to the Sheraton and pay $15-$40 if you like. I did not see any bugs, and believe me I looked. Several buses are right out front, and you should be able to walk anywhere in downtown from here. There is a train nearby, but I'm from L.A., so I've never been on it. This is definitely not the Ritz - where I've gotten worse service. It is definitely the Milner. If you are saddity or highfalutin, this may not be your spot.

The hotel does not have parking per se, but there is a lot two doors down for 11 bucks a day. That is a pretty decent deal in downtown L.A., most hotels charge in the 20-30 dollar range. There is no in and out privilege though, so be prepared to use the Metro or walk. The room is *very* small and there is no view to speak of, except for a large building next door with fading, chipped plaster coming off of the brick foundation. The shower was a stand up type (no bath) but they did include small bottles of the toiletries. They didn't give up towels, but the maid brought them within 30 minutes of our check-in without us having to ask. The television was in pretty bad shape, it was a picture tube model Zenith and it had a heavy green tint to the picture that couldn't be adjusted out. The selection of channels was not bad though.

It is a small, almost straight shot to the venue. There are lots of things in the area, a supermarket right across the street (doesn't everyone forget sodas/snacks and dread paying the massive fee at hotels) and several 24 restaurants including IHOP and Subway. Check out was very simple and we were on our way having paid very little for the night. Keep in mind, this is a *NO FRILLS* hotel, and you are not getting much more than a bed, a roof, and a television (green). The location is excellent and I found the bed to be comfortable and the pillows to be quite serviceable (I brought one of my own anyway).

Ofcourse,. we weren't told this until we had already parked our car. Street parking is free on Sunday. They did have a deluxe continental breakfast that was included in the price of the hotel. The breakfast was good and the breakfast lady was friendly. Friendly is a word for a few of the staff there but not for the manager DAN. The next morning,we approached the management to discuss the issues we had the previous night but all he said was that he was aware and that they moved us into another room. Besides being rude, he could careless about customer service or about the people staying in the hotel. No concern or regret. I don't understand how someone like that can be the manager of a hotel in busy Los Angeles not having any people skills.

No aspect of the stay was acceptable in any form, and I immediately began trying to find another place of lodging. Eventually, I had to give up, and resigned myself to the worst hotel ever. Location: This is how they get you. Located across the street from Macy's Plaza and about two blocks from LA Live, it seems like a very good value for as low as $60 a night. But trust me- no matter how bad you think it is, it's worse. Much worse. Room: The first warning sign was that our door was quite literally kitty-corner another, with yet another door just to the left. The 'room' turned out to be about 16 feet long and maybe six wide. The bathroom was in disgusting condition, and the sink wasn't even in the sink- it was next to the bed, with no towel rack or even toiletry stand to put things on. We had to resign ourselves to using the dresser. The carpet and curtains were dirty, and when we tried to close the one nearest the bed, we found it was attached to the wall with a nail and not by a curtain rod! Getting into the room was a chore itself, requiring three to five swipes to get the reader to even register. The TV was from the 80s or so and didn't even work. It hung from the wall above the end of the bed, and my girlfriend hit her head on it about three times trying to get to the other side. There was no alarm clock, but that's okay- as the June 24 review stated, we backed onto an alley and garbage trucks paraded down it every morning at 6:30 AM. Service: Friendly but completely inefficient. Each day of our stay, housekeeping would take our dirty towels but never replace them, forcing us to call for new ones before taking a shower. Same with toiletry items; by the third day we had no shampoo left, and it was not replaced, nor was new soap left. Amenities: None. The hotel advertises 'free WiFi', but with the caveat that it only works in the lobby. Every day it was jammed with guests trying to get on. The ice machines didn't even work. The one elevator is still as shaky and scary as it was described in the older reviews. Conclusion: No. Just don't stay here. It's worth the price increase to stay at City Center or one of the LA Live (JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton) hotels, or worth the trade-off in distance to stay at somewhere like the Biltmore if you're attending an event at LA Live. No matter what you think you can live with, this hotel is not suited for normal folk.
