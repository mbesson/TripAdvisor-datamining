The apartment was split into two halves separated by double doors, which was really handy and better than we expected having booked a senor 'studio'. The kitchen was well equipped, including a decent sized oven (great for a quick meal of pizzas purchased from nearby supermarket Rewe). There was a full-sized bath in the bathroom which was lovely for a soak after a long days' sightseeing. The apartment was absolutely spotless on arrival. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, and when we mentioned that the kettle in our apartment had an intermittent fault it was replaced immediately. U bahn is so close you can literally see the station from the reception building. Only a 10 minute walk from Alexanderplatz.

We had high expectations given the very favorable Tripadvisor ranking, other reviews online and direct feedback from friends we trust. The hotel was \"fine,\" but by no means recommended for a first time stay in Berlin (or even a second or third.... ) There are far more interesting and pretty design-type hotels. Once I saw Amano on the second day .... closeby also in Mitte .... I knew we should have stayed there... and it's pretty much the same price! Horrible feeling. Also, Lux 11 and Weinmeister were at the top of our list .. and unfortunately, the higher Trip Advisor ranking made Schoenhouse win out. The lesson here? Go with your gut feeling and not just the numbers. Yes, this is true apartment-style living but there's probably better apartments via VRBO.com or Air BnB if that's the route you want to go. Berlin is REALLY spread out so know before you go .... and why not stay in a hotel if it's pretty much the same price? The room.... While large, it smelled like a one big ashtray ... we were invited to move one day later into another room .. .which was a nice offer but a pain. This is not an uptight American complaining about a smoking smell but rather .... the smell hit you over the head as soon as you walked into the room. We did move rooms for the subsequent nights, but we heard A LOT of noise in the rooms above (hardwood floors so the noise really carries) We are not early people - we are talking noise at 12am, 1am, 2am..... Normally, in a hotel ... you could complain to the front desk .. but after hours - there's no one to call..... and it's not really feasible to have to deal with the issue directly with the other guests... Hey, it's their holiday too. The room was clean when we arrived (*there's no maid service throughout and I never did figure out how I would have called someone after hours*) and the bed and sheets were also fine but not great..... The towels were really small and thin but that's more of a minor comment..... The whole room's vibe was drab and tattered ... it was probably nice about 5 years ago ... but definitely a little worn now. Having traveled extensively in South America in the mid 90s when I was in college, it reminded me of one of those cost-effective utilitarian pensiones/guesthouses. The staff was friendly and efficient ... but always seemingly in a rush. I'd look into another hotel.... read up as there seems to be a lot of new hotels in the city..... it will be a much more enjoyable, unique and comfortable stay. I even checked out Amano (just to torture myself maybe?) and the staff seemed friendly and the vibe very cool. I probably should have tried to move hotels but we had been traveling for the week prior in Paris so weren't up for another move... We also had to pay in full (is this normal?) so sort of expected that there wouldn't have been a very friendly return policy.

The room was a large loft style room with a small kitchen that would allow you to have coffee, eggs, toast. Not equipped for large meals, but we bought a few groceries and had breakfast in the room. The bathroom was large and comfortable. Nice strong, hot shower. Towel warmer too. Centrally located, excellent front counter service. The employees were very, very nice. The front counter closes at 8p.m. and one night I accidentally locked myself out of the hotel room. There is an emergency phone number on the front door of the hotel, We called and in about 10 minutes somebody let us in. They have bikes you can rent, which we did. Only 10 euro's for the day, which is less expensive than other places. Metro is 5 minute walk... As you leave the hotel, turn left and there is a grocery store a block up the street on the right hand side. Also, there is a pizza place two blocks up that is very, very popular.

We started IKEA, remember? Schoenhouse Apartments is white and minimalistic in style, but the slickness? I guess you'd have to pay more than 95\u20ac a night for that. The staff was great. Friendly and helpful, with a sense of humor. The cheap pickup at Tegel in time. Late checkout was no problem - although they forgot to mention the extra fee. The location is really really great - just opposite are on of Berlins best rock and indie clubs. One block down hipster restaurants and stores. Three blocks up the little bit ruffer Kastanieen All\u00e9e with great vintage shopping and nice small shops and restaurants. One block to the west some of the best bar in this area. The pricing was really modest, we hooked up with some of the nicer rooms since it was so cheap anyway! Bathrooms okay, a big balcony, plenty of space and all that... You can get four guys in a room for less than 25\u20ac per head! It is an apartment hotel, so there was no minibar - but on the other side you didn't have to sneak past the reception with your beer, ashamed that you won't put up with the hotel prices... And since the reception closes fairly early, there is no one complaining if you bring friends in the middle of the night either! Sounds like a great place for spending a weekend with your hipster friends? Well, it would've been great. If it had soul. If you're going for that scandinavian style with the whitened birch furnitures, the all white painted walls, metal/plywood chairs and concrete balconies, then you'd better do it with a sense of design that is 100%. And you'd better tend to the details. Or even better - have some details! Personally I'm not into that kind of design anyway - I'm more the cosy chestefield sofas and green plants kinda man. But I guess a minimalistic and fresh hotelroom is fine. At least it's fresh. But Schoenhouse Apartments. It was empty, cold and depressing. I'd rather go for filthy, gray and chaotic (you are in Berlin, aren't you?) - at least you'd feel alive, rather than in a morgue. Oh, wait. I guess in a morgue you'd get some kind of pillow you could actually sleep on? What I got here was a square meter big cushion, unfortunatly without a 2,5 meter long bed. I had to fold one of bathtowels into a pillow to be able to get some sleep. I gave this a 4 average. I mean, although I'm coming onto it really hard it was still a great staff and location and I can't complain about the price or the cleanliness.. I think I'm just disapointed because they where doing everything so well, but they had to go bad and boring nordic design on it. It's not romantic, or cosy, or charming in any way. It's cold and boring. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends who are cold and boring.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "No Fixed Abode", "Title": "\u201cA Haven from the snow...\u201d", "Author": "nathan_black", "ReviewID": "UR93331061", "Content": "We stayed in our apartment for two nights just after Christmas, arriving just in time for the coldest winter in years!

Nearby is a good sized organic supermarket and next to it is another very large supermarket so it's very convenient for shopping as the bigger one was open till midnight. It's also on the same U-bahn line as Potzdammer Platz where the multi-screen cinema shows a huge range of English language movies, all-day, every day so if the weather is terrible, it's really easy to go and watch a movie. You can be there in about 15 mins - it's just so easy with Berlin's terrific public transport system. Although the apartments are in an area which was formerly in the GDR, you'd never really know this as the area has all been smartened up and is very stylish and feels very safe. We loved our stay at the apartment, the beds were comfy, the kitchen is really well equipped and the bedding is snowy white and soft. Lovely bathroom too. Can't fault it at all. Downstairs is a small informal cafe where they do lovely cakes, snacks and breakfasts. You can also have a meal there and it's very reasonable, and the food looked lovely. Having said all this, I don't think I'd visit Berlin again in the winter as it really is very cold indeed and you can't really appreciate the city fully when you're battling through a snow-storm.

I am sure we made the right choice. This is a really workable and cosy place. We had a one bed apartment in the new building - on the top floor. The bedroom was huge, the living room/kitchen fine size (though a bit smaller than the lower floors as the balcony cut into the room space not added on). Bathroom small and not luxy (no bath but it seems its hard to find a bath in aparthotels in Berlin) but perfectly ok. Lots of hall space for buggy, good TV and DVD set up before we arrived (just ask when you book). In all it felt like home from home quickly. The location is great if you have kids - Kollwitzplatz is only 5/10 mins walk away and has a playground (more English speaking kids than Germans it seemed!) and many child friendly pavement cafes around the square. The main sites of the Eastern side of town (the museums) are walkable in less than half an hour - longer to the Brandenburg Gate and Tiergarten. What was perhaps most useful for a family stay was the deli/cafe. You can pop down in the morning and get a breakfast to take up, and they do very nice pasta until 8pm or so, again you can take it to your flat to eat in. Made it really easy not to have to plan every meal and know that there was always a last minute option. supermarkets are v close. would reccomend daytrips to potsdam and wansee via train. and dont miss the interlocking courtyards", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "BonnieMax", "ReviewID": "UR21468478", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Schoenhouse Apartments in October 2008.

The hotel is located in the old East Berlin area, so the surrounds are a little bland. It is located between two U Bahn stations, only minutes to the Rosa Luxemburg station. There are two supermarkets just down the road. The hotel can do your laundry for you, but can be a little expensive. For a small load 4.50 Euros to wash and 4.50 Euros to dry. The rooms are a good size with a large bathroom and a reasonably equipped kitchen. The room was clean, but the 4 days we were there not once was our room cleaned. We were only given one small bar of soap between three of us for 4 days. It would have been good if they supplied a small amount of coffee, tea, sugar and milk for the first day.
