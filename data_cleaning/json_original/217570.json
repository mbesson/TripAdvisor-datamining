And downtown Branson is also about 3 miles away. The room was nice size. The beds were comfortable. But I cannot say the same things for the bathroom. It was small and crampy - well, kind of. There was hardly enough counter space for one person to put the cosmetics. If you are staying two people (we were), one of you will have to put the stuff somewhere else. Also there is no hanger behind the bathroom door. You just do not know where to even put your clothes (note that I said put, not hang).

As what girls do...our weekend was spent on SHOPPING! Where to shop? You must check out the Tanger Outlet Stores and The Landing. I've stayed at the Barrington before, but this would be my 1st review. All I can say is this stay was better than the last. The reason was before, they were renovating the hotel. The hotel then seemed dingy and old. Now, it's newly renovated and fresh. It even smelled good when we first walked in. The front desk was friendly and hospitable. They greeted us with smiles and seemed to really be accepting to have us as their guests for the weekend. There is ample amount of parking at the front and back of the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean. The hotel also serves free breakfast, but be early or you won't have much food to eat. It seems that 1 hour before they close the hospitality room, they don't refurnish food. This hotel is not on the 76 strip but we were very close to it. It was good not to hassle with the traffic on the strip. Try to avoid the strip and use the other routes if you can help it. If you want to be adventurous... go ziplining! Use the Branson Zip Tours, which is located \"outside\" of Branson and not \"in\" Branson. The tour \"in\" Branson seems boring. Who wants to zipline and see tops of buildings? As for the Branson Zip Tours, you zip above tree tops. We chose the \"express\" zip which is their longest line. However, be ready because at the end of the line, the only way down is to jump 100-feet free fall. We were scared at first, but it wasn't really that bad. Yes, you seem to be jumping off a plank on a ship, but it was exhilarating! Also, don't miss the Dixie Stampede! It's by far my most favorite show on the strip. As for food...

The manager came promptly when called and offered another room which we declined since we couldn't find a problem and it wasnt that big of a deal. However, when we took a shower later, we discovered the bathtub wasnt very clean and the hairdryer didnt work. When we called the front desk about the new problems, they immediately moved us to another room down the hall. This room was ok except for the strange smell which had a close resemblance to cigarette smoke cover up. The shower head was spraying water out behind it, all over the ceiling and over the curtain onto the lavatory and floor. Maintenance fixed it the next day while we were gone. Overall, the staff was very friendly, accomodating and very prompt with the problems. It sounds like we complained alot but the rooms really had those problems that needing attending to. We stayed on the 4th floor which was quiet. The beds and pillows were comfortable and clean. We didnt use the indoor pool but it looked nice. Since we usually go to SDC when we are in Branson and this hotel is not very close to anything, we will more than likely stay at a different hotel next time. There arent many eating places close to the hotel either so we had to drive a good bit to eat. The breakfast was good and the hostesses were very efficient and friendly and kept the place clean and stocked very well. However, if you want to get something to eat without having to fight your way around the place or to get a table, you better eat before 8am during this time of year. The breakfast area could be laid out better to accomodate bigger crowds. All the food and drinks were crammed in a tiny part of the room so that everyone had to step on each other. I've had this kind of breakfast at other hotels with crowds and it was much easier to get something to eat. We decided it was easier to get something to eat at one of the local restaurants even though it was added expense. Overall, the hotel was mediocre compared with others we've stayed at with similar rates even though it has been recently remodeled.

We arrived a little bit early, and although the Tourism Center told us check in was 3pm, the front desk staff had no trouble allowing us to check in a little bit early, around noon. We had requested a ground floor room for easy access because we are both disabled, however, upon arriving at the hotel we discovered that due to the fact that the Barrington is located on a hill, there is direct parking lot access from both the first and second floor, as well as a central elevator with access to all floors. We accepted a room on the second floor, and the front desk clerk was nice enough to put us as close to the second floor's outside access door as she could. It definitely made unloading our luggage and subsequent shopping purchases MUCH easier. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean. The beds were comfortable, there were plenty of clean towels, the room contained a small mini-fridge for our drinks, and a flat-panel television to watch during our downtime. The in-room air conditioning unit appeared to be fairly new, and we appreciated how well it worked considering the sweltering heat and unbearable humidity Branson was experiencing during our stay. The pool area at the Barrington is exceptional, and contains a large hot tub and a pool that was, to me, surprisingly large and 8 foot deep at the deepest end. There is plenty of room whether you are swimming for recreation or exercise. Additionally, I was VERY impressed by the handicapped access to the pool. One entrance to the pool area requires that you climb a short flight of stairs, but there is an additional entrance that is equipped with a wheelchair lift/elevator. I had never seen pool access quite like it. The pool itself has a wide staircase at the shallow end to allow for easy access for the handicapped/disabled. The pool area is kept very clean and stocked with plenty of extra towels, eliminating the need to bring towels from your room. The only disappointment we encountered at the Barrington was the complimentary breakfast bar, which is offered from 6:30-9:30 am in the third floor conference room. The selection was large and included biscuits and gravy, a selection of cereals, bagels, donuts, boiled eggs, sausage, bacon, fruits, juice and coffee, however many of the offerings were nearly inedible. One morning, the biscuits were served individually wrapped in foil, and they were so hard you could have used them as a weapon. The following day, they were much softer, but lacked flavor, and the gravy had the same texture and taste as the flour/water paste that is sometimes used for craft projects. Both the donuts and the bagels were exceptionally dry, the sausage was bland, and the fruit selections were somewhat under-ripe. On a positive note, though, the highlight of the breakfast, were the waffles, which we were allowed to make fresh. There were waffle irons provided, along with a dispenser and small disposable cups that each held enough batter to make one waffle. Plenty of butter and syrup was provided, and we were able to make a pretty decent breakfast on the waffles and bacon provided. So breakfast ended up not being a total wash, but I think the hotel could save itself some money and customer dis-satisfaction by offering LESS selection but higher quality foods. Overall, the Barrington was well maintained and well appointed, the staff were friendly without exception, and the location-away from the noise and traffic of the strip, but centrally located and convenient to both attractions and shopping locations-made it the ideal hotel for our stay.

Our room, a King Suite had a sitting area and hot tub. Some in our party mentioned the small vanity in the bathroom, but my husband and I had no problems. There is a flat screen TV. I helped one of our group to her non-smoking room which had a strong aroma of smoke. The front desk quickly responded to her concern with a thorough spraying. I'm not sure I would have been able to remain in the room even after the deoderizing, but the staff did try to correct the problem. Our room had no unpleasant aroma and was very clean. The drapes on the windows are 3 layers. There is a top decorative layer, a middle sheer, and a black out layer next to the window. I provide this information because it took me a while to determine how to close the window treatment for privacy. The continental breakfast (6:30 - 9 am) is provided in rooms on the 3rd floor. Because we had to leave for our meeting at 8 am, we determined to be at the door when breakfast opened. At that time, there was already a long line outside the door. We couldn't even get in the room to check the offerings to see if we wanted to wait in line without those standing in line thinking we were breaking the line. We would have liked to get our breakfast and take it to our room, but, to do this, we would still have to stand in the long line. We continued to check the line until about 7:45, and it remained as long as it had been at 6:30. If you stay at this hotel, I would suggest waiting for breakfast until about 8:30. I asked the desk clerk the breakfast line was always long, and she indicated it was because they had a large bus clientele. I would suggest that the hotel consider providing another breakfast area for guest who would just grab a cup of coffee or juice and a roll and return to their room.

We stayed here for two nights. We travel to Branson ALOT! and sadly we are spoiled and like to stay at a more upscale facility, but we wanted to cut expenses a little. We booked this through hotwire. Like I said we come here alot so i was surprised I had never stayed here, then checking out reviews on here I was skeptical. What a delightful surprise. Sure it wasn't a 4 or 5 star, but it was pretty nice. Very clean. Good beds. A little out dated but that gave it character. Nice pool area. Nice lounge area. We did have an issue with housekeeping. They threw away food. I had never had that happen. I thought they werent suppose to throw anything away unless it was in the trash or by the trash. We had left over pizza sitting on the table, they through it away. I was shocked. We had alot left over and had had it in a cooler, but took it out just before we left so we could dump and refill the cooler with ice. We came back an hour later and it was gone. I called the front desk, at first it was like oh well, then we explained the price of the pizze because it was gourmet and we were planning on eating it. Well about 45 minutes later, the manager called, apologized over and over. I said thats okay, I just appreciate the call from you and the apology. About an hour later there was a knock at the door and it was the pizza delivery. They had reordered our entire order!!! and they paid for it!!! I was totally shocked!! still am. Talk about ozark hospitality!!!! They didnt have to do that. With service like that I would gladly stay again!!", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201conly as last resort\u201d", "Author": "v82", "ReviewID": "UR10274631", "Content": "Booked this hotel as no other available for time period needed, very dusty in room, carpet had stains, remote not working, and room had funny smell, perhaps spray to cover other smells.
