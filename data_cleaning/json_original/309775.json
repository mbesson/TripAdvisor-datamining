The staff was wonderful!!! Thank you especially to Alessio and Simona who took extra special care of us. Their restaurant is not open for lunch so make sure you plan to rent a car or buy groceries if you plan to hang out there during the day. The breakfast is great and the dinner is EXTRA special, romantic and VERY delicious! We arrived in Tuscany and spent 4 nights here before our wedding in Cortona and it was the perfect place to unwind, relax and feel like you're in Italy. Our room, Torino, was super cool...lots of character and the fireplace made it extra cozy.", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR616934931", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Hvalfangst"}, {"Content": "Scorpion in room; Gym/Spa is ridiculously overpriced The resort itself is lovely, although the rooms are fairly basic. We had a scorpion in our room which made it difficult to relax. We tried to eat outside but were covered in bees and bugs. One of the reasons we chose this resort was because of the gym. However, upon arrival we discovered that the gym is outrageously expensive. And you can't even use the bathroom in the gym when you are sitting by the pool--you have to walk all the way back to reception. Most of the staff were really friendly but we were given horrible directions one day and spent half the day lost. I would highly recommend the cooking class--it was excellent. The breakfast is average and overpriced (it sits out all night waiting for breakfast). The resort doesn't serve lunch and nothing is in walking distance so you have to get groceries (but here is no oven or toaster) or drive 15 mins into the nearest town. We enjoyed our trip but thought the attempts to squeeze money out of you at every turn put a damper on it.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR721153383", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SandALondon"}, {"Content": "Perfect location, perfect accomadations, perfect staff My husband and another couple spent two glorious weeks at Monsignor Della Casa..We found the accomadations to be just what we hoped for and more..We stayed in the Fratoio 2 villa..the kitchen had all the necessary equipment but we ate out most of the time..Enjoyed the restaurant on site..especially Simone who ran the dinner hours..We found the staff exceptionally helpful in getting us reservations for restaurants and museums..They even arranged for a wine tasting at Castle Trebbio...We were blessed with warm and sunny weather and found the location to be convenient to all the sights we wished to visit...the train from Borgo San Lorenzo was a 40 to 50 minute ride to Florence..the highway from Barberino de Muggello took us south to Sienna and West to Lucca without any difficulty...we also enjoyed the surrounding Muggello region...a very special place, staffed by some very special people..We can't wait to return...", "Date": "Oct 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR819661157", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nanub"}, {"Content": "Great Stay!
