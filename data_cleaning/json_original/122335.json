They advertise free WiFi, but on our visit Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday it could not be accessed. The four people working the front desk indicated it was a common problem (many others regularly complained) that only the manager could address. But he didn't. None seemed to care. They seemed most sorry for themselves for receiving so many complaints. Even though we paid in full for our stay on our credit card prior to its start, we had to get dressed in the night to go make a cash deposit of $10 for local calls. Then we had to go back again to pay $5 so that we could make a long distance call, even though they had our credit card number. There is a big flat screen TV, but no breakfast, no refrigerator, no coffee pot, no alarm clock, no microwave and worst of all no positive attitude toward service. The first morning we found ourselves standing in 6 inches of water during our showers. They fixed that and broke the shower. They offered to change our room. We asked and received permission to check out 1.5 hours late, but the manager told us we could have an hour. When checking out we asked for some consideration for all the inconvenience. The manager. Mr. Patel, sat in his office 10 feet away with the door open and didn't even come out or acknowledge us as we complained to the front desk. Given I could hear him clearly speaking to the front desk through his open door, I finally went into his office and told him, \"Wouldn't it make more sense to come speak to us face to face?\" We were told we deserved no consideration because WiFi is free, we had used a $10 off coupon from the internet at check in and he was kind enough to allow us to check out 1 hour late without charging us $25 as is hotel policy. Worst of all was management's attitude, \"I have been here for 25 years. Go ahead and complain.\" He refused to give us contact information so that we could complain to the corporation.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cworst place to stay\u201d", "Author": "philytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR15151017", "Content": "if you like constant noise, doors slamming, hookers in the hallway. pot smell, this place is for you.also plan on not getting any sleep. the noise and people in the hallways is non-stop.i can't believe that ther could be so many rude, crude, and obnoxiuos people gathered in one place. and management doesn't care, i stayed at this place last year, and figured i'll give it another try. big mistake, i checked out a day early it was so bad!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cRun, don't even pause at this place\u201d", "Author": "Stonewall112", "ReviewID": "UR10026509", "Content": "The first thing you notice, is the thick bullet proof glass that the clerk sits behind at the check in desk.

The room itself was clean, but it was bereft of even the smallest amenity. There was no phone book or any paper, pamphlet, pens, and the air conditioning was not working well. My youngest son (9) tried one of the beds and announced that he would be sleeping on the floor. My son's both said that the beds felt like woooden planks. I thought it was an idle threat, but he did indeed sleep on the floor that night. The next morning, I went looking tor the \"continental breakfast.\" It appeared sometime after eight and was the result of one of the staff having made a trip to Dunkin Donuts, and a pot of coffee (no decaf available) with a lovely carafe of milk sitting in some ice. The second morning it appeared even later because no one seemed to be in charge of actually putting the donuts where we could get them. Desparate guests ventured into the kitchen to nab a donut for themselves, and coffee was not made until shortly before nine.
