The overwhelming deficiency evolves around the smell and condition of the carpets throughout the property. The entire place smells like too much deodorizer, or perhaps too much carpet cleaner. The carpets are worn, and clearly beyond any possibility of being effectively cleaned (hence the smell of too much carpet cleaner). The elevator smelled so badly that we avoided it and took the stairs instead. Otherwise, the staff was pleasant and accommodating. The computers were down when we checked in and the gentlemen at the desk did a nice job of dealing with a tough situation. The shower in the room had no non-skid on the bottom of the tub. This situation was corrected immediately. However, it's beyond me how a hotel shower could not have this in place!

The Bad - the front desk staff was overwhelmed and not well trained. It took over 45 minutes for them to get all of our group that we had brought into rooms. The girl helping us even admitted that she did not know what to do. We had traveled for 4 1/2 hours and had a conference to get to that evening. We arrived early enough to get rested, but the check in process was pathetic. One of the rooms had water poring out of a light fixture in the bathroom. One of the ladies in our group was in her late 70's and they moved her from this room to a room upstairs and on the other side of the motel. It was ridiculous to have made this poor older woman have to walk so far to another room because of bad maintenance. The hot breakfast was supposed to start at 7:00 AM. Again, we had a deadline to get to the conference we were attending. They were not ready by 7:00 Am and instead of apologizing, they made excuses as to why they were late and told us to stay away until they were ready. The check out process was, amazingly enough, slower than the check in process. The poor girl checking us out said that her training was not sufficient to help her check our group out. I had to leave and they assured me that bill for the rooms would be as we had planned. Once we got back home, i called to complain and was assured that the person that made the group reservation for us would call me back the next day. that's been over a month ago and I have still not received a call.

When I went to the front desk to check out of our points reservation and check into our reservation for the other 5 days of our stay ( at $89/night), I was again told the fee applied. I asked what it was. I was told a tax. I said, \"It's not a tax. Taxes are percentages. What is this really?\" The clerk said, \"I don't know. I'm just told to charge it.\" I told her that was bait and switch because they quoted one rate on the internet and then added $3.50 upon arrival. Once you arrive it's generally past their cancel policy so you're stuck. I went back to my room and then called back to the desk. I asked what their early check-out policy was. She said they had none. When she realized we were going to leave, she checked with a manager and they waived the fee. Now about the stay. The heater didn't work properly. There were only about 5 channels on the TV. The free breakfast was sparse. I ended up buying a box of cereal and some yogurt to eat every morning. The hot tub was ice cold. One morning we went to our truck and the car next to us had it's window smashed and some of their belongings were thrown on the ground. We found ourselves searching for things to do so we wouldn't have to go back to the hotel because we didn't want to be there. Basically, the owners are cutting every conceivable thing they can thinking they're saving money. However, we did end up checking out early. They lost that revenue. When we went back to Phoenix 2 more times, we did not stay there. We will be going back to Phoenix in about 2 weeks. We won't stay there. Their \"savings\" have cost them a lot.

Physical look of the hotel is good and convenient to freeway but nothing else. Many items not in working order, while hotel is clean on the surface don't put your glasses on or walk on carpet without shoes. This hotel appears to either be absolutely the most minimal standards to pass with Choice Hotel brand of Comfort Inn or in some serious financial trouble. My job requires me to use Choice Brands about 70 days our of 90 and I was fooled by the pictures for this hotel which may exist in a \"special photo\" room. I did have a \"suite\" which did have the two sofa's shown in the pics. They are having trouble with the cable and only have a few channels - not including 3 major networks which I have Never seen before! There was NO Flat Screen TV unless it was in some \"photo room\". Sliding doors onto the patio by pool were very difficult to open and close and those were only in the \"Suites\". The beds were SO HARD - we went to the closest Walmart and bought egg crates for everyone and folded them over three times to get some sleep after the first miserable night. The beds haven't been replaced in years according to the manager on duty when we checked in. Don't expect any quality bedding from sheets, pillows and in particular the ugly old bedspread in both rooms. The only likeness to the photos is the color! As I stay with Choice so much I have come to expect certain things from the breakfast. Yogurt, a cereal I recognize rather than pre-assembled bowls of cereal of unknown brands. Usually there is a hot offering - yes there was waffles and grits. \"Grits\"! Very healthy. Usually there is Orange juice and fruit. They served an orange or an apple if you got there early. They did have a sit down table service which was ordered from a menu with a wait staff. The one offering which was part of the free breakfast was powdered dry eggs and mushy hash browns. I have no problem paying for breakfast but after tasting what they served as free items we were not about to eat there again. We bought breakfast foods and stocked the fridge with healthy foods. They need to get Will's Cafe out of the building and at least go with the most basic staples of the Choice Hotel Brand breakfast. The physical plant of this hotel could be so nice and is in a good location. I can see this as a lower class business travler hotel for an overnight. The reason the rooms are inexpensive is you getting what you pay for and I don't believe these rooms were worth the low price. We would have been much happier paying more and getting what we paid for. Additionally, the front desk staff at this hotel have such smart mouths and are so rude they only make a bad situation worse.

It was large, with comfortable beds and a good-size bathroom. Bathroom was basic, but served its purpose. Free WiFi was convenient, and worked without any problems. Free breakfast is served each morning, with options including: waffles, bagels, pastries, sausages, eggs, cereal, muffins and juice. Although we did not use the pool, we decided to check it out just for fun, and it looked quite nice. It also had a separate jacuzzi area.

The breakfast area used to be a real restaurant, so it's much more pleasant than the usual motel free-breakfast room. The hot breakfast was a nice touch--little omelets, make your own waffles with strawberry sauce, gravy and biscuits, as well as cold cereal, toast, and some apples and oranges.

Hot Tub is HUGE. The only thing was that there was no fridge in the rooms, some equipment in the gym weren't wrking, but other then that I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone!
