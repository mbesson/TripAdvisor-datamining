I appreciated this nice gesture because the room was not only spacious but also at the end of the corridor. So I enjoyed perfect silence during the night. This room was directed to the inner court full of trees and may be one of the very few hotel rooms in the centre of Berlin where traffic is virtually inaudible. In order not to raise too high expectations I must admit that the house itself is not fully sound-proof. Actually, quite some noise results if somebody flushes the toilet or walks around in the room above. Thus, the silence I experienced was due to a large extent also to the considerate behaviour of the other guests. My room was modern, in best condition and spotless. It was definitely of much higher standard than one would expect in such a moderately priced hotel. The room was equipped with a king-size double bed and a flat screen TV with 16 channels, including BBC and CNN. I would have preferred the mattress and pillow of the bed to be firmer, but this is an issue of personal preferences. Apart from that, my only minor criticism regards the illumination of the desk, which is not really appropriate for reading. Of course, the breakfast buffet of this small hotel cannot compete with that of hotels of hundreds of rooms. However, I did not miss anything and was even offered freshly boiled eggs. On top of all that, Arco Hotel is situated in a nice and calm residential area garnished with some decent restaurants. I may have had particular luck, which cannot be taken for granted. At any rate, I enjoyed a perfect stay and exceptional value for money.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel located in a quiet and convenient area\u201d", "Author": "Thebestinparis", "ReviewID": "UR114511377", "Content": "I would definitely recommend this hotel for friends or couples who wish to visit Berlin.

We are not interested in many of the services luxury hotels offer - just a clean, quiet room, a decent breakfast, and approachable staff. The Arco more than met our requirements: a beautiful, well maintained room, excellent breakfasts, and friendly staff who happily responded to any questions we had. The hotel is in a very nice, quiet area of treed streets, and there is an U-Bahn station only a few minutes walk away (Viktoria-Luise-Platz), with trains to Nollendorfplatz every 10 minutes even on Sunday morning, and usually much more frequently. The Ku-Damm, the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche, Wittenbergplatz, and KaDeWe are all within about 10 minutes walk. We used the U- and S-Bahn to travel all over Berlin and found the Arco to be an excellent base and a nice, quiet, comfortable place to come back to.

The hotel is a short walk to Ku'Damm and the KaDeWe. Rolf was a wonderful host. He gave us terrific advice for dining and getting around the city (the reception sell passes for public transportation).

Based on the generally excellent reviews on this web site, we booked our stay directly with the hotel and found their reservations side of things very prompt and efficient. The hotel seems to be part hotel and part permanent accomodation. The lady in the room next to ours had a dog and gave the impression that she was a permanent resident. In any event, the staff were polite and efficient and breakfast excellent. It was good to have muesli on offer with yoghurt and a cooked egg offered as well. Newspapers in English were provided. As other reviewers have pointed out the breakfast room is nicely presented and opens onto a central garden area. The room itself was between two and three star, pretty tired really and the bathroom about 800mm wide, yes, pretty cosy. Our house maid ignored the \"do not disturb\" sign every day, which given the night life on offer in Berlin was quite irritating. Also, it would appear that her vacuum cleaner was all noise and no suck, because the carpet in our room appeared not to have been vacuumed for some time, yet the sound of machine could well and truly be heard. The owner of the hotel is a particularly pleasant and polite chap who seemed happy to help on any matter. The last word though must be on price.

I agree with all the other reviews. I had a single from for 75 Euros a night. A very good value for Berlin. The hotel is connected to an apartment building which gives it a very residential feel. I had room 403 which was on the top floor and for the most part, very quiet. I didn\u2019t hear the sound of people taking showers in other rooms which is common in most hotels. There was a dog barking very loudly off and on during the first night (which I also hear all the time back home, so I\u2019m used to it), but other than that, I was both surprised and pleased that the hotel was so quiet. As typically in many hotels in Europe that have been renovated, the elevator stops half-way between floors, which means you have to drag your bags up half a flight. Then there is an old door that you have to unlock to get access to the hallway. It looked like something out of \"Cabaret\"! I wasn\u2019t crazy about the bathroom, yes it was modern, but it was one of those typically every small European types. You might want to bring your own wash rag as they do not provide them. I also loved the location. It\u2019s nice to stay in a residential area that with easy access to U-Bahn, KaDeWe and the gay area of Nollendorfplatz. Felt very safe walking alone at night. Front desk staff was friendly, however, they don\u2019t tend to stay by the desk (they don\u2019t need to as you are given your own key). One minor complaint: all the guide books I read recommend getting the \u201cWelcomeCard\u201d which provides 72 free hours on public transportation in Berlin and Brandenburg, as well as reduced or free admission on sightseeing tours, museums and a discount for my favorite, the \u201cBerlin Walks\u201d tours. When I asked to purchase the Welcome Card at the front desk, they sold me a \u201cCity Tour Card\u201d instead. This card offered similar discounts, plus 72 hours of free public transportation in zones A & B, however, the Welcome Card also includes transit in Zone C which covers Potsdam. I didn\u2019t find the difference between the two cards after I purchased it.
