Of special note, the shuttle drivers were friendly and helpful, the receptionists on check in and check out were friendly, and the restaurant staff was efficient and accommodating. On the room side, the bathroom setup was awkward (I could see a bigger person having difficulty), and the bed was incredibly soft (my wife and I are 130 and 140 lbs). With that being said, I am saddened to see that I am not the first person to have a voucher issue at this hotel, however this time they didn\u2019t lose ours. They must have learned since then that it is more cost effective to bill you and use the voucher. When our flight was delayed, we were given a voucher for the hotel. We had a reservation previously, and mentioned this on check in when we handed the voucher in. We were assured the voucher would be used to pay for the room, as we were under the impression that the airline was paying for our room due to the severe delay that occurred. We had no issues when we checked out in person. When we arrived home, the hotel had charged us for the room. We spoke with the billing clerk and the hotel service manager, and unfortunately we were able to see how this hotel is interested in the bottom line, not the client. We were told that we were paying for our room and the voucher had been used for the room booked by the airline (which seems to me like they wanted to charge for two rooms, even though we only stayed in one). After much discussion and difficulty, we settled with a $25 service charge rather than the full room charge. So, even when they assure you there will be no problem, be sure to check everything and expect a \"by the book\" response if there is a billing issue. Both my wife and I work in customer service jobs and we go out of our way to ensure that the customer is satisfied and will return. The way the hotel handled this billing issue was not the way either of us would have dealt with it. Unfortunately, because of this response, we will not be returning to this hotel as there are many other hotels in the area.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHotel is good, staff very friendly\u201d", "Author": "coloradowoz", "ReviewID": "UR125803509", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 nights on business, first of all thank goodness I did not have a rental car they charge guests 14.00 per night for self-paking and by the way they have airport parking as well so you may have to park some distance.

Usually we stay at the Radisson (all suites) down the road, so I can offer a comparison here. The hotel is very close to the airport and the shuttle did not stop along the way, it is approx 5 - 7 minutes drive. It was late picking us up by 10 mins, no big deal. We waited over 30 mins when we landed for a return shuttle but that may have been because some folks got on the wrong bus - when it arrived the driver was unceremoniously throwing them (a family with a young child) back off the bus! Not a great impression. Given the # of HI in the area, I'm not sure it was entirely their fault (buses show up randomly and you always need to check yourself if they're going where you want). It is a typical HI - nice lobby, the staff EXTREMELY friendly and professional. The rooms were small compared to the Radisson which has a sitting area and sleeping area. But the heated bathroom floor is a nice touch. Shower was great. Amenities - shampoo, lotion, shower cap. Beds were comfortable but I found the pillows really \"stuffed' (just a personal thing, I don't like my head at a 45 degree angle to sleep). We did not use the restaurant. The TV channels were great, everything you'd probably need. No fridge in room but a/c worked great. In short, good location for airport, excellent staff, comfortable rooms - I would stay here again if they offered the best rate, otherwise probably return to Radisson.

Found the internet to be VERY slow. Turns out they cap everybody to a maximum download speed of 0.5Mbps at this hotel. This is technically \"High Speed Internet\".... NOT \"Broadband\" which I think is what most people expect when they visit a business friendly hotel. Also found out that 0.5Mbps (64kBps) meets or exceeds Holiday Inn's corporate standards... HA!

Anyway, I'm back at a Hilton this week and I'm downloading at over 30Mbps! And yes, it's free here too. If you're not going to be using internet, this hotel is okay. Overall it's a nice place, price is reasonable, a little noisy due to the proximity to the airport but you'd be crazy not to expect that. One more thing.

The closest thing I can come up with is that it is average - but that should be your expectation with a Holiday Inn. The brand is not normally known for luxury. Therefore, it remains in line with many other HI's out there and, if anything, it's a touch nicer. The lobby area is comfortable and somewhat open. There is a seating area that you can make use of when waiting for the airport shuttle to come (which, by the way, runs every 20 minutes). Attached to the lobby are the restaurant and lounge, both which I have eaten in. I prefer the lounge for its simpler menu (try to Cookstown Greens with steak on top) and more relaxed atmosphere. I find the prices to be very reasonable, especially considering you are eating in a hotel. Rooms themselves have been touched up recently, and are very comfortable. There is a variety of pillows on the bed, and a nice semi-soft mattress. I find I have really great sleeps here. Other typical room furniture includes a desk and small seating area with a a table. In fact, I'd even say the rooms are nominally larger than normal. Bathrooms are regular sized and contain the new Bath & Body Works products, though the absence of conditioner is disappointing. A small vanity area separates the bathroom from the room as well, in case you need an extra table shelf. Leisure wise - internet is free by wireless in the room, and the signal is usually dependable. There is also an indoor pool (a touch on the warm side) and, I believe, in the summer there is also an outdoor pool. The gym in the basement is small but practical, containing a few cardio machines and an additional fitness area. The airport is located close to the hotel, and the shuttle runs frequently.

My friends were coming in from Victoria, BC at 6:52am on a Sunday morning. To avoid me having to get up at 4:30am (I live 2 hours west of Toronto) to be at the Airport in time to pick them up I booked a hotel from the Saturday (the day before) to the Monday at a hotel with an Airport Shuttle. After booking through Hotwire.com the hotel was reveiled to be Holiday Inn Select. I had called a few times in the week prior to their visit to make sure that my friends had their names on the reservation (which required me calling holiday inn, then hotwire, and then hotwire called holiday inn to add their names). Then I called so that they knew no one would be checking in until Sunday morning (I booked saturday night because I wanted there to be a room ready that morning. Some hotels don't have check-in's earlier than noon, so I wanted to be on the safe side). I had also phoned to receive information on the shuttle. It was essential I had it clear for my friends. Sunday morning comes and I get a call around 7am from one of my friends saying that the shuttle hadn't shown up and they were told they needed to call the shuttle. Apparently there are two Holiday Inn's, one being west and the other east. She asked 'Which one are we?' I didn't know because I was never told. I scrambled to call the hotel thinking this would be a simple question for them to answer. I found out that the reservation line goes to somewhere in South Carolina. So not only did the girl I was speaking with have no idea what I was talking about, the computers were down and I had to wait to find out whether my friends should pick east or west. I was irritated beyond belief already, then my friend told me when she called the hotel they said they didn't have any of our three names on the reservation. I called the hotel and they said because I had booked for the Saturday, we have to call in and say the reservation date, not just our names. No one explained that to me when I phoned a week prior to tell the hotel NO ONE WAS CHECKING IN SATURDAY. By the time my friends were checked in it was already 8:20am. I was extremely upset that they had to deal with that so early in the morning and right after a long flight. As soon as the hotel staff realized I had booked with hotwire, they began to use it as a cop out. Saying 'when you book with a third party website, situations like this can arise.' I told them 'I don't appreciate you using Hotwire as an excuse for everything I've had to deal with this morning.' The hotel kept insisting I call Hotwire Customer Service, and when I did the girl was very understanding and told me 'This is an operational issue, Hotwire does NOT operate the hotel.' When I finally got to the hotel they had told me they upgraded my friends a better room. I walked in to see one giant king bed. The reservation said 4 people would be staying at the hotel. We had to have them switch us to another room. It was seriously issue after issue. Even when I spoke with the managment I was not truly satisfied. The most they did for me was validate my parking. By the end of my trip I found out my situation had become the story of the hotel, staffpeople knew who I was and were acting rudely towards me even though it was the hotel in the wrong, not me.

You had to move into the narrow space between the toilet & sink in order to close the door. The polyester shower curtains which are fully machine-washable were edged in black mold. The cramped space made it impossible to share the bathroom (we were on our honeymoon). Bathroom amenities were basic - shower cap, shampoo, conditioner, soap & body lotion. We chose this hotel for its proximity to Pearson Airport and highway 427. As it is an airport hotel, there really isn't much of a view, which is to be expected. Service was hit or miss in the lounge, depending on which staff member was working. The one who left us to find our own menus and left us waiting so long for service that my husband went hunting a drink for us both did not earn a tip from us. She was abrupt, lacked attention to detail regarding our orders, never smiled nor made us feel welcome in the least. Cobwebs dangled from part of the ceiling in the lounge. The other service personnel were good - one fellow in the restaurant recognized us at breakfast our first morning back at the hotel and made us feel very welcome. The bell service was also very good - both gentlemen were friendly, helpful and polite. The maid on our floor was from Jamaica. Very pleasant and friendly - we liked her a lot. The food was okay for the most part although we found it a bit expensive. There are several good restaurants to choose from just a short distance from the hotel and we took advantage of a few of them. The jacuzzi was taped off and definitely not functioning when we checked out the pool area. My husband inspected the sauna and found it less than clean so we decided to avoid the sauna & pool. This was a huge disappointment as we were looking forward to a soak in a jacuzzi, a good sweat in the sauna and a leisurely swim to relax us after our long flight. Although we saw other hotel staff - in the elevators, halls and lobby, not one smiled or said hello. Maybe it's a Toronto thing? I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the things we needed access to the most while staying in the GTA - the freeways and the airport. I also chose it based on a pleasant experience with the hotel in 2007, however for future trips we will be looking at another hotel in the same vicinity. We are not snobs, nor do we expect royal treatment, but for the most part this hotel let us down in areas that were important to us - mostly attention to detail related.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskoka, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDeveloping somewhat of a history with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Itsbeenawhile", "ReviewID": "UR26037206", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel in May of 08 due to a late flight from Cuba and a package that included a reasonable price and the ability to park our car in their lot for the week.

The entire experience is superb: great lobby with awesome flowers, excellent efficient check in, brand new room and great restaurant with real food, not just some pub or diner food. If I lived nearby, I would actually come to this restaurant more often. I'm a vegetarian and they had good fish and sushi. Room was surprisingly big. Later I found out that they have just renovated hotel, so that explains why everything looked and smelled new. I liked the blue and brown colors, how clean room was and most of all - how practical it was. Imagine all the little details you miss while travelling - they had them! For example, they had well lit bathroom with great massaging shower head and enlarging mirror with light for shaving/make up. Or there was a hook to hang your purse on. Little things like this made a huge difference and that's why I remember this hotel. Matress was also great. Medium firm just as I like it. I had non-smoking room with king bed. Hotel was quite busy considering that it was Sunday night. When I checked in, clerk said that they were sold out. I guess this is really a popular place. I would definitely recommend staying.
