I went back upstairs and asked about making drinks only to be told that we could help ourselves to these from a counter opposite reception and where breakfast was to be served each morning, between 8-9am only! however i was given a kettle, 2 mugs and some tea/coffee/milk to use. on returning to the room later that first night, it was warm and the bedding and towels were clean. however the pillows were about 1\" thick and there were only 3 of them (we prefer two pillows each!). Also the beds were ridiculously hard, with nothing other than a sheet between mattress and me. after almost an hour of tossing and trying unsuccessfully to drop off to sleep I put the thin quilt from the spare single bed on top of the mattress and hey presto, instant comfort and at long last sleep! next morning we went up to breakfast at about 8:30 to find our continental breakfast consisted of cheap cornflakes which we could serve ourselves to out of a large bowl with a plastic soup ladle, hard boiled eggs and white bread for toasting - 2 quite cheap plastic domestic toasters were available to use. there was a tray with butter and jam portions and tea/coffee sachets. at exactly 9am the staff removed all of the breakfast items, whether you had finished or not!!! our second night's sleep was better than the first because we had sussed out how to make the bed more comfortable, but my request for a 4th pillow was dismissed, and I was told that there was already 3 pillows in the room.... the shower worked ok, despite some leaking around the shower head and some dodgy looking plastering at the base of the shower tray. The extractor did not work in the shower room. Towels and bed linen were changed each day. needless to say we left early on our 2nd morning, checked out and walked 100 metres around the corner to purchase a decent english breakfast - 6.95 each and worth every penny.

The room was tiny (I could sit on the end of the bed and have my legs in the bathroom). There was no room for my suitcase, the bed and me. I felt like I was in the movie Hostel and I was going to wake up without my kidneys. I never went to breakfast, despite having paid for it, because the owner was a little creepy, and as a woman travelling alone I felt very, very uncomfortable. It was also absolutely sweltering and there was no air conditioning or fans (or room for either I suppose).

The location I think was great, it was a nice neighbourhood very close to Hyde Park, many restaurants, close to the tube stations and not very far from Oxford Street. The hotel on the other hand, was not so great. Before booking we decided to check out their website to see if it was someplace we would want to stay. Not until now, afterwards, I've realized they don't have a website and I've been looking at the wrong one the whole time. Apparently there is another Radnor Hotel near Hyde Park...So don't get fooled as we did, this place does not have a website. On to the hotel then, we arrived and had to carry our bags up to the reception where a younger-looking boy greeted us. He did not seem to know what to do with the hotel voucher we had handed him and soon another person came to help him (supposedly the manager?). Then we had to carry our bags down to the first floor and then down to the basement floor where our room was. Room looked all right, although there was no TV or no hairdryer, telephone or other things you would think you'd find in a hotel room. Bathroom looked nice and clean, though. The next morning we went up for breakfast which was only served for one hour (8-9) and what a breakfast it was! Just one kind of bread, jam, a couple of eggs and milk and cornflakes. Not too much too choose from, really. And the lady who worked there kept the bread in a bag on the floor, and only filled up everything when it was all gone, almost as if they were afraid we would eat too much. One day someone asked for an egg because they were all gone and she said \"In 10 minutes\", but she did not go to get new ones. Also on the same counter as the milk and butter there were an old VCR or some related device that was all covered in dust and behind the counter and old equally dust-covered TV. Not very hygienic... Staff did not seem very interested at all and the possible-manager guy was sitting in the sofa in the breakfast room/reception watching youtube-clips. Now that's what I would call professional. Or maybe not. Then one day the lady working there seemed to start fighting with him about something so she took her handbag and ran down the stairs. Maybe that's something that could be dealt with after work. Maybe. Outside our room's window was some space apparently used for storing garbage. We were waken up several nights of people going out there with old chairs and stuff, late at night. And they weren't really speaking quietly, which is odd since I do think they knew they had some paying customers just outside the door. And for the cleaning of the room: the towels were changed daily to new ones, which is good expect that there were holes in plenty of them and also some old make-up on one. The glasses that had been used were not changed for new ones, and no one ever vacuumed or did anything like that. So to sum up; location is great but there were plenty of hotels in the neighbourhood so I would rather look for another one. Possibly in the same area. Breakfast was laughable, hygiene not very good anywhere. Staff was...sometimes friendly, sometimes not at all. Did not seem interested in their customers at all. No good service. Room was all right, not the most beautiful view out the window but at least the furniture seemed new. Beds were not very comfortable but OK.

The wiring and trailing cables were dangerous, espicially as we had 2 children.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Graz, Austria", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "lauramatte", "ReviewID": "UR6181703", "Content": "We stayed at this \"hotel\" two nights. The location is very good, just two minutes walk to the tube. The street is very nice and the building looks fine, from the outside. We arrived pretty late friday night and got a tiny room, with a small bed (it wasn't even a queen size) in an angle. To come in you had to pass two doors and to be pretty thin. The bathroom was even smaller and you couldn't even seet on the wc because you had no room for the legs!! To get to the shower you had to step over the wc.. It was pretty dirty, the wc never saw a brush and the carpet has never been cleaned. The blankets were washed but still dirty. We freezed in the night and the reason was that one window (behind the closet) was broken: you couldn't close it and it had a hole in the glass. The heating didn't work too.. We asked to fix the window and the heating. They sayed OK, but didn't seem very interested. As we came back it just looked like in the morning!! They told us the heating was brooken. And the window was fine.. We couldn't get another room. So they had to scotch the window. We asked our money back, but we have to do it with the agency. Last but not least: breakfast is very poor: toast, cornflakes and if you are lucky you get an egg, jam and milk. But if it's finished, don't bother asking, they'll only reply \"we have no more\"!!", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSo so\u201d", "Author": "JenniG", "ReviewID": "UR5898849", "Content": "We stayed here for a total of 3 nights - 2 nights at the beginning of August before heading for a car journey around the UK, then 1 night after we returned before flying home via Hong Kong. Hotel is in a long wide street with hotel/hostels in just about every 2nd building so the area has a lot of tourists. Bayswater tube station is a 5 minute walk away which is on the main line to Oxford Circus. There is no lift & reception is on the 1st floor up 2 flights of stairs. The room that we stayed in initially was on the ground floor at the back of the hotel. There was no air-conditioning so we had to have to window open - this was fine until we realised that the security grill could not be locked! The room was very very small - the smallest we'd been in during 8 weeks of travelling through Europe & the bathroom was tiny as well. The toilet seat came off the first time it was used - this was reported to reception. When we came back to our room later that evening it had been replaced. However the shower screens kept coming off the tracks. There was no power point to plug a hair dryer into - had to unplug the fridge to use the hair dryer. The floor didn't appear to have been vacuumed. When we returned at the end of August, we were given a room on the 3rd floor i.e. 4 flights of stairs. This room was much larger however there were 2 double beds in the room for 2 of us so it was still very tight space-wise. Again, the floor didn't appear to have been vacuumed & the previous guest's leftovers were in the fridge. Breakfast was adequate, toast, cereals & juices in the main dining room on the 1st floor. Reception staff could have been a bit more professional. We had left a luggage strap behind during our 1st stay - as soon as we realised I rang the hotel and asked them to look for it & hold it for when we returned in 3 weeks. When we returned I asked about it & they said it had been thrown out - when I said that it was supposed to be held for us - they then said they would have another look for it. We also asked them to book the shuttle to the airport at a pre-advertised rate. When we later checked if this was done, they advised they could not book us on this shuttle but booked a cab for us instead at a much higher rate (without checking with us first).", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radnor Bayswater Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d598487-Reviews-Radnor_Bayswater_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$112 - $174*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">23 Inverness Terrace</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Bayswater</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3JR</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "598487", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c0/ab/c0ab920837abfc94a45a8e75d65762041large.jpg"}}
