Off the beaten track, me and my spouse chose the L Residence over the swanky, stiff hotels in Singapore. The room we stayed in was big and clean, with an attached bathroom. We were impressed by the size of the property, the tastefully decorated hall that leads to the many rooms in the villa. There is a nice size patio for you to unwind and listen to the birds and enjoy the sun. Yes, the owner keeps many feathered friends as pets in a little aviary, including Mandarin Ducks! How cool is that. There is even a basement swimming pool. We had the whole house to ourselves for most part of the stay (we stayed for 6 nights) and the experience was truely private and relaxed. Breakfast is served everyday. The house keeper was helpful and available. Internet access available via WIFI FOC. There is ample parking spaces to the property and you would need to have a car (or rent one) to make your stay more convenient. Situated at Upper Bukit Timah Road, you have easy and quick access to the highways (PIE,CTE,BKE) and 5min to hit the downtown. I believe the owner allows booking of the hall for private functions and events/dinner. If one's house is not big enough to host such an event, this can be an interesting choice. Overall, an incredibly unique experience which, as a Singaporean, I am not aware of until now. Book early to avoid disappointment. For those who needs the pampering of bellboys, turndown services and hotel reward points can look elsewhere.

When I need a few nights accommodation last week, I booked and stayed there again, this time with my wife. Again we liked the location, the help we got such as booking taxi, and the normal B&B benefits. My wife however was not happy about the condition of the bathroom... very simple and not very well maintained. We were trying to keep it clean but the whole bathroom gets messy very easily but difficulty to clean it up. Other inconveniences are no cups(holding our own toothbrush), no slipper(you will need them at least in bathroom). I likely will stay there in the future but do have concern about the condition of bathroom there. Just wish the owner put more effort running this B&B or get some one with hotel or B&B training... particular when I recommend this even to my Singapore colleagues-:)", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk", "Title": "\u201cA rare B&B in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "CAQ", "ReviewID": "UR62299579", "Content": "We arrived fairly late in the evening and caught a taxi to the residence (the airport shuttles do not run to residences or B&Bs - only hotels). The house is up near the Botanical Gardens in a very pleasant residential area about 20 minutes walk from the western end of Orchard Road. We were greeted by the owner who was very friendly and helpful with answering questions regarding location etc. The lobby is very big and spacious and nicely furnished which gives a lovely first impression. Leading off this area is the dining room and also a covered outside terrace where guests can also take breakfast. Downstairs is a lovely indoor pool for guests use (however the area around the pool seem to be a bit of a storage area with boxes and spare furniture stacked about). Our room - The Oriental Pearl Suite - was very spacious and nicely furnished with a four poster bed (with another one which we weren't expecting - however, this would be a good family room). The bathroom had a lovely rain shower and guest toiletries provided. Whilst our room was perfectly comofable the photos on the website do portray a VERY luxurious view of the rooms. A personal breakfast menu is provided every day for guests to choose from a good selection of western and Asian foods on a tick box system (ie, egss, pancakes, noodles, fruit etc). This sometimes ended up with some strange combinations on one plate but overall the breakfasts were good. All in all a lovely small B&B hidden away in the vast hotel saturated metropolis of Singapore.

Near to excellent buses and a short walk to the Botanical Gardens which are magnificent 3 I got food poisoning (from a meal at The Wine Company) and the Flipino cook and housekeeper at L Residence could not have been more supportive and helpful. So to summarise - yes this is different: its in a really upmarket residential area and yes there is building work going on up the road though it did not affect us or me when I spent a day in bed.

Wise choice, we absolutely loved it! It is located in a quiet upmarket residential area just north of Orchard Road, only a 10 minute bus ride away. The residence is so incredibly quiet and peaceful, and we were grateful for that after the hussle and bustle of all the busy roads outside, our room became our sanctuary. As soon as we walked into the residence for the first time, we thought WOW! The place is just full of the most amazing Chinese antiques, and guests have a complete run of the house (mansion) and it has such a warm, welcoming atmosphere, we really did feel like we were at home, not just as guests but very welcome ones. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, although we tried not to bother them too much. Other than constantly having to be let in as we couldn't get the hang of where to put the swipe card on the security panel! The rooms are very comfortable indeed, they are really mini-suites, as there is a little lounge area as well as bedroom and bathroom. There was a small bar fridge (empty), huge lcd tv on the wall opposite the bed with cable tv, dvd player, and nice and quiet air conditioning. Our bed was a king size bed, made up as one bed, but it was actually 2 comfortable singles together. The bathroom was not overly large, but had 2 basins, and toiletries provided were not the usual silly little things hotels love to provide, but real family-size bottles of shower gel, shampoo, hand soap. Also toothbrushes and toothpaste, and spray cologne. Was surprised to see a bidet! Huge shower head over the bath. The bath itself was quite high, and could be difficult for someone with less mobility to climb in and out of perhaps, and it would also be easy to slip after a shower, as no anti-slip mat was provided. There is a wide variety of food available for breakfast, and a menu is slipped under the door of your room every afternoon so that it can be completed and left outside again at night for the staff to collect ready for the morning. The food is not cooked until you are in the dining room, so that it is nice and fresh. Good choices of western, Asian or Indian foods, and HUGE portions! If I had one complaint, it would be that the fruit juices on offer - orange, grape or apple - are not fresh but canned. Considering Singapore is an expensive city for hotels, we thought the price for our room was very reasonable. We booked quite a few months in advance and were offered an \"early bird\" rate of $150 pn including breakfast, but some rooms are bigger than others, so I think the rate might depend on which room you are in? All in all, we had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again, it would be like returning to old friends.

When I booked the facility I got immediately the feedback to provide my credit card details. After I submitted all details nothing happened. I sent reminders, nothing happened. I called and after many failed attempts and long waiting time a pretty helpless receptionist picked the phone (my 8 years old daughter would be more talkative). This person promised me than to send a confirmation immediately. Guess what, nothing happened until I wrote a serious request for confirmation. We finally got the booking confirmation that the desired room is booked for the period we requested together with a description of the way to the Lewis Road (we have this all in written). Unfortunately when I arrived with my family, tired after a long flight, I was left helpless back in the lobby room with a strange feeling that something is going terribly wrong. No comment from the receptionist, nothing until I got serious (loud) and asked why I can\u2019t see my room. The receptionist, a shy and helpless person, talked to the owner outside in another room that we could not catch the situation, we were simply left ignored. When I finally could talk to the owner I just a lapidary comment, that obviously something went wrong. No apology, no owner coming on site to talk with his frustrated guests, a completely unusual and for Singapore unexpected embarrassing situation. Still today no apology from the owner (he has my e-mail), it confirms a hopeless lack of professionalism. A taxi driver which came by chance along helped us to get a hotel. After all we wasted a lot of time, got frustrated and paid for the unexpected hotel we had to take a tremendous additional charge.

There are very little reviews about this place, so like the previous reviewer, I took the risk and booked with the place. I booked as early as May for my end of July trip. After seeing pictures of the various rooms in their website I chose one I liked best and specified this room in my reservation email to the owner. The reply, however, was that they reserved their rights to allocate the rooms to guests based on various reasons (not specified). I found this strange and kind of irked me a bit. But it was fine. The owner then requested for my credit card details as they wanted to process the payment beforehand. I gave my details to them and the room charge was reflected on my bill that May. In June, I was surprised to see another charge from L Residence on my credit card. Apparently their credit card machine provider double booked our transaction. I informed the owner of this mistake via email and he replied saying he would cancel the erroneous transaction as soon as possible and would email me soon. However two weeks passed with no updates from the owner. This posed a great deal of hassle for me as my credit card bill was nearing its due date, and the double charge (SG$450) was too large a sum for me to pay in order to settle my bill. I emailed the owner again and he said they were still processing the transaction. I did not understand why a simple cancellation would take so long to process, when I've seen retail stores in malls void erroneous transactions in less than 5 minutes. The transaction still was not corrected by the time I flew to Singapore and was only corrected two weeks after my trip. I had wanted to cancel my reservation with L Residence as the whole credit card issue irritated me as well as the lack of concern and sense of urgency of the owner. However I had already paid and I had no choice. Despite the initial hassle I came to L Residence with a positive outlook as I did not want to spoil my vacation. Here then are the pros and cons of the place itself. Pros: 1. Beautiful house located in an upscale Singaporean neighborhood - very different from staying in hotels. The atmosphere is very homey, and it's feels just like staying over at a friend's house. There is even a pool at the basement. 2. Spacious rooms - lots of space to move about, or cram extra beds into. 3. Free wifi and drinks - internet is fast enough and all the drinks in the room fridge are complimentary. Cons: 1. Location - as it is located in an upscale neighborhood, dont expect any MRT stations within the vicinity. There is a bus stop nearby, but somehow buses to major places like Orchard Road dont stop here and you will have to walk an additional 10 minutes to the next bus stop, or call a taxi (expensive). Also, as it is essentially a house, don't expect that all taxi drivers would know how to get there, despite the efficiency and quality of the Singaporean taxi system. 2. Service - as there were only a few guests, we expected service to be very personalized. Their attendants were accommodating and kind enough, but there was a lot lacking. For instance, we asked for breakfast to be served at 7:30 am sharp (we were in a hurry), but it was past 8am before it showed up. We also asked for a wake up call at 6am which never came. 3. Bathroom - for some reason the bathroom wall in our room (Imperial Suite) had translucent glass right next to the shower. I have no idea to what extent I could be seen from outside (I'm sure I couldn't be seen, because who builds see-through showers right?) but it made me feel very uncomfortable. In conclusion, I think we would've been better off staying at a hotel out there in the commercial areas. Transportation would've been easier and cheaper and service would've been more predictable.
