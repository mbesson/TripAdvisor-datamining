Hotel stuff not very nice; 2. The location far away from citycenter (on average 1-1.5h to get there by fast public transport); 3. The neighborhood is shady and there's no decent place nearby to eat or have a drink; 4. Our double bed had 2 matresses, instead of a single big matress; 5.

I have to say, for a tour group, as ours was, it was ideal. It is about twenty minutes from downtown, so if you want to explore in the evening, you have to take a taxi and they are not cheap in Rome. We paid 100 Euros to get there from the airport Having said that, the rooms were very nice, they have wi-fi, and the breakfast is wonderful. Across the street is a small wine boutique that sells bulk wine. We got two litres of great red wine for 3.20 Euros.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arad, Romania", "Title": "\u201cMaybe I was UNLUCKY...\u201d", "Author": "paullamar69", "ReviewID": "UR116339251", "Content": "I chose this hotel because the price was very good and they had some great facilities from my point of view: free and safe parking, free shuttle to the metro station( which is very convenient if you ask me), free internet and an outdoor swimmingpool.VERY NICE OFFER!

The hotel has a gate around it that can be locked, which should give you an idea of the area. There isn't really anything nearby the hotel except an overgrown field and run-down neighborhood. To get into Rome, there is a shuttle* or city bus to a metro station and then you have to take the metro in. The shuttle is limited to first come for 6 people, runs irregularly and can not be scheduled. It is also subject to being canceled without any advance notice, which happened to myself and 4 other travelers who were waiting for the 8 am shuttle (for 40 minutes) when it was canceled at 7:55 am for a private service. There was no manager on duty to appeal to, unless we wanted to wait until 9 a.m. and risk missing our train. We then had to walk to the city bus and luckily made it to our train for the next leg of our trip. Next time I will be sure to stay in the center and leave the communting to the locals.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cRoma Tor Vergata, Italy\u201d", "Author": "akshaymadan04", "ReviewID": "UR105170192", "Content": "A Best Western Hotel on the Highway, away from main city.
