In the elevators people were smoking cigarettes and marijuana. in one of the three rooms we were in i killed a roach that crawled up the wall. we had to ask for refrigerator and microwave and had to wait 2 and a half hours for, that was not clean at all. as for the alarm clocks, there are no clocks in the room. there is soo many complaints to type but please whoever reads this please do not get a room here. the staff were not even close to being professional. i took pictures of everything.

The front desk staff was friendly enough but it went quickly downhill from there. After checking in, I push the button for the elevator and I waited, and waited, and waited some more. The floor indicator on the elevator on the right was moving and so that was at least a good sign but the left didn't seem to be working. Another young man had checked in and was waiting for the elevator as well before it finally got to the ground floor. When I actually got onto the elevator, I noticed why it took so long, and probably why the left side elevator wasn't working...the thing was as rickety as I've ever seen. When the doors opened on the 6th floor, it lurched a bit to actually get in position as I could see that there was an inch or two of separation between the elevator and the floor. So I step into the hall and quickly find my room. The hallway and the room door had a very \"dungeon-esque\" feel to it. This feeling was confirmed when I actually opened the door and it creaked like some cheesy horror flick movie. The switch plate just inside the door seemed like it was about to fall off (not a big deal). The bathroom was absolutely DISGUSTING! I didn't want to take my shoes off but I kinda had to in order to take a shower, the floor was filthy.

Upon returning to the crowd in the lobby, I was told that they would have someone clean the room for me (right), although during the next 1/2 hour while I phoned around looking for alternate lodging, the sole housekeeper came thru the lobby on her way home, chatting with another staffer and indicating that she was done for the day and was the last one on site. The stale-beer smell of the lobby furniture only spurred me in my efforts to get out of there! I ended up getting a cancellation receipt from one of the clerks who was very courteous and clearly unable to solve the hotel's troubles. I ran out, caught a cab to the airport Hampton Inn, and never looked back! The website imagery and claims regarding services and amenities are misleading at best.

But for the price (we paid under $100/night) its a great deal.

Since we were taking a 3+ week trip I asked them whether I could stay one night at each end of my trip and get free parking for the entire three weeks, and they said \"yes\". They were the only hotel I called that would agree to this so I booked it, although I had second thoughts due to the terrible reviews. The place is obviously old and a bit run down. However its being fixed up. The lobby is actually quite nice and our first room was very nice as well. On our return trip the room was a little shabby, but all we wanted was a good nights' sleep and we got that. The elevators are old and have been redone with plywood walls. Pretty yucky, but they work. The halls and stairwells are dim and grubby, but not dirty.....although they do smell of cigarette smoke. The large roomy non smoking rooms we had were clean and did not smell. No hot dogs or condoms on the floors (!) and no bedbugs or roaches as mentioned in some of the reviews!!! The extra large rooms were great because we had a lot of luggage for our trip and needed to spread out and reorganize it. The mattresses are very firm......just as we like them. If you want a pillow top mattress stay somewhere else! The staff was not particularly elegant and refined. just ordinary local folks. But they were all polite, helpful, and seemed eager to please and happy that we were there. The continental breakfast was simple but it was fine for us and saved us the cost of breakfast. An added bonus is that there is a 24 hour restaurant, The Penrose Diner, right across the street. It is big, bright and friendly, and has an extensive menu and good food. Its always busy (even at 4 AM when we went in after our trip because we had jet lag). The local police eat there all the time, so you knowits safe. Our car was parked in the hotels' brightly lit parking lot for a little over 3 weeks and it was fine when we returned.

Earlier in the day, [August 22, 2010], there were bad electrical storms in the Philadelphia area. Because of this, there was a skeleton crew working at the airport. My family and I arrived at the airport from Cancun and had to claim our bags, clear customs and re-check our bags to make our connecting flight to Providence, RI. Once we cleared customs we were directed to a US Airways ticket counted downstairs. Once there we waited in a long line and were told that our flight was delayed until midnight. That was fine because it was only 10:30 PM. We were then told that we wouldn't be able to board the flight because US Airways had sent the baggage handlers home and there were no TSA Agents to screen our bags, or us. Again this was at 10:30 PM in a so-called International Airport in the United States. Are you kidding me? So, our flight left without us. We were given boarding passes for the following afternoon as well as a hotel voucher to the Skyview Plaza Hotel & Suites. Well, it sure sounded nice.... yeah, right. Like the others, we waited over an hour as we watched the two small-overcrowded shuttle vans drive past us over and over again. Once we were finally picked-up by the disgruntled employee, we were shuttled to the hotel. Two of the three clerks had no type of uniform whatsoever. Opened shirts with hairy chests and gold rope chains exposed. They looked like porno actors from the 1970's. I was delirious at this point laughing out loud as I thought, \"You can't make this stuff up.\" I felt like I was in a Candid Camera or Punked episode. One clerk, a younger kid was neatly dressed and courteous. Luckily that's who I dealt with. Anyway...we were checked into room #1503. Once I opened the door the odor hit me. Kinda like the odor of a men's room in a third world country soccer stadium. The so-called air conditioner was on, but blowing warm stale air. It obviously hadn't had a Freon refrigerant re-charge since around 1988. The carpet was filthy, and the comforters were ripped and riddled with cigarette burns. The windows were screwed shut and as I looked out the window I noticed that the outdoor pool was drained and barricaded with that yellow crime scene tape. God only knows what went on there. Needless to say we checked out as soon as we woke up from our night in the urine/smoky sweatbox room. I will say that the bathroom looked like it was recently remodeled and looked kinda clean with the exception of the odor. This place really should be on TripAdvisor's top 10 list of filthiest hotels. US Airways should reconsider sending displaced passengers to this hotel. I agree with the other reviewer; the only way this place stays in business is because of displaced passengers from the Philadelphia Airport. The Philadelphia Board of Health should inspect this place. After this experience I will avoid the Philadelphia Airport as well as US Airways.

And to boot the toilet had some kind of \"snakeskin\" floating around in it, it was flushed and overflowed..So we get moved to another room only to find dried blood stains on the sheets..We couldn't even stand to be there for one night..Packed up our stuff and left at 3 am...Someone needs to call the board of health on this hotel, because it is an absolute SCUMHOLE!!!!", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWho Could Possibly Find Anything Positive about This Place?\u201d", "Author": "MF012356", "ReviewID": "UR74969914", "Content": "I'm sitting in my room as I write this.

So I didn't get change for the soda machine. The only thing in the area that will deliver is Dominos. I'll just wait till I get back to the airport, Thank you. Avoid the elevator! Got on; punched 2. Went to ten without the door opening. Went back down to 2. Didn't think the door was going to open.

The hotels in Center City are frightfully expensive and parking is even more so. My 5-night stay was relatively pleasant but there were some issues. This is an interesting place. It is a 16 story circular tower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite interesting architecture. It has changed franchises several times in the last few years. I reserved the room under Motel 6, but it was an American Best Value Inn and Days Inn and several other names before that. The ownership is trying to go alone as an independent now. Curious about the frequent name changes, I called up some personal friends of mine in Philly to ask about this property. Some said it was a dump and to stay away. But others said it was fine. I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to expect and hoped for the best! My priorities in reviewing a property are that it has to be clean and the stuff (i.e. A/C, heat, Internet, TV) has to work and the staff has to be willing to help out with any issues. I found this property to be acceptably clean in the room, bath and hallways. The stuff mostly worked. The first night, the Internet did not work at all anywhere in the building. I reported this to the day manager and she had staff reset the system, which fixed it in the lobby. But still, no Internet in the room. I was told that there was a storm the week before which might have damaged the system. I did a quick check and found that the Internet worked on the other side of the building. The staff was helpful in letting me change rooms. Problem solved. And I have had Internet problems in many properties over the years, so this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an isolated incident. I was warned about problems with the elevators. There are two working elevators which are pretty old and somewhat slow. But they worked perfectly whenever I used them. Another issue was the ice machines. One didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, one worked sometimes, and one worked OK if you talked nice to it. Clearly, new machines are needed. When I reserved the room, the hotel had a pool available. When I arrived, the wall around the pool was completely smashed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looked like it was blown up! I later found out that during an intense thunderstorm a few days before we arrived, a Water Spout (small tornado) formed over the pool, sucking up all the water and smashing the wall, and several A/C units. I saw downed trees all over the area, so I knew something went on. So, while the pool was missed (especially on one hot day), I understood the situation. One negative thing was that the list of amenities found on various web sites is grossly incorrect. These show things like alarm clock, coffee maker, ironing board, hairdryer, refrigerator, newspaper, restaurant and bar. None of these amenities exist today. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care, since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use these things, but the management should make sure that this information is accurate. The property does offer Continental breakfast, but it is minimal. In summary, the Skyview Plaza provided a reasonably pleasant stay. Positives include reasonable rates, close access to bus and subway, free parking, 24 hour diner across the street, a tremendous view of the Philly skyline from the upper floors and staff who were friendly and mostly helpful. The big negative is that maintenance of equipment in this 40 year old property has not been the best over the years and there are some issues with things not working. When checking in, check everything out and make sure you get a room with stuff that works. I got the feeling that the management is trying to turn this trend around, but it will take some time.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlantic City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cbest view of the city from the top\u201d", "Author": "sandy85_10", "ReviewID": "UR66093239", "Content": "stay there, eat there and enjoy the view of the city late night as well as the early morning sun...", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Skyview Plaza Hotel & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d1778574-Reviews-Skyview_Plaza_Hotel_Suites-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html", "Price": "$76 - $97*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2033 Penrose Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Philadelphia</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">PA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">19145</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1778574", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c6/2a/9a/skyview-plaza-hotel-suites.jpg"}}
