We were in two different rooms because the window broke in the first room when we tried to open it. The receptionist (a young guy) called the owner of the hotel on the telephone. When the receptionist came back he said that the owner had said that there was a note on the window that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open it. And that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have opened it. It was going in the direction that they wanted us to pay for the broken window. Luckily my boyfriend kept very calm in the situation. There was no note on the window, and how are we supposed to not open the window in a (very) small room without air circulation. Afterwards my boyfriend asked to speak to the owner and went down to the reception to speak with him on the phone. In this conversation the owner even implied that we had removed the note on the window which he probably regretted after my boyfriend said that his family lawyer would probably not agree. I think if we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made such a fuss, the owner might have forced us to pay for the window. In the end they gave us a new room because we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep in a room with no window. The next day we asked the new receptionist and cleaning lady if we were allowed to open the window in the new room. They looked confused and said that it was only in room we were in on the first night that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open the window and the guy from yesterday had just forgotten to tell us. Generally everything was dirty and greasy in the hotel. You would get sticky fingers from touching anything in the hotel. The old fat carpet on the floor in the rooms was filled with dust. In the first room the window was broken, everything was dusty and none of the bed lamps had working light bulbs. In the second room the sink was blocked, and only one lamp had a working light bulb. Generally I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel unless you have very low standards and only need a place to sleep. Also you have to be prepared to stand up for yourself, because the hotel is literally falling apart and the owner will have no scrubbles in making you pay for stuff that brakes. It seems there are many nice hotels in Amsterdam, but you have to book them in good time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you book to late only the bad and very expensive hotels are left, that was the mistake we made.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value for money!\u201d", "Author": "Sneckweck", "ReviewID": "UR123433477", "Content": "Me and my boyfriend booked this hotel for a very reasonable price last January and we were not dissatisfied!

It was me and my boyfriends first weekend away and this totally wrecked the weekend. we complained and the receptionist had the cheek to say that we had brought them into the hotel, I was so appalled by her response, it was so infested they must have been there a long time because there were hundreds of them. it wasn't just the room we were staying in beacuse we moved rooms after we complained, only after being in the room half an hour we noticed that this room was also infested as the bugs started appearing as we sat on the bed, so we compalined again the receptionst said the only room that was available was the room that we had orignally stayed in but she re assured us that it had been sprayed so we agreed to go back to the room. That night I felt itchy again so I sat up and noticed more bed bugs so I woke my boyfriend up he complained to the male receptionist who said he couldn't do nothing about it we was appalled so we had to sit up all night and leave for the airport early. I'm disgusted that we was lied to that the room had been sprayed when it clearly hadn't. As we sat up that night we noticed the bugs all up the walls, all over the bed and around the bottom of the mattress. I am also disgusted as we only recieved 20 euros compensation, which doesnt compensate the fact that we had no sleep all weekend, had to get all our clothes steam cleaned throw my suitcase away and get my whole house sprayed because they were crawling on us and our luggage in the airport.

The only thing two things are the steep stairs to the hotel reception which is on the first floor, and if you are lucky enough to have met the nicer ppl at the reception. My story > at my arrival there was a lovely young lady who was helpful and professional, I was given a bunk bed in a room with 4 beds and keys to a locker which is numbered according to the occupied bed (eg bed 32 hence locker 32.)I left and when I came back, it was pretty late and I found someone else in my bed, it being very late I didnt make too much of a fuss and took the other bed that was empty, they were to leave in a night or so and I was to be there for 2 more days. To my chagrin I found out that the bed I was now in was broken.(i.e. the iron grating holding the matress was broken) I informed the receptionist (a very kind young man marcus?) who agreed to have the bed looked at and let me have my bed back on the other ppl leaving the room) When I went came back the next day I found an exceptionally rude and arrogant man at the reception (slightly tall, black) screaming at another customer who was trying to connect to the internet and was being told off because the internet wasn't working and he tried to ask for some help ?? does that even make sense?? I explained that I would be changing back to my original bed as the others kin the room had left, He was obnoxious.he refused to acknowlege that it was broken, He lay down in the bed with his shoes on and told me that there was nothing wrong with it, upon which I showed him the grid falling out, to which he replied he'll fix it by putting a blanket under the mattress(didnt help). He refused to believe that I had another bed, when I showed him the bill, he refused to let me change beds even though the one I was in was not the one I was paying for, His retort was that \"I' ve been working in this s**tty hotel for over 15 years and Ive had enough of ppl like ...\" His argument was that I should have complained in the beginning so that he could kick the other person out of the bed, now I couldnt change beds. Why? because they were taken. When I came back from dinner the other receptionist , thin fella, short hair Marcus? , was perfectly reasonable and informed me that the whole room was empty and that no one else was there and yes, that I should change beds.

It was my second stay in the hotel, last time was approx 2003 and it hasn't changed a bit. It is a very basic hotel, you get what you pay for though (and I suggest you book it from their own website to get the cheapest rate). I have never had a problem with the cleanliness of the place, if you are a reasonably hardened traveller then this place will be a walk in the park. While we're on the subject of walking in the park I must say that the prime location of this hotel is the main reason you should stay here. The Vondelpark is a 3 minute walk away and is a beautiful place to go on a nice day. Leidseplein is a 5 minute walk and the rest of the city centre attractions are all within easy walking range too. Hotel Princess is located 10 minutes walk from Dam Square in a lovely part of the city. This is nice if you've had a smoke and don't want to be in the minging, rank, seedy part of town any more! The other reviews which strongly criticise this hotel are clearly written by people who are used to a very high standard and who are perhaps naive to think that the low tariff at HP will bring them some kind of luxury. They all complain about people smoking weed in the rooms (its Amsterdam, what did you expect?) but this is no longer an issue as the Dutch government have imposed a smoking ban - therefore no smoking in any of the rooms any more...unless you get one of the two rooms in Hotel Princess which have a balcony ;) Anyway, this hotel is fine, it will do if you are just staying in Amsterdam for a few nights. If you're heading to the dam for a quick smoking weekend, this place will certainly do, I'm sure it'll be the least of your worries if you've been blazing up some white widow :) Basically if you want a clean, basic room in a perfect location then this place is ideal. If you expect higher standards then perhaps you ought to revise your budget... Oh, and unfortunately it is true about that unfriendly rude guy who works on reception (tall, slightly long hair). But the guy who does the other shift (short black dude, short hair) makes up for it. He is a really nice guy, he has been working there for years and is always happy to help you.

It is 1 star for a reason, but this is not a bad thing. It was everything we needed it to be. Clean and handy for the attractions in Amsterdam. If you just need a place to rest your head then it does the job perfectly, clean linen and carpets as well as clean shared facilities which we never had to queue for. It was also pretty cheap. We paid $220 euros for a double room for 3 nights. Although the guy on the reception did try to charge us 20 euros more, but I had our confirmation e-mail so there was no query. Breakfast was served between 8-10am, we never made breakfast so I don't know what this was like. But you are a 5 minute walk from Leidseplein, a square with plenty of bars that serve breakfast all day at reasonable prices. The hotel is not in the centre of the city but it is within walking distance of most of the top places to go in Amsterdam. We were suprised at how close eveything was together anyway. If you are of a lazy disposition then trams leave regularly from outside the hotel and will take you to most places.

It was the last day of 2 weeks in Europe with a 24 hour layover in Amsterdam. We arrived quite early and found the hotel easily, but once we arrived, things just kept getting worse. When choosing the hotel, it was advertised to have a luggage room. We asked if they would hold out luggage until check in time and they said yes. Front desk had us set it in the breakfast room and said it would be safe, but there was a sign on the wall saying that they were not responsible for the loss of any items from the hotel rooms. There is no actual luggage room-only the breakfast room/common area which is not locked or safe. We did some tourist activities and returned the hotel to check in. When booking the hotel, it was stated that credit cards were accpeted. They would not accept credit card as payment so we had to go get cash down the street. The man at the front desk was very confused and frazzled about what room we were in, was swearing and saying the f-word, and finally figured it out. We were on the 3rd floor which is a steep climb up many flights of stairs. Stairway was partially blocked by the housecleaners vacuum and bags of laundry. When we arrived in our room, she was still cleaning it and there was someone else's luggage in our room, which had to be removed and nt sure where it was placed. Condition of room was disgusting to say the least. We put towels down on the floor so we would not have to touch the disgusting carpet with our feet. It smelled horribly of smoke ingraned into the curtains, carpet and beds. When commenting to the front desk, we were told that this is what we should expect from a one star hotel and that people come to one star hotels in Amsterdam so they can smoke and treated us as if we should have known that. Room conditions: There were only sheets and a scratchy blanket on the beds. Extra blankets in the closet were scary to say the least. To air out the room we needed to keep the window open which was extremely loud and also had to buy a candle. Very tiny room, barely enough room to move with two people. Bathrooms and showers are shared and we had to go down one floor to use a shower. I believe there are only 2 or 3 showers for the whole place. Showers smelled moldy and dirty. This was advertised as a \"quiet family hotel\". After breakfast as we climbed the mountain of stairs, the hallways stunk of cigarette and \"other\" smoke. The photos of the hotel on the internet don't look anything like the hotel and most of the statements of hotel amenities are not true. I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone. It is not worth the $100 we paid. If we had more time, we would have immediatly found another place to stay, but after hiking our luggage up the stairs we did not have the energy or time. A hostel would be much better than the Hotel Princess.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cMore like a hostel than a hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4333973", "Content": "The good things: cheap, close to city centre and tram The bad things: the room did not at all correspond to the photo I had seen on the internet.
