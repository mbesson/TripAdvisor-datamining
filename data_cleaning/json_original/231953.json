The place isn't fancy, but it is a good value. The only things I din't like so much was that the blankets feel like sand paper - if you are picky, you may want to bring your own.

We once had a \"favorite\" place, but it changed management and is no longer a place we enjoy staying. Beachside Motel is wonderful. The front desk personnel were all very friendly and accommodating. Check-in and check-out went smoothly. Complimentary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch. The room was clean and cool, the drapes were open, so we walked right into a beautiful ocean view. Our room overlooked the pool, also, which I don't usually like, but we were there at a quiet time and the pool area was not loud & rowdy. The pool was clean and clear. About 15 minutes after we settled into our room, we received a call to make sure we were happy with our room. Everything is fresh and clean, the appliances are modern and CLEAN, the bathroom was spotless. the sliding glass doors were clean, and the air conditioning worked great. The price was right, a great value for an ocean front kitchenette.

She even discussed the price with the new motel manager and got us a better price. This kind of customer service is not the norm and was greatly appreciated.

The room was definitely dated; balcony chairs could stand to be replaced, but for $75/night it was worth it. They also charge you $5/night parking, and $1.50/night if you use the safe, but they explain that the safe charges can be removed when you check out if you don't use it. For the price, a continental breakfast is included. The hotel is partners with the property next to it (palm plaza?) so you go next door to check in and eat breakfast. Breakfast included cereals, muffins, bagels or toast, hardboiled eggs, donuts, and juices/milk/coffee. An economical way to start the day! Because the two motels are partners, you have use of either pool. The pool with the Beachside goes to 8' deep, the other only 6 I believe. The Beachside pool was never crowded which was nice also, and every morning I saw them at 6 am or so cleaning the outside pool areas. The only negative about the room was it had somewhat of a funky smell, but it wasn't too noticeable after you were there-only initially. Also, the hotel used your room key to open outside doors, but the doors usually were not shut tight anyway. Overall, I'd recommend this place; people were very helpful; they even printed out our boarding passes on the last day. They also offer a \"linger longer\" plan where you pay more to check out late-we checked out at 3pm so that we could enjoy the beach/pool for longer, and I think it cost $20? more that day to do so.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilton Head Island, SC", "Title": "\u201cThis Place Should Be Shut Down!!!\u201d", "Author": "jadorechanel", "ReviewID": "UR14473729", "Content": "Upon approaching this place I thought it was a joke!
