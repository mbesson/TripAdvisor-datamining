{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Fantastic Stay I was apprehensive about our (hubby and me) 10-day stay in Tokyo, because we had visited 4 years ago and stayed in a cupboard with a bed as part of a packaged tour. Having gained travel experience since then, I was determined to hunt for something bigger, better and yet affordable, and I am so glad to have found this serviced apartment.Now, being a serviced apartment, Somerset Azabu East is quite different from a hotel. There is no huge spiffy reception, no room service, no fancy breakfast, and no in-house restaurant or shopping area. That was perfectly fine by us, because our agenda was to spend the days haunting Tokyo and the nights in a comfy place, and we never had the habit of ordering room service or eating in-house anyway.What SAE does have is great rooms. We took a Studio Premier, which is perfect for a couple. Not only did it contain the usual suspects (bed, TV, bathroom with tub), but also a cooking area (with stove, cutlery, flatware, kettle, coffee-maker, microwave, fridge and a very unexpected dishwasher), washing machine (with detergent!), study table, sofa, coffee table, iron (with board), 2 aircons, umbrella (!) and a wardrobe big enough to walk into. The pillows and comforter were feather-stuffed. The water temperature was electronically controlled (and the mechanism could even talk to you - albeit in Japanese). The quality, cleanliness and maintenance of everything was good, and cleaning was done on a daily basis. I don't normally sleep well outside my own home, but slumber was a pleasure here, as the room was beautifully comfortable and quiet at night. A very simple breakfast of toast, coffee, juice, and sometimes hard-boiled eggs, was provided daily at the common area - that was quite sufficient for us. It's also a 5-minute stroll from Akabanebashi station, and splat next to a fantastic convenience store named Pororoca, which will keep the fussiest person well-fed and well-boozed at low cost. This store even has rice cookers for use.I think we were lucky to find this place, because there happened to be an Autumn Promotion at the time, which pegged the price at 17000 yen (excluding tax) a night - not much more than hotel rooms one-third the size. However, the non-promotion price at peak periods is much higher, so check the website (easily Googled).We loved this place so much that it was painful to leave - something that we have rarely felt about overseas accommodations. I would be delighted to stay here again, particularly if I come across another promotion.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576671810", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Hypocaffeinated"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d638980-r21644706-Somerset_Azabu_East-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "638980", "Price": "$188"}}
