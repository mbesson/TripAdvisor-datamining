Free internet - need password. Good breakfast. Decent location if you need something close to TXL (but TXL is closing down next year.) 30 Euro for double bed ensuite (two single beds with private toilet and shower) - breakfast included. A little high, in my opinion, but still ok. Linens and towels included. They even left a bar of soap with the towels, which was nice - not usually given to you - by what is typically considered a hostel, not a hotel. However, it is located right on the street corner, so it can be noisy. No parking available. If you arrive after normal business hours, it can be quite difficult to get a hold of someone in order to check in. No 'real' staff to speak of. I would only suggest staying here if it is a last minute choice/option, and you are just looking for a place to crash for the night.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "neimi", "ReviewID": "UR116714748", "Content": "Location was pretty good, bus to the airport and to the center stopped right behind the corner. Train station is also right next to the hotel, but the train lines stopping there won't get you to the center. Toilet and bathroom were in the corridor (a big minus), but there was a sink in the room (a little plus). There also was a TV in the room. Our room faced to the street and was awfully hot during daytime and evening. The windows could not be left open at night because of the traffic. When windows were closed, traffics noises didn't disturb, but the heath was unbearable. Service was good. Price included breakfast, which was very german (bread, eggs, different kind of meat, cheese and fruit jams, tea or coffee and juice) but not very nice for vegetarians. We still got our stomaches full and did not even ask if they would have had some kind of different breakfast for vegetarians. The food was really fresh and it was served to the tables, so this was no breakfast-buffet! The hotel was fully booked but really quiet. We only managed to get a room with two single-beds but they were easy to move next to each other so with a little muscular work we had a twin bed. ;) The room was cleaned every morning (a big plus). But place was in every way more than OK.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Latvia", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and kindless personal, good location:)\u201d", "Author": "Santa87", "ReviewID": "UR88204843", "Content": "Nice place where stay, helpful and kind personal.

Where to begin.. It's NOT good value at \u20ac60 a night. The room was absolutely nothing like what is shown in images on the website. The double room we booked was smaller than expected, with awkwardly placed furniture taking up most of the floorspace. We expected 2 beds and there was a third thrown in as if they'd run out of storage space elsewhere. The beds themselves are double mattresses that look like they were collected off a street. The tiny bathroom / toilet / shower was ok, however the shower never got beyond lukewarm and the showerhead wouldn't hold up on its own. The towels provided for showering were ridiculously small hand-towel size. Housekeeping is at the most minimal - not borthering to replace a small bar of soap throughout 4 days of our stay. I had to personally chase down the cleaner and ask for some. Apart from fixing the bed covers I doubt much cleaning was ever done. Also we tried to sleep in past midday after a big night out and kept waking up to the cleaner banging on the door, or somone making a ruckus outside our room. The room gets stuffy easily which meant keeping the window open and having to hear street traffic and noise at all hours of the day or night, so don't expect a sound sleep. The place is located on a large intersection close to a railway overpass. The breakfast included was very basic and average and was identical every morning (coffee, bread rolls, packets of jam, slices of cheese / ham / salami). The best part is being able to go across the road to a kebab shop that's open 'til late. The staff were generally apathetic and unhelpful, except one man behind reception who was an absolutely rude and opportunistic nightmare to deal with - we requested to checkout at 6pm the same day rather than 11am, and they said it was fine if we paid an extra \u20ac40, however when we came to speak to him the price suddenly jumped to 60, CASH! After a lot of arguing we managed to bring this down to 50. The location is run down and not in a nice area. It's far from all central sights. Taking a bus or train takes at least 25 minutes to reach any place of interest; a taxi ride will set you back about \u20ac15 - 20 one way! Overall our experience was terrible. Every facet of this hotel was disappointing and I wouldn't recommend ANYONE to stay here even one night. You'd have a better experience staying at a hostel!", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cVery unpleasant\u201d", "Author": "krotopop", "ReviewID": "UR58396080", "Content": "We have been treated in pretty rude way at the reception.

We made reservations for this hotel through the Venere website. Hotel cost was 50 Euros with an additional 5 Euros for use of the hotel parking lot. Since some of the rooms don't have bathrooms, we reserved a room with a bathroom. Furthermore, we specified late check-in between 9:00 and 10:00 PM. Upon our arrival, we discovered that our room had been given away. Our room did have a sink but no toilet. There was a community shower and toilets for both sexes. Unfortunately, the women's WC reeked of urine. However, there was plenty of soap, paper towels and toilet paper available. Our room was small and comfortable. Perfect for our short stay. Although there were only 2 of us, our room could have been used as a triple. Breakfast was simple with coffee, tea and juice available. Hotel staff was exceptionally helpful with directions. Furthermore, they didn't have a problem with us leaving our car in the hotel parking lot while we toured Berlin. Bus and S-bahn stops are half a block from the hotel. Be sure to pay for an S-bahn ticket. While riding the S-bahn, we were asked to show our tickets. The only drawbacks for this hotel were the bathrooms and the issue with our reservation.
