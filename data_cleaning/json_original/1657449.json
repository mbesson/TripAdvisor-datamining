This is a relatively new hotel -- opened about 2 years ago, I believe. Check in was easy and the person at the desk was very courteous. The room was clean, and it was spacious. I opted for a king size bed, which left plenty of room to walk around. There was a comfortable chair in the corner for lounging, as well as a desk for work. The room included a small refrigerator (not stocked) and an well appointed bathroom with a large walk in shower. There were two sets of pillows on the bed -- one marked soft and the other marked firm. Unfortunately, neither were to my liking, but I made do with what I had. I had a glass of wine in the bar before calling it a night -- it was a generous glass. The hotel has a small fitness room ( a stationary bike, 2 treadmills and an elliptical), and the fitness room is open 24 hours a day. There is also a business center that has a couple of computers and printers. The restaurant offers a buffet or order off the menu options in the morning. As I was not there for lunch or dinner, I do not know what those menus are like. I opted for the buffet, which had a nice selection of cold and hot foods, including beverages. The price, as I recall, was about $12. The food was good. All in all, this was a good place to stay -- convenient to where my meeting was, and it offers easy access to where ever you may want to go in Phoenix as it is just off University near the 143. I don't know that one room or another matters, but I was in room 204 -- it was certainly quiet. The cost of the room was about $145 with taxes.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Stay\u201d", "Author": "homesafe60", "ReviewID": "UR127332855", "Content": "The Staff here are top notch right from the friendly efficient front desk people (Andrea and Dan) to the waiters and waitresses.

And they didn't care to have a bell so that I could call someone. I stood there for 10 minutes, but nobody showed up. Secondly, on the second day of my stay I found that my sheets were not changed or there were just stained new sheets. When I called up the front desk, they told me that they'd call back. They did call back - to tell me that the cleaning service people left and they'd change the sheets the next day. And I was leaving the next day. Lastly, the coffee in the room was the worst I have ever had in any hotel in US, period. The coffee in the restaurant was only slightly better.

We were able to get booked into a room with no reservation. The man at the counter was very helpful and even scrounged up a baby bed for us and because our flight had been canceled he helped us with a discounted rate and included breakfast which took away some of the sting of not being home after a long day. The room was nice and clean, and comfortable with a large shower. The next morning the people working the restaurant area were very friendly and helpful, and the shuttle driver came and loaded up our luggage while we ate.

The hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport adjacent to the freeway in a corporate park area. It is away from the flight path, so no noise from airplanes flying overhead. The hotel is brand new, and was probably built within the last year. It has the new design theme of Holiday Inn and will blow away all of your past connotations of the shabby Holiday Inns of the 1980s. The design of the hotel exterior, lobby and rooms is sleek and modern. The front desk is more like a kiosk....it's a smaller hotel, so it works. The rooms have an upscale look reminiscent of Westin and Wyndham. Even the bathrooms have granite counters and large, stone tiled bath areas. My only complaint about the sleeping rooms, was that it does not come with an in-room safe. All of the other essential amenities are there - wi-fi, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron and iron board and hair dryer. Other reviewers have complained about the restaurant, and quite frankly, it is small. It can maybe seat 50 guests (there is a small buffet area during breakfast in the rear), so if there is a group staying at the hotel, it can easily get too busy there. My suggestion is to avoid staying at this hotel if there is a group of more than 15 rooms staying there....the property is just not designed to handle groups. Otherwise, the hotel really is beautiful, and I hope all Holidays Inns around the country are going for this new look.

The hotel is a great place to stay to catch a plane out of the Phoenix airport. The room we stayed in was comfortable, quiet and clean. Daniel at the front desk was so helpful in directions to a restaurant and making arrangements for shuttle service. The shuttle to the airport was waiting when we came down to the lobby and everything went smoothly. Our return wasn't as pleasant. I called the hotel after getting our luggage at 1:00am. We were told the shuttle would be right there. (It's 5 minutes away at the most) After waiting 20 minutes in the cold and rain I called again. I was told the driver had been contacted. I called again after waiting 30 minutes and finally the driver pulled up. Another guest waiting had also called a number of times. The driver gave us the excuse that he had just come on duty, but when I asked the other driver's name he changed the subject. When we reached the hotel the driver pulled up at the front door and I explained that we were in the back parking lot and would appreciate it if he took us around back, which he did. Our car wouldn't start and we had to call AAA. Justin at the desk was most empathetic, offered us something warm to drink and kept watching for AAA.

Sleep Quality: beds & pillows very comfortable; beds are firm but have a cushion top or fluffy mattress pad and are very comfortable for sleepers in any position; pillows come in firm or soft, but if you prefers a different thickness of pillow call the front desk as they have different pillows available. This hotel is very close to the airport, but is very quiet; we did not hear planes unless we were out in the pool. The only noise we heard was the quiet hum when the elevator went up and down, but we were in room 203 which has the elevator on one side of it and another hotel room on the other side - however, the hum didn't wake us up when we were sleeping, and both my son and I are light sleepers. Value: hotel was a great value; breakfast buffet (fresh juices included) a little pricey ($9.95 at the time) but was worth it, and our kids ate free, so it was about $5 pp. Our server was very nice and willing to assist; food was delicious; cook offered to make additional waffles for us.
