Mine was very enjoyable with a stone surfaced bath area, and granite on some surfaces. The golf staff was tip top, our carts were clean and on time, and the course marshall kept an eye on things so that they moved along quite nicely. The course itself is well maintained and the room with golf package is an outstanding mid week value. When I finished, my clubs were cleaned and sent up to the bell station to be put in my car.

The floor manager, who passed himself off, by the way as a sommelier, (yeah, right - it's pouring real well, my customers are buying a lot of it - he didn't have the vaguest idea what he was talking about), said the kitchen had \"stuff\" happening. I had to go track the wait staff down after not seeing anyone in ONE HOUR. Oh, and same dull knives to cut our lamb. Utensils are too expensive to stock?

It's a great reminder for me that marketing isn't about accuracy--it's about sales. The reservationist got our date wrong then didn't return my call after multiple attempts to correct the issue. I should have backed out then, but I called the front desk instead to resolve it. The front desk was fantastic every time I called them before and during the stay, however. We arrived after a long day at the zoo with my young son. Valet/bell asked if we'd like assistance, we said yes (twice), but when they saw our room location, they basically insisted we park ourselves. That's fine except we had to haul our bags, with our tired 5 year old through a big parking lot and up a few flights of stairs and all the way around the building. After a long day, it would have been nice to have someone help with our bags, especially since we said we'd like help. Room service was great. Went above and beyond to make suggestions on dinner and gave us perfect directions--elsewhere. Once we got to the hotel, we weren't feeling so confident about having dinner at the hotel, so we went out. The room was a miserable disappointment. Great view, but there were several issues that stopped us from enjoying our stay. The decor was fine, not horrible, not great. It was dated like the exterior of the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and attractive though. It was bright with a nice soaking tub, separate shower with a rain shower head. White subway tile and classic beige marble. Not over the top, but definitely the nicest part of the suite, actually. That's where the nice ended. The construction is either so old that the floors shake, or it's always been very, very, poor. You couldn't tip toe across the room without the floor shaking severely, and we are not big people. I had to call the front desk to make sure there was no one below us because I was worried we were bothering the neighbors. It was ridiculous. Made it difficult to relax because I felt like we had to just sit quietly on the bed and not move around. The next misery was that I found (without looking) many long brown hairs around the suite--inside the sheets, in the bathtub, on the pillow etc. Really gross. It was probably from the housekeeping staff and not the previous guests, but still so not okay to find other people's hair everywhere you are going to sleep. Then there was an area in the grout next to the mini fridge that was sticky, stained, and smelled suspiciously like vomit--while standing nearby. Sorry to be rude, but it was foul. I threw down a towel so we didn't have to walk on the tile. So, at this point, we just wanted to go to sleep so we could get up and leave in the morning. Well, a good night's sleep wasn't in the cards. The sheets and pillows were the absolute worst quality I may have ever felt. Not kidding. That includes the hospital stay when my son was born. They were stiff, scratchy and so cheap. I've never been to prison, but I'm just imagining the sheets... The bed started with horrible mattress, a flat sheet, then a \"comforter\" and another flat sheet. Since the first sheet wasn't fitted, we were literally sleeping on the bare mattress by the morning. If you turn over at all while sleeping, the sheet just moves too and ends up slipping out from under you. Again, so gross. Can't even imagine what my family was sleeping on all night. Seriously, the worst night's sleep EVER in a hotel. After that, all I wanted to do was have each of us take a hot shower with lots of soap. Wished we had brought flip flops for the shower, but the water was hot, the pressure was great, and the aveda products were nice. Of course, then we had to get out of the shower and dry off with towels that the YMCA wouldn't supply for free. I think I am traditionally very fair with reviews and almost forgiving at times. However, the issues we had here, some of them so easy to fix, were just unacceptable for any hotel. Seriously, actually CLEAN the rooms and then spend some money on new bedding and towels. The floor shaking issue, would be harder to fix, but they should be ashamed of the other issues. If you stay here, good luck.

I called the front desk on Thursday morning - very early - asking if they could schedule a couple of spa services for me for the next day.

I was informed the spa was closed but that the front desk would send them an email to contact me first thing Friday morning. I was on conference calls until about 11am on Friday morning and never heard from the spa. I left a voice mail with the manager of guest services informing her that the spa lost out on approximately $400 as no one had gotten back to me. I specifically stated I wasn't looking for anything free, but just wanted to make the Inn aware of the matter. I left the resort to go and enjoy the day in La Jolla. Around 2pm, I received a call from the spa asking me if I wanted to book my services for Saturday. I told them that I had left that voice mail the prior day and that I had wished for spa services on Friday. The response I get is \"oh, I'm sorry, we can book you now\". I retorted no thanks since I'm in La Jolla - 25 minutes away. BTW, I never heard back from the guest services manager either, which I do believe is poor customer service.

We love the grounds and we had a beautiful room overlooking the spa this visit. Sadly, we had some of the same problems as last visit. It's too bad the customer service is not as good as it should be. We were told at the Veranda on Sunday evening that we couldn't have our 3 course meal that we had paid for in the Living Social package. We knew El Bizcocho was closed, but Christina in sales had assured us we could still be served in the Veranda. We finally had a nice meal thanks to Sean, but we weren't expecting the hassle we had to go through first. The resort needs to have better communication about it's packages and what they offer and how to provide the customers with what they have promised. As other reviewers have stated, there is a nasty sewer like smell by the bar area inside near the Veranda restaurant. I almost got sick when I used the restroom in that area the odor was so strong. We ordered orange juice ($4 or $4.50) at the Veranda with our breakfast one day and it was fermented. The waitress just said \"oh, sorry\" and didn't bring us another one or offer to take it off the bill. We had \"smoothies\" in the coffee shop near the lobby another morning and they were essentially like 7 Eleven slurpies - ice and syrup...SOOO terrible. There was no real fruit, cream, nothing nutritional or tasty in it. We also had a problem with the final bill. The Pool Bar bill was $46.18 and it was listed on our final transaction statement. However, below that was what looked to be a duplicate charge for $46.18 at the Pool Bar. When I looked at it closely it said below that second line item \"gratuity\". I told Carley who was helping us at the front desk that we had already left a cash tip ($10, plus $2 more on the room bill for a total of $12, which reflected over 25 % tip on $44.18) with Joe at the Pool Bar. Carley said, \"oh that charge does not reflect in the total\", you can just pay the bill as \"the total doesn't include that line item\". I had my card out, but then did a quick mental calculation, and told her she needed to run the totals again and give me a new final bill. She did and then I paid the total without the gratuity charge. Upon reflection, I wondered how many people just pay the final bill without checking it carefully. I also couldn't help wondering why Joe was able to get by with entering a $46.18 gratuity for himself on our bill?!? We mostly waited on ourselves, walking up the bar for our drinks and sandwich order. I also wondered why Carley was not noticing the discrepancy, or covering for him, when it was obvious we were double charged. I returned to the desk and calmly told her that I would be addressing this with Mr Gates and that it was unacceptable to be double billing, accidental or not. Carley just nodded. This resort is brimming with possibilities with it's gorgeous surroundings, but with the lack of communication, mistakes in billing and poor customer service it falls out of grace. To be fair, after reporting these problems to management they did reimburse the entire pool lunch/bar bill.

Not just staff trying to be pleasant but really nice folks who made our stay memorable and who really cared about us - not just their paycheque. Food is excellent in both the more casual Terrace Restaurant which overlooks the golf course to the formal dining room which we heard was going through a make-over shortly...but as long as the quality of the food from Chef Nic remains the same - with an emphasis on locally grown items - we can see why locals and visitors alike flock to this place for special events, meetings and a weekend getaway. Ask for a room overlooking the golf course...quiet and close to the main building with a lovely bar area and again, outstanding service. The Spa is lovely, the golf course is a bit of an older style, resort course but playable for all levels which makes it fun because you are not constantly being punished for a bad shot. If you want a real challenge go 7-minutes up the road to Maderas Golf Course where 'target golf' abounds but green fees are pricey.

Overall we had a great stay. The spa is definitely the highlight of the property and we had booked services for noon. My expectation was that the hotel would hold onto our bags for us until check-in. Instead the front desk didn't even say a word and sent us to our room at 10:30 a.m. The property itself is well maintained and can best be described as a garden setting. With that said, the architecture is late 1970s / early 1980s Spanish, which just makes the feel of the hotel stuck in this period. This place can do everything right, but the design just didn't age well and that's something that can never be changed. The rooms are comfortable and recently upgraded. The beds were firm with nice linens, the television was high def, ours had a patio overlooking a courtyard. The first floor rooms have private patios, but abut common areas and completely lack privacy. As has been mentioned before, the bathrooms seem dated, although they did look newer. Perhaps it was use of inexpensive and generic tile. The spa was great, but a tad pricey for services. Spa guests have access to the spa pool, which is a lot nicer than the hotel's \"regular\" pools. The food was average hotel food and reasonably priced. Drinks were a downright bargain with $4.00 beers across the property. Free ice tea is also available near the treatment rooms. My one negative comment about the spa is there were three bachelorette parties booked in the pool cabanas. This is fine, but maybe it shouldn't be sold as the spa pool. Really it's just the one remotely hip area the property has to offer and it is borderline day club on a Saturday. All they need is a DJ. Aside from the spa bar, there is also a series of bars in an area called the Viranda. These could just as easily be billed as one bar, not three. The outside area around the fire pit (billed as the Fireside Lounge) was a nice was to spend the early evening. There is also a bar immediately inside with a contemporary decor, and finally a separate area adjacent billed as the Sports Bar. Apparently this is slang used by staff to indicate it's the only place with a TV. The formal restaurant is nice, if not a bit dated and stuffy. Collared shirts are mandatory. I wore a suit and tie and felt comfortable. There is also a separate bar area for use while waiting for your table. The bartender, Tom, was great and had worked for the hotel forever. He was happy to check on our table for us and had just the right balance of conversation without being intrusive. The waiter was great as well, recognizing a long delay in the meal and bringing a complimentary item to address the problem without us even bringing it to his attention. On Sunday morning there are two separate brunches, and we had breakfast in the Viranda area before heading out. The selection of items was good, but again, it was the service that was standout. We did not leave the property once, which is exactly what we were looking for. This might not be for everyone though, and it's really quite a drive to central part of San Diego. The location is not practical if your goal is being out and about and just sleeping at the hotel. Also, there is absolutely nothing of interest in the immediate area. Finally, it's likely there are going to be multiple functions at the property which could affect your enjoyment. The Saturday we stayed, there were the 3 bachelorette parties, at least 2 weddings, and some type of couples workshop. We didn't have any problems, but I can easily see restaurants or pool areas being unexpectedly closed.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Suryonhan", "ReviewID": "UR118503646", "Content": "We loved Rancho Bernardo Inn.

We both enjoyed the beautiful and tranquil grounds and took solace in the our spacious room, which had a balcony overlooking the lush golf course. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon and then headed for the spa where we were greeted cordially and professionally. I swam laps in the pool, while my husband sunbathed and enjoyed a nice cold glass of one of the local craft beers. I then had one of the best facials I've ever had by a esthestician named Sarah. My husband relayed that his massage was really relaxing...exactly what he needed to unwind. I looked at other resorts and hotels in the San Diego area, but none of their spas had everything that I wanted. The Inn's spa had co-ed facilities, each fully equiped with steam rooms and jacuzzi's. There's also a large pool for spa goers only, as well as an additional adjacent jacuzzi. It was so lovely. We were the only ones there. We really liked the layout of the structures because it allowed for privacy and intimacy. I loved how lush the grounds were - the flora was environmentally conscious (lots of succulents) and create a relaxing atmosphere. The only reason I gave this resort a very good rating is because out dinner at the Veranda restaurant could have been better, but then again my husband is a chef who has worked some of the best restaurants in the US, and so I am spoiled.

The property seems charming enough, some might consider the 50's/60's California Ranch style \"dated\" but I consider it classic, but truthfully we didn't have time to explore beyond our room, main lobby, and veranda (restaurant & bar space), and we didn't play golf, use the spa or enjoy any of the property's amenities, including what appears to be a nice kid's program. So why are we disappointed? By the weak service of waitstaff and lack of service by front desk/security/valet staff handling (or lack thereof) of our complaints over two nights. Our first night was marred by a car alarm that went off ALL NIGHT LONG, a beep-beep-beep that cycled on for a couple minutes, off for maybe 10-30 minutes, then on again. First call to front desk was they'd send security. My second call was answered by someone who had just come on and didn't know anything about it but would send security. I slept through the alarms until the one that woke me at 5:30 am but my wife had not slept. So I walked to the front desk and the gal there said she didn't know anything about it but then jumped on the radio to someone saying \"what do you know about that black Honda Civic in Valet with the alarm that's been going off?\" Nice. Second night, and unbelievably, another car alarm was going off into the night, this one being one of those with six different alarm sounds. Thank God it ended sometime after midnight, maybe that's when the offender who had self-parked his pickup truck in the valet lot and left, returned. First call, they'll send security. Second call was met with hostility, \"there's nothing we can do, valet doesn't have a key, we've looked in the bar and asked everyone if it's their truck. Sorry, let's just hope the owner comes back.\" Third was an in-person visit to the front desk who says I'm the only one complaining about it. He radios the valet who says sorry, he didn't find keys or the owner and he's off in 5 minutes so he can't help\" but they'll send security, give them a little more time, and they'll call me and tell me what they're going to do. No call... ...no apologies, no offer to move us to another room, or comp us, or offer SOMETHING. We (including coworkers) had cocktails on the veranda 3 times and 3 times waitstaff was inattentive, one time disappearing with my wife's credit card and had to be located after we waited 30 minutes.for her return. We stayed at a corporate-discounted room rate. I guess that's why we ended up in the \"Terraces\", the rooms that are outward-facing, towards the parking lots, on the perimeter of the resort (and why we were not offered a relocation?). Nice rooms, well-appointed, with attractive casework for dresser, desk and 42\" plasma with digital LodgeNet, and another nice piece which set the king bed at a 45-degree angle, and with integrated night lighting. If the rest of the resort has this level of appointment then you'll be fine.

I always stayed in condos for previous trips to San Diego growing up, so I never needed a hotel. Used TA to find RBI, and also visited their web site. Thought this was going to be better than it was. Arrived late Thursday night (11:30pm) and asked if their were any suites available as RNI sent me an email saying I could upgrade on availability. The front desk person actually told me \"I don't know, I work the front desk.\" OKay...I was tired, so I just asked for my room keys. Walking to the room I felt like I was in a very dated resort. The carpeting in front of the rooms is 10 years overdue for changing, and the exterior paint looks like the original from RBI's glory days. The room was okay. If you want modern, sleek, or new, this is not the place for you. The bedding and TV were nice, but the furniture reminded me of my parent's bedroom from the 70s. Bathroom was really small, as was the shower. Did not hear neighbors at all. Breakfast was good, and the staff at all meals was very pleasant. We were on a package where the kids ate free, so they were excited about that. Prices were high, as expected, but enjoying the view of golfers teeing off on #1 20 yards away, as well as the beautiful course, made me forget a $14 omlette. I also noted food trays sitting for over 8 hours in the hallway. Even my 7 year old came back to the room and said \"Dad...you can still have some of that food from this morning...it's still here.\" The family pool was the real disappointment. It was a square, probably 30x 60, with seating for about 50-60. There were no umbrellas for lounge chairs, although the vegetation and tall trees provided some significant shade. No poolside service on weekdays, but room service will deliver to the pool. Some toys and water basketball for the little ones, so they didn't mind the surroundings. There is a Wii lounge to play video games adjacent to the pool, and the staff there was great. Again, I felt like I was in Vegas in the 60s sitting at this pool. The parking lot is an issue too for larger vehicles. The spaces and rows are cut to maximize the space and it created a number of issues for SUVs. I almost got stuck in a space; unable to back out more than a few inches, then forward, then back...you get the picture. So, I give this place a C. Staff was excellent with few exceptions, but everything else was less than memorable. I felt deceived by the website, especially when it came to how much fun would be had at the main pool.

Lovely decor and interior design, lots of nooks to relax, talk, have a drink, or read a book. There are two full-service restaurants on site, a golf course, a full spa, and several pools.

The grounds are extensive and very well maintained. We took walks around the grounds before and after meals and were amazed at how beautiful and well kept the property is, and how diverse the plants and trees were. Restaurants were excellent, although it was a little confusing to figure out where the restaurants are located and what they served.

The massage was the best I've had and I overhead other guests in awe over the quality of the massage as well. I strongly recommend the outdoor massage followed by a quiet lunch and cocktails at the spa-only pool. Hotel rooms are split into several buildings and you are provided a map upon check-in. It is a little confusing at first, but the property is manageable on foot. Note that resort fees and parking fees may or may not be included in your rate, so be sure to check on that if you are on a budget. We saw several families there as a group and one pool is designated for families and all others are adults only.

The spa pool was the only decent place to lounge in the sun. Had lunch at the Veranda restaurant which was below average. Wedge salad with pancetta had a few tiny crumbles of pancetta and was not that great. Fries were ice cold. My hubby's burger was tasty though. Breakfast buffet was just average and some items were cold, some of the food trays were empty and needed to be replenished. Overall service of the staff is just average. No one remembers your name or seems eager to help you. I expeced more of a \"Four Seasons\" type staff based on the cost and other reviewers comments. This is not a service oriented hotel and the staff is not trained to accomodate the guests. We checked out of our first room b/c of the noise and A/C not working. There was a HUGE spider in our bed in the second room so we had to switch rooms again at 9pm at night. I understand things like that happen, but it is still unpleasant. The front desk staff member who helped us find another room was very kind and helpful. She was the most accomdating staff member we met. When we advised the staff of our complaints, they were not eager to help. The check out staff member simply thanked us for our comments and said she would relay them to management so it could help the next guest. Well, that doesn't really help ME at all, does it? So we had to ask to be compensated for the inconveniences during our stay as she did not offer any solution. She acted like she had never addressed a guest compaint before and only offered to cover our breakfast from that morning. Most high end hotels would upgrade you if you had to check out of your room even once.... we had to change rooms twice and were not upgraded or offered compensation. I would NEVER go back to this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone. I expected way more for $300+/night. I am surprised by the high reviews. We probably would have been better off at the courtyard marriott up the street.

The bathrooms especially are very dark and depressing. The adult pool definitely needs to be redone as most of the pool tiles had cracked and stuff was starting to grow out of them. Furthermore, the hotel is located about 30 minutes from downtown San Diego.

I didn't use the restaurants but I did enjoy the coffee shop. They served Starbucks coffee and had a nice assortment of pastries. Cozy little nooks to sit down and relax with a paper.

The room was really clean, bright and airy, especially with the balcony doors open. Carpet and linens were in great shape, as were the spa robes in the room. We had 50 minute massages included in the package. The massages were done in small outside rooms with heated tables in a quiet outdoor setting. If you don't get the package, their Signature massage is $120 for 50 minutes. Since it was my first massage, I can't tell you whether or not it was \"good\", but I can tell you that the waiting room was relaxing and filled with complimentary fruit, teas, flavored water and spa music. There were 2 hot tubs (one a women only and indoors, one outdoors) and a steam room available with your spa purchase. The outdoor pool and hot tub are salt water and heated to 82 degrees year round. I'm not a golfer, but the people going by with bags all seemed to be smiling, so it can't be all that bad! We ate at \"The Veranda\" for early dinner. The menu wasn't extensive, but it wasn't expensive either, with my margerita pizza being $10.....the food was good, service was absolutely great and the view was beautiful. They have a Sunday Brunch that packs the house on Sundays, so make sure you make reservations if that's your meal of choice. Overall I was very impressed. For the money, it is a great deal. I'm not a spa girl, and I wouldn't hesitate to tell friends to stay at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. It's seclusion and peacefulness (well, besides the golf cart!) mixed with it's cleanliness and great service make you feel pampered and spoiled.

At checkout, both Golf and Spa were still on my bill but the Desk agent caught it before she handed me the bill. Everything else was correct. We thought the food was mearly ok but pretty expensive so not a good value. Steer clear of the breakfast buffet if you want your eggs fresh. Compared to the chain hotels I stay at, the buffet was pretty limited. On the flip side though, the restaraunt staff is extremely attentive and professional. My wife completely enjoyed the Spa experience. The staff were friendly, professional and skilled. The facility was clean and inviting. She came away relaxed and invigorated. The golf course is fun and has some good challenging holes. It rained hard one of the days of our stay but the next morning the course was in great shape. Hat's off to the grounds staff. The shop staff, cart setup, starters and marshals all worked to make for a good round. They keep play at a good pace so a round should finish in 4 1/2 hous. Ours did. I can't figure out the parking fee - $10/night. There's plenty said about it so no surprises for me - and it is still irksome. We enjoyed this hotel, the grounds, the staff and the golf/spa.

Also, the shower/bath fixtures were backward and shower head so high that you could get burned before you got it adjusted.

My husband and I were looking forward to a relaxing weekend while the kids stayed at grandma's house. Unfortunately we were sorely disappointed and left feeling ripped off. We checked in and headed to our room. When we opened the door I stepped into the room to turn on the lights only to find my shoe and the bottom of my pants completely soaked from a pool of water that had run from the bathroom into the entry way of the room due to a leaking toilet. We headed to the front desk to change rooms where they told us that they only had a room with 2 queen beds left...we had reserved a king. Eventually they found one for us, but it clearly wasn't ready for guests. When we arrived we were short towels, the toilet paper was almost gone and there was no replacement roll, there was no bathmat when we got out of the shower, there was no kleenex, no trash can, there was a dead rat outside the room with crows stopping by for a snack, ants in the bathroom and the cleanliness of the bathroom counter left something to be desired. These problems persisted even after housekeeping visited the following morning. They recently remodeled the hotel. The rooms have some nice built in cabinetry now, but the walls and floors were very dirty and needed some attention. When they replaced the carpet the didn't bother to take off the baseboards, so the carpet stopped about 1/4 inch from the wall/ basebaords and was all shredded and coming up on the edges. It was also stained and dirty. We went to the fitness center to workout and the short comings continued. There were no towels or clean headsets to use. We had booked a friends and family rate that was advertised in a mailer we had received. One of the ammenities was that the in room mini bar was included in our rate. It would have been a great deal if the bar had ever been stocked. Finally, when we went to check out, they had added a $40 restauarant charge for a meal that was not ours to our bill. By the time all was said and done, (charging for self parking in surface lots that are empty, passing along San Diego Marketing fees to the traveler, resort fees for things services that we don't use) our two night stay cost us about $400. We left feeling very ripped off and disappointed in the quality of our stay. We have stayed at many Perferred Resorts and are usually happy with the hotel. This was a disappointment.

The hotel itself is gorgeous - a word I overheard many times from other guests also! Although there were 4 rehearsal dinners and 3 weddings that weekend, they were barely noticeable - the grounds are laid out so there is no excessive noise, no crowding... The staff - the whole staff - were the most helpful and accommodating I've encountered. Dinner and breakfast at the Veranda were delicious and reasonable; brunch at El Bizcocho was over-the-top (although, one or two seafood dishes did not benefit from sitting around awhile.) The q/q room was comfortable and very roomy; plenty of space for 2 ladies to spread out without tripping over each other. The double-vanity in the bathroom is a nice touch, as is the small balcony with chairs. The only small problem was our room near the stairs, where it got a bit noisy during late-evening returns and early-morning check-outs. The spa atmosphere was relaxing and the treatments were as good as we expected them to be. Prices are high, but par for the course at a resort like this. Adult-only pool with cabanas was incredibly tranquil; spa lunch poolside was healthy and delicious. I booked thru Southwest Airlines Vacations, and expected a \"value\" experience, but on check-in, the manager threw in an invitation to the Manager's Reception and free breakfast at the Veranda, plus free items in the mini-fridge, like beer, wine, and snacks. Extra touches like this, and the free shuttle to other restaurants or shopping, made us feel like we were totally pampered all weekend.

I heard alot about the Inn and amenities. The room was average at best and in need of updating (Room 815)......the bathroom was tiny.....one person barely fit. Nicest thing about the room was the flat screen, HDTV. All this for $205/night. We stayed at a Residence Inn in La Jolla on the 7th and spent half as much and the room was twice as nice. The restaurant Bizcocho was the same as the room - overpriced and average at best. Wine list was weak and the by the glass offerings horrible. $16 for a glass of Beaulieu Vineyards Cab - are you kidding me? I was a member of their wine club - the bottle only cost $18. Appetizers were not much better, wings were OK and the sesame tuna roll was pretty good. We attended a group dinner on two separate nights......these were the best meals we had. One night they did a buffet with a Mexican theme - all in all the food was good - but resembled more of what a Marriott would offer not a high end Inn like Rancho Bernardo. The second night we had a plated dinner - apps, dinner and dessert. Finally something good. The filet mignon was excellent - cooked perfectly and a good piece of meat. My wife visited their spa and gave it slightly above average ratings. She got a good massage and told me the overall spa was nice. Again, she thought it was a bit overpriced for what she received. Do not fall victim to the hype of their website......stay in Del Mar or La Jolla - try L'Auberge in Del Mar......you will find nicer hotels, some on the water - for the same rate.

Working with her was absolutely wonderful. She was very friendly and professional. The hotel itself has some wonderful qualities. The main building has an upscale lodge feel to it and is very beautiful. So are the grounds. The front desk staff needs some more training or a change in attitude. When you walk up to one of them, there is almost a look of fear in their eyes. It seems they are ready to be defensive. Smiles seem a little fake. The clerk who checked me in failed to tell me about the free breakfast and complimentary items in the mini-fridge. Fortunately, I was aware of them while making the reservation. The room was beautiful and overlooked the golf course. We were on the top level, so the ceilings were high. The room was very big, recently updated and well-furnished. The bathroom had double sinks which was nice. However, the bathrooms appeared a little older. There was a little mold in the shower, but not a deal-breaker. The restaurant was painfully slow, but forgivable our first morning. The second was an awful experience. To lure families, the resort offers kids free meals. When we went to breakfast, a few sets of parents, who were traveling together, were at the restaurant with their children. The kids were screaming and running all over the place. They also were only wearing bathing suits and no shoes which is actually a health code violation. The management did nothing and should have on its own. To make matters worse, our order was not taken for 20 minutes. Our pot of coffee was forgotten after three requests. The manager, noticing we were not happy, offered to credit our room for the cost of breakfast. We were satisfied with that, but after his offering, neither he nor anyone from the staff checked on us again. As we started to walk out, the manager ran over and apologized again. Also, self-park was $10 a day for guests. However, people who were at the hotel for functions were able to park in the same lot for free. And, in some cases, we could not find a parking space. At least it was at times we only had to quickly run to the room. We actually left our car in the fire zone with flashers! The resort has no way to really monitor who is parking where.

Booked this property online through Priceline. I was looking for a 31/2 star location near Poway. The Rancho Bernardo Inn is not on the website. Ended up getting it for $75 per night with no mention of a $20 dollar resort fee and $10 dollar parking fee. This made me mad upon check-in. The parking lot is ridiculous to park in on the weekend. I would pay $2 more for Vallet, although that line was very long. Our room was on the 2nd floor with a courtyard view.(no elevators, so be where...) The room was nicely decorated with under bed lighting(My daughter thought that was cool) .We had a frig stocked with beer, soda, water and some snacks, hence the $20 fee. It was leaking and had to continually wipe up water off the floor. The beds were comfortable , but the towels left a lot to be desired. they were small and rough. not a high quality. The coffee bar in the room was not fully stocked. We enjoyed our stay, but I would stay on the first floor closer to the pool.

This place, compared to other similarly rated properties was very disappointing. We wanted to check out as soon as we arrived. There was a long and confusing hike to find our hotel room. Prior to arriving Arlene in the spa bent over backwards to accommodate our last minute requests at the spa. Because of all of her hard work and professionalism we decided to give RBI another chance. Arlene in the spa was so accommodating and welcoming we decided to tolerate a lot more than we normally would have. When we arrived in the room it was nice and clean with what appeared to be a lowly budgeted recent remodel. When we sat on the bed, the mattress slid across the frame mounting about 6 inches. The frame of the bed was too big for the mattress! The bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear springs in the mattress all night and neither my husband or I got a good night sleep! I ended up with bruises on my legs from banging them on the frame every time I got out of bed. The only nice thing I can say about this place is the spa was a wonderful experience and the atmosphere of the grounds is beautiful. Our hotel rate included 2 spa treatments with each night stay for $268. Which is a great deal if the room had not been so miserable. I have been to better spas, but everyone was quite professional and caring. My husband chose to have the signature massage and I chose the aroma therapy facial. We also opt'd for the spa pedicure, which in my opinion was a waste of money. The environment for the pedicure was not in the spa area and the bench seat was very uncomfortable. The room was attached to the fitness area and was very loud and non-relaxing. The spa has a nice dressing room area with all of the amenities, 3 showers and plenty of lockers. While waiting for your treatment you can enjoy a private men or women only steam room and jacuzzi, the saline pool or co-gender jacuzzi, or relax in the cabanas that are included for spa members only. Needless to say the night only got worse when we went to the Veranda Dining area and were highly disappointed by the very low quality of the food offered there. The ambiance was amazing as it sits outside overlooking the golf course but we could have gotten better food from Denny's down the road! Overall it was nice to have a weekend away with my husband but I would highly recommend that you consider another place unless you are used to the Holiday Inn level or lower of accommodations.

This place is very old and run down on the outside, however the room we were in was nicely remodeled. The pool they show online is not the pool you are allowed to use unless you have booked at the spa for that day but no where do they mention that, as stated in other reviews the pools you are allowed to use are no better than a motel 6 pool. The pools are not conveniently located by the rooms so we only used it 1 time. There is no elevators, where we were located was the 2nd floor in the middle of the hotel so up 2 flights of stairs and down the long hallway was no fun at all with luggage and children, this was everytime we left. I will say that the staff was friendly until check out. At check out we were hit with an unexpected additional 232.00 to out hotel bill. We were there for 7 nights/8 days and were charged a 20.00 a night resort fee (that covered the so called free internet) and an additional 10.00 a night parking fee so the additional 30.00 a night added up. We were not told about this fee upon check in yet the hotel manager was not willing to do anything for us so we were stuck paying that. We also ordered room service breakfast one morning for our family of 4 and an additional 20.00 was added to that bill,18% gratuity and a tip, on top of that they expect another tip when delivered (this is standard in all hotels for room service, so not just this one) but when you are paying that kind of money you would expect the food to be delivered hot, but it was cold so our 80.00 breakfast was no good at all. I hate to see what dinner for 4 would have cost us as everything in the resort was very over priced. I was so upset at check out that honestly if I were offerd a free week there I would turn it down so fast. I was very unhappy with this place and have no desire to ever step foot on this property again as I have stayed at nicer Holiday Inns. Please do not expect much from this hotel when booking, ask about any additional fees up front and you may have an ok stay but for the nightly rate they charge I would really really recommend another resort.

Every time we tried to eat with the kids in one of the restaurants they did not apply the kids eat free discount and we had to ask them to rerun the bill to apply the discount. (twice -- then we gave up because the selection was so limited). Its a 15 minute drive to get food outside of the resort but there are some decent options around town. The big pro to the hotel for kids are the grounds themselves. We had a great time exploring the resort and took many long walks to look at the beautiful fountains, trees, and flowers. The kids actually loved watching the golfers and we got to talk a lot about the game. If not for the grounds, it would have been comparable to a comfort inn.

Our room had a patio, but unfortunately we never used it because there was a heavily-trafficked path in front of it so there wasn't much privacy. Free wi-fi is available--a big plus in my book. And I loved the Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, which was kept well-stocked! Room service was tasty and reasonably priced, as were poolside drinks. Don't attempt to bring your own drinks into the pool area, though. We saw someone try to but they're big sticklers about that (understandably so). The staff was very friendly, and did an excellent job in terms of the wedding, cocktail hour and reception. It was really well-orchestrated and the meal was great. One other thing to note - the resort isn't in San Diego proper. It's about 30 min. or so north. The hotel doesn't offer a shuttle to/from the airport, but they did recommend Cloud 9 Super Shuttle.

I am extremely picky when it comes to cleanliness and customer service. Here is the scoop! We got a great rate of $150 per night through Hotels.com. We arrived late, so it was not easy to navigate the place in the dark. The room was decent, but nonetheless I brought my Lysol (wiped all the door knobs, the remote control and toilet). For those who stayed there in 2006 and talked about \"tired rooms\" and construction, it's all done now. It has a rustic/Spanish (not Mexican) feel to it, perhaps you can imagine being in Europe or in the country somewhere. It's nice overall, but keep in mind that it's not a new place (although they've updated their rooms). Here are few complaints: The beds were HARD. The pillows were strangly filled. Mine was hard as a rock and it felt full of knots. Another pillow was \"deflated\". The comforters were not stuffed well either (some won't keep you warm). The fan in the bathroom was very loud and rattled (old perhaps) The air conditioning was the same as the fan. The sales lady in the golf shop was snooty. If you are not as picky as I, and the above mentioned won't bother you, than you should try this place. Make sure you get a reduced rate though. The grounds are beautiful and the waiter we had was very helpful. Can't say the same for the hostess (probably her young age had something to do with it). My husband kept complimenting me on finding this place, so he liked it. He is even planning on bringing his sales team there for some R&R. Overall, it was better than I expected and considering the fact that these days it is rare to find a hotel that lives up to its rating, I would give them a B-/C+. Trust me, I've been to Ritz Carlton and St Regis, etc, that got even worse ratings from me. FYI - the location is in a residential area Make sure you ask and confirm what's included and what's not.

I read the glowing reviews on this site and noticed the hotels's ads hyping their recent 25 million renovation. I thought the hotel would be the sort of resort worthy of a $350.00 room rate (again, on a Sunday evening). I was mislead. After checking in, we walked down the musty halls full of signs indicating various conference and wedding locations. The room, overlooking the back pool, was equally musty, dark, and damp. The decor was dated and I would compare it to an upscale Howard Johnson. Yes, it was clean and a good size. However, if there were renovations (again, find hard to believe), they were done on the cheap. The bathroom was the same - upscale Hojo style. Cheap tilework in the shower, plastic seeming fixtures, and the like. We decided to step out by the pool and relax. Let's just say it was a D.I.Y. pool. No one offered a drink, to help us with towels, or anything of the sort. We visited the spa pool on the following day - never even saw anyone. When I checked out, I was not asked whether I enjoyed my stay, otherwise, I would have mentioned some of my issues to the desk person. The excpetion to the overall D.I.Y. service was at the spa. I had a wonderful massage and the spa staff was terrific. The restaurant servers were very attentive as well - the food was standard hotel fare. Nothing great, nothing bad. Overall, this hotel deserves more of a 2 or 3 star rating. It certainly is not worthy of the price paid.

I was here for a conference, so stayed on property the entire time and never felt the need to escape (as one often does!). The property is just gorgeous - fountains and beautiful gardens everywhere. When you walk in, there are low ceilings with rustic beams and lovely old persian carpets, so it feels like a gorgeous old lodge rather than a huge hotel. There are several pools, including the amazing spa pool. This is reserved for spa guests or you can pay $10 for a day pass for other guests. Since we had several spa treatments, we got to use it for free, and took every advantage. It was not hugely warm but still sunny so I went swimming even though very few people were! Using the cabanas was a great way to keep out of the breeze and stay warm. There is little service there but the spa staff bought me water and offered me room service if I wanted. It fits with the serene spa experience. The spa itself is wonderful - the services were wonderful, top notch practitioners and location. You can even have outdoor massages (it wasnt warm enough for that when we were there!) We had a standard room but it was very nicely furnished. The bathroom was a little dated but still nice and a good size. The room overall was a decent size and the beds were very comfortable. Our room had a patio and we could hear a fountain at night. The food at the resort was also wonderful. We had most events catered by the hotel and the food was excellent every time - the sign of a well managed kitchen since feeding 200 people is always a stretch! We also ate at their high end restaurant - El Bizcocho - excellent food although very expensive. It is a bit pretentious and one of our friends was asked to leave and change out of jeans. I mean, its California, not Paris! That seemed a bit much. Anyway, once she was changed, we were seated and I had the vegetarian tasting menu which was intriguing. The food is quite complicated, which I am not usually a fan of, but it was delicious. It depends what you are into. I suppose if I had to describe what I like its local fresh ingredients (organic if possible) thoughtfully prepared, not disguised by 15 ingredients. They had an excellent wine list. We ate another meal at the more casual Veranda, which was also excellent and a bit simpler. The room service breakfast I had was fresh and tasty. Gosh I've said wonderful a lot, but that really sums it up. The brochures use the word elegant a lot. It is elegant, but more rustic elegant - its not the St Regis New York (which is what I think of when I think elegant) but its California elegant. Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel.

I can't remember the last time I saw a plastic ball shower knob. They have flat panel tv's but they are all configured incorrectly so the picture is so stretched out everyone looks 4' tall and twice the weight they actually are. We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year - July and August. Both times we spent several days at the adult pool and were very disappointed in the lack of pool side drink/food service. One day no one ever appeared. Another day we moved to the bar across from the golf shop to sip a few drinks and watch the football game. The service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress and the bartender were so rude we had to get management to discuss their behavior (it's a long story). After returning 2 drinks that were mixed incorrectly, we watched as the bartender poured 2 separate drinks from our glasses into one cocktail shaker, added something, and poured into our 2 used glasses. The waitress attempted to reserve to us, when I informed her that we wouldn't be drinking those drinks and that what the bartender just did was a health code violation...... I could go on and on about the lack of response from her and the angry bartender - it was unbelievable! One morning we left our room early, walked out the door and was assaulted with the worst stench I've ever experienced. Apparently the sewer system had backed up the day before and they had scheduled maintenance - now don't you think they would have asked us to move rooms the night before???? It was so disgusting my husband and I almost threw-up trying to get to our car. The next morning, Sunday, we decided to sit outside in our little patio, have a cup of coffee and read the paper. Unfortunately, the gardener thought it was a good idea to use the blower to clear leaves on Sunday at 8:30 am and proceeded to do this and was actually blowing leaves into our patio! That was it for me. I met with the Asst. Manager, apparently the GM didn't have time, I told him all my complaints in a very nice way and my disappointment that I wouldn't be coming back to what use to be one of my favorite places. He listened with what seemed like interest (took notes), and I never heard another thing. I can't tell you how many friends have told me about their bad experiences at the RB Inn.

The best thing about the location is the proximity to the Wild Animal Park. If that is a main highlight in your travel agenda, definitely stay here. The property itself is well decorated and comforting, quiet, safe,fountains and wells everywhere, and though it is nice that there are two separate pools (one for kids and one adult pool) the adult pool was in a courtyard surrounded by rooms, and lots of foot traffic. The jacuzzi next to the adult pool was great, could fit about 18 people in there if you wanted to. There was a nice gleaming mediterranean pool in sight, yet it was part of the spa, and was being set up for an event while we were there, so we couldn't enjoy it. The grounds are dotted with cheesy motel lodge style jacuzzis hidden behind fenced in mini courtyards with a single bistro table with chair and covered in dirt and floating leaves. Not so fancy, eh? Note that this is a golf resort, and for golfers, it must be amazing, the course looked really nice. My boyfriend and I are not golfers, but never mind staying at golf-emphasis resorts, however we were looking forward to playing tennis, but guess what? The courts are under construction, and most of them have been torn down. As far as the rooms go, when they give you the option to stay on the first or second floor, always choose the second. First floor you get a sliding door and patio which EVERYONE can walk by and gawk at you, where as second floor has a balcony, and more privacy. The room had a slightly musty odor, but a super comfy bed and nice soft pillows. Ipod dock made getting ready feel more at home. The bathroom was OK, tub and shower were really nice, two sinks and plenty of space for toiletries, they supplied Aveda products which was also a nice touch, but the one pet peeve was that the bathroom didn't have a fan, which meant it would get very steamy after a hot shower, but worse, no circulation for \"odor.\" We ate lunch out on the terrace facing the course, this was possibly my favorite part, late afternoon watching all of the golfers coming back from their games, we enjoyed bloody marys, a mediocre salmon and an amazing, perfectly cooked risotto (with a mysterious mushroom mousse surrounding it.) We later in the evening enjoyed cocktails at the upstairs upscale restaurant, while we were considering dinner there. Food here is supposed to be amazing, but the environment felt a little too stuffy for our taste so we went out of the resort exploring (wish we hadn't, in retrospect dinner at the resort would have likely been much better.) All in all I would say this is a great place for golfers, or those who want something very quiet and safe with good food and nice cocktails. This is the perfect place to come back and unwind from a day out looking at animals, and for lovebirds there is one item on the room service menu I would recommend: bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cGreat relaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "Cork_Boy", "ReviewID": "UR8418924", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn as part of our honeymoon.

We chose to go to the San Diego area to visit Legoland and Seaworld for my two year old son. We stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn for four nights. We found this hotel in our Entertainment Book. This is suppose to be a four star hotel but I found should be no more than a three. This hotel had some good things I liked and bad things that I did not like. When we arrived at the hotel on Sunday, August 6, the valet service was great. They unloaded our bags with no problems. The grounds were beautiful. It was very green and very well manicured. They had two pools. One for families and one for adults only. I thought that was great. The fitness center was ok. Here is the part I did not like. The room was very large. We had plenty of space but was not very clean. The carpet had stains on it. The mini bar was not stocked. The bed spread was very out dated and was old and dengy. The bed skirt had stains and holes in it. I saw atleast 3 pieces of hair on the sheets. It was not our hair because we had just checked in. The chair that was in the room had a number of stains on it. The drapes had a number of stains and was old. The decore was out dated. I always carry lysol with me when I stay at a hotel and I used the whole can spraying the beds, bathroom, carpet, drapes and anything else I could. I never felt comfortable in this room. The straw that broke the camels back is I saw three spiders in the room over my four night stay. I hate spiders and to have them in my room was unacceptable. The balcony was nice to have. We were in the very back of the hotel which when you walked out, you were in the parking lot. I read the reviews from other guest before making our reservations and thought maybe I would just give it a try. I should have listened to the other guest that stayed there. I would have left but had pre-paid for the room through the Entertainment company and was to late to get a refund. I should of listened to people that had already stayed there and gave their opinion in their reviews. The staff was nice but I will never stay there again. I didn't listen to the other people but will in the future.

I was then told \"sorry, it's first come, first served.\" I will skip many details but the bottom line was I had to get the manager and argue for something I already paid for. We were finally given a room, which was very nice and I must say the grounds are beautiful, although the spa was going through renovations. We only ate breakfast at the Veranda which was very good. I believe this hotel is lovely, it just needs better trained staff and clairification on hotel policies. It is a bit out of the way being situated in a residential area but close enough to the freeway so you can get many places quickly. Oh, as for the hotel being full, we only saw one other person in our building the entire time we were there so i'm not sure what that was about.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Grounds, Sub-par Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5010971", "Content": "I have stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn numerous times for business. Although this hotel is near our client's office, my colleagues rarely stay here, opting instead for a nearby 2-star hotel at the same (corporate) rate. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms nice, but the service is erratic at best. Certainly not what you would expect of a self-proclaimed luxury hotel. Many of the employees are young and inexperienced - they seem to be students who are never there long enough to get to know the hotel or its policies well. Many times, I have asked a simple question that had to be referred to a supervisor. In addition, the rooms are not well maintained. On different occasions, I have had a stopped-up bathtub, a non-working internet connection, a broken alarm clock, and quite a few mis-programmed keys. The food is delicious, but the bar is the only place to get good service with it. Individually, these are not big issues.
