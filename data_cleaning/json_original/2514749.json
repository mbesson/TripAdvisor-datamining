The personnel on the front desk were lovely, as were the chambermaids. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - it seemed a shame to do so when we were able to explore the Marais and have breakfast on the terraces of nearby cafes and watch the world go by. The room was compact - not small, as such but certainly not spacious. The bed was comfortable and it all felt quite cozy. Lots of storage space between the chest of drawers and the wardrobe. The mirror in our wardrobe had a slight crack in it. The bathroom was immaculately clean but had a low ceiling. I'm 5' 10\" so I can imagine showering being uncomfortable for anyone over 6' in height! The toiletries were a citrus-scented hair and body wash - bring your own is my advice.

The hotel is very convenient to either the Hotel de Ville (1 line) Metro or a closer metro on the eleven (11) line. The hotel is extremely close to the Pompidou center so there are lots of restaurants in the area. It is very close to a couple of small grocery stores and some pastry shops. We ate breakfast in the hotel a couple of days, but found it be much less expensive to eat at the local pastry shops and I liked the pastry shop food better. Breakfast was essentially three kinds of bread. There was some cereal that looked like it had never been touched and for extra money you could get protein of some sort. We paid 130 Euros per night. There are a few homeless in the area, they were alcoholics and never appeared threatening. Later in the week we transferred to another \"modern\" hotel near the convention center for a meeting, I like the Beauborg much better because you feel like you have experienced France.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cascais, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel in the Marais\u201d", "Author": "Mica1966", "ReviewID": "UR125013934", "Content": "Very nice little hotel in the best area of Paris, rooms are very nice and toilet very nice and clean.

The breakfast is a typical light French style with french bread, croissants, butter, jam, orange juice, and coffee. There is also cereal and for a little extra you can add a egg or sausage. The wifi is a little slow at times and you have to login each time you use the wifi, but once I got the hang of the process I was able to get it working faster. Only one day it barely worked at all.

We were told the Eiffel Tower was a short walk away. It took us almost an hour to walk there by foot. Ultimately, we should have taken a river boat on the Seine River to the Eiffel Tower. We also were given wrong directions by the front desk to get to a museum and found it to be very frustrating. Fortunately, everyone we met in Paris was very friendly and helpful so we were able to find our way. Other than those two situations our stay at this hotel was great.

It is in a great location on the edge of the Marais, just across the street from the Pompidou Centre. It is about a 4 minute walk to Chatelet - Les Halles, which is a good metro hub, but also has an RER stop for the trains to and from both Orly Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport ( It took about 55 minutes to get to the hotel from Orly and about 35 minutes to get from the hotel to CDG when I left). TIP: If taking the RER to CDG airport, choose the right train for the terminal that you need to go to. The trains leave from the same track and are well marked as to which terminals they go to, but there are some that go only to Terminals 1 and 3 and others (TGV) that go only to Terminal 2. If you choose the right train at Chatelets, you won't have to locate and take the shuttle between terminals - which will add time to your trip.

Beware of the shower though, you tend to splash out a lot and make a soggy mess of your foot towel, but just adjust the pressure when soaping up and you should be fine. The bed was very comfortable (it was one of those memory foam mattresses which I now understand are amazing and will be purchasing for my home). The room also had a mini bar a large closet, medium flat screen TV, desk and sitting chair. Bathroom amenities (shampoo, body wash, etc) left something to be desired but I bring my own anyway so it didn't matter. Our room faced Rue Simon Le-Franc and was very quiet.

The front of house staff were all friendly, especially if I made an effort to speak french! One criticism is there were no english tv channels in the room. CNN or BBC World News would have been nice. Also, you sometimes hear a bit of noise from the hall or the room next door. Bathroom was great, with a full bath and spotlessly clean. No frills, but comfortable and convenient. I'd stay here again.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gastonia", "Title": "\u201cBeware!

We celebrated our 2nd anniversary with a trip to Europe, four nights in London then four nights in Paris. We booked this hotel because of their rating on Tripadvisor and the central location to sites we wanted to take in. The Hotel staff were very friendly and the room was decent. We paid 150 Euro per night for a King bed. A little too much noise late at night but not too bad. After we checked out and were on our way back to London for the flight home, I tried to use the Oyster card that was in a card sleeve that I had purchased earlier in London and it did not work. Upon opening the sleeve to look at the card, it had been replaced with a used international calling card. I used this card at the last station at Tower Hill to get to St, Pancreas station to take the Euro Train to Paris. It was in a zippered pocket the entire time. I had two jackets with me so I left this one in the room in Paris because I would not need it again until our return trip to London to get to Victoria station for the express back to Gatwick Airport. The oyster card can be turned back in to get the 5 British Pound deposit plus any amount up to 7 British pound unused on the oyster card. The Oyster card was definitely removed from its sleeve and replaced with the used Calling card in the room at Hotel Beaubourg. It is a minor theft but still a theft. We checked all of our valuables on a daily basis there. The cars sleeve is closed with the card on the inside and you cannot physically see it from the outside but can only feel that it is there.My wife contacted them, gave them this same information. We only asked to be reimbursed for the value of the Oyster card and the amount that was left on it. A total of 9.90 British pounds. They are asking us to fill out a police report to give to their insurance. We inquire how do we go about doing that. Their reply is to \"Fill out a Police report\". We feel that this is getting us nowhere so We just wanted to let potential victims to be vary careful with this Hotel Beaubourg. Do not leave anything valuable in the room as minor as An Oyster card or Metro cards. It is the principal of the matter not the amount. All they needed to do to make it right with use is to credit my account the 9.90 British Pounds, but I have to spend major time and effort because someone on their staff is a THIEF!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bremen, Germany", "Title": "\u201cTo recomment, perfect location, quit\u201d", "Author": "R M", "ReviewID": "UR120071102", "Content": "Perfect location for Pompidou, Louvre, Marais and easy access to numerous metro stations.

My reservation was on file, the first night was pre-paid and within 5 minutes we were in the room and unpacking. We had room 46, located in the back of the hotel with a view facing the courtyard.

Most of the hotels in older Parisian buildings have small rooms. Sometimes it required the two of us to reshuffle luggage to move about, but nothing we could not handle. Definitely not a room for those who might require handicap accessible features though. Bathroom with shower (no bathtub) and hair dryer. Hot water worked flawlessly for the four nights we were there. Cable/Satellite TV with NO ENGLISH CHANNELS. If you want your daily fix of CNN, etc. you need to speak French to understand anything on TV.

I've stayed all over Paris, and while this wasn't the Ritz it certainly lived up to its appeal as a charming, small boutique with larger than average rooms, great front desk customer service, and amazing central location in the Marais. I was in Paris for 24 hours and spent a night here as I wanted good access to the Marais AND Les Halles Metro so I could get back and forth to Charles de Gaulle Airport easily. Hotel is right next to the Pompidou Center (known as locals as Beaubourg), and about 5-7 minute easy straight-shot walk from hotel to Les Halles metro stop for the RER and other transpo options. I paid $210 for the night for a standard room. Hotel lobby is small, cute, but nothing fancy. I'm more used to chain hotels (think Sheraton, Westin, etc) and didn't come here for business so didn't need all those amenities. I've stayed at the Westin Paris at Place Vendome which was amazing - didn't want to spend on all the glitz this time. Just a quick 24 hour trip to Paris en route to Italy. Reception was always very nice - had to return the key each time upon entering and leaving hotel which I really hate. But it's common in Europe. More a safety concern which is why I think they ask you to leave your key when you leave the hotel. Teeny tiny elevator but enough for me and my bags. Room itself was on the top floor and was really cute. Bigger than I expected, and had a large bathroom, King bed (two twins pushed together which is typical in Europe) a writing desk, fridge, closet, and a little sofa. Cute view over the rooftops/courtyard. Bathroom was CLEAN. Room was CLEAN. While this hotel could certainly use an upgrade, and it would be a lovely boutique, the furnishings were somewhat simple/plain/dated. Though I cannot stress again how clean everything was. No gross spots, marks, stains, dust, cobwebs. So you don't have high end luxury furnishings but you have a good clean comfortable and rather spacious (for Paris) place to lay your head. My biggest grip (and always is in Paris/Europe) was the shower. This shower had the half-size glass shower 'curtain' that only covered half the length of the tub, so of course I got water everywhere. BUT at least there were plenty of good (and shockingly comfortable) towels to wipe up the water. :-) If you're here with your partner, husband, wife whatever this is an excellent cheaper option for a pleasant stay in a cute boutique hotel in the middle of the Marais.

Proximity to Rambuteau and Hotel De Ville metros means journeys to other areas are quick and convenient. Hotel is located in relatively quiet side street directly behind Centre Pompidou so we enjoyed reasonable level of peace and quiet. Our double room faced inner courtyard which I would recommend. However room size is tiny (typical in Paris) and bed was only of average comfort. Shower pressure and temperature were good though. Importantly for us - the room and hotel were consistently clean. We were appreciative of the front desk staff who we found to be very helpful, accommodating and spoke good English. True they may not be the most smiley or chatty people, but we took this to be 'cultural' so we didn't take it personally. We would definitely stay here again given value for money and location. Warning: we used the airport transfer service from hotel to CDG. We were advised trip would take 1 hour. However, the car was 1/2 hour late to arrive plus the trip took 1.5 hours - a 2 hour trip in total.

The room is dark, because of the low beamed ceilings and the dark fabric on the walls. Also the lighting seems to be low wattage as well. The King room had plenty of room plus the big bed which was a true king and not just two smaller beds pushed together. Because of the fabric on the walls, the room was very quiet.

Maid service was very efficient (and friendly!) They all respected my Do not disturb sign (I usually slept really late!) AC worked fine, but most of the time just opening the window was fine. Front desk staff were friendly but did not offer a lot of suggestions for local bars and eateries etc. I tried the hotel breakfast one morning and it was fine.

The only downside to rm. 22 is that it can be rather noisy from the street. If you are a light sleeper, request a room in the back of the hotel. Breakfast is offered at 9 euros per person. This included fresh breads, yogurt, butter/jam and coffee. We added cheese for an extra 3 euros per person. We had breakfast the first morning at the hotel and although it was very nice, we went by the suggestion of other reviewers and ate at the local cafes within walking distance for the remainder of our stay. This proved to be more cost affective and fun! The location of this hotel is AMAZING! It's in the Marais section of Paris, which, is basically the heart of where everything is and walking distance to the major sites. There are 3 metro stops in close proximity. Chatalet, Rambuteau, Hotel De Ville. Also, we found ourselves going back to our hotel area to eat dinner because there are so many great Brasseries, which offer great food, casual dress, and very fair prices for super quality. Everything is open late and we found a nice mixture of tourists and locals. People in general are very nice and helpful. TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM CDG USING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: We arrived using the RER Rail line from the airport. Follow signs in the airport reading \"GARE\" and/or \"RER.\" Depending on where you are in the airport, you may have to take a mini bus to the other terminal where the GARE is located. Have 9 Euros in change ready so you can purchase a train ticket from the machine, rather than stand in long lines to purchase. You will want to take the B3 RER line to Chatelet Les Halles. Get off on Chatelet Les Halles and the hotel is a 4 min. walk through some wonderful little streets. I mapped out walking directions using www.mappy.fr. This is a great website similar to our mapquest.com. Please note: If you use public transportation back to the aiport, ONLY TAKE THE B3 line. If you take the other line, you will end up in the suburbs of Paris and not at the airport. TRANSPORTATION USING AIRPORT SHUTTLE: On our way back to the airport, we asked concierge to hook us up with a shuttle bus. The cost is about 20 Euros per person and we found this to be worth the extra money as the shuttle drops you off directly to your terminal. Plan to leave a few hours earlier since the bus does pick up other folks from other hotels and Paris traffic is comparable to some of the heaviest traffic spots in the US. Pay in cash. I'm not sure if the shuttles take credit cards. Overall, the hotel is very clean and we found the service to be very good. Everyone speaks english, but it is well received when you attempt some basic french phrases out of respect.

You can virtually get on almost any line from those stops which is great for sightseeing. Additionally, you can take the RER B train from Paris CDG and ORLY right into Chatalet Les Halles and walk to the hotel - its only about 5 minutes and is a straight shot. The hotel is small, but the rooms are decent size for Paris and the bathroom was very large for Paris standards. In addition there are tons of things open and going on around the hotel at all times, but it remains quiet inside. GOOD: Our rooms were clean and comfortable and really that is all the maters. They were also quiet and we really couldn't hear our neighbors. There are only 4 floors and 4 rooms per floor, keeps things simple. The room also had a mini fridge - which was nice to put water and other things in there. DISLIKED: The hotel advertised free wi-fi internet access and while it was free, it was only in the lobby which was a pain to always have to go down tot he lobby to use the internet, but it also gives a social outlet by meeting others in the lobby doing the same thing and since this hotel is in the Marais, the majority of the clientele when I was there, were of the same mind-set. Lastly, they also provide a safe, but it is with the front desk and not your room. COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT: Honestly, everything was good, the one thing I could have done without was the attitude of a specific front desk person.

When we arrived, the back of the hotel where our room was appeared to be undergoing some renovations, and the carpet was covered in plastic which was a bit off putting.

Try Pain de Sucre on nearby Rue Rambuteau for exquisite and cutting-edge patisserie.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cologne", "Title": "\u201cOverbooked and impertinent staff\u201d", "Author": "Urmel66", "ReviewID": "UR8612856", "Content": "Having booked well in advance, we were informed upon arrival that they had an IT problem and lost a few reservations - including ours. Funny enough, we have seen our confirmation eMail in the receptionist's documents, so we are absolutely sure that this was just a daft attempt to distract from the fact that the hotel was simply overbooked. They offered accomodation in another hotel, \"very nice and just around the corner\". As we had never heard or read anything about this other hotel (\"Hotel Vieux Marais\"), we insisted on inspecting it and its rooms, at first. The receptionist told us that we would have to pay the first night at Hotel Beaubourg by signing the credit card receipt issued as security deposit (Hotel Beaubourg will clear with the other hotel) and that we will only have to pay the second night in the alternative hotel. When we refused to sign the credit card receipt before having seen the hotel, the receptionist was extremely impertinant, using swearwords and tried to intimidate us. After a rough discussion, we left our luggage in Hotel Beaubourg and went off to see \"Hotel Vieux Marais\". What the receptionist described as \"nice and clean\" was a 2-star-hotel (Hotel Beaubourg has 3 stars!) with an ugly reception, run-down lift and awful rooms - all in all not worth half of the money we were asked to pay! After having returned to Hotel Beaubourg, we told the receptionist that we are not going to change from 2- to 3-star and he suddenly began calling other hotels in the area. We agreed on changing to another 3-star hotel (Hotel Bretonnerie) which we knew from our other trips to Paris and which is comparable to Hotel Beaubourg. All in all, we had a great stay at a nice hotel with friendly staff, but we will never book at Hotel Beaubourg, again! Overbooking, rude staff and an attempt to shift us off to a much cheaper hotel at the same price (and probably keeping the difference) is not a good way to attract future guests!", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wokingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Sapphire22", "ReviewID": "UR8470731", "Content": "We wanted to stay at a clean and reasonably priced hotel in the Marais district and this hotel met all our expectations. The Beaubourg is well located behind the Centre Georges Pompidou on a short one way side street (a bit challenging to get to if driving) near a Metro station. We had requested a quiet room with a bath and shower and our room overlooked the courtyard and the (very narrow) bathroom had a small shower stall and full sized bath tub. The room was small by North American standards, but very typical of Parisian hotels in this price category. The air conditioning was quiet and efficient and very welcome in Paris in August. The room and the entire hotel were spotlessly clean and the lobby offered an English language paper on the weekend. The hotel breakfast was adequate, but we enjoyed going out to a cafe to sit outside with our coffee and pain au chocolat. The front desk staff seemed to change on a daily basis, but our check in and out and any requests were handled in an efficient manner.

My bathroom was very spacious and clean, the room had flat screen tv, a full length mirror and A/C that actually worked. All these are things most Paris hotels at this rate lack. The street is also very quiet, so I could open my windows at night and sleep. The location is great, its a simple walk to Notre Dame, The Louvre, and Le Marais. There are cute breakfast places around and you can take bus # 38 right across the street to go to St Michel or St Germain des Pres. Le Marais is gay central of Paris, so this is particularly advantageous for gay travellers, though not exclusively for them (majority of guests at the hotel when I was there were straight couples).

The down sides of the hotel- the bed was a bit soft for my liking and there was no safe in the room. Didn't have breakfast as loads of cafes and bakeries nearby. The location is ideal as you can walk to the Louvre within 10 mins or so and, if you feel fit, all the way to the Eiffel Tower (took us around 1 hour, walking slowly). The staff are helpful and let us leave our luggage after we checked out and the hotel is easy to get to from CDG airport-just use RER Line B to Chalet and then hop on Line 14 to Rambateau (1 min from hotel).
