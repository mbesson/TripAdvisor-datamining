After a long flight from Chicago, I got there just to find out that the hotel did not have any rooms available! To make a long story short, a middle man brought me to Yunus Emre hotel and I told the person at the front desk about the situation. He said he has a room with three beds and asked for $150 for one night (I told him that I want to stay there for only one night and will decide whether I want to stay longer later). I agreed since I did not know the area and did not have any other choice. The next day after a good night sleep, I went walking around looking for another hotel. I found a much better room with 3 beds (I didn't ask for 3 beds; it was just there) in another hotel about 3 minutes walking distance from Yunus Emre for $50 a night. When I was checking out of Yunus Emre I told the front desk that what he did was not fair. His response was that customers negotiate for a lower rate and we do the opposite and ask for a higher rate whenever we can. He said this goes both ways and I should not be unhappy about it! This hotel is in a good location and is clean. However, the building is old (like many other buildings in the old town) and other than the bathroom and roof terrace (that is used for serving breakfast) there hasn't been much renovations. You'll get a gigantic key and key chain to your room, the TV and heating/cooling system is old, there is a small old elevator, ... With three beds in my room there was not much space left for luggage and I had to put my luggage on one of the beds. Overall, I think you can find a better hotel for the price nearby.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cbasic, excellent value, nice people, great location, clean\u201d", "Author": "travellingsalesmen", "ReviewID": "UR122866343", "Content": "I have stayed here three times when in Istanbul - it is very basic, when I was there some of the guests were locals, I personally really liked the laid back come and go as you please atmosphere.

I didn't realise until we were there, when I told the drivers and there was a flurry of phone calls between Maria and the driver. Obviously time was running short and things were getting very tight, and I didn't have any Turksih currency left to get a taxi. Maria organised for the drivers (who should have gone back after this job) to turn around and drive us at truly terrifying pace across Istanbul to the other airport, a good hour away. She said not to worry about paying then, that I could wire the money when I got home. How's that for service, and trust? I have never witnessed such driving, and against all the odds they got us on our flight. Maria could have so easily washed her hands of us and said 'your problem' but she went out of her way to help us, and even paying for us, hoping we'd be honourable enough to settle up afterwards. My father and I are eternally grateful for her help and support - and for the terrifyingly brilliant driving we experienced!

We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of our travels and another 2 nights at the end. We had a family room with a double bed and 2 single beds. It was absolute value for money and its location couldn't be better. The hosts, Maria and Irem Bulent went out of their way to make us all feel welcome and at home. It was our first trip to Istanbul and apart from the reservations at the Yunus Emre we had very little else booked and they had arranged our pickup from the airport as well. We arrived in Istanbul on the night of the 1st after a 24 hour flight a little apprehensive about what awaited us. We need not have worried. Irem even kindly arranged for 2 bottles of water to be sent up to us from the nearby shop seeing how exhausted the kids and we were. We were shown straight to our room which was ready and super clean with plenty of hot water for all 5 of us to shower and we found the beds comfortable. The next morning we woke up and went up to the terrace to a beautiful view of the Marmara sea and the Blue mosque and a basic but hearty breakfast. We went walking around the Sultanahmet area and we were pleasantly surprised to realise how close we were to the action of Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace, Hagya Sophia etc and the exciting Ramadan bazaaar and other Sultanahmet attractions. We eventually made all our Turkey travel arrangements with their little travel agency with Maria who very kindly took into consideration that we were travelling with 3 young children. All the buses, hotels and tours she had arranged for us along the way were reasonably priced and the connections were quite seamless. The guides along our travels in Cappadoccia, Ephesus, Pamukkale and Troy were all excellent and we even had Mustafa Askin (he is the author of the book Troy and is mentioned in the Lonely Planet guide) guiding us in Troy on Beyram day. All in all the hotel was perfect for our needs and I would recommend the hotel to those looking for a clean, comfortable convenient hotel that offers value for money in the beautiful city of Istanbul! And did I add that it is also extremely close to the tram station?
