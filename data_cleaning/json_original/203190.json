When we first arrived the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room I admit could have done with some redecoration but I don't see how this affects the quality of anybody's trip. We enjoyed a view of the Vatican from the balcony and the room was comfortable and clean. For breakfast there was a great selection of food which was all very tasty. The evening meals were also very good and reasonably priced. The location of the hotel was quiet and a tad far out of town. However we never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a bus and the metro was very easy to get used to. Once you know your routes in and out of the city centre everything was pretty simple. The hotel also offers a shuttle bus if you're less adventurous with negotiating public transport.

Not only that the rooms are old and in need of restoration but they are very poorly designed (the bathroom especially, if you are using the toilet you will have your feet under the sink and the shower cabin is sooo small that you will always touch the cold walls with your back - honestly speaking someone larger wouldn't even fit in that shower cabin). The walls are so thin that you can practically hear EVERYTHING what other people were talking / doing. The door closing mechanisms (pretty unique nowadays) are really hard to use. There were no carpets on the floor (but at least they provided slippers). No tea / coffee making options (it was listed that in the Executive rooms you have that option!!??). We only got plastic glasses in the day we checked in. They were picked up with the cleaning in the next day and they were NEVER replaced and there were no other glasses available in the room. The breakfast is ok for 1-2 days but since you get the SAME food everyday (1 type of cheese, 1 type of ham, 1 type of salami = SAME type everyday) it gets very annoying. As a curiosity, even if you get some fruits for breakfast there are no vegetables at all (no mustard also even if you get hotdogs and fried bacon), The hotel is pretty far (20 mins metro + 10 mins bus waiting + 10 mins bus ride) from center of Rome and pretty hard to find. So unless you plan to leave the hotel in the morning and come back at night it's a bad choice in this aspect too. The staff was helpful and friendly, though, Overall, a bad choice in all aspects.

I poured over the past reviews and had substantial fears. My impressions were similar to many negative reviews but differed in some ways. When we got into our rooms there were hairs in the bathtub and the bathroom floor was dirty. The rest of the room was clean. We went down to the bar and ordered some food and drinks. The female at the bar seemed unhappy to be there but everyone has bad days. From there I went to the gym. The gym, not at all as envisioned on their corporate website, was completely insufficient for any kind of decent workout. But it's there. The hotel is, as some have stated, a significant distance from the centre of Rome. That can be a positive or negative depending on your needs. Unlike some others I found the staff to be courteous and helpful. Although wi-fi is widely advertised you have to pay some amount of money to use it for periods of times. The in-hotel kitchen works hours that did not jive with our tour. Ending the day at 2pm and having the kitchen not start cooking until 630pm forced my wife and I to find alternatives. There is a supermarket very nearby which we frequented over the 48hrs. Prices for food and drink in the hotel are what is to be expected, i.e. hotel markup. This markup is, in my estimation, also attributed to the lack of options coinciding with it's rural location. There is a bus service into Rome which we didn't use. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear people on all sides and above and below you moving around throughout the day and night. The decor is directly out of the 1980's and we didn't use the blankets for fear of smallpox (joke). Although we really didn't use the blankets because they seemed very ill-maintained. There was one chair on the balcony that overlooked several garbage piles on other properties. The key-system is evidence of the lack of reinvestment into the hotel. With your key you get the pleasure of carrying a cigerette-pack sized piece of metal. Satellite TV is non-existent. I'm sure that the 7th floor is quite nice, no other floor is.

The only complaint I had was its location - located in the suburbs. You had to walk out of the hotel to take a bus to an interchange and take the train from there. Alternatively an express bus near the hotel (5 to 10 mins walk) takes you directly into central Rome via Vatican City, it's around 30 minutes.

I know, I know I should have paid more attention to the reviews on here, but for some reason my sensible head was having a day off. Right, we booked to stay at the Pina Colada Palace for one night before our return from Italy via Fiumicino airport. Here is a tip for all reading this, DONT DO THE SAME! Upon first entering the hotel it takes a while for the full horror of the situation to hit you, but you soon realise what the place reminds you of. If any of you were unlucky enough to be caught up in the great Costa Del Rubbish package tour boom of the 80s you will start to get a feeling of familiarity as the surroundings of the Pint Of Vomit Palace begin to assault your senses. If I am being completley honest the lobby and bar area of the hotel that you are first met with could be very nice if some money was spent on updating the decor and facilities. It is a nice size and is quite nice to sit in to relax, just close your eyes! Now I think about it, we should have stayed in the reception area, (with our eyes closed of course), and not ventured up to \"The Room\". I write it like that because it felt like we were in an 80s horror movie. And a note to make here is, who had the idea to put a strip of carpet halfway up the walls?? We entered the room and were met with worn out furniture, which looked like it was probably never nice in the first place. The walls were a lovely shade of peach, the bedding was white and blue and thinner than my hair and the bathroom was trying to burst out from its surroundings, not dirty, (which is a pet hate of mine), but not clean, especially the shower curtain. A nice touch in the bathroom was the way you had to slide yourself underneath the oversized sink to sit on the toilet which was actually underneath the sink.....madness! The wall behind the desk (or whatever it was supposed to be) had been dented and scraped with the desk like object but not repaired. The television looked it was also trying to escape but via a different method, it was trying to fly away, perhaps being near the airport had given it ideas. The balcony was smashing, at least as far as it was outside, although I cant help thinking that it was originally a feature of the bathroom that had actually managed to escape. I wish I had taken some pictures of the room so I could relay the full horror to you but I didnt want to damage the camera. Anyway, we managed to get back in to the centre of Rome that evening for dinner and decided to have too much to drink so we wouldnt notice the room when we got home. Breakfast at the Please Release Me Palace was at least in the morning, and that's the best thing I can say about it. The juice tasted of Tarmac, the other flavour of juice was actually orange squash, the croissants were once cardboard boxes and the cooked breakfast was cooked three weeks ago last Tuesday. Oh, I forgot about the lunch that we had the previous day from the bar. Breeze blocks with some (virtually tasteless) ham and cheese in the middle, delicious! But, even though the staff are at best, unsmiling and a bit grumpy (well wouldn't you be, working there?!) at least one receptionist was fluent in three languages at least so she should have no problems understanding your complaints. Anyway, to sum up, this place is a waste of space, it needs to be demolished, it is beyond help, it is a blot on the landscape of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has no redeeming features, other than you can at least leave if you do find yourself there by mistake.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "middlesex", "Title": "\u201cFar away from everything\u201d", "Author": "HEATHROWHONEY", "ReviewID": "UR5494998", "Content": "This hotel was rated 5 star and it was too, it was too far out of rome central but the hotel was good and very clean. you could catch a courtsey bus for a small charge to centre of rome but it was a pain to have to keep on doing this rather than just walk to all amenties. the people in hotel were very professional and the cocktails were to die for, also the latte coffee was out of this world. not for teenages or small children mainly a break for couples as the walking catching busses etc too much for kids. no pool indoor or out so that was a downer but we made good of our time there and will always remeber it with love.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Katy, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price, Nice Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "KenRuth", "ReviewID": "UR5489385", "Content": "I just came back from a 7 day vacation from Rome and stayed exclusively at the Hotel Pineta Palace.

I slept perfectly and my wife is a light sleeper and she never missed one minute of her sleep. Not many negatives to report other than I got tired of eating the same breakfast every day, the eggs were more like soup. The distance to the city was a ways but the shuttle (4 euros) was well worth it and always available. The bathroom sink was a bit oversized but that's getting too picky in my opinion.

When I left the desk service called a taxi for me and I was off. Check out was easy and painless.

Yes, the room was typically small (don't believe the pics linked here at Expedia - that's a suite), but the private porch nearly doubled the usable space. The hotel really is situated smack in the middle of a purely residential neighborhood, and is surprisingly quiet for being surrounded by thousands of apartments. While it is pretty far from the center of town, it is easily reachable via a combination of the Metro A Cornelia station and the 994 bus. Save your money and buy a 3-day unlimited bus/metro pass for 11 euros instead of paying for their twice-a-day shuttle. The trick is to get your pass at the Tabbachi at the railway station in FCO airport before heading into town, and figuring out where to get off the 994 bus the very first time (hint: wait for the roadway to split around buildings near the Hotel Beethoven, and get off where the two sides rejoin. Cross the street and walk up and thru the dead end street right into the hotel lobby - 150m in all). The bed was very firm and pillows too soft, with a noticeable split between the two twin mattresses. Not enough to ruin a few nights' sleep. Breakfast was just fine, even for an American traveler who enjoys a very full plate. We had dinner there one night during a thunderstorm, and service was pretty good, with nearly all guests speaking American English. I did feel like I was \"played\" regarding whether or not tips were included (\"servizio compresa\") in the meal bill, however. If I *must* complain about something, the walls really have zero sound deadening, and the room could have reclaimed some space from the bathroom by using a smaller sink and losing the bidet. Now that we're experts at the whole Metro A <-> 994 bus thing, we would definitely stay there again, if I'm the one paying the bill. This place was an excellent find for 100-150 euros per night less than other places closer to the center of town. Oh, and for the person who spent 55 euros for 2 calls to Brazil, you should have bought a phone card (thanks Let's Go Rome!)

The restaurant is excellent and the service was very good. It is actually quite large inside, but we chose to sit under the outside awning. The food was reasonably priced too. You can't go wrong here. I am not one to rip a place apart and I feel like I see the good in most hotels and so I just gave credit where it was due. Our room was clean and comfortable and I didn't have a issue with the stool being too close to the sink like others have in these reviews. Some people plainly have nothing nice to say about a place and everything has to be kept in perspective here. But now for the unpleasant part......The room noise at night was purely unbearable. We could hear the guy next door coughing like he was standing in the room. People roamed up and down the halls on their cell phones at all hours of the night talking in their normal voices that sounded like they were right by the bed. As many have written before.....the walls are paper, paper, paper thin. If you are a light sleeper, you will be a non sleeper. My sister sat up in the lobby all night because of the noise coming from everywhere. People kept moving furniture across the tile floors above us at ridiculous hours of the night. The experience was horrible. This would have been a fine hotel if it weren't for the inabilty to sleep. That is why you stay in a motel, because you are dog tired from running around all day and you need sleep to re-energize for the next day. Unless you are in a coma, you will not sleep in this hotel. Period.

We once walked to the little pizza restaurant roughly a quarter mile away, which was the only eatery within walking distance. The hotel had an OK restaurant though. The view was of the old apartment buildings nearby and the entire surroundings were generally distasteful. The typical European breakfast fare was not liked by the others in my family, but I liked it. Thankfully we purchased Expedia's cancellation coverage.

If it hadn't been for our tour guide's prodding, the front desk staff would not have even called us a taxi to the police station to report the theft (that's another pathetic story).

My husband observed that, if gypsies are that prevalent in the hotel, perhaps we should not leave our luggage outside of our room doors for pickup as COSMOS told us to do.

Although Italian hotels are generally less comfortable than other hotels with the same star rating in Europe, Pineta Palace does definitely not stand for \"luxury\". The location is ok, although it is VERY hard to find when going there the first time and not taking a taxi. So make sure you have some detailed travel information with you. There are some bus stops close to the hotel, most busses have service until midnight. Nevertheless you can also walk from metro station \"Battistini\" (served by night bus) and you will reach the hotel within 15 minutes. But still, with bus and metro, you will need 30 - 40 minutes to reach Termini station. Nevertheless, the surrounding area of the hotel is quite nice, a bit hilly and a beautiful view to the Vatican city. There is a big street very close to the hotel, but you don`t really recognize any noise. The rooms were fine, considering that we paid around 70 euro a night. The most annoying thing to me was that they did not have adaptors for my standard european plug. I couldn\u00b4t charge my mobile. For any Italian, this would have meant a severe catastrophe, if you know what I mean;-) The bed was comfortable and the room was big enough for 2 persons. I did not hear any noises from other rooms or from the floor. The bathroom was ok, although it looked as it had not been renovated within the last 15 years. The breakfast was a very funny experience, as you could see Italian \"hospitality\" at its best. The staff did not speak English and the staff were very slow. Although it is a breakfast buffett, they did not manage to clean up tables and to provide new cups and glasses. The food was standard, forutantely not an Italian but a real breakfast. So it was definitely not the most delightful stay I had in Italy, but in comparison to other Rome hotels (especially the overpriced shabby ones in the Termini area), Pineta Palace was a bargain.

Do not go on the tour to Hadrian's Villa!!! My wife and I started by leaving our hotel to go to the tour company's main bus station. At that point our hotel had reserved us a spot, so I was paying the bill with a credit card and my wife used the restroom. I saw that my shoe was untied and put it on a row of seats inside the tour company's office. The row of seats were so rittled with cigarette burns I had no problem putting my foot on them to tie my shoe, then all of a sudden, a Dutch speaking woman went crazy in her foreign language I'm guessing that I was crude for putting my foot on a cigarette burned chair??? to tie my shoe. She was from the Hilton and quite a bit snobby from what I saw. Then we get on the bus and go to Hadrian's villa where we almost run uphill all the way for ten minutes, and look at a few sites, then I stop at a restroom and our tour and tourguide were gone. We went downhill and found nobody there. Our bus was gone far before we thought any tour here would have been over. We looked at all the buses in the lot and were told that our bus was at a bar/cafe and then I realized they Left Us Behind. If anyone over 50 yrs. old doesn't have a myocardial infarction on this tour I would be very surprised and happy. It cost 70 euro for a taxi to St. Peters, and 10 Euro to our hotel from there.

It is NOT convenient to any public transportation no matter what you are told. If you take the subway, which is suggested, it is VERY difficult to find a connecting bus to the Pineta area. If you actually do find the bus (congratulations!), it will drop you off on a highway and I can only suggest you find the nearby hospital (back down the highway and off the road)for directions to the Pineta. Nothing is marked. Of course, our first attempt was at night which added to the problem, but we have pretty good savvy with such things. Maybe a better option would be to take the bus all the way. Also, the early hotel risers can be easily heard thru the walls. On the plus side, one of the desk clerks who was willing to help us suggested a nearby restaurant to walk to...and the meal was quite good for the price. I think it was probably the only nearby restaurant. I would recommend trying a find a different hotel if you are going to be dependant on public transportation. And if you are on a Cosmos type tour and like to have some independance, good luck. A taxi from the Termini cost us 28Euros including tip.

On an average we waited around 15-20 mins. I suggest you buy a day metro/bus pass as you will need it just to get to and from the hotel.

We never ate at the hotel restuarants, but I believe they are expensive. The rooms were clean and well maintained, but apart from CNN there is no other English channel on the television.

There was a low cost bus available into town but it had very limited space and filled up quickly. The bus only ran during the day so a taxi was needed every night. The hotel was very remote and situated in a residential area-not at all practical for Rome sightseeing, and without sufficient reasonable quality amenities to make it a viable option to stay at the hotel to relax.
