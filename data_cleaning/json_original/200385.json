The main drawback is the distance from the center of Berlin. If you need to do business in Berlin, this is not the hotel for you. If you want a nice quiet hotel with a lot of green and a beautiful lake out the door, this would be a good choice. if time were not a problem, then a 45 minute bus ride to the city to do some sightseeing is not so bad. The food in the restaurant was very good, but the wait staff seems a bit under-trained. There were many waiters/waitresses, but it took quite a while to place an order, for drinks to come, and to pay the bill. Other than that, the food was very good.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cGood for conferences or a get-away\u201d", "Author": "gahoppe", "ReviewID": "UR84998402", "Content": "We stayed here for two weeks, conducting several business conferences during this time. The location is great for meetings up to 250 people. The setting is ideal if you want to get away, or have meetings without distractions. The restaurant and meeting room staffs are very friendly and helpful, the sleeping rooms are clean and most rooms have a balcony. It was easy to stay here for several weeks because there are plenty of hiking trails and you can rent bicycles and Segways at the front desk. On the negative side, the front desk staff is needs a LOT of training in customer service. They are generally unhelpful and rude. They love saying, \"That is not possible\" any time we needed something. The spa is nice but the exercise facilities are a joke. The restaurant food was OK but rather bland and starchy. We will definitely go back to this hotel for business meetings but I hope they train the front desk staff to smile and say \"Yes,\" and invest a few euros into some new equipment for the fitness center.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "AussieLotti", "ReviewID": "UR54980496", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Muggelsee last weekend and we had a fantastic time. The staff, in particular Anja on reception were wonderful and always going out of their way to help us with directions, taxis etc. Our language barrier was no problem and the hotel itself was beautiful. One warning I will give you - The spa is naked only.... something that certainly shocked us after a cold snowy day in Berlin and you are looking forward to a spa and sauna.... The hotel is a little out of the way.... but it was worth it for us as we had such a great time and thought it was great value.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dudley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFrom old Hanoi to East Berlin - Purebob involved again !\u201d", "Author": "Ormstein", "ReviewID": "UR16748363", "Content": "Stayed at the Mueggelsee hotel for a conference. Firstly - know that this hotel is in East Berlin as was - and it is an hour's schlep in a taxi from the airport to get here. It is no mean feat to go to the town centre to dine, for example, so you are pretty much stranded here. Hotel is set in lush forest at the edge of Lake Mueggel. Almost all rooms seemed to have great views. Check in and pubic areas all very impressive in this hotel - spacious, interesting and well kept. Bar quite intimate a fun, although the service from very young and indolent waitresses bordered on unacceptable. My room was very spacious and comfortable with a patio area overlooking the forest. Very nice indeed. Bed a bit soft and pillows VERY soft, but perhaps that is the personal preference of other folks. The conference food was quite decent. Best of all was the bowling alley in the basement ! Much fun was had here during the conference evenings ! I did not try the swimming pool or gym. It was a fine conference hotel, and I can imagine it is a peaceful retreat for folks wanting a quit civilised break by the lake too. Just don't expect to be close enough to Berlin to spend much time there from thid hotel.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hedge End, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and efficient\u201d", "Author": "SLKmaniac", "ReviewID": "UR8863750", "Content": "First appearances can be deceptive and in this a perfect example. It's as it it's been built to look as unattractive as possible (it was built back in the days of East Germany) however once you're inside things take quite a different turn. The staff were all very friendly and exceptionally helpful providing excellent service constantly throughout our stay. Whilst not the most modern hotel it is very clean and probably a good average in terms of decor and general appearance. The bedrooms were fairly spacious, clean, and quiet. We were there for some corporate education and we were given everything we needed quickly and efficiently, and the conferencing facilities overall were bright, modern, and spacious. This hotel is in a great location so would make a good base for a long weekend stay. It's just a shame the building looks more like a 60's office building rather than a comfortable hotel - just remember to keep you eyes shut as you arrive until you're well inside the building.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Basshound", "ReviewID": "UR6152019", "Content": "We stayed for four nights at this excellent hotel and were very impressed by the standard of accommodation.
