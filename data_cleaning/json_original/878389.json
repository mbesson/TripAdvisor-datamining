{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No complaints here No complaints on this one. Not a place for someone who cant sleep in traffic sounds, but you get the excellent central location for reasonable price on the other side. Free inroom internet connection is also a plus. You have to look around for a reasonable price for Walden but we did get a room for abt 90 USD a night which is a good value for Hongkong. Yes, rooms are not spacious, but check some of the Hong Kong hostels first and then talk about tiny rooms. Views from the windows are awful, but you can hardly look for a hotel in this location if you are looking for views.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR364983522", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ManaPet"}, {"Content": "Not that bad considering...

The deluxe rooms were simply tiny rooms located on higher floors. For 300 USD a night, we had a room, that with an extra bed had little room to walk. The view from this expensive room was junky. We were shocked at what we had reserved and decided to pack-up and leave and head to the airport two days early. The desk staff had little to say, other than contact booking agent and tell them. The standard rate was not available. Their solution was to give us three rooms and waive the extra cot fee. This solution would cost of 800 USD a night for two rooms, instead of 600 USD. They were unwilling to accomodate us in any way. Although this is a clean, tidy little room in a convenient location, the prices are way overblown. I say, run for your life and don't let the websiter fool you.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR885231362", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "magnoliamom"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u3123\u505d\u9289\u5e9b\u512b\u9289\u7b3a\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137       \u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\u5b28\u501d\u9287\u88e4\u4ee7\u68f0\u3126\u6ad9", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR749420327", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "applepie747"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d878389-r23274851-Walden_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "878389", "Price": "$131"}}
