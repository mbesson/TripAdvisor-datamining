The room was what you would expect from almost anywhere in Paris. It's small. But that's the charm of Paris. Most residences are small and narrow, but this was completely acceptable and not too small. For people not used to Paris, be warned - there are most expensive places, a lot smaller than this. Before I go off on one about how awesome this place was, I'll list a couple of negatives - 1) No internet. But there's a Quick Burger near Bastille with free wi-fi, and numerous other coffee places that will offer it too. 2) Not much of a view - but then again, if you want somewhere to sleep, then there's no problem. 3) No hair drier or iron (although there MIGHT have been some at reception, I never asked - you might want to check that out). But on the plus side, you have a very nice, comfortable, clean (VERY clean), warm room with cable TV, cooker, microwave, decent sized fridge. The shower is possibly the greatest thing I've experienced at a hotel of this price. It was hot and powerful, and perfect after a long day of walking the city. MOST importantly, this residence offered the MOST polite and genuinely friendly service I have ever experienced in Paris. All the staff (we encountered 4 different staff during our stay), were unbelievably helpful. They all spoke fluent English and went out of their way to accommodate us. They even let us check in 2 hours early. If you want to stay somewhere comfortable, and don't mind spending about 20Euros more than what a standard 2* would cost you, then I would HIGHLY recommend staying at Le 300.

The boulangerie at the opposite end of rue Moreau to the arches opens at 7am has excellent croissants etc and looks very dull from the outsite but the inside is stunning with tiled ceiling mirrors and chandeliers.

This hotel is acceptable but based on the previous reviews, my expectations were raised and my experience somewhat disappointing. The hotel is located on a quiet street and a 5-10 minutes walk from Gare de Lyon and Bastille. Lots of conveniences in the area including bakeries, laundry facilities and internet cafe. My drawbacks were as follows: - The front desk staff is friendly but when there is only one person covering the front desk, the Guest waiting time needs to be managed properly. In several instances, I had to wait a few minutes to get my room key because the front desk lady was bending backward with the Guest ahead of me about tips in Paris and in the area. Somewhat frustrating. - The internet connection costs 15 euros per week but did not work from my room. The front desk person gave me another cable and it still did not work. She apologized profusely and reversed the charge. The evening front desk person told me they could have contacted the internet provider who would have done a remote reset. Too late now as it was after 6 PM and closed over the week-end. I found this somewhat upsetting. Luckily I was able to get to an internet cafe. - The room was cleaned twice a week. For some reason, mine was the last one to be cleaned and the maid came at a time I was ironing some clothes. I offered her to start while I was finishing but she said she preferred returning the day after in the morning. Although I had managed to leave early on that Sunday morning, she ended up showing early in the afternoon as I needed to use the room again. We managed to do our things without interfering and the room was cleaned to my satisfaction. - The toilet seat had a crack. I did not notice it at first and found it the hard way!

Residence Le 300 is a 5 minute (10 if you're really slow) walk away from Bastille and in the middle of a quite interesting residential area. Walk south to Place d'Aligre for a non-tourist residential area with local bars and restaurants, east to Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoinne / Rue de Lappe for bustling nightlife, west to Marais for, erm, more bustling nightlife or north to Bastille for local landmarks.

Odd that they don't provide the things you need to avoid that... Other than that, I felt that the residence had two minor downsides: it is no hotel, so don't expect room service - I didn't have one throughout my 5-day stay and I felt that at least every 2-3 days someone should have looked after the room, restocked toiletteries etc. Also, the house is a bit clairaudient and I woke up in the morning by the noise of slamming doors (the room doors are very heavy and loud!). Maybe someone should do something to make them a bit less noisy? Nevertheless, I felt that I got great value for money. A brand new apartment with a kitchenette in central location for prices for which you would usually only get a shabby 2* etablisement (and I have heard these can be pretty awful in Paris!).
