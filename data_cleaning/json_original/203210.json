OK, we were a party of 21 in Italy for rugby in February and it snowed, but I thought the whole place was jaded and un-loved. The escalator was so slow it was quicker to amble upstairs and the breakfasts were a curious mixture of terrible machine brewed coffee and hard-boiled eggs. The bread was fresh on the Saturday but that's the best i can say. Inexplicably for a rugby tourist group they were always reluctant to open the bar, but they caved in on the Saturday and Sunday nights. Our room had a fabulous view of the office building next door and althought the sheets and towels were clean the bathroom left a lot to be desired in terms of a showering experience.

As others have said, the lift is very slow, the receptionists generally grumpy, shower outlet wobbly, etc etc, but nothing to say don't go. Breakfast was limited in range (basic ham, cheese, boiled eggs, some jams and pre-packed pastries) but always plentiful, and coffee from machine wouldn't qualify a barista, but adequate. Water in shower, from my experience, was consistent in flow and its temperature - although it didn't need cold water in the mix, it was certainly hot enough. (Others in the party, later risers, did say the temp dropped.) We had three in our room: two singles and a fold-out and my bed was absolutely fine, though my friend found his hard. The bedding was clean and well-pressed. The room ceilings are high and the decoration is a bit (a lot!) tired. I had no complaints about the cleanliness of the place. The weather was freezing with a lot of snow and sleet, but our room was warm enough. (One friend in the fold-out in another room was cold at night and got some extra blankets. TV limited channels - about 5 mostly italian with one BBC World news. It's not very near any of the major sights (apart from opera house) but is local to the main railway station and the metro.

One tip - on most occasions a guided tour is not needed however in the roman forum well worth the money as there are little to no signs explaining the sites, so you end up walking around looking at rocks.... Also make sure you visit san giovanni in laterano, the pope's first church.. overlooked by most and looks closed from the outside, but this is a stunning church. If i returned to rome i would return to this hotel as it was a great deal - \u00a3150 for 4 nites for two people, excellent value and a good overall base. The one negative the breakfast is as bad as they say...saying that i don't like breakie, and there is many cheap, good places near by to get a proper coffee and a danish.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cnot too bad\u201d", "Author": "staybeautiful123", "ReviewID": "UR93973386", "Content": "I stayed here for one night as part of a school group.

The hotel breakfast is very minimal (bread, boiled eggs, ham and cheese or some cheap cornflakes -thats all!). I asked the receptionist on Sunday morning about local markets to which he simply said 'you have missed them' he did not attempt to try and help suggest something else! he then turned away and did not engage any further. Also, on another day when asking the receptionist if he could confirm that the cinema that was 10 min walk away from the hotel showed films in English he said he did not know and that was it. We asked if he would mind phoning the cinema for us as it was raining, he huffed! but eventually did try (FYI: the cinema that does show films in English is a few mins walk from the Flaminio station).

It is VERY close to Termini station which is great if you are arriving or departing by train. Could not here noise from train station. On a cute street, but I find Rome quite charming. Hotel booked for us by another family member and was QUITE nervous about staying here due to the reviews I have read on Tripadvisor. So, I was prepared for the worst, and it ended up not being so bad. When we first arrived there were 2 creepy front desk men so I was a little concerned and happy that I had a room with my husband. We had a triple room the first night and it was quite big. Had seen pictures of mould on TA and you could definitely see it in the bathroom (at least where it had been on the ceiling, they did try to cover it up). Sheets were clean so was able to get some sleep!!! Switched into Mother-in-Laws room next night, as the men went to southern Italy for a night and we stayed to sight see in Rome. Room was okay but shower curtain was mouldy and remnants of scraped mould in bathroom. Also, mother-in-law lost her wallet, either got stolen on the subway, or she left it on her bed and cleaning staff stole it. Not sure, but just BEWARE of stolen things from your room in this hotel. Next night husband and I had our own room. It was beautiful. All new bathroom, marble floors etc, clean, no mould anywhere, If I had stayed in this room the whole time I would have said the reviews of this place were all wrong, but they aren't. Husband and I wanted to go for some drinks and asked the new front desk man where a good place was. He was very kind and full of great ideas. told us which bus to take and drew the walking route out on a map. Also gave us a book of maps of Rome that we were supposed to get but hadn't. Gave us a few different options of where to go. So nice. Got home late and front was locked. When he answered he was very happy we were back safe. So, I think next time I go to Rome, I will definitely book somewhere else due to the first two rooms, however if I had to stay there again, I wouldn't be overjoyed, but I would be okay. Also, the next morning a girl who was staying at the hotel was yelling at the front desk man (the one from the first night) about how her stuff had been rummaged through and stuff was stolen and saying that this was supposed to be a 3 star hotel and expected 3 star service. Basically, don't fret, just put your money in the safe and be smart about it. I imagine stuff goes missing all the time in Rome. Oh yeah, breakfasts were terrible.

The day before we travelled I decided that I would have a quick look at the reviews, BIG MISTAKE. I slept very little due to worrying about what I was going to find after reading these horrific reviews, complaining about filth to items being stolen. We landed in Rome very early, way before check in time. However we thought we would try our luck and go and find the hotel to see if the room would be ready early. We found the hotel and it is in very easy to find location, about a 10 minute walk (if that) from the Termanii (Station). From the outside it looks ok, we went in and asked if there was any chance our rooms were ready? The man behind the desk was slightly blunt and came across slightly rude. However I do think this was a language barrier as he was just very short and to the point. One of our rooms was ready and we were shown to the room via a very small, old lift. The floor of the lift did feel like it was going to fall through, however you can use the stairs but this didn\u2019t stop us using the lift during our stay. This was the moment I was dreading, as soon as we walked into our bedroom I just couldn\u2019t understand what all the fuss had been about. We stayed in rooms 210 and 212 on the second floor, for 2 nights. The rooms were an ample size, not at all small as some people had written. I checked the bed sheets, all beautifully clean, I checked the bathroom, shower, toilet, towels all wonderfully CLEAN!!! Even the towels smelt fresh and soft. I\u2019m a cleanaholic and if there is a slight bit of dirt I will spot it a mile off and both our rooms were far from unclean. Granted the decor is a little tired and not to my taste, but its clean. And the view from our window was not the best, but I wasn\u2019t in Rome to be starring out my hotel window. The only problem we had with the room was our shower, even though it was very powerful and hot, the shower tray drained very slowly and you would end up in ankle depth water and the shower head would sometimes fall. They had some strange hand towels in the bathroom that were more like a small sheet than a towel but the bath towels were fine. The bedroom and the bathroom had tiled floor which is easily kept clean, with carpets you never know what\u2019s living in them. The pillows could have been better, but for 2 nights they were fine. In the morning we went down to breakfast and again was pleasantly surprised. Previous people had described the breakfast room as \u2018the dungeon\u2019. It was small but not ridiculsley small, but again it was clean and light ( not dark and dingy like a dungeon). Breakfasts consists of rolls, bread, cereal, croissants(pre packed), boiled eggs, crackers, jams, ham and cheeses. All very lovely. The only downfall at breakfast time was the coffee. I\u2019m used to coffee out of machines, I use these all the time in work, but this coffee was disgusting! It was barely warm and tasted awful, however my parents thought I was over reacting to the coffee as they drank theirs, so it shows how we all like something different. However i do think this must be the way in Rome, i tried several times to get a coffee when out and about and they were all the same. Not once during my stay did I find any uncleanness or mould. The staff could have been a little happier and the reception staff did come across slightly rude but I do feel this was a language barrier. The decor is tired and not to many people\u2019s taste, however you are there to see Rome not the inside of your hotel. It is in an ideal location.

We stayed four nights and I would stay there again and recommend it to my friends. 4 and 5 star hotels were in the same area. The breakfast room was pleasant and clean. Food was good.

The milk in the capuccino machine in the brakfast area was sour. They locked us out of our hotel room one night after the cleaning staff came through - after a hard day of touring Rome and them having to walk up 3 flight of stairs - this was inconvienience for them and they acted as if it was our fault until we finally got the poor nice porter to come help us and he finally got us in with apoligies that housekeeping locked us out. Our last night, the desk clerk advised us we should call a cab to the airport because there was goinng to be a transportation strike the next day. He knew just the guy and would make arrangements for us. The next morning that guy never showed up. But while waiting for him, the hotel consierge insisted on charging us double for our stay - even though we already paid in full and despite our confirmation of having done so. He even refused to call the Free 800# given to me by our travel agent and refused to conceed that it could be their mistake. It took me months to sort out this transaction. At that time, I swallowed my pride and I paid twice because we needed out of there. Funny that despite the general strike we were warned about the morning of - the trains were running on schedule.

The next week when we found ourselves in Rome again, without hotel reservations, we stayed there again. They offered us a decent rate, and accommodated the large group once again. One thing I found odd was that they noticed an extra person in our group of 9 (a friend who was not staying the night, but just visiting with us). THey required that he leave his ID with them at the front desk until he left (\"just in case there were any problems\"). Then after his train was delayed and he had been there for a couple of hours, they called to make sure he wasn't spending the night. No slipping anything past them!
