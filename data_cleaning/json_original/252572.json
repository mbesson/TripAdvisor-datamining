The staff was so friendly and the property was clean and well kept at all times. All of the highrise units face both the parking lot and the wetland/pool area. There was some noise from the roller coaster at Old Town but nothing that bothered us too much or kept us or our daughter awake. The property is gated and a code in needed to get into the grounds at night, it is right next to Old Town which was amusing to stroll through one afternoon but definitely not an attraction in my mind! The pool area was lovely thought the water in the kiddie pool was freezing cold so we stayed in the bigger pool for the week. They even had pool toys on site for the guests to use. My only negative was that I had called ahead and asked to reserve a pack-n-play for our daughter to sleep in but they said it was first come first serve but they had 5 so probably not going to be a problem, well we were the 6th family to need one when we checked in so unfortunately we had to go and buy one.

The resort is tucked off behind US 192 near Old Town. Even though we could hear the sounds from Old Town, this would not deter me recommending this resort. Old Town can run until 10-11 PM and we could hear it, but it wasn't as loud to us as stated in some of the other reviews. The bathroom fan could be run to offer white noise. I suggest taking a stroll over and browsing that area. It is run down a little but has great nostaglic stores to window shop and browse through. We went for ice cream and was not dissappointed! We arrived around 7 PM on a Tuesday night and check-in was a breeze! The girl at check in was accomedating and changed our original reservation that had us booked on the 2nd floor, but we requested to change rooms to the 6th floor and not near anyone else. The unit was clean, spacious and looked brand new. There is plenty of storage/closet space throughout the unit (there is even a pantry in the kitchen). The ceilings are high and the A/C worked perfectly. The kitchen was stocked with everyting we needed for our week stay. There is a Publix grocery store within a 5 minutes to the resort, so I suggest checking in first and come up with a grocery list. The resort will charge for housekeeping if you request it, but to be honest, I don't mind not having a daily maid service. We had plenty of towels for our family to last the week and did a load of laundry during our stay. My only negative is the pull out sofa bed is not super comfortable, so those of you with sensitive backs should sleep in the bedroom. Overall, if you are looking for a resort that is not busy and to simply relax after a day at the Disney parks, this is resort you will want to stay in. We went to the parks first thing in the AM, came back around lunch time, went for a swim, read a book around the pool, ate lunch, took a nap and then headed back to the parks at night. The resort does have recreational courts (volleyball, shuffleboard and basketball) but we did not use them. My family was looking for a place to unwind and to get away from all the crowds. After doing extensive research online for months, this was the best resort for our price range ($50-$100 per night). If you want a 5 star hotel then book it! If you just want a place that offers a full kitchen but is not busy then you should stay here.

We are frequent travelers to the Orlando/Kissimmee area and found Barefoot'n to be simply average when compared to places we have stayed in the past. The resort is very small, however welcoming and somewhat comfortable while still maintaining it's \"Keys\" atmosphere. Our unit was directly beside the reception area and 10 seconds from the pool which was incredibly convenient. Our unit was equipped with all of the necessities for our stay and if we needed something all we had to do was ask at reception. We weren't overwhelmed with this resort however it's location is ideal; just off the 192 and walking distance to Old Town, although we find Old Town to be run down and don't go there often. Since we were in the bungalow style units I can not comment on the high rise units however they are new and seem nicer and more upgraded than the bungalows. The major problem I had with the resort is that the exit gate was broken (completely removed) when we arrived and it was not repaired by the time we left 7 days later, which detracted from the \"secure\" feeling of the resort. The bungalow units could definitely use an upgrade and some new kitchen appliances. I was not impressed that the resort charged $7.99/day for wifi access when almost every other hotel along the 192 offered this service for free. Although the lack of wifi access was not a major issue for us, it is one of those small conveniences that is appreciated by most travelers (simply went to Starbucks for a coffee and wifi access to check in for our flights). I would say Barefoot'n is a fairly comfortable resort and would recommend it for travelers on a budget but would not recommend this resort for those looking for anything more than average or looking for anything more than a 2.5 star rating. There are some activities posted in the reception area however the resort is very limited in activities for children, etc. I can best describe Barefoot'n in the Keys at Old Town as adequate and average and with so many choices in the Orlando/Kissimmee area I would choose to say elsewhere for my next vacation to the area.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northwest", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Condo\u201d", "Author": "fabioNorthewest", "ReviewID": "UR115433379", "Content": "We loved our stay.

It will take you 1202 Vine - a nonexistent address in bad part of downtown Kissimmee and the phone # does not work. We finally called to ask directions. It was difficult to get a real human to talk to. Wasted 2 hours in heavy traffic to find it. Even with address it is hard to find at night. Small unlite sign is visible from only one direction. Security gate would not open, a line of cars was forming, and someone in next car punched in code so we could get in and register. Told clerk of problems-- his excuse, if he wasn't in office or on another phone call was transferred to who knows where. This problem with gate was never corrected and maintaince had to let us out the entry gate. However the pedestrian gate is unlocked 24/7 so anyone can walk in. So much for security. The grounds are pretty and peaceful, yet trash is all over. I picked up some but there was not a trash container to be found. the staff is either very young and or barely speaks English.

This would be our new hotel to stay at in Orlando if it was in a different location. Unfortunately, we didn't take seriously the warning about noise from the other reviews. If you stay in the tower section, the noise from Old Towne is really bad, esp. on the weekends. Then every morning at 5am a housekeeping cart rattled very loudly past our first floor unit and woke me up then. Napping during the day was out because I could easily hear any people talking outside our unit. Little sleep makes for a grumpy Mom at the amusement parks. Noise and smells from other units could easily be lessened if the connecting and outside doors were well insulated. There was about a 1/4\" gap under our door to the outside, which would easily allow noise and bugs into the unit. Thankfully we saw no bugs. We asked to change our unit, but the property was booked solid. Also, there are some hotels in the area that look like they might be temporary housing for some families down on their luck. We never really felt unsafe though. Bad location, but awesome staff and cleanliness.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Falls Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience, clean with friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Travellor2011-02", "ReviewID": "UR97515176", "Content": "I just returned from this resort with my spouse and two other family members. the rooms were spotless, we loved the layout of the two bedroom unit.

(Continental breakfast from 8h15 to 9h30, so you will probably miss it if you want to go to Disney parks early). On some days you will find cookies in the lobby in the afternoon. The pool is great and there is a smaller pool with fountains for the kids. We also had some unfortunate encountered... We found a couple of silverfish... Eurk... But I guess it is hard to avoid in that region when you are on the first floor. I just hope that they will find a way to get rid of those. The \u201cOld Town Carnival\u201d is just in front of the Barefoot so it is nice to take a walk there at night. Take the time to go to the \u201cMagic Store\u201d, you can buy all kind of magic stuff and the guy will show you some amazing demonstration. All over I would give this resort a 5/10 and I would probably try something else next time I am in Kissimmee.

We booked this condo thru RCI. The price was good, but it was an example of 'you get what you pay for.' We had the 1BR condo with full kitchen and pull-out couch for our family of 4. First the good points: It was very close to the south entry gate of Disney (within 5 minutes). The condo complex was cute from the outside and had a security gate. The heated pool and hot tub were clean and nicely maintained. There was a children's pool with sprayers (not heated) too and sand volleyball court. The staff was very nice too and our kids loved the baked cookies in the afternoon. On the downside: The condo was cramped compared with others we've stayed in, with little storage space for luggage and all the accumulated Disney junk. We were also on the ground level and could hear every step from the guest upstairs (footsteps woke us most mornings). The hot water tended to run out after 2 or 3 showers in the morning (particularly if the family upstairs was also showering). The decor was uninspired, the bedding like a cheap motel's, and the overall cleanliness questionable. The bathroom, in particular seemed a bit dirty and I found the exposed toilet brush and plunger (next to the toilet) gross. While the proximity to Disney was awesome, I would say the Old Town area is a little seedy -- kind of like a carnival. The motels nearby also looked a little creepy. Overall: I'd recommend that any visitors who simply want a decent and affordable place to crash while visiting The Mouse, may want to try this property for the affordability, nice pool and kind staff. But, I'd recommend staying in a second floor unit (with kitchenette) to ease the noise issues (plus the bathrooms upstairs were much nicer!).", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island, new york", "Title": "\u201cnever again!!!\u201d", "Author": "sonnee", "ReviewID": "UR22739258", "Content": "we booked this stay through our vacation plan. it was represented as a 4/5 star resort. our reservation confirmation stated \"full kitchen\". when i confirmed it 24hrs in advance(as instructed), i was told it's a \"partial kitchen\". it consisted of a mini-fridge, which didn't freeze, two shelves that could't hold anything more than a saucer -high dish, bottom space for one bottle. a 1 or 2 cup coffeemaker(which was replaced) & a mini-microwave. the bathroom sink leaked all over the floor, it was reported on sunday am, we were told it couldn't be fixed till tuesday & were given extra towels to absorb the water. the heating/air conditioner didn't work, or the thermostat or both. the table had two chairs, but not enough room to fit two plates if you planned on cooking in the microwave. the front gate also advertised \"nightly rentals\". there was also a daily charge for internet service in the office. this was not a place we would have stayed at for the price when motels all around us offered the same amenities for 1/4 the price & no charge for internet service in the room. on the positive side, the staff was very friendly & helpful with some of the issues.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "mfitm", "ReviewID": "UR14363823", "Content": "It was in a great location, very close to Disney World.

We were there Sat. - Sat. and 4 towels and rags were not enough so I had to do the laundry a few times. They only give enough detergent for one load. You can purchase more if needed.

Great place to go if you want something in the middle of everything but still feels secluded (was a gated resort, locked). The pool/hot tub area was amazing....warm water. Was never crowded. We were out pretty much all day, and the pool officialy closed at 10...but they as long as we were quiet, they let us swim until 12am. Everyone was super nice and put out amazing cookies, fresh baked, every day around coffee time. Was in walking distance to a really fun mini-golf place and of course, Old Town, which stays busy until almost 2 am(don't worry about the noise, we couldn't hear any!)....we aren't the bar crowd, but still enjoyed walking around there every night, fun shops, fun rides, and a great old car parade on sat. night (i think they have one friday nights too, but we didn't make it). Really close to all the attractions and everything was easy to find. There are washer and dryer units in your unit which is great to throw your wet suits/towels in. Be aware, they offer maid service (new towels, sheets, and cleaning) but for $50 for each time....and they gave us 2 rolls of toilet paper and if you need more, they are $1 a roll. Our suggestion is to bring wipes with you or to go to the Publix groc store across and street to buy some. The only other problem, was that there were 4 of us staying in the 1 brdroom unit, so two had to sleep on the pull out sofa, which was comfortable. But they only supplied a sheet and one light blanket...I know it's FL, and warm, but I would suggest bringing a top blanket...we asked for one and they brought one up to us right away. Our pillows were also pretty pathetic...so would suggest asking for more or bringing your own.
