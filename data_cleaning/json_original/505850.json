Access to the train is simply a matter of walking out the door of the hotel. It's about 10 minutes by train to Shinjuku. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. Very 'locals-only' feeling...In a good way. My room (a 'single') was eensy-weensy, teeny-tiny. Just wide enough to accomodate the bed, desk, and a tiny space to walk in, and just long enough to accomodate them plus a bathroom. Bathroom is perfect and spotless, and kept that way. Furnishings look just a little bit tired, but clean. Bathrobe, slippers, and a little origami swan on your bed. For around $80 US, I (a single guy, first time to Tokyo) couldn't complain.The staff is very friendly and helpful. Enough English is spoken to not be a problem for non-Japanese speakers. The lobby is tasteful, quiet, and clean, and the restaurant is the same, with a good buffet breakfast that accomodates Japanese and Western tastes. Two coin-op computer terminals in the lobby to check your email (10 minutes for 100 yen).Train noise is (miraculously, considering the proximity) virtually inaudible with your windows shut. They've done well there...Then again, I was on the 6th floor.For a city as expensive as Tokyo (and I'm from LA!), this hotel is a real value.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR457527887", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d505850-r17707415-APA_Hotel_Tokyo_Itabashi-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505850", "Price": "$161"}}
