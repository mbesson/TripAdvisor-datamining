Other personnel, didn't see anyone expect 1 time during breakfast. First time in Turkey I didn't give any tips. Big column in the middle of the room. Last morning I saw a cockroach, creepy. Bathroom not clean, lamp above sink had dust from about over a year thick. After a two minute shower drain will overflow. Second day no hot water. Only showered once. Travel was with Corendon. They tell you what hotel you will be in during busstransfer. Now I know why. I'm learning Turkish, liked Istanbul very much. Hospitality of the Turks is great, but this hotel should be stripped and build up again. Kahvalt\u00c4\u00b1 (breakfast) was not good. Not much, bread (sliced at 7.00 if you're there after 9.00 its gets very tough. Oherwise cucumber, tomatoes, olives, white cheese. Cups (margarine, cheryjam, honey. Black tea. Mock orange juice (taste like diluted kidsdrink). Cold water tasted like the plastic can it was in. In summary location is perfect. Like Sultanahmet neighbourhood, but the hotel was bad. I itend to visit Istanbul again, but not with Corendon anymore.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cA perfect hotel for a big city\u201d", "Author": "Anton_Spitsyn", "ReviewID": "UR117264095", "Content": "If to talk about Sublight hotel, where I have stayed in August 2010, I can say that this hotel is right what's required if you plan to Stay in Istanbul for a business trip or as a toursit. It is situtedin Sultanahmet, the area with all the main symbols of the city - Topkapi palace, Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque and so on, but at the same time it is on a quite street, so the noise of nightlife won't interfere in your sleeping. The room I lived in (Don't know about the other ones) is rather small, and had no balcony, Just bed, TV, writting table with chair and mirror. There has also been a shower with toilet, again small. Although you really do feel at ease in this size of room, and it is not a problem, if you spend most of time in the city. And now about the food. The Hotel is BB, so there is the only breakfast you get. There is no great variety of food, but nevertheless, yu can find what you want and there is always a free table. So, to sum it all up, if you are not planning to stay in the hotel all the day round, Sunlight is a pace for you.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cBad is an understatement!!\u201d", "Author": "SandraBC", "ReviewID": "UR116557950", "Content": "I went to Sunlight hotel as a family trip. The whole staff was very friendly except for the receptionists. There are only two receptionists men, who don't talk well English and are very rude! They don't help you at all. The hotel wasn't clean and not appropriate for children or a family trip, or any other trip. There are so many better hotels around this, Sunlight definitely was the worst I've seen in whole Istanbul especially because of the small rooms and bad hygiene.

They hadn't vacuum cleaned underneath the beds for probably more than a year. The luggage carriers were very friendly but the people behind the desk were extremely rude and hardly spoke any English which is a requirement when working in the tourism industry. Contrary to the pictures the roof terrace only offers a view from above and has no caffe or restaurant. The air conditioning also did not work properly. The only good thing about the Hotel is it's location, although it's situated in a somewhat neglected neighborhood it's a 10 min walk from the shore and a 5 min walk to the main shopping street of that district. Overall the Sunlight Hotel is not worth the money and I'm sure there are plenty of other Hotels that offer much better service for the same price.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood place to start a city tour and to return to find rest and energy for the next day\u201d", "Author": "Spinring10", "ReviewID": "UR71681901", "Content": "Central location in the old town, good to reach by public transport.

Hotel Generally the hotel was clean, exept of some damp spots. All the time we had warm water. The heating was okay, though we could not regulate it ourselve. Breakfast contained of white bread, jam, honey, labane, eggs, cheese, legumes as well as hot and cold drinks. Return to the Airport Advise: For a cheap transfer to Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en Airport it is advisable, to take the ferry from Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc to Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y (1.3 YLT pp) first.

The transfer took about an hour in a spotlesss mini-bus with ourselves and Sammy the gude as the only passengers. This transfer was booked over the internet at only 24 hours before departure and proved to be a big relief after a 3.5 hour scrum on easyjet. Later, the return to the airport with Fez proved to be just as punctual and hassle free. The Sunlight Hotel is situated in a pleasant side street just a 10 minute stroll from the Blue Mosque, Kapali Carsi (covered bazaar) and the Cemberlitas tram stop. There are many restaurants and a few decent small grocery stores close to the hotel and the area (like all of Istanbul) felt very safe to stroll day or night. The hotel was having an external facelift (literally) at the time of our stay and so the drilling at 8am outside our small window was met by ourselves as a neccesary wake up call! Our room was in a state of general disrepair and as much as we could it was hard to ignore a few stains and damp spots on the walls. The breakfast was very basic (i took down meat to stuff into my rolls) and generally the staff were a bit miserable......having said that we lost our passports, camera and wallet at one point and the guy on reception acted quickly and efficiently to inform the British consulate. Fortunately the passports were found and returned to our hotel after being found on a tour bus which we had never agreed to book, was cancelled after a 2 hour bus ride trying to find a boat up the Bosphrus....and quite spoiled an otherwise fantastic day. We actually had to ask for a refund! Overall, I quite liked the Sunlight Hotel...the room and services were rubbish, the staff unsmiling...but is in a great little location...it has a roof on its head...enjoy and have fun if you're on a budget.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cI liked it\u201d", "Author": "Heike65", "ReviewID": "UR5920022", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights.

The breakfast is served downstairs and is typical Turkish (boiled eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, yoghurt, bread, olives). From the roof of the hotel there is a small bar area.
