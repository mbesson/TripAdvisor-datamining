Mother and Father of the Bride. The wedding itself was not held at La Concha but a welcome dinner for 80 people and a farewell brunch for 80 people were handled by the hotel catering dept. The catering dept delivered superior product and service as promised, but the hotel front desk was seriously wanting. It took over 24 hours to finally get the promised room after unpacking and repacking at least three times. Our original room was to be adjoining with family but it really wasn't. \"Well you need to understand sir that we really do not have adjoining rooms in the sense that they are connected, we just told you that.\" The original room was half the normal size, next to a service elevator and , condition wise, resembled a Frat house room. Our second room was the regular size and in much better condition but did not have the promised \"step out\" balcony. \" Oh, really? That room doesn't have a step out balcony? Are you sure? We're sorry sir\" We'll take care of it right away!! Eight hours later, at 11 PM, after attending a welcome party away from the hotel, we moved into the \"Promised\" room. For the next 5 days we received 2 $8 bottles of water in our room until we had amassed 10 bottles, and once again we had to deal with the front desk. \" Are you sure there are really 10 bottles of water in your room sir?\" Hidden bellman and housekeeping fees. When the front office manager, Cynthia Colon, was challanged over non-disclosed charges she quickly blamed the Wedding Planner. Really? My room contract was with the La Conca Hotel, not Ms. Lopez the wedding planner. Four other parties staying at La Concha for the wedding experienced similar unprofessional conduct at the front desk. The front desk personnal, led by Ms Colon, were quick to point out the Fantastic Room rate being enjoyed by the wedding guests. Enough! The hotel staff, bellmen, housekeeping, bartenders, wait staff etc. were all vey professional, helpfull and pleasant. Management on the other hand, thinks very highly of itself and not so much of its guests. So rating wise..... Hotel Public Areas - 8 Hotel Rooms in old tower - 3 Hotel Rooms in New Tower - 6 Hotel Staff - 9 Hotel Management - 2 Food - 5 Catering Dept - 10 Value for the dollar - 3 The wedding is over.

It is very modern and kept very well, but there is a severe lack in service from the hotel staff - especially for a platinum member. Due to a late arriving flight, we would not be arriving at the hotel until 4AM local time. I called and spoke with the front desk before our flight left and informed them of our late arrival and was told there would be no problem, and that we had been upgraded into a 1 bedroom oceanview suite. Upon arrival (almost 4am exactly) I asked if we could have a late checkout due to our early morning arrival and was informed that the hotel manager would arrive at 7am and I could call and ask then, but for now they were unable to even consider the request. Not a big deal, but not even an effort to try an accommodate us. When we arrived to our room it was a 1 bedroom suite, but faced the loud bars that were still very busy at 4am, no ocean in sight at all. I woke up a little bit past 7am to call the hotel manager, who I reached, and was immediately and flat out \"no\" to my request for a late checkout and that we needed to \"vacate\" our room by 11am. I've stayed at Marriot's (JW's, Renaissance's, Marquis, all of them) all over the world, and to have one not even try to consider a platinum member's request was a huge turn-off.

The area around the hotel is fairly run down. A sense of relief came over me as I walked into the lobby. I was also relieved to get the room I requested, as the hotel was completely booked just before Easter. We stayed in the suite tower, in a cityview room. After reading reviews, we packed a few pairs of earplugs. We didn't need them, as the noise wasn't bad on the Wed. and Thurs. night we were there. The noise comes from two rinky dink bars that appear to serve drinks right on the sidewalk and seemed to attract 50-75 people nightly. The hotel ought to just buy out those properties and be done with noise issues. Our unit was large, with a separate kitchen area. I lifted up a chair cushion and found food underneath. Other than that, things appeared clean. The bathroom was large, but we hated the shower. It has a clear half-door, so water leaks all over the bathroom. The other side is a transparent wall to the bedroom. Yes, you can easily make out body parts from the bedroom side. There were no sheets for the sleep sofa, so we had to call housekeeping. The two queen beds in the bedroom were actually full sized beds, not queen, as previously mentioned. We ate at Perla one night. While the atmosphere was really cool, the food was lacking. My husband ordered scallops and received a plate with 4 scallops as a main course. I had the Chilean sea bass. It was good, not great. We also ordered salads, but they were nothing special. Let's just say, don't go there for the food. We wanted to do the chef's tasting menu, but everyone at the table has to order it, and our son doesn't eat seafood or coconut desserts. You will leave the restaurant hungry. The waves were really crashing in when we were there. Surfers were out in full force. One wave came within 12\" of the hotel. Waves were as high as the cement jetty/seawall. I would never dream of going in the water under those conditions. I just sat on the beach for a few hours. It's great people-watching. During my people-watching I observed one of the hotel's beach chair valet's hit up the ice cream vendor for $5. Another hotel employee chased off a guy who was renting boogie boards. As much as I hate beach vendors, I really feel hotel employees are taking advantage of the beach vendors. Beware of a big, handsome, well-tanned, silver-haired, 50-something, Caucasion guy wearing a white Old Navy sweatshirt and WHITE FLIP FLOPS. He's either an undercover police officer or a thief. All-in-all, I wasn't crazy about the Condado area. The hotels are close together. The area restaurants weren't that good. The beaches were crowded. I much preferred the Wyndham Rio Mar, out by the rainforest. We also stayed on Vieques and at El Convento in Old San Juan (see my other reviews).", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burke, Virginia, United States", "Title": "\u201cBeware the see-through bathrooms.....\u201d", "Author": "Cynthia S", "ReviewID": "UR127965544", "Content": "Overall, the service and location are great.

Therefore, every time somebody turns on a light in the bathroom, the light flows right into the bedroom. And since we are a family of 3 (mom,dad, teenage boy), using the shower was really uncomfortable because you can see through it from the bedroom.

I am a very experienced traveller and have stayed at many hotels and resorts around the world. I do plenty of research before booking my vacation and thought that this was a beautiful hotel...boy I was wrong! The only good things I have to say is that the lobby is very nice and the valet people were extremely friendly. After we checked in, I was shocked to see that our room was a cheesy replica of Ikea display and did not appear to be very clean. The kitchen was not clean, we even left a little makeup on the table and on the floor to see if anyone really cleaned...it is night number 4 and there is still eyeshadow on the table from the first night. The air conditioning only goes up 5 degrees, which I personally like my room cold and figure this would be a problem, but the loud system that goes on and off every 5 minutes either kept the room freezing cold in one area and was uncomfortablely hot. Again, we booked a room with two queenbeds only to find out that they are a full at best. The bathroom has the worst lighting ever (extremely bright in weird areas) and the awkward see-thru glass wall that faces the bedroom gave plenty of sight to see for whoever was next to you. I got to see a new side of my friends. The trash was barely taken care of unless we called, the floor was not cleaned, the counters were never cleaned and I hope that the shower was, but I doubt it. Oh and I don't know if this is just a weekend thing, but the water pressure didn't work until 3 hours ago on Friday. Despite all of this, we were trying to stay positive and enjoy the beach and pool side...but guess what...it sucks. The pool in the main area was small and over packed. Walking out to the beach...that amazing infinity pool turned out to be a small pee green pond filled with who knows what and maybe sand? The beach was okay at best, the staff were sercivable. The outdoor furniture looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months, with stains and sand and the freaking pidgons that would come next to you wanting your food. We did find the scond infinity pool but it was okay, and a little small for my standards. If you're interested in staying in San Juan, I recommend Old San Juan because the neighborhood that this hotel is in is extremely diverse...meaning, down the block you have a Louis Vuitton shop but literally turn down the corner and you will run into a pregnant hooker. I have to say tht it is safe for tourist because the police are out in full force. But that doesn't mean they aren't on their cell phones and or smoking cigarettes on the job. Oh and if you wanted a good nights sleep, the walls are paper thin and the bar across the street plays loud music until 4 am...and it's not the best music to fall asleep to either. I feel as though that once the Vanderbilt is finished next door to La Concha, they may have some competition and will update their standards. overall the stay here was okay at best. The service was okay, the food was a bit overpriced, but okay, the lounge was okay.

In choosing our San Juan hotel, we looked at various Marriott properties and, boy, am I glad we chose La Concha. Beautiful property with three pools and direct beach access. The lobby is modern and open. The service was impeccable. The rooms were spacious and pleasant. The beds were comfortable. The restaurants were excellent. The location is ideal. The casino was spacious, not too crowded, and not at all smoky. When we return to San Juan with kids, we'll stay here again. There were two things I wish I had known prior to booking this resort, so I'll pass them along to you. 1. There is a new tower and an old tower. The old tower was clearly a child of the 60's and La Concha has tried to maintain that retro vibe in building out the new property. We were in the new tower, so I cannot comment on the old tower rooms, other than to say they all have ocean views, which is nice. I can recommend the new tower, which has suites. The bedroom is pretty standard. The other room has a fold-out bed, dining area, and mini-kitchenette, with two electric burners and a large refrigerator with its own ice maker. Very convenient. My only gripe is that the decor looks like it came straight from Ikea -- not unattractive, but not as comfy as it might have been. Overall, a minor complaint. 2. The bathrooms in the new tower, however, are a warning to those who would place form over function. They are beautiful creations, with wide, light wood sliding doors, top mounted bowl sinks, and acres of frosted glass. There were three problems with the bathroom itself, however. First of all, the frosted glass opens into the bedroom. So, when someone (say...me) had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, turning on the light floods the bedroom with light. Not such a nice thing to do and there's no way around it because of the placement of the lights. We ended up using a flashlight, which is sub-optimal on vacation. Second, the frosted glass doesn't really provide as much privacy as it might. In fact, it provides precious little privacy at all. Again, this is fine if you're on a romantic getaway and have no personal body issues. If, however, you're with the kids or some buddies from college, you might not want them in the bedroom while you're rubbing soap all over yourself. Finally, the shower (which did include a jetted tub), has one of those fixed glass walls separating it from the rest of the bathroom. You can't reach the shower controls without climbing in. So, every morning, I ended up doing a little contortionist yoga to avoid the cold water that came out of the shower head. (In their defense, it warms it really, really quick.) Hotels, please don't let your designers run amok like this -- different lighting wiring, a sliding door on the shower, and glass with some ripples in it would have been a good idea. Also be aware of resort fees and taxes, which will add 20% to your room rate. All that said, I will go back there again. It's location was perfect, as it was far enough away from the cruise ship port to keep the visiting-for-the-day crowds away, but close enough to get to the cool stuff quickly. The beach is small, but nice, and the pools \"flow\" from one to the other down to the beach nicely. For those of you with elite Marriott status, the Ocean club saves you money on breakfast, hors d'oeuvres, dessert, and drinks each day. Really a great location.

The overall experience was mostly wonderful with just a downfall or two thrown in. Let's start with the good. We enjoyed a beautiful suite and had a connecting room as well in the newer part of the hotel. The ocean view was also fantastic. The connecting King Room also had a \"mini\" kitchen with an additional fridge which was nice for water,juice,beer etc. The rooms were clean and very updated with kinda this \"W\" vibe. Although neither the Suite nor the King Room was especially large, it did have this cool boutique/South Beach hotel feel to it. The Ocean View was worth every penny because I could even hear the surf crashing on the beach at night which lulled me to sleep(even with the sliding doors closed). The Lobby has this very hip open air lay out with a great bar in the middle. On some nights, a live musician will play on the edge of the lobby bordering on the outside patio. The music can be heard both inside the hotel and outside as well. If your dining outside, it's a nice compliment to your meal. Speaking of meals, I cannot remember a Carribean Vacation were every single meal was excellent! I've traveled quite extensively through the Carribean and the only other two islands which have perhaps equally as good food is Turks and Caicos and Aruba. Both signature restaurants in the hotel were great- the Italian Restaurant featured homemade pastas, while Perla was more Continental. Again, both meals were fantastic with great service. We also ate off site which will be covered in a separate review. Just a few additional random thoughts: The pools and service was great, the staff very helpful and nice. However, the elevators are slow and one broke while we were there-again, not really a big deal. The overall stay reminded me of being in South Beach, Miami without the flocks of beautiful people and more families. The resort is only about 20 minutes to the airport so that's a big plus as well. Now here is the problem: Serious Gamblers Beware: This is not the resort for you. The caliber of play is not what you would find at the Atlantis, with most of it local trade. I noticed several $5 match play coupons on the tables. In fact, when we checked out we were quite disapointed at the dismal comps offered considering the amount of play which we gave them. It's obvious that they really don't care about running a Vegas or Atlantic City caliber gaming operation-their bread and butter are the locals and that's fine.

Here's the letter I eventually wrote to the Renaissance Group GM, Luis Rivera, to address the ruined experience. After learning of the issues, he provided additional discounts, albeit regretfully, to the price we paid for the trip. To keep things in perspective, I've traveled all around the world, I'm NOT high maintenance, and I've never been compelled to write a review on Trip Advisor until now. \"... I've been a guest at your resort in San Juan since Wed, July 20th. I am checking out today and was hoping to speak with you prior regarding a myriad of very serious issues that I've encountered with the hotel staff and accommodations during my stay. I'm appalled at the lack of compassion demonstrated by the management team in that this stay has been a nightmare since the moment we checked in. I chose the La Concha because of the location, upscale appeal and rave reviews on the internet, however, I've yet to experience any of those things over the course of a 5 day stay. My 30th birthday has been a disaster because of the negligence displayed by the La Concha management team and I'd like to speak with you directly regarding my concerns. To give you a brief overview, my party and I were moved to 3 different rooms for reasons including insect infestations, faulty plumbing, as well as, poor cleaning and upkeep. Additionally, we've been treated poorly by the beach attendant staff and been the victim of extremely slow hotel response time on request, to the point where we've missed reservations and had to completely change plans. On top of all of that, the Concierge and Guest Services team, failed to follow through on a surprise 30th birthday audio visual request that was planned a week prior to our arrival. Only after our arrival, about an hour before the presentation was needed, were we informed that the La Concha would be unable to accommodate the request though we were informed everything was set-up and ready to go by the Concierge manager, Louise. My largest concerns rest with the management team, namely Alfredo Arroyo, who initially appeared very concerned when I met with him to discuss these issues on Friday, July 22nd. I was on the verge of checking out of the hotel; however, he immediately apologized and offered to comp our first two nights, upgrade our room, and provide complimentary breakfast during our last 3 days on the property. He also asked that we meet with him again before we checked out to ensure that the remainder of our stay met our expectations and to determine if any further comps he should be applied. However, upon meeting with Alfredo yesterday, Sun, July 24th, he rescinded his offer for breakfast stating that he felt he'd done enough and was being \"fair\". He also dismissed the remaining issues that my party and I experienced after meeting with him and since being moved to yet a 3rd room. I find his callous response completely deplorable and dishonorable, which is why I am now escalating the matter to you.\"", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLike South Beach, but in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "60618Travelers", "ReviewID": "UR126781964", "Content": "This place is super modern and beautiful... however, the South beach vibe with DJ's by the pool and people taking shots and \"woo-ing\" isn't really my scene, so I'm happy that we only spent a day here enjoying the facilities since they are partner hotels with Hotel El Convento where we stayed.

However, because of the geography, the beach loses sun sooner than some of the adjacent properties. The hotel itself is very nice. The only problem is that when full, the staff does not seem to be able to keep up with the demand and often appears disorganized. We are vegan and discussed dietary concerns with the concierge before arriving and were assured there would be no problem. However, upon our arrival we saw that there was actually only one option on all of the menus that would work for us. Thankfully there was a viable option a few doors away. Prices for food and drinks are high, but you are paying for a nice property. The pool area is divided nicely into several areas to sit. Smoke from the outdoor grill tends to flood part of the deck area. The first room we were given had a completely obstructed ocean view. As we booked an ocean view, we were not happy. We immediately went back to the front desk and they said it would be no problem to change rooms. We had to wait another hour before a room was available. They explained the room was ready, it just needed to be inspected first. I am not sure what they inspected as there were a few issues with the room, specifically the bathroom. There was a burned out light bulb and there was no toilet paper holder. We told the front desk about these problems and they promised to fix them. Upon returning from dinner, neither problem was addressed. We brought it to their attention the following morning before going out on a tour. When we returned 5 hours later, they were still not fixed. As we were leaving the next morning, we gave up trying.

Resort is very nice, but some major downfalls for this price point. - Not enough staff at the resort. Always a wait at the check in desk and concierge desk. Sometimes we just gave up and left. Also when you did get a chance to talk to them they were not friendly at all, and were actually rude at times. They don't make eye contact when interacting with you, they smack their gum, and actually tried to discredit our platinum status at check-in and were arguing with us (sheila was the associate that checked us in). - Room keys had to be re-programmed 6 times in the first 2 days. Finally we were told the battery was replaced and we should not have the issue again. We had the issue 2 more times over the next 5 days. - Food quality at bar pool is very bad. First of all the seating area is pretty spread out so the waiters don't know if you are waiting to order. We ordered the chicken noodle soup for our daughter one day and the chicken looked really pink and undercooked - took it back and found out that they were actually serving us campbells soup....really???? If you don't cook it fresh, it shouldn't be on your menu! - Bar in the Lobby gets really loud on Thursday nights as they have a weekly party there starting at 6:30pm! You can hear the music on the entire main floor because if is blasting! YOu would think you are in a club not a hotel lobby. - The Sunday night that we were there, there was a group outside protesting against the Telecom company that was holding your event there. We got informed with a letter under our door of the protest. This is not your typical protest...they had huge speakers and were playing loud music and chanting. It went on till almost 9:30pm! Super annoying. The resort did not try to offer any sort of apology beyond the letter for the inconvenience to the guests staying there. - Rooms were nice except there is no privacy in the bathroom. The bathroom is separated from the room with a frosted glass, so you can see the person taking a shower. Also if they go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and turn on the lights, the whole room is disturbed b/c of the lights. Other then that everything else was great about the rooms, and shower pressure was best I have had at a hotel. - Pools were very small. One of the three pools is adult only. The only infinity pool that is usable by families is tiny, and the deepest end of the pool is only 4 feet. The largest pool is not beach front, which is very disappointing for a resort of this size. - Ocean Lounge staff was super nice and accommodating. Mike gave our kids some toys and always made them feel welcome. But the night staff was even better! The lady manager and Jose were very personable and always willing to go the extra mile to make you feel welcome! We loved hanging out with them and our kids actually miss them! Overall one thing we noticed was the resort was very focused on making money, be it from a convention, company party, or club-by party in the lobby.

We arrived by taxi (18 for 2 people and our luggage). We did not meet anyone at the front to help with our bags; we had no encounter with this famous Felix that so many people have written about. We arrived in the late morning and after a nice lunch at the hotel bar we had our room by 1:30pm. We had reserved a junior suite in the new tower and upon arrival in our room everything that was promised was there and ready. The previous reviews lend me to believe that the people who did not enjoy their stay had rooms in the older, not newly renovated tower of the hotel. Great views. Great room. Fantastic pools. Nice beach. Wonderful food. If you can get a reservation at PERLA, their gourmet restaurant, get one. I will remember their Black Truffle soup w/ White Truffle Flan for the rest of my life. Amazing. We ate brunch at VOGA. The $25 all you can eat breakfast buffet was a deal, but that could be because we are used to New York prices. It was very good with a wide range of breakfast foods all the way to the omelet bar. I seriously have a new appreciation for a slow cooked omelet. We did have the knowledge beforehand due to some reviews that we should get to the pool early and reserve our chairs, which we did, but I rarely saw it being crazy around the pools. Well, except for the number of children who seem to run free from their parents. If you do not really want to be near the children there is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadults only\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 infinity pool area. Smaller, but nice and quiet. Those chairs are taken by 8am daily.

The hotel is aesthetically pleasing, filled with modern furniture, interesting lighting, and a hip vibe. I stayed in an ocean view room with two queen beds and a very small balcony. The room was tidy and spacious and included a small fridge, where we stored bottles of water we picked up at the nearby Walgreens. The room was carpeted, which I always find an odd choice in the tropics, but the room was fresh and clean. The beach was very full over the weekend, but we never had trouble finding beach chairs or a sunny spot. The ocean is very rough, and I say this as someone who loves big waves. Fortunately, there is a nice infinity pool on the beach, so we did our sunbathing and dipped in the infinity pool to cool off when we didn't want to brave the surf (and the surfers). There are a few vendors on the beach, but I didn't find it particularly bothersome. If you eat breakfast on the later side and then don't eat again until dinner, the breakfast buffet ($25 pp) is a reasonable deal - we opted for the buffet. But there are budget friendly options for the money conscious nearby, including a well-stocked Walgreens, a Starbucks, a Wendy's, and a Dunkin Donuts. There are a number of dinner options in the area, both inside and outside of the hotel. We dined in the hotel on two nights, once at Perla and the other time at Solera, which becomes a tapas bar at night. Perla was a lovely way to start off our trip. We ordered steak and lobster, both of which were fantastic, and don't miss the boca negra cake, which they serve with graham cracker ice cream and a toasted marshmallow - just like a deconstructed s'more. Perla was pricey, but the food was great and the atmosphere was lovely. Plus, you feel like you're dining in a giant oyster shell floating on water. (That's not a bad thing.) Solera was a decent choice, and the small plates we ordered tasted great, but they didn't really seem to fit together in the way I think a tapas menu should. We also loved the lobby bar, where we often stopped for a pre-dinner drink. I enjoyed a mojito or two (or three)! Outside of the hotel, we opted for dinner at Ropa Vieja, which is in walking distance. Don't miss this one, since there is very good Puerto Rican food to be had there. We went for the goat stew and the shrimp mofongo - yum! We also took a cab to Jose Enrique, which tends to get rave reviews. The menu changes nightly but the restaurant serves food inspired by a variety of Latin American cuisines and they know how to cook meat right. Our super splurgey meal was at Marmalade in Old San Juan, which was incredible and worth the price of admission. Just a 10-15 minute drive from the airport and relatively convenient to Old San Juan, La Concha was great for our 6-day beach holiday. I can't say this was my favorite beach vacation (once you've been to Dubai, nothing can measure up) but La Concha had everything I needed for a fun trip.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Suburbs", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Modern Hotel with Very Friendly Employees\u201d", "Author": "Lusk623", "ReviewID": "UR126110708", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous pool grounds (three pools.)

La Concha is in a great location to see San Juan and all the splendor this wonderful city has to offer. We arrivied at SJU and found a cab easily. The cab fare was flat at $15.00 to the Condado area. The cabs were clean and in excellent condition. The cabbies spoke english pretty well. We took numerous cab rides into old San Juan and again this was a fair flat rate. Never saw a meter running. Upon arriving at La Concha we were greeted with 2 of the nicest bellman I have ever come across in my travels, Victor and Felix. They will make you feel very welcome and both are very proactive in making sure you are taken care of during your stay. The check-in and check-out process was easy. Concierge services were always available, efficient and steered us to the right places. The king suite was large, clean, modern with a large fridge (for a hotel room), mw, stovetop and 2 flatscreen tv's. One in the master and a smaller one in the room with a pull out sleeper sofa. My 12 yo daughter slept on the sleeper sofa and found it comfortable. The Beach and surf was beautiful. The infinity pools were small, but clean and warm. The only negative was there was alot of shade in the area of the pools so if your there to work on a tan get out to the pool areas early or sun at the beach. We did not use the spa or on-site restaurants. The gym was was equipped with a direct view of the surf. The only low experieince was the bartenders. The outside pool bartenders were busy and made really good drinks but I never saw them smile at a customer or make eye contact (sort of distracted out of proportion to being busy). The inside bartenders who were not busy when my wife and I sat down never even acknowledged us. One tender in particular walked past us twice and without saying even \"be with you in a minute\". These 2 examples are small, but they are ones that guests remember. If you are looking for a great adventure that is somewhat physically challenging, call the Rocaliza tour group for the El Salto tour to the rain forest where you can hike, rapell and zip line.

A few complaints: We could hear the music in the lobby every night in our room after we went to bed. I was told you could not hear the music if you stayed in the \"suite tower\", but we were in the regular tower and could definitely hear the music. There is a rather steep resort fee you are charged daily (I believe it was $36+) and we were also charged for a maid gratuity daily, and a bellhop gratuity on the first day. These fees were by no means expensive, but we did not use the maid service once, and the bellhop did not help us with our bags on the first day, so to be charged for services you are not using was a bit obnoxious.

I am a Diamond rewards member with Hilton and I never receive any upgrades or special treatment at the Conrad. I was extremely impressed with the e-concierge service Marriott provided prior to check-in which allowed me to make any requests or special arrangements for my room. I am a Gold level member with their rewards program and I requested a complementary room upgrade from partial ocean view to ocean view and it was granted. Also, I requested the highest possible floor and that was also granted. My room was ocean front in the newer Suite Tower which has beautiful, spacious accomodations.

My room had a nicely appointed living room / kitchen area, a spacious bath with an all glass walk in shower, a large closet, and comfortable bedroom with a wall of glass looking out over the beautiful Atlantic ocean. I slept both nights with the balcony door open to the refreshing sea breeze. My balcony included a table and chairs for relaxing or dining outdoors. I had dinner in the beautifully landscaped outdoor patio of the Solera restaurant and although the service is a bit slow, the staff was friendly. The complimentary breakfast that was served in the private lounge each morning was great and the ocean view was even better. Another difference that I noticed as a business traveler between the Conrad Hilton and this Marriott property is that La Concha has a complimentary business center where they DO NOT charge you to use the computers or to print documents! While staying at the Conrad on one of my trips I had a horrible experience with their business center and because it is run by an outside company they charge very high rates for printing and internet usage.

She informed me to wait by my door as she called maintenance service. After 30 MINS. someone showed up!!! I must give it to the cleaning lady, Atena, who was very apoligetic about the issue and remained available as she proceeded to continue with her duties in the room next to me.

I think age and expectations play a big part in the reviews. I've been traveling almost 30 years and have a pretty high standard to meet. That isn't to say those who haven't traveled as much are not entitled to their opinion, but that being said if you haven't stayed at truly amazing resorts, this would be considered very good, I however, without sounding snobbish, expected a little more. First although we had a oceanfront suite, I felt the furnishings were very cheap looking the room, It was clean, but still had an older feel to it. The pool area is very nice, but serivce at all the reataurants was horrible, That is what I am basing my average rating on in particular. Especially the breakfast restaurant, extremely disorganized, and for four days, never got our food without asking or it took forever. The area is not what I would call upscale as opposed to other areas in PR. A couple of so called designer shops nearby, but really nothing. It's also smack in the middle of downtown Condado, stil a cab ride to nicer restaurants and Old San Juan. The lobby area was the most attractive and active area of the hotel and the casino was on par with other island casinos. All I can say is it just depends on how high your standards are and what you are used to. If I was 20 again, this place would probably be a 5 star, but that was then this is 30 years later. Let's put it this way , we went to the Ritz for dinner and I felt like I was where I needed to be. The remodeling was done well, but even the new tower didn't feel updated, and the only pools to get morning sun is the main pool area the small one at the towers gets 0 sun in the morning and the pool overlooking the ocean isn't that sunny either, so everyone is kind of on top of each other.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The property is lovely and well-maintained, the surrounding neighborhood is interesting, and the service is friendly, albeit slow. There were a few issues that detracted from our overall experience. We arrived late afternoon after a long day of travel. Upon arrival, there was a long line and no separate line for Marriott Rewards Elite members, so we waited a while. When we got to the desk, we were told that our room needed to be \"inspected by engineering\" and were handed a restaurant-style beeper to notify us when the room was ready. After waiting for a while, I found a staff member and requested that we get a room immediately. Miraculously, our room was ready at that time. When we got in, it was clear that the \"inspection\" had something to do with previous guests smoking in the suite, because it reeked. At that point, we just opened the sliding door and hoped for the best because we didn't want to wait any longer. The lamp by the door did not work, so I called the front desk about that. A gentleman came to look at it and said someone would be back to fix it. It was not fixed during our stay. There were also some other small service issues (coffee and other items not replaced daily, etc.) but nothing major. Our experience with the poolside restaurant is consistent with other reviewers'-adequate, resort-priced food with slow service. I didn't expect anything else-service in the islands is typically friendly, but slow. I don't think this restaurant was any exception. The food and drink were not cheap, but not out of line given that this is a resort. We enjoyed the suite tower and were excited about the adults-only pool. There seemed to be a wedding going on that weekend, so twice the pool and associated terrace were closed for private events, which was disappointing. We had to go over to the main pool area which was a lot louder and more crowded, and not as convenient to our room. The ocean was too rough for swimming, but we did sit on the beach. I found that the gentlemen manning the chairs and umbrellas were friendly and attentive. We spoke with two ladies at the concierge desk regarding recommendations for dining in Old San Juan and excursions on the way to Fajardo. One was very helpful, the other was less so. In sum, we had a nice stay despite the blips. The lobby and street facing the hotel are very loud at night, but being in the suite tower facing the ocean, we did not have any noise issues.

We also used the private, members only club which was very nice. All trips that we arranged through the conceriage went smoothly and were well worth the experience.

What transpired at La Concha Resort during our recent visit transcends these allowances, and was far from acceptable. I'll start with check in. Arriving around 5pm in the afternoon, only one staff member was available to assist guests. After waiting for a while, we were greeted by a friendly employee, though we'd later find out that despite informing them of our parking arrangements, we'd eventually be improperly charged. After a long day of travel, we were hungry and anxious to try out the hotel's restaurants that we'd previously read positive reviews of. We stopped by Solera, the poolside tapas lounge. Finding the non-staffed receptionist's stand for the restaurant, we waited for over 5 minutes as various waiters and staff members visually acknowledged us, however neglected to greet us, nor assist in any way. Typically I'd speak up, but I wanted to see where simply waiting would get us. Not far, it seems. Eventually someone came by to seat us, providing us with only one menu. That was only the beginning of the wait however. We jokingly wondered how long it would take a waiter to arrive, finding the answer to be about 15 minutes. Both of us having been in professional food service for many combined years, we have a realistic expectation of what good service looks like, and this wasn't it. Being on vacation however, we were again willing to let things slide, looking to relax. Drinks took another 15 minutes. Food, another 30. An hour after showing, we finally had food on the table, and empty drinks with no second round in sight. Giving up on this lost cause led us off the resort and across the street to a local bar & grill that provided much better service. Back to the room, we called it a night. Understanding that people have infinite sleep preferences, be warned that La Concha's beds satisfy none. A stiff bed, thin sheets, and hard, thin pillows are what await. Sleep didn't come easy, or comfortable here. The straw that broke the back however was our visit to La Concha's Komakai sushi bar. Only intending to stop by for a quick appetizer, we ordered a lobster roll. We anticipated by now from previous service that it would be slow, and this visit was no exception. What did surprise and disgust us however, was when a sushi chef came out from the kitchen (into the dining area) with a bleeding nose, rags wrapped around his face. He then proceeded behind the sushi bar where our food was being prepared, talking to the other chef while his nose bled. During that time, he touched various utensils, food prep items, and various foods, still covering his bleeding nose. Immediately upon being served our food, openly prepared near a bleeding chef, I sought out management. Walking to to front desk and asking for the on duty manager earned me a 10 minute wait, while my wife sat back at our table with our likely contaminated sushi. After finally speaking to a manager and explaining the situation, I was told that she would speak a food service manager, and offered little other resolution. I of course informed her that we would not be eating the food we were served, and she agreed. Walking back to my wife, I watched as she consulted with the food service manager in the lobby. The food manager neglected to speak with me, and went to discuss the matter with the offending chef. Disgusted with the dangerous food service standards, we left to find food in the local area again instead. What really put the nail in the coffin, however, was seeing that upon our return nearly an hour later, the previously offending cook was still behind the sushi bar, preparing other guest's food. Not only was this blatant health code violation ignored by the chef, but apparently acceptable to the management. No effort by the staff was ever made to amend this experience (or any other), and by this point we were just ready to call it quits and leave. Any effort to address serious concerns such as these are met with general indifference by the management. I'm still considering addressing this issue with the local health department, as management at La Concha shows no inclination to police themselves or their employees. Other experiences at the hotel's Voga restaurant provided better service and flavors, though now realizing how lax La Concha is with health standards in their kitchens, it makes me worry, to say the least. One concession I will make about our visit however was the service provided by the valet staff. These professionals are the first to greet you as you arrive, and reflect a positive attitude about the resort that is not seen nearly anywhere else. Management: take note, if your entire staff was even half as professional, courteous, and helpful as your valet team, you'd have a hotel worth considering. Potential guests: your experiences may vary, these are merely mine. Again, I'm generally agreeable when it comes to variation in service standards across various borders, but I draw the line at dangerous and unhealthy violations.

The hotel is little bit more than what we normally spend...but worth it for a special occasion! We booked an oceanfront junior suite. Loved the room (albeit not exactly spotless - minor carpet stain and other minor issues), bed was okay. When I booked our stay I sent an email specifically requesting a high floor and was disappointed to hear that they booked us on the third floor when we checked in. However, they changed our room to a higher floor when I mentioned that we were there for my husband's birthday! Our room didn't come with a microwave, but I was able to request one from housekeeping. Quiet room, beautiful view, and comfortable chase lounges to rest on while I stared at the ocean! Some people on tripadvisor said that they were unaware that the hotel was going to charge a resort fee (mine was about $40 a night). I booked my trip with Orbitz and was given the heads up. Note to the hotel, it wouldn't hurt for you guys to reiterate the fee upon checking in. Be aware that the beaches are not private. Also, there are pros and cons to the area...easy access to local spots, you're in the middle of everything...Walgreens, liquor stores, etc. (You really don't need a car except if you want to take a few day trips. There are car rental places near the hotel - we rented a Lancer from Enterprise for about $48/day.) There's a lot of traffic on the street at night, particularly on the weekends. I was also surprised to see homeless people sleeping on the street just a block from the hotel. I never felt unsafe...however, the visual is a bit unsettling. Some reviewers here complained about the pools being crowded, but I didn't see that. It was a bit breezy so I appreciated the slightly heated pools! Restaurants in the neighborhood - avoid Cafe del Angel (spelling?) across the street! My husband is Puerto Rican so I know good Puerto Rican food. This place served watered down beans and food with minimal flavor. Pelayos (71 Luisa Street) is a must for any meal! I heard about their pancakes from Tripadvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. My husband said they served a great cup of coffee! We also went for dinner and I had the best arroz con pollo! Don't pass on the deserts....take the yummy flan and delicious amaretto cake to go! There is a Denny's at the Conrad hotel but their pancakes were like paper weights....yuck! Dining recommendation away from the property - if you rent a car, drive to Guavate about 20 mins away...the concierge can give you directions and it's an easy drive. The best time to go to this area is on the weekend when they have live music, but even if you go during the week, you will get the best lechon (roasted pork) ever! i first heard about this area from a Travel Channel link. We're only talking about a block or two of side-road eateries. There's nothing fancy about this place, in fact, the spot we went to looked like a dive, but the food was great, plentiful and reasonably priced!

My needs were as follows: Beach plus pool Ocean view room for under $350 a night No more than ten minutes from Old San Juan One high end restaurant for a good dinner I prefer smaller hotels, but after a day I was okay with the massive amounts of people and the spot mongering of beach lounge chairs which is prevalent at resorts since I am a morning person who likes to wake up at 6:30, go to the beach to read/nap until 10 for breakfast time. There is the family space (inside courtyard pool area) which has tight seating, the ocean side pool with more space, the beach with plenty of space to not be amongst the thorngs if you choose, and one pool on the opposite side of the porperty which I preferred as it was pretty much adults only and under fifteen lounge chairs next to an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. This is where I went when I lamented the quantity of people surrounding me. There is an odd vibe of business folk with meetings and laptops and families and kids running about. Sunset becomes clublike festive and no more pool time. The staff were all so pleasant and helpful. One concierge mixed up the helicopter arrangements, but everyone else was proficient in the communications and job. The bar staff in the main lounge were eager to push the drinks, everywhere else was much more chill. Breakfast for two was $46 and dinner at Perla was $148 - this makes the dinner an amazing value in comparison. As a New Yorker, the prices were no shock, and for resort prices, I didn't think they were all that high. I was comfortable with the prices. some spoke about the horrendous resort fee. Every hotel has this. Go to another island if this upsets you (or rent a house for a week like our friends did near Boqueron). The food was fine, service was island speed. No one moves swiftly in hot climates. Nicaragua, Hawaii, the southern US, Puebla Mexico, Botswana. If you are in a rush, you cannot have a sit down lunch. Even France and Italy require a two hour lunch. Prior reviews had complaints, but the only agreement I have is that I saw that they were understaffed at times. One guy to move lounge chairs one morning and two waitresses doing their best at breakfast (with smiles and great personality). I was pleased by my stay (20-24). Got the Ocean View Jr. Suite for just $303. The room was 4th floor. I wanted higher up, but then saw the view. If I were higher, I wouldn't have the sand, waves, and palm tress in my view (just the water). It was much more pleasant. 3rd and 4th floor rooms by the restaurant Solera about 408-415 had exhaust from the restaurant as well as pool noises and club like noises. 405 only had pool noises. At Solera, if you are in a rush, sit by the bar, but endure the smoke of the cooking, otherwise sit on the comfy lounges far from the cooking station and be patient. Perla was great food. Skip the wine. My PR friends don't understand the wine craze on the island. the wine list is great, but you cannot find a bottle for under $65. There were many bottles between $600-2000. At this price, the wine should be decanted with me present hours before I enjoy it. It was a silly thing to have at a resort restaurant. Just get a mixed drink. Walgreens is across the street and down a block, so get your big bottles of water and essentials there to cut costs and be comfortable during your stay. There is a mini fridge in room. San Juan is really a one day trip, so there is no need to stay in the Old District. There is the Castillo del Morro and tourist shops. Nothing so special that you truly need, unless you have never been off the mainland before. For me, Old San Juan was best after 5pm, when most of the cruise ship folks and other tourists left my PR friends and I to stroll in cooler, breezier weather with more space to stroll. Avoid Old San Juan in middle of day - hot, lots of people. Staying at Condado area allowed us to visit city by taxi ($15-20) each way, and enjoy most of our time with the sound of waves and a beautiful tradewind breeze. I will return to this hotel again. Updated facilities with cool retro original shell kept (not just the restaurant shell) and modern interiors, happy helpful people (DON'T forget to tip everyone - tourism industry requires a modicum of generosity on your part!).

The property is gorgeous! infinity pools, marble floors, white furniture in the lobby, an open air lobby, three pools, beautiful view of the ocean, right on the beach. Just perfect. less than 30 minutes we got our room. within minutes, the manager called us to check in and make sure we were happy with our accommodations. we were. Our room was very large, with a seating area, kitchenette (2 eye stove, microwave, fridge) and a balcony. The bathroom had two shower heads...a stationary one and one with a hose. The wall beside the kitchen had two wall closets with a dresser area between them. very nice. We wanted to go to El Yunque and Luquillo beach but that particular tour wasn't one of the options in the tour book at the concierge desk. I spoke with Zoraida (?) and she said she could make a couple of calls for me. Turns out she booked us the following morning for a tour doing exactly what we wanted! It was only supposed to be about 4 hours but it was truly an all day . event. It was so worth it. Zoraida connected us with a tour guide named Rupert. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! He took local roads to El Yunque so he could give us a \"history tour\" of each of the towns on the way to the rain forest. Waterfalls, botanical information, historical information, Rupert had it all. We went to the rain forest, had a fantastic lunch and relaxed at the beach.. Highly recommend! The following day, we took the bus to Old San Juan. The bus stop is at the end of the drive way of the hotel and is only 75 cents. The bus ride is about 10 minutes to town and drops you off a block from the heart of Old San Juan. The one drawback...no schedule. It kind of runs when it wants to...sort of. If a cab driver sees a group of people, you may be able to work out a deal for about $3 per person. Go to LaBombonera! Mallorca bread. That's all I'm going to say. Went back to the hotel and lounged at the pool, then the beach...SO nice. Pools are nice and warm, clean. The staff is very attentive. They keep an eye on the beach entrance to the pool to ensure only guests are at the pool. Natalia at the concierge desk helped us plan our anniversary dinner, she is very sweet and helpful. We kept it simple and went to a nice Italian restaurant (yes, Italian :0)) two minutes walk from the hotel. VERY nice. Something I wanted to add in addition to a wonderful attentive staff, this hotel is in a great location. Every morning people are running up and down the street, there is a second beach five minutes walk from the hotel (Condado Beach) no waves. There are plenty of authentic cuisine restaurants, chains (if you're missing home) starbucks, dunkin doughnuts, souvenir shops, upscale shops (Cartier & Louis Vuitton about 1 block away). There's a casino in the hotel and another casino about 10 minute stroll down the street. I felt safe very safe. The Heineken Jazz Fest happened at the plaza right beside the hotel. Wonderful music! Traffic was at a stand still and there were people everywhere but it was very nice, no craziness. again, I felt very safe. If you want a nice getaway, this is the place. If you have trouble with noise, ask for an ocean view room or shut the sliding glass door, it blocks all the street sounds. The staff and hotel are lovely and I would definitely return.

While the entire staff was extraordinarily pleasant and helpful, three people stood out to me: Victor Rodriguez, Frank Aponte, and Luis Torres. In particular for me, Victor truly went above and beyond to provide us with a memorable visit. A particular highlight was when I asked him about arranging a birthday lunch for my husband. I wanted a dessert that was not on the hotel menu, and Victor went outside of his work schedule to pick up a fabulous tropical treat and get it to the hotel on time. Somehow from that point on it seemed like most of the staff knew we were celebrating a birthday. A perfectly chilled bottle of champagne was sent up to our room - that was a complete surprise and what a treat! We ate breakfast at the Voga Grill, where Luis took great care of us, lunch at the poolside grill, ordered sushi one night, and had cocktails at the bar. Everything was fresh, well-prepared, and tasty. Cocktails were perfect - nothing watered down or second rate. We felt we received excellent value for any food service (the two for one special breakfast offer helped here). Could use a bit more variety for the lunch menu - after 5 lunches we had eaten everything. Maybe a daily special or two - or make the children's menu available to adults in different portions (the macaroni and cheese looked darn good). We had a room in the \"old\" tower on the 7th floor. The view was fabulous and the sound of the ocean was soothing, and there was nothing \"old\" about the room. The only thing that should have been done differently from the beginning is that our room was small with no drawer space, which was fine once extra hangars were delivered. The hotel should realize that without drawers you need a good supply of hangars and should stock the room with them. I should note that the rooms in general are not small at all - we just had a setup where you enter through a hallway (which kept things quiet at night) and then there are two rooms on either side of the hall. The pool area was beautiful and a very pleasant seating area for lunch, but we always sat on the beach. The beach staff was great about setting up chairs and umbrellas for our large group. Great beach for walking on early in the morning - bring shoes and walk back on the sidewalk to see the neighborhood. I would definitely return to La Concha.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "Peter V", "ReviewID": "UR125207457", "Content": "I have stayed at La Concha many times while on business in Puerto Rico.

We has the choice of any hotel but based on reviews and pictures of the hotel decided to stay here. It is hard at this point for me to imagine that these reviews are authentic. The hotel layout and room design is certainly lovely and very convenient.. The junior suite and full suite are large and well appointed. However, there are significant problems at this hotel. Day one -we arrive for check in at the 4pm designated time to be told our room was not ready. and not sure when it would be because they are so full. So we are given a pager (very convenient but this certainly tells you something about this being a usual problem) Didnt have to wait too long and checked into junior suite 305. We were concerned about noise because it is right near the 24hour pool but assured that it would be no problem. Not really the case, and the airconditioner was so noisy going on and off all nite made sleep difficlut. The worst was the smell that started wafting thru our room when we returned at 10pm and it was mildly smokey. The rooms are just abover the exhaust vent from the grill ,Onions and hamburger smell ugh. So we called that nite for room change and and would pay more for a 1 bedroom suite in the tower. They said we could pack our things in a.m go out and they would move us. We returned at 3 and After many calls and trips to front desk with waits in line again we finally got a room at 5:30pm. It is puzzling how long it takes them to see if your room is ready. Finally a manager went to see if the room was ready. It was other than the hair all over the bathroom floor. These things could have been overlooked some but on our last day I got really sick and needed a doctor. They are supposed to have a doctor on call . We called and hotel staff said he would call back in 5 minutes after 20 with no return call we called again only to told he was at a function and couldnt help and we could go to local hospital.(thankful for the wonderful pharmacist at walgreens who helped facillitate us getting a rx from my doctor in the states) No other backup available.from hotel Beach area pretty but understaffed so it is difficult to get a drink cups and junk start littrering the beach by 3.

Why not an excellent review..Only small things...1. the glass enclosed bathroom that can be seen from the bedroom. Not cool to see my sons taking a shower or my sons not being able to go to the balcony while my wife was taking one. 2. with all the space this hotel has they shoud have just a small area(pool area) for those families that do travel with kids.

The Bad: Overpriced for what you get, small pools, crowded pools, lack of pool seating, uncomfortable / creaky bed, mediocre food, extremely slow service by staff (check-in, baggage handlers, waitstaff at poolbar). Although the staff is very courteous and nice, you just can't get over how slow and inefficient everything is at the hotel. I understand people may say relax you're in San Juan, but if they are charging high prices and ask guests to dress in a certain manner at the hotel, then we should expect a certain level of attentiveness. Also, the adult only pool area is SO SMALL, and if it is meant to be adults only, then they should enforce it by not letting any children in that area.

I have done several events in my home town, Miami, and had specific details ...but I want to commend Jessica Rivera and Fabiola Cruz in catering who surpassed my expectations. They are THE most professional, pleasant, creative people who captained their 'crew' for a spectacular party! Both of them communicated with me for months through emails and phone calls, and never did they seem to be bothered by my endless questions. The room they suggested, El Mirador, has incredible sea and city views, and the huge wrap around terrace allowed us to have the cigar roller ( Rafa from the Plaza in OSJ) treat the guests with his organic cigars.! We were greeted with Puerto Rican mojitos, and sampled Greek hor'deuvres... The 100% consensus was that food was FABULOUS! I can go on and on...but space is limited. .. To sum it up...a magical weekend ( ending with my 89 year old mother winning over $700 in the casino!) What a weekend!....Thank you La Concha! ( we all plan a reunion next year!!!!)", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExceptional service\u201d", "Author": "KTBNY", "ReviewID": "UR124639432", "Content": "The staff goes out of its way to provide the best service to La Concha's guests.

We travel a lot, and really spend our time researching what will be the best place to stay while we shut off our phones and forget about the world. For the most part, La Concha did not disappoint. As pointed out in many other reviews, the staff at La Concha is amazing. They are extremely friendly, helpful, and will cater to your needs efficiently and effectively. We had a great experience with all of our waiters, the Concierge, hotel staff, bellhops, and cleaning crew. I even had a great experience communicating with their staff (and getting excited!) on the La Concha Facebook page, which is very rare. I literally cannot say enough about my experience with the staff. The resort itself is also done well, with a beautiful lobby, pool area, well-maintained beach, and great bars and restaurants. We were there for a \"romantic\" vacation, but I could see how this hotel would also be great for groups. As for people with children, it depends on what you're looking for. We are city people, and we expect our children to adapt to their environment, rather than catering to every Disney princess, chicken finger, and kids pool they want. If you're like us, yes, you can bring your kids here. If you expect Pluto to serve your child a Shirley Temple while they're having a tea party with their friends, you might not want to stay here. :-) Something else worth noting about the La Concha....the locals spend a lot of time here, which we love. We hate vacationing where there is a clear divide between local and tourist. It feels unnatural and stuffy. This is not the case at La Concha. Their bar is popular with the locals and we loved how everyone mixed it up every night in the bar, restaurants, and casinos. A lot of our staff had been to the restaurants they recommended (try Marmalade for one of the best meals of your life....try Casa Lola for great food, but be prepared for lousy service), so we really felt like we were getting recommendations on things the locals loved, and not some tourist trap. As for the room and some of the complaints about the noise.....we were in a city-view, one bedroom suite in the newer Ocean Tower (don't get a suite unless you have a large group....we didn't spend a second in the living room part and we felt like the room would've worked much better if they would've flipped the bedroom and living room) and yes, it did get noisy at night being right next to the street. Also, the air conditioner was unbelievably loud, but we got used to it. Like I said before, we're city people, so we're very used to a lot of noise and it actually was great listening to the music, nightlife, and people enjoying themselves. If you need quiet, do not go city view. Personally, I/We loved it. Ok...time to discuss the flaw. It's so unfortunate because up until we \"experienced\" the flaw, we were already planning our next vacation to La Concha. On every level, this is a solid 4 star resort. It's clean, the grounds are well-maintained, and the staff is superb. Why, however, did they purchase a 2-star bed and 2-star linens? My husband and I had three of the worst evenings of sleep we have ever experienced in a hotel. The linens were rough and scratchy (just the sheets....the towels and robes were fine), the pillows were cheap and small, and the bed creaked, moved, and bounced every time we rolled over. We both woke up with backaches every morning and last night, our first night home, we slept for over 10 hours because we were so exhausted. Because of business, my husband and I sleep in hotels a lot and this was by far the worst mattress/sheet/pillow combination we have ever experienced. Unfortunately, we probably will not be back to La Concha unless we hear that they have upgraded their mattresses. And when I write \"unfortunately,\" I truly mean that. The La Concha was an absolutely amazing hotel, but if I come home and feel like I need a visit to the chiropractor, I just can't stay there again. I hope upgraded mattresses are a plan in the near future for La Concha. Other things worth noting: -Try the mini-burgers at the pool restaurant/bar....so good. -The Puerto Rican beer, Medalla Light, is so fantastic. -Marmalade, Marmalade, Marmalade (Yes, I know I already said that, but it's worth nothing again.) -PACK a flashlight. Our friends experienced a blackout (three hours) last year, and we experienced one this trip as well (about an hour and a half). It happens. Be prepared. -FANTASTIC storage space/closet space in the room -Great gym -Loved the London Blackjack/Lucky Lucky table at the Casino", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cFriendliest staff\u201d", "Author": "Chris B", "ReviewID": "UR124565069", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 7 days and had a wonderful time.

The only thing that stands out in my mind was a sliding mirror door that absolutely would not stay on its track, but to be fair, we never called the desk about it, so I'll give them a pass. The hotel was certainly a haven for partying and for the posh crowd, and we really didn't fit either of those descriptions. (Our days mainly consisted of outdoor adventures--OSJ, El Yunque, etc.) Still, the non-food service staff were very nice. If you're big into the club scene, this place is definitely for you, and even if not, don't necessarily pass it up. The beach access, pools, hot tubs, and outdoor furniture were all awesome. The bar service was expensive, but that was completely expected. The food, however, was humdrum for great prices. The only outstanding thing was the sushi, but that's more for another review. The foodservice staff was often unattentive, once going on break for about twenty minutes just as we had finished our meal and were waiting on the check. It's a beautiful hotel in a great location. We won't be coming back--just because there are probably places that suit our tastes and interests better.

I just returned from a five day stay and had a very nice time. Here's what's great about it: 1. The service - extremely helpful and courteous staff from the management to the front desk to the bellman to the waitstaff in the restaurants. To give two examples, I was concerned about the noise after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor since I was traveling with my dad who is not in the best of health. I contacted the hotel's guest services manager and he blocked rooms on higher floors in the back of the hotel so the noise wouldn't be an issue. That made a huge difference. Also, Linette at the front desk booked a rainforest tour to El Yunque for us with a guide who was fantastic. 2. The food - not cheap, but excellent, esp at Voga. 3. The decor - the rooms in the tower have been recently renovated and have a modern-chic vibe to them (white, turquoise, chartreuse) as does the hotel overall. 4. The convenience- to the airport, Old San Juan, the East Coast, not to mention it's within walking distance to lots of restaurants in the neighborhood and a Walgreen's where we got milk, juice and cereal for our breakfasts. Here are some things to think about when choosing this property: 1. It's more for couples than families, at least those with little kids, in my opinion. If you go with small children, you wan't feel out of place and you'll have a good time, i went with my 9 year old and extended family and he loved it. But with all the chic decor, the house music in the hallways and elevator, and the bar/nightclub in the lobby, it's just more for adults. Plus, the pools are small and there isn't one that is super-geared for kids with a cool slide or wading area. 2. The beach is a small strip of urban sand surrounded by high-rises, and it's too dangerous to swim there, anyway. A local person literally begged me not to go swimming there, saying it was much safer further down the beach around the bend. If you are going to PR for the beach, this isn't the property for you. 3. This is a nice property but not a spectacular one (like the St. Regis Monarch Beach in CA or the Ritz in Naples FL, two of my all time fave places). Then again, it's probably 40-50% of the cost of those places so the small trade-offs are worthwhile. Overall, I liked La Concha a lot. There is a lot to recommend it and if you want a few days by the pool with your honey I certainly think this would be a good choice.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice spot right on the beach.\u201d", "Author": "ScPe", "ReviewID": "UR124507298", "Content": "We were able to stay here after getting bumped when the Doubletree was overbooked.

But first, a little background: We are a mid to late 30's couple with three children, ages 14, 9 and 4. I am telling you this because we have not been on a vacation in almost 3.5 years WITHOUT the kids. I love the kids but we needed a getaway to rekindle our relationship. My hubby surprised me with this vacation for my b-day as 2011 was an emotional rollercoaster with the death of my father last July. Needless to say, I was looking forward to LaConcha from the moment I looked it up on tripadvisor and scoured every review...I'm kind of obsessive like that. We stayed from Thursday, 2/2 to Monday, 2/6. I didn't know how this trip was going to go as my luggage had not reached PR by the time we landed. But the airline was able to track it and stated that it would be delivered to our hotel later in the day. Kind of a bummer because that was the suitcase with my swimsuits, etc. in it. NOTE TO SELF: Carry a swimsuit in carryon. Anyway, this was my first time to PR and as we were driving from the airport, I really didn't know what to expect as there are some blighted properties mixed in with high end shops & restaurants on the same blocks, so I had my fingers crossed.... We took a taxi for the 15 min. ride from the airport, which had a flat rate of $16, plus $1 for each suitcase. When we pulled up at the hotel, we were immediately greeted by Felix who had the same upbeat, welcoming personality as described in other reviews. I almost felt assured that this was going to be as good as I have read in other reviews. We left our bag right there with the bellman while we checked in and was told that our bags would be delivered to our room once we got our key. No problem. I took one look at the hotel and was pleased and felt that we made the right choice. The exterior and interior decor of the hotel is very cool, contemporary with white marble, dark wood, white leather furniture and huge red floor vases, and floor to ceiling glass doors which opened to the outdoor gardens. The bar sits right in the center of the lobby and really didn't have much action as it was only about 12:30 in the afternoon. Not cold by any means, just very sophisticted. We booked a Junior Ocean Front Suite in the ocean tower. While I believe the newer tower has a kitchenette, etc. I was not interested as I vowed to not do any type of cooking on this trip! At check-in, we were told that our suite was not available but we could upgrade to a one bedroom ocean front suite for $30/night (which would have normally been a $50/ night upgrade) which was available immediately- I have another thought on this later on in the review. I wanted to wait for the Jr. suite, hubby decided to go with the upgrade...I wasn't going to argue :-) We stayed in room 1001, which was one of the higher floors as I believe there are only 12 floors. The Jr. suite would have been on the same floor as well. Our suite was at the end of the hall, far from the elevator but not too long of a walk. Walking down the corridor to the room, there are several balconies where you can look over into the courtyard where the main swimming pool (with two levels) and the patio and outdoor restaurant were located. Upon entering the suite, I have to admit that I was a llittle underwhelmed. It just looked like a living room with low profile, yet contemporary furniture. The balcony is off of the living area and faces the center courtyard (like the previously mentioned balconies), the side of the hotel which has an open green space and a partial view of the ocean. It had a table with chairs.It was functional to say the least but offered privacy as well. The \"WOW\" moment for me came when I entered the bedroom. The view of the beach and ocean was so magnificient, I am not sure if that is enough to describe it. There were floor to ceiling windows which provided unobstructed views of the clear blue sky and the beautiful blue/green water. The warm ocean air was so inviting, I was seriously contemplating buying a swimsuit from the hotel store. You could also see Perla restaurant and the infinity pool from my window. You could just see water and beach for miles and miles. The rooms were airy and clean. The bathroom was small with shower only, but it was rain shower so who could be mad. Aveda products and plenty of towels on hand although they neglected to leave any wash cloths. They were delivered right away, along with extra pillows as requested. VACATION MODE turned ON. We decided to use this as an opportunity to explore the property and surrounding area, and to grab something to eat as we were famished by this point. Back down to lobby, we went and checked out the business center located in the newer tower. The exit to the adults swimming area and entry to beach is located next to business center. The hotel has lemonade on hand at various stations throughout the hotel for your pleasure. The adult pool, which is also the infinty pool was empty, I assume because there wasn't much sun out on this side of the hotel. The fitness center was over this way too. We visited the lush garden area which seemed to be lively as it had the main pool in the center, and Solera (the outdoor restaurant), plenty of lounge chairs and music. We decided to eat across the street at the Cafe de Angel on a recommendation from one of the bellmen, since we had no change of clothes yet. DO NOT EAT HERE. I have no other description than to say it SUCKED and was expensive. The service was OK but for two entrees, a shared appetizer and a pina colada + tax was $80 w/o gratuity. The food was mediocre at best. Should have ate at Solera. We walked down Ashford to the Walgreens (2 blocks) to get some water, snacks, etc. for our room. It is a mini grocery store where you can pick up liquor, toiletries, snacks, etc. Our luggage finally arrived later in the evening but we decided to stay close to hotel as it had been a long day. The beds are not extremely comfortable but was fresh and had nice linens. Next day, everything was great. Woke up early to hit the beach, not too crowded, ate an early lunch on the beach as the Solera restaurant services the beach. The food was great and service was fast and efficient. For this meal, burger and fries, grilled chicken sandwich and fries, 2 frozen drinks = $60 including tax and gratuity. We walked down the beach and couldn't help but notice a few abandoned hotels along the beach. The sand on this beach feels like cornmeal and in some areas there is a lot of seaweed. We went in around 2 p.m. to get ready to head to Old San Juan. We took a cab which cost about $12 + tip. If it were earlier in the day, we would have tried the bus for 75 cents. Old San Juan was by far one of my favorite times in PR. The cobblestone streets are narrow and all of the buildings are are close together. The character and flair of Old San Juan cannot be measured and is unlike anywhere I have been. The shop owners were friendly and I found a great shop called Unique Stop which has a wide variety of jewelry, handbags, etc. from authentic Puerto Rican artisans to mainstream designers such as Kendra Scott, etc. There is also a Marshalls, Burger King, for some chain action. Walked along the water near the Port Authority and had some great ice cream which was delicious!!!!!! Sorry can't think of the name. We had been referred to a restaurant, J-Taste, by my father in law, and we happened to stumble upon it just as it was beginning to rain. It is a Japanese restaurant with a very modern decor. We decided to sit at the bar, as we were going to just grab a couple of drinks. The bartender, Donny and the waiter who spoke great English, were awesome. We had such a good time there. It was kind of empty when we first got there but started filling up after a while. You must try this restaurant. One side is hibachi style, the back has a raw sushi bar and the rest of the restaurant has booth or table and chairs. The red and blue lighting really helped with the cool vibe/mood. We ordered off of the appetizer menu and everything we has was wonderful: sushi, shrimp tempura and teriyaki shrimp/chicken skewers. It was really relaxing and we could have sat there all night. They called a cab for us but he charged $16 to take us back. When we mentioned that it was a different amount than going, he stated that he had to charge more bc they have to \"pay for the call\" which I guess meant they have to pay the cab company. When we arrived back at the hotel, the lobby was buzzing with music and people were dressed at the bar. We went upstairs and got dressed to join the party. I have to admit we looked darn good! I don't think I have dressed for a club in about 7 to 10 years. The lobby was sexy... We needed a snack so we went out to the Solera to order appetizers but was instructed that someone inside should have taken our order. When I told the waiter that no one approached us while we were sitting in the lobby (as we had gotten our drinks from the bar), he was nice enough to find someone to take our order. There is a tapas menu available until 1 a.m. The mahi mahi was great. The fried crab bites...not so much. The waitress inside seemed preoccupied or overwhelmed, not sure which but her service was a bit lacking. We did a lot of people watching as this hotel seems to be the place to be for locals and guests of other hotels. If there was one area of improvement would be the DJ and music selection...seriously the techno, Jersey shore fist-pumping music gets old quick. They need to add some variety as the guests are diverse!!!!!!!!!! We lasted as long as we could but again, we are not club goers and I was trying desperately not yawn. Off to bed for these old-timers.... Next day we were beach bums. We ate at Voga for the buffet breakfast @ $25 pp. It was a pretty good buffet, with fresh fruit, pastries, regular breakfast buffet food, omelet station, waffle/pancacke station. We were a little perturbed by the following. My husband doesn't eat pork which is what was offered on the buffet (i.e. pork sausage, pork bacon). We asked if there were any turkey products avaialble. The waitress said sure, they just didn't put it out but asked what we would like. He asked for turkey sausage. We thought this was included in the buffet charge. WRONG. When the check came, it was almost $7 for the turkey sausage. I mentioned it to the woman who brought us the bill (I can't say waitress bc we got everything ourselves, including juices, etc). The original bill she submitted was $50 something. I gave my credit card but when she brought the authorization for signature, it was higher than the original bill. Only after I questioned her did she tell me it was bc of the turkey sausage.The authorization slip was not detailed to show what had been added. They did remove the charge after slight hesitation on their part. We laid out on the beach for the better part of the day and later walked down Ashford to some of shops...Nice relaxing day....did stop in the lobby for drinks and tapas but finished our night in our room. Next day...up early bc I wanted to hit Old San Juan again to get some gifts and souvenirs. The night before was uncomfortable as the themometer rattled and clicked on and off. Called front desk, the problem was addressed and it needed to be replaced. After expressing our discontent, management comped half our room charge for the night and the upgrade fees for two nights and offered breakfast. What more could you ask? The management and service was always prompt to responding to any issues. Everything is not always going to be right but the response is what is important. We tried to wait for the bus to Old San Juan but a cab offered to take us for $3 pp, so we took it. I picked up everything I wanted to get and went to the Pier to catch the ferry over to the Bacardi Tour. This is something you can do yourself. Please don't fall for the the excursion tours which charge $55 pp. for this tour. The Bacardi Tour is free and the ferry is $1.00 roundtrip. The only weird part is that once you get off the ferry to go to the Bacardi Tour, there are no directions or signs posted as to what to do next. I thought we were there. WRONG. As a group of my fellow ferry passengers and my hubby and I wandered around looking like lost tourist, this old guy was pointing at us and yelling for us to follow him to Bacardi. He led us to a garage where there were three passenger vans and other taxis which take people to the Bacardi estate for $3 pp. This area was a bit seedy so I was constantly looking over my shoulder and cautious. Anyway, once we arrived at Bacardi, it was like entering a whole new land. It felt tropical with palm trees, lush gardens, etc. You are given two free drink vouchers and a bar is right there in an open pavilion. Beautiful, well kept grounds. There is an English speaking tour and a Spanish speaking tour and run alternatively about every 30 min. This tour was nice as it did not last for more than an hour or so. TIP: Be sure to eat before going on the tour as you will not want to drink on an empty stomach. Once we got back to OSJ, we ate a full dinner at J-Taste again. Even better than before and the bartender and waiter were happy to see us again. Once we got back to the hotel we had to pack for the next day as we had an early flight. Sunday, however was the Superbowl, and the SB party was packed in the lobby as they had two projection screens and flat screens showing the game. Very festive. We had a wonderful time although there weren't any drink.appetizer specials. We left at half time to retire in our room and finish watching the game. You could here the uproar though once NY won! It was great. HIGHLIGHTS: We found the jacuzzi which is off the beaten path on the upper tier of the swimming pool in the center court. It is covered and hidden by lush plants...very nice for a late night romantic dip...On the first Sunday of the month, there is a PR festival next door where you can purchase some great stuff...the beach and Solera excellent...The staff was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable, although I will let the first night's recommendation slide.....be sure to tip bc everyone will go the extra mile.... MISSTEPS: The bathrooms are small and didn't always feel like they had been cleaned well... There was hardly any Spanish/Island music played during our stay except once there was a live band for a wedding which we happened to catch...the DJ in the lobby needs some variety (then again, I never seen the DJ, so it could have been music being streamed)...the free wifi is choppy in suite...works well in lobby and on beach....not too many kids (not sure if this is good or bad)..felt like the \"your room is not available\" bit at checkin was a gimmick as I observed the same thing a few days later with other guests...the resort fee is almost $50/day.... NEXT TIME: Will try El Yunque Rainforest tour, will spend more time in OSJ..will definitely be back at La Concha.

I must say I was surprised, I have stayed in quite a few hotels and have never gotten such a welcome from the behind the scenes staff.

The location of the hotel is perfect, A bus stop directly outside which has few uses that go into Old San Juan which is a 10 minute ride. The hotel is surrounded by quite a few restaurants if you don't feel like going into the city. There is an awesome Peruvian restaurant one street over, unfortunately I forgot the name. The hotel also has a few restaurants, I enjoyed a few drinks at the hotel bar. The only reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars was due to the following: My room was next to the ice machine so it was noisy. Also, this is a VERY busy hotel so as soon as you enter the lobby be prepared for activity. House keeping did not clear the fridge, so the next morning we discovered leftover items in the fridge. They did clear it out promptly, and when we came back we found a bottle of red wine, with a note of heartfelt apologies in the room.

Upon arrival, the striking lobby and overall liveliness of La Concha was a feast for the senses and we knew we had made the right choice in staying over in this beautiful city. Check in was quick and we dashed up to the room to drop off luggage and check out the ocean view. High ceilings, tile and glass shower, and modern white leather (?) furniture (along with LARGE closets on either side of a dresser/valet) gave the room a sleek feel. The only disappointment was the \"balcony.\" We pulled back the sliding door to expose about six inches of overhanging cement. Though we had a beautiful view of the pool and ocean, there was no way to utilize the balcony itself. Since we were only staying for one night, we decided to explore the grounds and grab a few drinks. The lobby was excellent for people watching and lounging about. The drinks were somewhat on the pricy side, which is of course to be expected at such a place, but well made. The Mojitos were excellent. After dinner at a local place and then a few more drinks, we retired to our room. The bed was very comfortable--not too soft or too hard. Room darkening shades kept the early morning sun out of our room while we snoozed and the rain-like shower head left us refreshed and ready for our day of exploration in PR. Check out was not as smooth as other hotels, but I believe this was simply an oversight. Although La Concha does allow for self-check out, someone neglected to leave us the bill under the door. A quick stop at the front desk took care of that and the extremely friendly concierge helps us plan a great day in Guatave (GO THERE!). Overall this was an excellent stay.

We did not stay long and did not have time to take advantage of the restaurants, but the place was very nice and the beach was great. It's also an easy close cab right to the Old San Juan.

Keep in mind that although these hotels on Condado say ocean front - the beach experience is best felt at one of the other beaches toward Fajaro. My husband was kind enough to summarize our review as follows: Pros: -------- * Excellent pi\u00c3\u00b1a colada served at poolside. * The ocean front suites in the ALL SUITES BLDG offer an amazing 180 degree ocean view from the ocean facing balcony. * Main pool area offers nice setting for outdoor eats & drinks. Day & night. * Nice casino downstairs (for those who like to gamble). * Complimentary plate of tortilla chips + guacamole, salsa, & sour cream was brought to our suite on 2nd day in the afternoon. We discovered this upon return to our room. No note was left and one must be careful with eating sour cream once away from refrigeration, but a nice gesture nonetheless. Cons: -------- * Although we booked an ocean front suite with balcony, we received a suite with glass window (and dirty) facing the ocean on 4th floor in older building. The non-bedroom suite portion was in back and faced a parking lot. There was a balcony, but it too was in back with views of the parking lot, a satellite dish, and a little ocean. * We requested another room, but were told that we would have to wait until the next day as all was booked. We did not need the suite portion. We just wanted the ocean view balcony and a higher room. No attempt was made to try and accommodate us. We would have gladly downgraded from a suite, but either they did not know how to do that or did not want to loose on the revenue. * Shortly after checking in (and long flight and room disatisfaction), we went down to the pool area to order some drinks and eats. No waiter ever came by our seating area. I finally walked over to the grill area and one of the staff said they were sending a waiter over right away. Waited another 10 minutes, but no one ever came to serve on us. We ended up walking out of the hotel and settled for something elsewhere. * On our 2nd morning we decided to eat at the breakfast Buffett. Upon arrival, we asked to be seated in the outside portion of the restaurant. The hostess gave us a little bit of a strange look and said she would have to check if it's ok. She returned to say that it was ok and seated us. Once seated, we counted at least 10 unoccupied tables outside (& 3-4 occupied) so we were puzzled as to why the big production. * There are very aggressive pigeons at the restaurant (outdoor portion) who come to your table and eat your food (if left unattended). So can't all get up at once to go to Buffett. Apparently, hotel has not figured out a solution to this * On our final night we phoned reception to ask for a late checkout (2pm instead of 12noon) as our flight was not until 4pm. We were told to check back the next day as this is \"subject to availability\". Upon checking back the following morning, we were told that no more late checkouts are being issued and that we would have had to ask for it early in the morning. Of course thats not what we were told when we asked the previous evening. I asked again for some extra time, perhaps 1:30 instead. After a lengthy phone conversation with someone else on the staff the hotel clerk agreed to a 1pm checkout. As a related side note, we spent $1400 on a 3-night suite stay + $200 incidentals and were asking for 2 extra hours to check out (with still ample time to prepare the room for the next guest check-in).", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, California", "Title": "\u201ctrendy hotel by the sea with bad service\u201d", "Author": "givemesunshine", "ReviewID": "UR123606098", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in early January for three nights. I have traveled to over 90 countries, but have never seen worst check in line than at this hotel. The line to check in took 20 minutes during the first week of January. I shudder to think how long the line is during peak times. The hotel looks trendy and hip. It reminded me of South Beach in Miami. The vibe is young with most of the guests in their 20's and the furniture is knock offs of Modern Classics like Saarinen. The room was not ready until 4 p.m. I was pleased with the size of our room. It was an apartment with a full size kitchen, sitting room, bathroom, balcony and bedroom. The kitchen was fully equipped and you could basically cook all your meals there. A small grocery store was a few blocks away as well as Walgreen's with a small food department. The hotel is on a beach and has a small heated infinity pool by the beachside. They would not let anyone under 15 to use the pool, which would be devastating for people with small kids. The pool was almost like a hot tub. The biggest problem we had was no maid service. After spending the whole day at the beach with the \"please make the room\" sign hanging outside our door nobody had cleaned the room by 4.30 p.m. Just when I hopped in the shower the maid came and left and said she would be back at 5 p.m. She never returned. We started calling for a maid service at 8 p.m. After several phone calls and talking to the night manager a surly reluctant maid showed up at nine. She took her time cleaning the room and left at 9.45 p.m. She made the beds and cleaned the bathroom, but did not wipe the kitchen table that was dirty. I would have cleaned it myself,but there was no cleaning supplies. I had to go and get clean towels and supplies from the maid's carts subsequent days. I guess the young clientele does not mind this kind of bad service. There were some large groups of college swim teams who were staying at the property at the time. I am giving four stars to the hotel for its location and overall look and amenities. I would give zero stars for service. The hotel is about one hour walk from Old town San Juan (3-4 miles) a cab is $15. Outside the hotel there are several low end restaurants like Wendy's and expensive stores like Louis Vuitton.

Make sure you eat the breakfast buffet, amazing fruit, fruit smoothies, pastries and the usual hot breakfast foods. There are three restaurants: An Italian. My friend and I had two specialty pizzas that were very good. One is probably enough for two people with small to medium appetites. I'm not sure why they chose an Italian restaurant, I would have liked more local foods. There is the grill by the pool that makes burgers and the like. We only ordered drinks there but although the tropical drinks were delicious they were a bit skimpy with the alcohol. The third restaurant is a seafood restaurant located within the La Concha structure. We plan to eat there tonight! There is a small cocktail bar at the beach and waiter service as well. Beach lounges are plentiful. All in all this is a very relaxed atmosphere until the band starts in the evening. Other notes: the outdoor hot tub was too hot at 107 degrees. There is only one shop, if you like to shop hotel boutiques you are out of luck, but this one has the necessities and a bit more. I think $10 is reasonable for a mixed drink at a nice resort.

I was a bit worried by some of the previous reviews, but this hotel was great to us. I am a Platinum Premier member with Marriott Rewards if that matters to you. (I always like to look for and read reviews by fellow road warriors.) I would imagine that your experience will vary a bit depending on the room type reserved and the occupancy of this hotel during your stay. As always, I will break my review down by the various areas of the hotel that we used. Check In: We arrived around 9:45pm, and we were immediately welcomed to the hotel. We were not given an upgrade in advance of arrival, but we were offered an upgrade at check in. We elected to pay for an upgrade to an oceanview suite in the suites tower, since we wanted a full ocean view. It was well worth the money. Check in was quick and we were on the way to our room. Rooms: There are at least two different towers within this hotel. The suites tower is the newest portion of the hotel, and what my review is based on. Our room had a living room, nice bathroom, standard Marriott bedroom, and a balcony overlooking the ocean. The Aveda products at Renaissance hotels are always a nice touch. Housekeeping did a nice job. The only negative to the room was the frosted glass in the shower overlooking the bedroom. It's great if you are staying with a significant other, but it would be awkward if you were with a friend/family member. The bed was also a bit worn--one side of the bed sloped down a bit, but was still comfortable with lots of pillows. Pools: The pools are a bit small, and only one of them is heated. The heated pool was the one that I liked the most. If the other pools were heated, they would be great as well. There are two hot tubs, I believe, but they looked small. If you need a hot tub, pay for the suite that has a hot tub on the deck. Ocean: The ocean is also nice, although it was pretty cold during our stay. However, there were lots of people determined to swim in it regardless of temperature! There is a rock wall to block some of the waves, and there is a little walkway at the top of the rocks that you can walk on. Works well for pictures if it isn't windy. Food: We ate at the Italian restaurant, which has excellent food. Service was on island time, but when the food arrived, it was very good. We also ate at Solera, the poolside restaurant several times. Our first waiter, Brock, overheard that my wife was sick from traveling. He immediately made her a non-alcoholic drink that made her feel 100% better, in addition to serving some delicious lunch food. Our other experiences were also good. Note that the chips and guacamole are actually vegetable chips of some sort, so if you are a picky eater like me, you probably won't like them. If you are a foodie, you will probably love them. Lounge: The club lounge at this hotel is amazing. The dinner/dessert spreads were tasty, and the staff were super helpful/friendly. It was constantly busy, so there must be a lot of Marriott Rewards fans that stay at this hotel. Casino: The casino was a decent size, and is attached to the hotel. Tip: If you like playing in the casino, you can get some free match play certificates at the hotel front desk. They have a few London Deal/Rummy Blackjack tables, one regular blackjack table, craps, roulette and slots. If you are going to play, sign up for their rewards card so you can earn comps. And take advantage of the fact that they serve tasty sandwiches for free at night, and Dunkin Donuts in the morning. Overall: We had a great stay at La Concha.

Drinks were top price but that's how it is at all Caribbean resorts that we have been to. We booked a room in the suite tower that had two beds, a kitchen area with microwave, Mini fridge, sink and two burner stove. There was also a seperate living room and nice bathroom. There were two nice flat screen tvs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The room was very spacious for the three of us. There was a hallway area with a large double sliding glass door closet that provided extra mirror area for us to get ready. We had a balcony which over looked Ashford Ave., which was a change for us from the usual ocean or pool view. But it was interesting needless to say. It was kind of noisy at night time especially on Fri and Sat nights but I just left the airconditioning fan run constantly and that would cover up most of the noise. The bedroom was a bit small for two beds but we managed just fine and after the first night my husband and I decided that our mattress was awful and sunken in. We just called the front desk in the morning and within 30 min. we had a new mattress and box spring. Very nice service! Our room was cleaned everyday although I felt that she could have done a better job cleaning especially the floors but I admit that I am very fussy. We used the workout room almost every day and found it to be large and adequate. We mainly layed out at the main pool area and were usually able to find chairs but normally put towels on them earlier to guarentee that we got the area that we wanted. We never used the two smaller pools facing the ocean because they were always totally shaded the whole afternoon. The beach was nice and you could walk quite a ways down past other hotels. The waves were very large and we got to see some surfers and lots of boogie boarders. It would have been nice to have some music playing near the pool area but all in all it was very nice. For some reason we were given access to the preferred lounge which was a nice little extra that we hadn't counted on. They had a nice breakfast every morning, late afternoon snacks and evening time desserts. We had dinner at the Perla restaurant which was excellent. Beautiful lighting and atmosphere.

It was a nice location. There was bakery within walking distance where we had our cafe con leche, and a top notch breakfast. Ask the parking attendants and they'll tell you. The employees were very nice!! We were without a phone however for 24 hours, which was a major problem. We had family members staying at the hotel, and we had to go to their room to speak with them. We also received no shampoo, and had to go down to the lobby, and when it was time to go to sleep, we realized we needed another pillow and had to go down again--and we were on the 11th floor. Each time we went down we were told that someone would be at our room right away to fix the phone--but it never happened. The employees were really nice though. We did get a discount in the end, but I made sure that we got a printed copy showing the discount--because I had learned that they say \"yes, we're going to do this...\" so sweetly, but their words didn't lead to action, and I knew I might not get that discount if I didn't ask for a printed copy of my hotel bill at the moment they said they would give me one. The hotel is nice, but the pictures look nicer than the hotel really is. I was surprised by the small pools. The pictures make the pools look bigger and classier than they are. The water in the pool was colder than the water in the ocean. We were surprised by that. The air temperature was warm, humid in late December. You had beautiful island breezes. Walgreens Pharmacy was a few blocks down the street. We purchased postcards, toiletries, water, souvenirs--t-shirts, and a man's swimsuit--all at very good prices. We tried the fitness facility which was free and you could watch a few cable tv channels on the ellipticals and bicycles. We ate at the italian restaurant which stated that they had a 3 course meal for a fixed price if you ate before a certain time. When we got there, we discovered that they only had 2 entrees you could choose from for this price, and their advertisement was quite misleading. We were not able to have the pri-fixed dinner. I ordered chicken piccatta, which came with no capers?!? When I explained to our waitress that I was used to having capers in my piccata, she brought me a small bowl full. The meal was not memorable for anyone in our family of four. The bread they brought was the highlight. Our server Joann was very nice. The hotel room was big with 2 queen beds. It was very clean. I believe that all the rooms overlook the ocean. The television was large and they had a music system. The bathroom had frosted glass instead of walls which can be odd for families with teens. Being close to Christmas there were parties outside on the street. Many drivers like to honk their horn, and I unfortunately heard them. I was awakened the first night thinking that the fire alarm was going off at the hotel. My family snored on unaffected. We felt the place was an average hotel, not really a resort. It was definitely overpriced!!! It was a short ride from the airport--about 10 or 15 minutes. It cost about $16.75 (increase due to gas prices), plus an additional dollar for luggage. All the cabbies were nice. Overall, I would not return to the Concha unless I couldn't find another accommodation. It really wasn't worth the price we paid. I would prefer staying in a resort if I am paying resort prices. Reading this review, I realized that what I would return for was the bakery, not the hotel.

For example, because I was arriving early in the day I booked my room for the night before. To my surprise, my room was not ready upon arrival, and the concierge Alexandra looks me in the face and lies to me saying that because I was classified by the computer as a 'no show' my reservation had been cancelled so how could they be held responsible for preparing a room that wasn't booked. What!?! When I spoke to the manager about this, she caught Alexandra in her lie and things got sorted out. Another example of the nightmare of La Concha is the behavior of Reymundo the Assistant Manager at Voga Restaurant (which by the way is fabulous). My daughter and I orderer lunch at Solera (the outdoor restaurant) and told the waiter we had only 1 hour to eat. Our meal had not come in 45 minutes (a salad and a wrap!), so we cancelled our meal and had to check out. At the check out desk, I was asked how everything had been, and I told the reception person about our lunch. Reymundo came to me and said when I came back to the hotel (in 1 week after our cruise), I would eat for free the entire week no matter if it were in the hotel's restaurants or room service. When I returned, I realized that this was a lie as well. What is up with this staff? The Head Concierge Louise took 8 hours to find a vase for my flowers and when I asked about this she said that she thought the clients had been stealing the vases so they couldn't find one for me! What?!? It was like this the whole week and I will never ever stay here again, as there are many better hotels on the Condado. However, if you are looking for great service, get Kenneth the server in Perla a fabulous hotel restaurant, or get Alfredo in the Voga restaurant. The casino is fine and the shopping across the street from the hotel is great. The beach is nice and the attendants there are helpful. The gym is small but ok. Go somewhere else if you want service.

We arrived at the hotel property after a late night flight -- after a full day at work and traveling for several hours, we were looking forward to checking in as quickly as possible and getting a good night's rest. Upon settling into the room, we pulled back the covers to the bed and found hairs in the sheets, strongly suggesting that the sheets were not properly changed prior to our arrival. We travel relatively frequently for work and leisure so we've become accustomed to an inconvenience here and there and you hope that a property's management will work with it's guests to quickly resolve any concerns or issues. Unfortunately, this was not our experience at La Concha. We had to place three calls to the front desk to have the room serviced and the sheets changed, taking approximately 45 minutes for someone to be sent up. This was a significant disappointment as you would expect that the hotel's team would want to make a good first impression and the request under the circumstances was far from unreasonable. As we waited for the sheets to be changed, we took a closer look at the room and as noted in other reviews, there appears to be a lack of attention to the cleanliness of the rooms (debris/dirt in the drawers, a torn curtain, grime and dirt on the room phones, stains and stickiness on some of the surfaces where spills were not properly cleaned, etc.). Wear and tear is to be expected in any hotel room, but a commitment to cleanliness should not be a point of compromise for guests. The guest services book touts the property's \"delighted to serve\" philosophy. Unfortunately, on the very first night of my family's stay, they fell well below the standard that their motto suggests.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel & very modern\u201d", "Author": "LisaNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR123020184", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights in the suite tower and had a great time. The hotel is beautiful, very modern and clean. The lobby has waterfalls and feather trees, very upscale. I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating but I found a few things that I was unhappy about. They have 4 pools, 2 of them which no one is ever in I think because of the way the hotel is designed that the 2 pools are always in the shade. During my 6 days I never saw anyone in them nor did I see any sun in those pool areas. The other 2 pools are very close together. In fact if you walk out of one pool all you have to do is walk up a few steps and you'll be in the other one. One of the major problems I had with the pool area is that the chairs are so close to each other and I mean very close. At one point some guys foot was on my chair! The chairs are up against each other. Not sure why they do this....they also have a restaurant and tables and chairs right near the pool area where you can have lunch so that was pretty cool. Another thing that's pretty strange was that if you stay in the suite tower and you come out to the beach area, you walk on about 100 yards of sand that is totally unused - again I think because the way the hotel is designed, this area gets no sun at all. After you walk that distance you will a bunch of chairs that are jammed together so everyone is on top of each other once again. The cabana guys are very quick to pull in your beach chair if you're not occupying it. There was one time where we asked for 2 chairs and an umbrella and after a quick dip in the pool our umbrella was gone. We asked what happened and the response was something like he was all alone and busy and had to start clearing the beach. Another time some guy came back to find his chair gone and his stuff laying in the sand! The minute someone leaves their chairs they quickly pull them in and stack them and I figured out why. If they leave the chairs they get no tip if someone comes on the beach and uses them but if they pull them in and have to bring them out most likely they get tipped. I didn't like this at all. The other issue I had was with the room. For some reason and I don't know why they design them this way but the bathroom wall that faces the bedroom is made out of see through frosted glass where if you're in the bedroom you can see someone taking a shower. So if you're not going witha significant other this may be a problem for some people. Otherwise the rooms are beautiful and very modern.

I purchased a damp-rid at the nearby Walgreen's and that eliminated the dampness and its accompanying smell.

There is also on-site guest laundry facilites that came in quite handy during my three week stay. Finally, the restaurants. Yum, yum, yum. The Italian restaurant was a staple for me. I had their lasagna modified to be made with vegetables and it was superb. La Perla restaurant was exquisite. Overall, a centrally located beautiful property. Downsides: the lobby has a very South Beach, party all the time feel. Great when you are on vacation, just depressing when you are there for work.

Excellent service all around, from the friendly valets to the timely housekeeping, to the kids on the beach who drag the loungers around, to the waitresses and bartenders. Rooms are bigger than we thought they would be. Even though we were on a low floor (3rd), and even though we could smell the hamburger grill exhaust from below, we had a view of the famous shell and the ocean out our window. Bathroom was spacious, mildew free and plenty of space to store toiletries. Closet space was also excellent. Love the decor in the lobby. Minor complaints: 1. Elite Rewards lounge closed for Christmas week. That was kind of mean IMHO, and the first time we've encountered such a policy at a Marriott property. 2. Good housekeeping, but I don't understand why they took my hotel robe away halfway through my visit and never gave me another one. 3. They hide the bathroom mat under a pile of towels, so before you waste a bath towel like we did, look for it. 4. Our sofabed was too broken to be fixed, so our daughter slept on the made up sofa itself instead, also one funky lamp was completely broken with exposed wires - dangerous but easily remedied (we unplugged it). **Note to hotel management** We are in the tropics, and your a/c works OK, but why on earth did we have to suffer under down comforters???? Too hot at night for sure, even with the a/c cranked as far down as it would go. Why not use a cotton duvet instead? Or layers? I did not sleep well any night because of this - with the comforter off, too cold, with it on, too hot. Re: dining - we ate at Solera grill - very good tapas, fun atmosphere, good cocktails. We ate once at Voga for breakfast buffet - excellent but pricey ($26/pp). We ate at Perla TWICE because it was so excellent. It was a nice break from all things fried or rice and I thought they did a good job of combining the local with the international. Get a window table for sure, you can see the waves even at night. Lovely atmosphere inside too, excellent table service. And the wine list is so long they bring it to you on an iPad. It was the only place on the whole island where we could find caribbean lobster on the menu (and it was excellent). If you rent a car, it will cost $20/night to valet park it, but you have no choice in the Condado district, no street parking anywhere. Worth it, as many ins and outs as you want. The pool scene - not our cup of tea, I don't travel all that way to sit by a pool, I want my toes in the sand, but for those who are into that sort of thing, to me it looked overcrowded and competitive. People were laying out towels by 7:30am to reserve loungers and there must have been some kind of brawl over it because after a few days the towel handler told me not to use towels to reserve poolside seats (which I pointed out never applies to me anyway, but would have loved to witness that cat fight!). Also, for New Years Eve they were closing down the whole pool area at 2pm to prep for that night, so the beach was extra-crowded that day. The beach - is on the Atlantic, the waves are VERY rough, no lifeguards. The beach itself is nice, but I think they should store the loungers further back or off to 1 side - the towers of them block the view for people not sitting right by the water. Good amount of palm trees on the beach (fyi all PR beaches are public, so leave your wallet in the room), very breezy and they do have beach waiters if you want a pi\u00c3\u00b1a colada without getting it yourself. There is a big park next door, looks like they hold a lot of free concerts there, so next time I'd look into that. Overall, we thought this was one of the most organized, clean, pretty resorts in the whole Marriott chain. That being said I think if we return to PR we'd look to be in Aguadilla because the beaches are so much better. And since we stayed for free, I have no idea if it is worth cost.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cGirls Weekend!\u201d", "Author": "Brittany O", "ReviewID": "UR122463678", "Content": "My girlfriends and I travel at least once every year and PR was calling our name.

A little crowded but nice and had waiter service. Readily available chairs and towels. had lemon water available to avoid dehydration. Pool: Didn't use the main pool.

Gym: Excellent with a decent amount of machines and ocean view. Restaurants: Didn't eat at the conch shell restaurant. Fair in quality. Nothing amazing. good for snacks or to eat if you didn't have much time. Central bar was good to get a drink while waiting to go out and explore.

The room was clean, spacious, and I hate to repeat myself, but beautiful! Decorated with white and subtle aqua colors, it gives the room the vibe of your own oasis. The only issue I found with the room was that the safe had a big screw right in the middle of the safe, so you can't really put big items, like a laptop or iPad. I called front desk and they 'sent' an engineer to the room, but after 20mns of waiting, I called again to cancel it. It wasn't fair for me to wait that long since my time was very limited! I wanted to go out! Another plus of the location, there are ALWAYS taxis outside the hotel. Working at the valet and greeting people is Felix, and like some reviewers have mentioned, he is THE nicest guy in the hotel; not the managers, not the front desks gals, it is Felix. A ride to the mall or Old San Juan is $15. Not too bad, considering there's always traffic.

But twice it happened to me that I slept in and left a little late from the room, and when I leave I switch the hangtag to maid service.

But at the second time, I definitely requested service. I think the managers need to take a look at how that is done, because I'm sure many people would like to sleep in at some point during their vacation, right?

My review will be prior to the storm: Room: I had an ocean view room and the view was awesome! Some previous reviews mention requesting an ocean view and/or pool and I concur (if views mean alot to you). Looking around the landscape that surrounds the hotel..I couldn't imagine what kind of views you may have otherwise. Beach: is nice, water (color) was not as dark blue as some have stated, neither is the sand full of rocks or ocean rocky. Plenty of seating at the beach and pool & they really insist on placing your chair and umbrella down for you. Which was fine..as long as there was not a wait. However, the hotel should consider getting more staff to assist with that area. Service on the beach was slow, but food and drinks were not too far away. The new suites have an infinity pool which was really nice and less busy. Supposedly all adults only, and staff tried their best in that area. Food: I only ate the Breakfast buffet once (due to the storm) and it wasn't bad. Typical buffet food. I did ask for restaurant suggestions from the concierge and the most awesome bell guys (I've drawn a blank to their names)..but they were the most courteous out of the hotel staff. I also tried some of the best rated restaurants from TA. Try--LaPerla, if you want to dine and see the beach. Very nice!

We chose this place because we heard it was a little \"younger\" and \"hipper\" than some of the other hotels around. We were incredibly pleased with the choice. Rooms in the tower are accessed through open-air hallways and have ridiculous views of the ocean (I've never seen the ocean be that close to a room view--usually the ocean is a little ways off). The room was impeccably clean and well-appointed with Aveda bath products. The shower is styled in a \"modern chic\" with only half of a glass door, so when you turn it on, water does get outside of the shower area a little bit, but it was no big deal since the shower itself was great (both a rain-shower head and a hand-held with great pressure). Our room was cleaned twice a day. One thing that was strange was that, despite the awesome view, there was no balcony. There is about a two-foot space where you can squeeze outside to see the view from your room, but that's it. There are a variety of restaurants and bars on the property and each one is truly excellent. We went to La Perle (the clam-shaped restaurant the hotel is famous for) and it was both beautiful and amazing (me and my friend are both from Manhattan where we are used to going to high-end celebrity chef restaurants on a weekly basis, and we both agreed that La Perle makes it to our Top Ten Best Restaurants we've eaten at; but even if you are not a foodie, you should go just to see the gorgeous room). The pools were great and there weren't any screaming kids when we were there. The one facing the ocean was often in shadows so we mostly sat by the pools on the inner courtyard. What really sets this place apart though is the service. Everyone from concierge, to towel service, to doormen, to security went above and beyond, almost to a point where it was silly how incredibly nice they were. One time, we wanted to use the jacuzzi at night (pools are open 24hrs!) but there had been a cocktail reception earlier in the evening so the heat had been turned off. We asked a hotel associate if there was another jacuzzi somewhere we could use. He could have just said \"no, sorry,\" but instead, he called up the building management on his walkie-talkie and asked them to come down and turn on both jacuzzis, then he assured me and my friend they would be ready to use in 20 minutes, then he found us at another part of the hotel specifically to come tell us that the jacuzzi was ready, and even later, once we were in the jacuzzi, he came back to ask how it was and if everything was okay and to apologize profusely that they weren't on to begin with.

I stayed at the La Concha instead of the Marriot this trip because the new lobby at the Marriot was still not opened after being renovated. Do not get me wrong, we were very happy staying at the La Concha, but we thought the lobby would have some live music and dancing, at least a DJ.

I did think there would be a DJ or music to dance to for all.

As a frequent traveler and Gold member of Marriott, I have access to the concierge lounge. Normally these lounges have decent appetizers in the evening and nice, healthy and appetizing choices for breakfast. This was not the case with the La Concha. The evening appetizers seemed to be of the cheapest frozen variety, or they were just down right awful. The breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs that were far too salty to eat, or a \"cream of wheat\" type cereal that was so overly sweeten that it was impossible to eat. The food at the restaurants was little better, and was expensive to boot. To top this off, the hotel added a 29.50 per day \"resort charge\" that is not advertised in it's prices when making the reservation. They would not remove this charge, but I will take it up with Marriott headquarters as I feel this is a deceptive practice with which a reputable business would not want to be associated.

You can imagine that our expectations were high and unfortunately we were left disappointed; especially since we sincerely wanted to like this hotel. Pros: - Fantastic location adjacent to the beach and within walking distance of many restaurants - The ocean view from our 9th floor room - The largest of the three pools was quite nice - The lobby was trendy and clean - The bell boys and service staff (with the exception of the pool staff) was very kind and friendly - When we had concerns about our room they were promptly addressed - Our room was available for an early check-in Cons: - Upon arrival our bed sheets had a large circular orange stain - Upon arrival our shower drain was completely clogged and nearly flooded the room - The closet doors in the room could not slide out without bashing into the dresser handles next to them. From the significant wear on the furniture it was clear that this had been a long standing issue. - The room was generally beginning to show it's wear - The original tower has balcony like areas in the corridors where one in theory could step out and take in the views of the city. Except it rained significant amounts nightly and not once during our stay was the water mopped. I didn't notice the first day and nearly slipped. - The literature in our room was very limited - no explanation of the spa services or a menu list of the different restaurants on the premises - The cabana beds were never once attended to during our visit - consequently they were not only dirty but had puddles of water on them from the overnight rain - The staff at the pool side restaurant was inattentive and rude - they never came by to take our order so I approached a group of them having a casual conversation. They then said \"YES!?!?\" as though I had interrupted them. - The area surrounding the ocean view pools was dirty. Pretty well all the beach loungers were dirty and again there were puddles galore. - The beach was completely unmaintained - in fact the seaweed wasn't raked (I could understand if they were going for a natural look) and it was totally full of garbage (unforgivable) - The beach loungers were completely disorderly - strewn about at will I have to say by far the most disappointing part of the hotel was the deplorable conditions of the area around the ocean. Let me put it to you this way, adjacent to the hotel there was a public beach. That one was raked and cleaned every morning. There was a noticeable difference between that area and the much less pleasant area in front of La Concha. To the credit of the hotel - during our stay we noticed there were what appeared to be visiting Marriott bosses inspecting the property. We saw them pointing out numerous flaws and giving instructions as to how the hotel should be run. Then on the morning we were leaving we saw the beach being cleaned. The bottom line is that this hotel could be fantastic. But it's certainly not there yet. The good news is that it doesn't have that far to go but it will take considerable effort on the part of the hotel management.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAmazing trip\u201d", "Author": "Sandra S", "ReviewID": "UR121352074", "Content": "Extremely serene, beautiful, and relaxing.

I am seasoned business traveler, and a Marriott Platinum Elite member. This trip was for a vacation. First, the check in process. I requested an early check in, and understand that it is based on availability. When we arrived our room was not yet ready, so our bags were held and we were asked to wait in the lobby area. It would have been nice to have been given access to the club lounge while we waited. Instead, we waited in the lobby area for at least two hours. After checking into the room, it took four calls to the front desk to get extra towels, bedding, blankets, and pillows for the pull out sofa, and a wine opener. These are things that should have already been taken care of. Secondly the Ocean Club Lounge. While this could have been a great experience, it was not. The lounge constantly had unsupervised children roaming around handling food, opening cabinets, etc. If it had happened once, or maybe twice, it wouldn't be an issue. The employees in the lounge noticed it, but did not take any action. The attendant at the concierge desk inside the lounge provided misinformation to us on more than one occasion. Specifically, I asked on two separate occasions (two different employees) if the lounge would be open and providing regular service on Thursday and Friday (Thanksgiving Day and the day after) and was told yes. I was surprised to find out that it would be open, as most club level service is not open on a holiday. We found out on our own that it would be closed on Thanksgiving day (and the day after). In addition, the \"adults only\" pool area was hardly that. Families with strollers and children were constantly around, while the employees noticed, but took no action. As a Platinum member, I have stayed at numerous Marriott properties across the US, and have never had a club level experience as this. After learning that the lounge would be closed, we made reservations to have Thanksgiving dinner at Voga inside the hotel. This did not turn out well. When we arrived we were promptly seated, and then ignored. Guests coming in after us were greeted by their server while we continued to wait. We walked out and had dinner outside of the hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were good, but I've had better experiences at other Marriott properties. Maybe because it was a holiday weekend - I'm not sure? I believe the hotel staff and management tend to over-promise, and under-deliver. I would not recommend this hotel to my family, friends or colleagues. And, if given the opportunity, I would stay at another hotel in Puerto Rico.

They offered us some complimentary cocktails from the bar, so we were content waiting a bit longer until finally our room was ready. The room was nice. We had an AMAZING view of the beach (and I do not recall paying extra for this or anything --- we may have been upgraded due to the LONG wait).

The hotel lobby has those walls that can be removed during the day, so it was open to the pool area. There are tons of little sofas and cabanas around the pool and we never had trouble locating a spot to have a few drinks. The service was good, but my fiance ordered vodka on the rocks, and was charged $3 just for the rocks which felt like a rip off!

They gave us excellent suggestions on where to eat and things to do. Nothing we asked of them was ever a problem and always fulfilled with an honest smile. The room was top notch.

First it is extortionately expensive for what it is. Paying a hotel fee, followed by a resort fee, followed by a breakfast charge. In any event, we paid for the continental breakfast option - you basically sit at the bar in the main lobby and pick one juice, one pastry, one tea or cofee and one cereal. The people at the bar watched us like hawks to make sure we didn't take more than we should which made us really uncomfortable. My husband was actually disgusted by this behaviour. We sometimes finished our breakfast before we were served our coffee if it was not the regular coffee, the service at the bar for drinks was really slow. It started to rain one afternoon so i sat near the bar looking at the cocktail list for about 15 minutes. Eventually i went to the bar and asked if i should be ordering at the bar or if they serve at teh table, and they said they take orders at the table. So back i went and still no-one came to take my order. After 30 minutes, i gave up. I found the rooms small, although clean and comfortable, the beach was not that great, it is coarse sand. And as far as i am concerned, the hotel has nothing authentic about it. It is a just like being in America - you are expected to tip for everything and anything even if the service is bad, (although we refused at breakfast two days even though the other days, the service was awful, we tipped) which is such a shame as although i love America, being in PR, i would have expected something traditional about this hotel so i knew i was in PR - i may as well have gone to Florida! Such a shame really - i am glad i went to El Yunque and some other places outside of the hotel as i didn't find this hotel had anything to offer.

The hotel is very good, although it doesn't quite get to our standard to award an \"excellent\" rating. First the the location is excellent. You are well situated on Ashford Ave in the Condado tourist district -- there are some very good local restaurants (see my other reviews) that provide a break from the hotel provided food (which is also very good). If you gamble, the Casino at the La Concha is pretty standard for Puerto Rico -- plenty of $5.00 blackjack and craps to go around -- no live poker here. TIP! Ask the front desk for match-play coupons -- even if you are not on one of their packages they will typically give you a few! There are a few different options when it comes to the beach and pools. First the pools -- you will find a multi-tier central pool in the court-yard -- it is very nice -- although this area does tend to get crowded on the weekends -- there is a smaller \"infinity\" pool to the right as you walk to the beach-- we found this pool to be perfect with a toddler -- never crowded, quiet and shaded! There is also an \"adults only\" pool accessible from the other side of the hotel. The beach is very good. Its large enough not to feel crowded on even a busy weekend -- and the sand stretches way out into the water so when the wind is low, it makes for good swimming -- beware the water can get rough at times... you can walk the beach from the La Concha to the Marriott and beyond -- remember beaches are public in Puerto Rico, so you will have a mix of locals and tourists. The rooms are pretty standard resort rooms that would expect from a higher-end property -- but not over the top like you might find at a five-diamond resort. We had a mid-level ocean view room in the original tower and were very pleased with the size --- our only complaint is there modernistic furniture looks better than it feels. The staff at the La Concha really set this property apart -- and if I were rating the properly solely on the staff they would earn 5 stars. Front desk, service, housekeeping and especially the bellman make this property stand-out -- think Ritz Carlton level service and you have the La Concha! Food at the hotel is better than average -- portions for the kids meals are actually pretty big -- and the menu has enough variety to keep things interesting. If you are traveling with children under the age of 5 -- don't expect to see too many other families -- even during the \"sell-out\" nights -- we were one of a handful of guests with toddlers in tow -- for us that was perfect. The only word of caution is that during peak-sell-out periods some services moved back to \"island time\" for completion -- but that was the rare exception during our stay.

I will say the little details in the room needed a little attention (i.e. corner molding not painted with clean lines - you notice this because of the minimalistic decor in the room).

You right away feel very cosmopolitan, but not in a snobby way. The service was amazing starting with the bellman to the front desk staff. Our front desk professional was Harif Marzan. He was courteous and accommodating with a great sense of humor. He was great with my kids (12 & 14) and you know how difficult kids that age can be. By the time we left the desk they were relaxed and laughing... yeah! As for our suite... WOW! You walk in to a comfortable, chic living area with a pullout couch, flat screen tv, table and chairs, bar and patio (overlooking ocean). Then the hallway bath, which by the way, always smells like fresh lavender (how do they do that?) followed by the bedroom with flat screen and best of all... a floor to ceiling, wall length window providing a breathtaking view of the ocean! We were a family of four, so right away they came to us and asked if we would need any additional supplies, towels, shampoo, etc... Usually I have to beg, borrow and steal to get an extra towel, and it was the La Concha staff who asked us first. That was refreshing! Moving on to the beach and outside amenities, the beach was clean and the ocean was fun with super big waves to body surf. The beach staff (I think it was Rudy? and the guys were very helpful with setting up chairs and umbrellas). The two tiered main pools were great. Top pool was heated and overflowed into main floor pool with fountains. Two jacuzzis on top level were clean and soothing as well. On that second level was a fitness room. First, I must say it was very clean and they had a nice amount of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. A separate room was available for classes too. One of those classes we took was a meditation class. This was our first experience with meditation and it was so brilliantly introduced to us by the Fitness Center Manager, Ana Paula Azirovic. My fourteen year old daughter and I both agreed that her knowledge and her approach were so comforting and energizing. Just listening to her speak relaxed you.

We were a little concerned at first because the weather report said it would rain everyday the first week of November. It did rain each day, but only for like an hour. The ocean view suite we had was amazing. It was the equivalent of a swanky one bedroom downtown apartment that included a sleeper sofa, breakfast nook, kitchenette, bath, bed, desk, two flat screen tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and balcony area. No bathtub, but I am too much of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153germaphobe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ever take a bath in hotels, anyway. Shout out to the 4th floor suite maid (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch her name) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she was so nice and kept our room looking spectacular. There were only two issues with the room that were infinitesimal compared to the room's overall presentation, but it may be a deal breaker for others. First, we made good use of the kitchenette because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat red meats, pork, dairy, fried food, etc. My hubby and I are both neat freaks, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the tiny ants from showing their presence on the kitchen counter. Again, not a major issue because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a home owner and know how easy it is for those little buggers to find their way in no matter how well you spray and tidy up. But, I did call the front desk and ask them to spray. Also, the room had a mildew smell to it. This was also not a serious issue because my home is within a mile of Lake Michigan and the humidity stays high inside despite insulating, ventilating, and sealing penetrations! We stayed on the resort majority of the week there. We had reservations for the restaurants but cancelled because we ended up buying enough food to prepare ourselves. We did, however, have lunch at the Solera grill a few times and it was well worth it! There are plenty of stores, boutiques, and restaurants within walking distances from the hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 24 hour Walgreens a 5 min walk from the resort. Also, There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grocery store within a 5 min drive of the hotel . La policiaca is present on every other corner day and night. We rented a car (three car rental places in walking distance) for a day to drive to El Yunque Rainforest (please go!). It was definitely cheaper for 2+ people (entrance to the rainforest is free) compared to paying for a tour and the hotel and rental place will give directions. We regret not going to old San Juan and some of the other locations/activities outside of the resort. But, the resort was so nice that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to ever leave the property!

Old SJ is a taxi ride away and should not be missed. Atmosphere: If you want quiet don't go here. It's a party atmosphere and has a great lobby bar but is noisy.

ROOM: We had a city view room which was great during the day but in the evenings was overwhelmed with the music from clubs/bars on the street. In the future, we know to reserve/upgrade to an ocean view (our friends stayed in an ocean view room which has similar set up but the ocean (beautiful) and peace is definitely worth it).

The other one we went to (up the stairs), again, cannot remember the name...was not worth the money and the private room was VERY hot as it is located outside overlooking the pool.

There is plenty seating/lounge spaces around the hotel with beautiful scenery. There are two \"warm water pools\" and a pool...all very nice. LOCATION: There are many shops and restaurants in walking distance to the hotel. Everywhere we ate the food was absolutely delicious (although a little pricey)!! If you plan to go to nightclubs plan to spend approx. $15 each way and even more for daytime excursions.

It was a bit pricey, but for a resort you expect that. Service: Incredible. The bellmen and staff were friendly and enthusiastic and made every attempt to make the stay enjoyable. Good dinner recommendations and tips about the area. Value: We were there for business and it is slightly expensive (especially with the $30 resort fee that could be disclosed a little better). We stayed there due to the proximity to the convention center (less than 10 min drive) and because it was a hotel we could get rewards at. Sleep Quality: I mean, my room was next to the ocean. Does it get any better? Maybe it does, but having a natural noise machine was great (though, if you closed the window it was silent). Bed was very comfortable, clean, etc. Cleanliness: Overall I would say it was good. The room was pretty clean; bed was fine, floors and couch area all fine. Shower could have used a little work, but it wasn't anything worth complaining about. Hotel itself could use a fresh coat of paint, especially on the ocean side. Location: Excellent because great food in walking distance (there was this small little place across the street that was fantastic), close to Old San Jaun and the Convention center (both via car). Easy to get to and find. Rooms: I think I've covered most of the room stuff, but it was a great room. I think the furniture was nice and the room was modern. AC worked with no problems. One odd thing: why have a metal chair/furniture with a room that faces the ocean? Legs of the chair were rusting a bit. Other thoughts: I was on the third floor, ocean side, and my door faced the vent from the Solara Grill. This brings up two points: 1) the door made sure I never heard that fan even though it ran 24/7 and 2) it smelled so good whenever I stepped out my door. Food was also fantastic. Solara Grill is expensive, but it is a resort. I had a hibachi steak tapas one night and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. No joke, great flavors, etc. Lastly, when I got the list of room charges their was parking on my room for 4 days. I only put parking on once and my coworker had it on his room the other 5 nights.

We spent about $150 for the car for the days we were there and it was well worth it! We were able to explore the area, without paying tons for taxis.

The lobby in La Concha is crisp white, clean, swanky atmosphere with house music at night. Maria is conceierge was very helpful with recommendations on where to eat nearby. For walking distance I recommend the following places we checked out: Peruiccan (delicious Peruvian cuisine) , waiters (reasonably priced and casual atmosphere bar food and also light fare), lost cafe (delish delish delish!!! Everything is good breakfast and lunch). Our room was nice and clean but based off of other reviews, I went ahead and called each morning to request clean linens and towels because a lot of people were saying that if you don't, housekeeping won't come each day. I didn't chance it I just called and never had a problem. The best thing about our room was the view. I would say if you are going to stay here to definately get an ocean view took because it is so beautiful and you can hear the waves as you sleep. Amazing. One thing about the rooms : no stationary or pens. Really? For that price? And the shower has just a half glass door no biggie if you are traveling with your man or comfortable around eachother like we are but if you are modest be advised. The drinks in the lobby are pricey but we are used to it the prices are similar in LA. Also they were renovating the bar while we were there so we didn't get the full lobby experience but on Friday and sat they had a dj, fun ambience and you can also drink and hang out outside plenty of couches and cushions. The perla has a nice bar upstairs and we had a drink there as well very nice fancy place to eat. Tapas at solera also very good! I loved the infinity pools although we didn't spend that much time at the pool and there are two decent sized hot tubs. The beach by the hotel is very nice!

Another plus is that it's 15 minutes from the airport. All of the staff were extremely accommodating (Felix, Eduardo to name a few) and the hotel was clean and very modern. At check-in everyone was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is ideal because it's on Ashford Ave. which is a main drag with tons of eating options, Walgreens, and shopping within walking distance. We felt safe walking the streets outside of the La Concha. There is a strong foot police presence. We saw the same few homeless people walking the streets each day pandhandling, but that was the only downfall. Since the breakfast at the Italian restaurant in the La Concha and the a la carte breakfast option in the lobby are both expensive it was nice to be able to walk to Dunkin Donuts, the Lost Coffee Shop, or eat in the room (cereal/milk from Walgreens). We ate breakfast at the Italian restaurant in the hotel twice, and although it was delicious!... it was around $20 per person. For lunch and dinner we recommend these surrounding restaurants: The Greenhouse, JAM Bistro and Rum Bar !!!! (so good!! great atmosphere, and 50% your bill on Mondays- be sure to make a reservation), the Punk Burger Bar (behind Lost Cafe), the Pure & Natural Cafe (great healthy wraps, salads, juices and smoothies), and the Old Harbor Brewery in Old San Juan. The 3 pools at the La Concha are all very nice. Fresh towels and iced lemon water were always available at the pool that we went to each day (the Tower Suites Adult Infinity Pool). It was a very quiet and relaxing atmosphere. The beach is just a few steps down from the Tower Suites Adult Pool and there is a restroom at the pool (which is a nice convenience). The only drawback of the Tower Suites Adult Pool is that it does not get sun after lunchtime (at least the chairs are all shaded after this time of day). That's when I would head to the beach for more sun. The beach area has plentiful lounge chairs and umbrellas (you can always get a chair). The ocean at the hotel is rough - it's not calm, still water. The beach is not little kid friendly. This hotel is more for adults, it does not seem like a setting for a family vacation if you have very young kids (not much to entertain the kids with and the pools are all small). The casino was very nice and clean (non-smoking). Our room was great, and it was clean. We had the Partial Ocean View Suite in the Tower Suites (with balcony). These rooms overlook the rooftops of other buildings and you get to see the ocean, too. It was nice having dishes, silverware, sink, coffeemaker, fridge/freezer, microwave, etc! Great for keeping bottled water handy and storing leftovers from our meals to eat later on. Only complaints: The air conditioning unit constantly shut on and off to keep the room temp set. While the room was never humid and was always nicely cooled, the noise of the air turning on and off woke me up a lot at night. Maybe I am a light sleeper? Oh and...people in PR party! On Tuesday night there was a party in another club/bar building nearby that kept us up until 3am with the loudest music. Although it kept us up we got a good laugh out of it since we were on vacation and did not have to wake up early. We don't recommend eating in the few eating spots DIRECTLY across from the hotel driveway. Venture down the street a bit (make a left out of the hotel and you will find tons of options, including the ones I mentioned above).", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome experience!

We ended going across the street to the Dunkin donuts and buying coffee and breakfast sandwhiches at a much cheaper price. The rooms have in room coffee, but the individual cup machines. We loved having the kitchenette and refrigerator, the teenager had a use of the microwave for late night snacks. The bathroom decor is modern and glass. The strange thing is the shower is glassed in, so bedroom partners can see you shower. Thus, mom had to leave the area when the teenage son showered. You can see everything, even though the glass is frosted. The hotel staff was very nice, and Victor, the concierge, was excellent. He made reservations for us, drew maps, and looked up any information we asked for. The business center was available for computer use and ticket printing. The pool area was great, the suite tower had its own pool and beach area. There is a public beach next door, can get busy on weekends, but it wasn't crowded and didn't bother us. There was a wedding on Saturday night, that got a little loud for awhile, but didn't last late at all. We only walked through the casino, we aren't gamblers. You can tell the owners have merged two neighboring hotels into one property. It was nice that the little kids had their own are and pool.

The cushions on the couch smelled and made my face itch after a nap. The ice machines in some suites don't work. The suite tower had only 1 working elevator while we were there, so be prepared to wait a long time to get up and down. Black fuzzy junk was hanging from the valence over the curtains. The phones don't work in the suite tower on upper floors. Everyday they told me they would bring towels, clean my room, and fix the whirlpool jets in my upgraded ocean front suite. They did not. No one at the front desk cares about anything you ask for, or how long you wait in line while other people are complaining. On my last night I told them I was tired of them saying they would fix things because I was leaving the next day. So they took $90 off my bill. I told them I didn't want the money. This was my only big vacation for the year. I just wanted a clean working room. I just wanted a happy fun vacation. Sadly, they just did not care! They gave my friends 1000 bonus Marriott points for the same issues. We also tried getting a Bloody Mary one day around 11:00am. Each bar sent us to the next because the bar tenders at each location said that another bar makes them. Finally Voga (the restaurant they turn into a cafeteria in the morning) was able to make one for us. We waited in the lobby with the hostess for at least 30 minutes while they made two drinks. Fortunately for the hostess, we learned she just got an internship next year with Marriott in Orlando or California where she will learn how a real hotel operates. We never tried again after spending nearly an hour total to get a Bloody Mary on a vacation. If you can get past the dirty facilities, they built a beautiful hotel on the beach. If the staff cared, it has the potential of being a great place to stay. The only redeeming quality the hotel has is the concierge desk. Four members of the staff set us up on amazing excursions everyday all over the island. If you do choose this hotel, a real Marriott hotel is just down the beach. The staff there is very friendly! Their poolside bar service is amazing. They are very helpful, and will help you find local restaurants! You can also get towels for your room by the pools. Remember, you will need to find your own towels on the island if you plan to take a shower, or clean up the dirt on the floors. Good luck in making your decision. This hotel is a beautiful property in a great location, but I imagine there might be other great properties nearby. If you only take one or two big vacations a year, be careful.

You had to go down to the gift shop and purchase drinks if you wanted one. So again, I can't recommend this hotel enough.

The pools and beach --superb--as well as the staff serving food and beverages ! Room 413--ocean front , 2 queen bedded room with shower that could accomodate someone with a handicap( i.e no tub) Cons: The city view suites face the street. The first night in suite 873, we were awakened by party goers at 3:30AM. We looked out and saw patrons streaming out of the bar across the street and what looked like a brawl. The noise went on all night The suite had the equipment to prepare a light meal, but nothing to clean up with--no paper towels, dish soap, sponges, or towels. Also lacking in the suite was a phone book, paper or pad, extra tissues or toilet paper. An oversight, perhaps? Voga--we ate dinner the night of a power outtage. We understand that that they were running on generators. We waited over 1 hour for our food to arrive, and when my daughter removed the head of her prawn, it oozed a red substance that looked like blood--very un -appetizing. Needless to say, we did not eat our meals. The staff did send up a lemon chicken dinner that was inedible. We assumed that the service and food issues at Voga was just due to the power outtage. So, like fools, we went there the following morning for breakfast . ( We are had access to the Ocean Lounge but wanted something different). Once again, service was poor and the food fair. To wait 45 minutes for eggs benedict and a fruit plate is ridiculous. The staff at this property is what sets it apart from others. The location is Ok.

Chic. Sexy. Modern. Lush. Gorgeous. Swank. Perfection. We had an absolutely fantastic stay at La Concha for the last two nights of our 5 night visit to Puerto Rico. When our group of four arrived we were told that they could not guarantee us a room with two queen size beds and oceanfront view which was our original hope. Booking through orbitz is always a gamble, but we knew that this was where we wanted to end our trip and so we took the risk. What we ended up getting was even better than we ever could have expected. We were given a city view corner suite with two queen size beds, a full living room, and galley kitchen, perfect for storing late night empanadas. In a hotel with views as spectacular as this, forfeiting the ocean view was a small price to pay as we spent limited time in the room as it was. The hotel grounds are absolutely phenomenal, every floor has a balcony next to the elevator offering views of the ocean, every floor is also built in a circular fashion that leaves the center agape with views of the pond filled atrium below. The resort boasts 3 pool areas, all three have infinity pools with two facing the ocean and one being \"adult only\". There are two hidden hot tubs, first come first serve beach cabanas, and a number of outdoor areas of plush white couches where you can lay out in comfort with a good book or just enjoy the sounds of the ocean. Each level of the main garden and pool space offers outdoor couches, perfectly kept landscaping, and the sweet sounds of running water. Whoever designed this hotel kept in mind that running water equals relaxation and for that, there are streams, fountains, and pool jets at every turn; in conjunction with the ambient house music, this was paradise. Lush gardens surround the pool area off to the side of the hotel lobby where you will find Solera, the poolside bar and grill that delivers to you and your party without question. You order...they find you, no questions asked. I can't comment on the food being too overpriced as a negative, this is a pricey hotel with great service, I was on vacation and was willing to treat myself to expensive cocktails. I knew what I was getting myself into and took full advantage of what each of our resorts offered. The service was great, the guys handing out towels at the pool were the sweetest things. Young and handsome, willing to share the secret nightlife spots, and asking questions about city life...clearly we wanted to switch lives because I could find myself being very happy in the islands for the rest of my life; conversely it looked like they were trying to get out. Bellmen were equally friendly helping with our suitcases at every turn and calling taxis only after asking where we were off to and offering their suggestions on what to see. I don't think I saw one person working at this resort without a smile on their face. A huge plus for this hotel and their accommodating staff was our late afternoon flight and our inquiring about a late check out. We had stopped by the concierge on our last night and were told that we would only be given until 1pm to check out of the rooms but that we could leave our luggage on site to use their facilities. They then told us to call back in the morning in the event that there were any room cancellations and that they would try to make arrangements for us then. We were concerned about having a shower to use before getting on the flight home, sitting for 4 hours smelling like chlorine and salt was not going to make for happy travelers miserably heading back home from an otherwise wonderful vacation. Calling the morning of our departure they told us that we could have access to the room until 3pm for no additional charge. This was absolutely more than we could ever have asked of them, and a sign that the staff will go above and beyond to ensure their customer's satisfaction. My only major issue with the hotel as has been mentioned by other reviewers was housekeeping. I understand hotels being eco-friendly with air conditioners that turn off when doors are open, or only changing the sheets every third day unless requested more frequently. But why they couldn't change and replenish towels each day was a little upsetting. All in all, this was a terrific experience. Service was great, room accommodations stellar, grounds were perfect. Pricey as it was, this is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or splurge for a little extra vacation satisfaction.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat trendy contemporary hotel\u201d", "Author": "emrtes", "ReviewID": "UR118393763", "Content": "The staff here is truly outstanding - the valet (Jonathan) remembered us every time we stopped by, even though we left the hotel to visit another part of the island for a few days.

I think my husband and I both spent at least 2 hours everyday just lounging around on our balcony, watching the waves! Plus, who doesn't like going to sleep to the sound of waves? One day we experienced mid-day rain and thundershowers, so we just sat on our balcony and watched the ocean and as the sun reappeared we headed back to the beach! The beach is long, white, and beautiful. The ocean is not tranquil, but the waves aren't so aggressive that you can't enjoy warm water, wade around, or 'ride the wave.' I especally loved that there was an \"adult\" pool facing the ocean and this pool didn't seem to have a closing time! We went into the pool 2 nights after enduring the humidity while walking around Old San Juan. It was so refreshing and fun! The majority of the people here were between the ages of 20-35. Definitely had a good-times, party vibe, but the beauty of the hotel is that if you're not there to party, you don't have to! There are enough pools to avoid the \"Snooki's and Mike's,\" and the lobby did have a DJ on Thurs, Fri, and Saturday, but it doesn't turn into this raging club, as others have described!

The resort was beautiful and the stay was great overall. However, there are a few things that I would like to advise interested visitors on. 1. There is a $100.00 per night hold on your credit or debit card, as a security deposit (seems to be the norm for all hotels in PR) so be sure to bring extra means of spending. Luckily we came prepared. 2. The central air units are automatically set to blow on low with a fixed setting of 68 degrees that cannot be adjusted (hotel policy). We're just accustomed to a cooler room setting. 3. The hotel food at the resort as well as the food on the strip is disgusting. 4.The alcholic beverages are over priced and are weak. The lobby bartenders are the least pleasant staff throughout the entire hotel. Those minor issues are nothing compared to the excellent customer service rendered to match the beautiful atmosphere of The La Concha Resort. Shortly after checking in (appx 1am) we realized that our ac was blowing on fan mode and could not be adjusted. The concierge had a technican there within a matter of minutes. The pair worked diligently to fix the unit and although it took appx. 2 hours (a little before 3am) we were completely satisfied with the exception of the set temperature rule. The concierge service is amazing (they book the excursions for you COMPLIMENTARY!) Francisco is the best, he was also interested in knowing whether or not you enjoyed the excursions!!! Louise was great as well. Jose Rodriguez is also a wonderful manager, he was very accommodating. Kristina is very friendly also, she wore a different color flower in her hair everyday with a ring to match. Our room was an oceanfront that overlooked one of the four pools in the resort with the only pool that gave the very best view of the beach. The hotel has great beach space. CAUTION: There are several rocks in close range of the ocean. Watch your feet! The lobby had live dj's on Thurs. Fri. and Sat. nights. The updated modern look of the hotel was very nice, providing a mature feel as well as a fun young adult vibe.

This was a very nicely appointed room - separate living room, kitchen area with refrigerator-freeze (very handy after walk to the Walgreens for water and beverages), stove. An amazing view from the balcony. We sat and had breakfast there the morning after Irene roared through.

We also had lunch a couple of times at Solera. Once upon arrival while lounging on the beach waiting for our room. Only one attendant, but very fast service.

Not too much to say about dining options outside of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a few fast food places nearby. A caf\u00c3\u00a9 across the street from the little plaza outside, was OK.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a ten minute walk. Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The beach outside of the hotel is swimmable, but is not calm. May be better outside of hurricane season when storms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t churning up the tide a bit. Plenty of room to lounge and plenty of chairs and umbrellas to be set up for you. Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend too much time poolside, but there are three pools at the hotel. Two of them are infinity pools. We saw most people over in the main pool nearest the bar and lobby area. Families and people of all ages. Our itinerary during our stay: Day 1 - Relaxed at on the beach, set up a beach chair and enjoyed a mojito, dinner @ Pamelas Day 2 - Rented a car and drove to Ponce. If I had to do it over, I would drive to the Cabo Rojo area and spent the day at Baqueron Bay Beach or Buye Beach in the southwest area of PR. Day 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Drove rented car to Fajardo and tried to buy tickets for ferry to Culebra \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no luck - Flew to Culebra! Get there EARLY! Flamenco beach is worth the trip! Day 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Purchased a tour - spent the day in El Yunque and then Luquillo Beach (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to try the kiosks). Beach here is calmer than near the hotel. Taxi to San Juan Hotel in the evening \u00e2\u20ac\u201c live Salsa bands and dancing until the early morning (free, except for the taxi ride!) Day 5 - Old San Juan, breakfast at La Bombonera...here comes Irene, shops closed up early. Day 6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lounged around the hotel and beach before heading home.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by Felix Perez who was smiley and jovial and made us feel so welcome. He was eager to help us out when he realized we wanted a picture taken of us in the front of the hotel which was very modern and chic, yet comfortable. During check in, I found staff to be extremely welcoming as they greeted us with champagne and offered to a better room than had already been assigned. We wanted a room with a view of the ocean, which we had but we would have been blocked by the restaurant. The rooms were very clean and very nicely decorated and laid out; the bed and pillows were comfortable as well. There was plenty of room for both of us to unpack and the room included two hanging closets and plenty of drawer space. We would have liked a larger patio area in the room as opposed to the Romeo & Juliette balcony, but how much time do you really spend in the room anyway when you've got a terrific resort and town to explore. The bar area in the lobby turns into a club at night that much resembles a Miami disco atmosphere with live DJs and even a stilt walker (a la Carnivale) one night. There was plenty of room around the big pool near the bar to relax with a few cocktails and I never felt over crowded or over powered by the music from the bar. The pool area facing the beach was terrific. Both pool areas were kept very clean during the day and at night. It seemed that the small pool over looking the beach was more of a family area during the day and the large pool area is more for adults. The beach area was clean as well (despite a little debris on the first day from Tropical Storm Irena). You can walk the beach during the day and even order a massage near the beach or in your room. The concierge was very courteous and knowledgeable, however, at times the line was a little long to get information. They could use a little more assistance behind the counter to keep the wait time down. We did book an excursion through the hotel concierge and they were enthusiastic to give us input and tips. We did the night kayaking tour because the rain forest was still closed due to the storm, but again we had a terrific time. There are five restaurants in the hotel from sushi, to Puerto Rican, Italian and Perla (the big shell restaurant in the photos) of which we ate at two. The Puerto Rican grill near the big pool area was slow as far as service, but was decent if you wanted to just grab something while hanging out by the pool. Perla is very nice on the inside and out and you are definitely in awe of the structure and decor, but the food is a bit lack luster for a true dining experience. While it looks like the structure is floating on water from the outside (at certain angles in the photos), it is less inspiring from the inside and you can clearly see the bottom of the shallow pool of water the restaurant is built on. The meal itself was okay. Very nice presentation of the food and the staff was proper (although at times our server was slow), we had a plenty of people that attended to our table.

Don't forget to try the awesome hot sauce (Pica/pique) especially made for that hotel! And the water is very safe to drink. They always have a huge water (with Lemons) dispenser by the towel service area (poolside). And the cool Almond scented face towels were also available for cooling you off. There were always lawn chairs available by the big pool area and at the beach. You didn't have to run down early to reserve any spots. The food out of the resort was also pretty tasty. Note: When they say Continental Breakfast, it doesn't mean that it is complimentary (we learned that first hand) :( Oh and make sure when you take a cab from their airport to La Concha, it only costs $17.50 for everyone (not for each person, some cab drivers may screw you!) We went into Old San Juan (which is a must see), try the Restaurant called La Bombanera for breakfast or brunch. They are infamous for their Mallorca sandwiches which you can have with egg, ham, and cheese, It is a must try! Their coffee is also very tasty! We then took a stroll to their different souvenir shops and visit El Morro (historical landmark). If you go into Old San Juan at night, they have great places to eat as well like the Dragon Fly (asian fusion) and there you will see people dancing salsa in the streets and have a number of clubs and lounges. A great club that we went to is Brava, Friday and Saturday nights are the best. We went on a Thursday, very young... We were very surprised at how beautiful, fun and friendly place Puerto Rico was. The resort is amazing for all walks of life including families with young children.

It is in a great area of town - many restaurants, shops, bars etc within walking distance. The lobby alone was enough to let us know we had chosen a great place. It's gorgeous, large, and open to the elements. Very cool bar area that transforms into an area with a DJ in the evenings. Our suite was beautiful with modern furnishings, a full kitchen with a sitting area and breakfast nook. The bathroom is large and the bedroom had plenty of room and a comfy bed. We had a city view... if you are a light sleeper this may not be for you. They really know how to have fun in PR, and the music went on well into the early morning! It didn't bother us, however. The resort is directly on the ocean, with two infinity pools overlooking the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of which is adults only. A nice perk! The pool areas are amazing, beautiful areas to sit during the day or in the evening with a cocktail listening to the band outside. If you need a little shade, grab one of the cabanas. No need to rent them, which was a surprise! It's first come, first serve, and they were a great respite from the sun after a bit of a burn the day before. Are the drinks expensive? Yes. But it's a resort. If you're concerned about that, there are a few liquor stores within walking distance, and you can pick up your own beverages. Even better if you have a fridge in your room! The concierge (Louise) was very helpful in recommending restaurants and making reservations. La Bodega Compostela is a wine/tapas restaurant that was recommended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great food, great service, extensive wine list. Casa Lola was also recommended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unfortunately we had horrible service here, and the food was just okay. We grabbed lunch next door to the resort one day at Di Parma \u00e2\u20ac\u201c supercute place with great food and great service. We sat outside with a view of the park near the water. We had dinner at La Perla our last evening there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wonderful. The waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable, and the food was delicious. The inside of the restaurant is really beautiful. If available, request a seat by the window overlooking the water. Our one and only complaint about the resort is the public restrooms. Both by the pools and in the lobby, they were just not what you would expect based on the quality of the rest of the resort. Many stalls were out of order, didn't have locking doors, and overall weren't terribly clean. So we just ran up to the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small sacrifice for an overall wonderful experience.

However, after staying at La Concha and visiting the other hotels, I must say I am very VERY happy we decided on La Concha. The hotel was very modern and CLEAN and the service was impeccable! ROOM: Our room was the ocean, which was stunning. The room was spacious and very CLEAN and smelled good to the point where my sister wanted to know if the hotel sold the scent lol (you don't find that often). The beds were very comfortable and the amenities were also great (aveda products, flat screen and ipod doc :)). The shower in the bathroom also had a rain shower head and a long handled shower head which I found great! You don't find that in most hotels. SERVICE: Excellent service from beginning to end. From the moment you step out of the cab, you are greeted with smiles. Felix is really spirited and defintely gets you in the fun vacation mood. The front desk was also warm and very friendly and accommodates your concerns. We were really impressed with Victor at concierge who was highly informative and guided us to all the places that we would be interested in, as it was our first time in PR. On one of the days, we decided to kayak the bioluminescent lagoon in Fajardo (our first time kayaking and quite the comedy show it turned out to be--im sure we're on youtube) anyway Victor equipped us with towels and informed us of all the essentials we needed, which we're glad he did. Defintely go to him for suggestions, information and/or concerns. We defintely want to come back to explore the other places he highly suggested. The restaurant Solera had very friendly staff as well and the food was really good and fresh. Service was a bit on the slow side, but we're from New York and used to everything being done in a NY minute. I have to say Reuben (waiter) was very good and attentive to our picky requests. POOLS Gorgeous pools!! The main pool is fun for kids and families and right by the restaurant Solera. There are also 2 infinity pools that overlook the beach, which are a bit small but nonetheless fun and gorgeous. We found these pools to be quite shaded so we stayed by the main pool or beach for more sun. Overall, La Concha made PR an amazing experience for all of us.

He was in a great mood every single day and made us feel so special and welcome. We were also greeted soon after by Anthony who remembered us as \"the ladies with the matching smiles\" - How can you not be in a great mood with greetings like these? :) There was a small problem with our room since we needed two beds (my mom and I) and there only seemed to be king bed rooms left. Zuheil was at the front desk helping us and she went way above and beyond to try and find us a room. She also has a gorgeous smile and a matching personality to entertain us while we waited for some help from a manager. The Guest Services Manager, Jose came out to help us. I was so impressed that he literally ran up the steps to different rooms to try and find us something that matched what we were looking for. It is so refreshing to see a manager that doesn't feel like he is \"above\" any job at the hotel. He came back sweating and holding a key for this amazing room that had the two beds we needed plus this gorgeous ocean front view! This is only the first hour of our trip!! Things just kept getting better and better from there. We went to the gym to take some ZUMBA classes and Victor who normally does the towels at the pool came in with wet towels for our faces and cold waters for everyone. He knew we would be back the next day so he came to the gym early and moved all of the spinning bikes out of the exercise room for us without even having to ask him! We always like to get the concierge room with the snacks and drinks throughout the day... and Pablo always makes this experience special. We knew him from last year as well and he always goes a step beyond to make sure we have everything we need. Probably the most noteworthy employees on this trip were Alejandra from the Concierge and Kristina at the front desk. Not only did they recommend the BEST beaches, places to eat, most convenient and affordable ways to get there... but they are just GOOD people. They are both super special and super dedicated. I can tell they are the type of employees that would come in on a day off, stay late, etc just because they love what they do and want their guests to be happy.. which we were!! Also worth mentioning is Luis at the front desk- he has a great personality and went out of his way to make conversation and inform us of different things to do in the area that we didn't know about! Everyone that we encountered at La Concha was wonderful...but these particular employees that I mentioned really went above and beyond anything we could have ever imagined. We have been to La Concha once before which is why we came back this time...but this time was incomparable. A vacation is what you make of it...but when everyone in the staff is so friendly and always in a good mood.. the guests can't help but be the same way. We will not only be returning to La Concha ASAP, but we will be telling anyone that will listen how wonderful it is there. One final note... as a previous Property Manager for an apartment community, with lots of experience in hiring and firing staff... I would be THRILLED to have any of the staff mentioned above working for/with me. They are all super stars and deserve much recognition. Pics below with most of the mentioned staff!

We later were able to check in at regular time (3pm) but received an upgraded room with a high floor and a view of the ocean since we had to wait (at no extra charge!). The room was beautiful and clean! The beds are so comfortable you don't want to get up. The hotel has 3 pools from what I saw. One has a waterfall and the other two are infinity pools - all of which are amazing. We ate at both of the restaurants (La Perla) and (Cafe de Angel (i think that's the name). The service is amazing at both and we even got free birthday cake for my friends birthday (without even having to ask for it!). The staff really makes this hotel an experience. They make you feel at home and very welcome. The service didn't feel forced and was very genuine. They wanted us to have a good time and were happy we were there.

I think we would have been lost tourists without his help. Truly great and genuine guy.

The breakfast buffet is good nothing that fancy, your typical buffet - omelet station, waffles, pancakes, coffee, oatmeal, etc. Again I could keep going about this hotel and staff. Note that taxi travel can get pricey after a few days. PR operates on a zone sytem so depending on what zone you travel to/fro it determines the cost of your trip. Typically between $12-$15, even if it is down the street. They really don't like taking credit cards either so beware of that. They charge you automatic $30 for use of credit card so if your trip is only $14 u really get paid twice that just to use your credit card. Other than that...great hotel + location.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "Hhmj", "ReviewID": "UR116530196", "Content": "The public areas and the event was wonderful the banquets team make every moment unique an the food was delicious never try the sweet skirt steak and I can't stop enjoying", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest Vacation Ever\u201d", "Author": "Rochelle01", "ReviewID": "UR116493227", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel and it was absolutely beautiful.

Big and spacious, full kitchenette, the bedroom was really nice. I've read some complaints about the bathroom glass wall that looks onto the bedroom, but as newlyweds and honeymooners, we found it to be a nice touch 8) The view of the beach was lovely. The room was very clean and stacked with a generous amount of towels. We were pretty high up so we never heard any club music. The hotel was great, the pool was nice, a little small but offered great views of the beach. The beach was really empty and very nice, there weren't any rocks, but the waves were a little rough at times. The service in the hotel was great, we were always greeted with great enthusiasm and smiles, everyone was incredibly nice and helpful. Natalia Gonzales was the best!!! Her recommendations were always spot on!! We ate at perla restaurant, it was pretty but the food wasn't amazing.

The bathrooms were also spacious and had just the right amount of room and storage to feel at home. We planned the trip with no schedule or plans - on purpose! We wanted to see what the island had to offer and make arrangements based upon our mood. The hotel offered a bar, multiple restaurants, three pools, a fitness gym and of course the beach!

Of course being new to the island we wanted to make sure we also visited Old San Juan, historic sites, the rainforest etc. Victor at the concierge was amazing and so helpful! We told him exactly what we liked to do and he hooked us up with everything from restaurants, a rental car, reservations to go zip-lining and also suggested some \"hidden\" gems. He also told us what to \"skip out\" on. All of his suggestions were on point and he even checked in on us to make sure everything turned out as we expected. We met several other couples that were in the same position as us - excited to leave the states, new to Puerto Rico etc. They all had the same feelings and were happy with their choice of hotel.

Downsides were that we needed every bit of that $50 and that the credit hadn't showed up on our final bill (although that was soon removed after bringing it up). We ordered room service breakfast the next morning, which was timely and perfect on the balcony. The rest of the time we bought groceries at a Walgreen's a couple blocks away. It was our anniversary, so we ate at the Perla restaurant, which was expensive but a great dining experience. Food and service were wonderful. Lobby bar was a constant hot spot but still received good service. Good mix of people at the hotel: the young and the beautiful were there, but also families, senior citizens, business travelers and even military personnel. Major downside is the resort fee, which is non-negotiable and expensive. It can make the final bill startling. Only consolation is that it seems to be standard among San Juan resorts. That covers umbrellas, beach chairs and towels, yet that didn't seem like much for the price. Drink and food service is available sometimes on the beach, but it's inconsistent. Still, a wonderful place. We enjoyed San Juan, and we would return to La Concha. P.S. If going to Old San Juan, take the bus which stops right outside the hotel and cost only 50 cents. Good way to see locals and much cheaper than a taxi.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cChic comfort and great service!\u201d", "Author": "N_V_adventurers", "ReviewID": "UR115919997", "Content": "We were at La Concha for 5 nights(6 days) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.

Although the security guards tried their best, the adult pool had young kids at times which was a bit uncomfortable.

I work in the hotel industry and was truly impressed (which doesn't happen very often). Here is what I'd like to share: - LOCATION: the hotel is ON the beach and since it's the last property on the sand stretch, the beach feels like is private - ROOMS: The hotel has a Hotel Tower and a Suite Tower. The rooms in the Hotel Tower have no balcony and no kitchenette, but all Suites do. We were enjoying breakfast on the balcony each morning and that was lovely. - POOLS: the resort has 3 pools and all are very well maintained. The infinity pool adjacent to the suite tower is not restricted for kids but natually draws adults and therefore is quiet. The big pool by the restaurant is surrounded with palm trees and lush greenery and is very exotic. There are two hot jacuzzi tubs that are almost private becasue of teh way they are tucked in the garden - RESTAURANTS: the 5 F&B outlets are all are very well appointed and worth the try. However, there are many restaurants just outside the hotel and if you prefer genuine puertoriocan food, the small inexpensive looking places are just the spots you may be looking for (great tips for restaurants can be found on frommers.com) - STAFF: very friendly and helpful employees troughout the entire hotel - PROXIMITY TO OLD SAN JUAN: La Concha has a bus stop right in front and $0.75 is the fare to Old Town San Juan which is a must see. Taxi ride is $15, also worth it.

The location was great because it was right ON a great beach, there were plenty of restaurants in the area. The staff was extremely nice, helpful and accomodating. We had the spa-room in the towers suite. I was disappointed at the lack of privacy on the balcony with the spa. We had an end unit and there wasnt a privacy wall to the right of the building so the construction men on the building to the right could see on our balcony. Then the spa balcony's stick out from the back of the building so the balcony's above can see straight down to our balcony. So there was no opportunity for \"creative fun\" in the balcony. Otherwise the rooms are absoutely beautiful. Our phone never worked and no one ever came to fix it. The food is VERY pricey so I would recommend eating at the resaturants outside the hotel. We were very disappointed at the quality of the breakfast buffett. For two people we spent 47.00! Well we found a great resaturant just walking distance from the hotel and spent 20.00 for a great breakfast for both of us. Wish we had of discovered that place sooner. The Pearla Resaturant has great food...but again expensive. I did like how you can get a van to many of the local attractions. We took the El Yunque Rain Forest van tour one day. Just know that it is not just your hotel guests and you will be with a group. San Juan doesn't offer alot of ACTIVITES per say. So expect to do more beach sun bathing and eating more than anything. Most cab rides are 15.00 even if it's 10 minutes away. Oh and I jus tlove the fact when you stay in the spa tower there is an ADULT ONLY infinity pool. That was awesome!

After careful research, I have selected La Concha Resort over Ritz-Carlton or Conrad. It appeared that I have made the correct decision. Upon our arrival, we were offered an option to upgrade ourselves to a one-bedroom suite at the new tower by paying an upgrade fee of $60 per night. We ended up taking the offer and we found ourselves in a huge one-bedroom suite at the corner of the new tower. This suite can be connected to a standard room next door to form a two-bedroom suite, which is good if you are visiting with a huge family. The layout of the suite was good. The living room was spacious, and was equipped with a large sofa bed and an armchair. There was a dining area, and it was situated next to the windows, providing excellent ocean view. There was also an open kitchen, equipped with microwave and electric stove. The king-sized bed inside the bedroom was very comfortable. There was a balcony outside the bedroom, which was equipped with 2 chairs. The bathroom was enclosed by a glass wall, which resulted in a bit of inconvenience as I was sharing the suite with my friend. Whilst the suite was nicely appointed, I believe certain aspects of the resort should be improved. First, the quality of the breakfast was mediocre. Limited variety of food and fruits were offered at the breakfast buffet. I would expect more from a Renaissance resort. Second, housekeeping was done in a slow fashion. Our suite was usually not cleaned until the afternoon and housekeeping was only offered once a day. For a resort of this class, I would expect twice daily housekeeping services to be offered. Guests staying at resorts use up a lot of towels, as they visit swimming pools and the beach multiple times per day. Therefore, it is important that the resort is able to replenish towels for guests quickly. Third, poolside services should be improved. I was asked for my room number and I had to sign a piece of paper, acknowledging that I had taken some towels for my own use at the swimming pool. What I hated most was that, I was asked to return those towels that I took to the booth when I had finished using them, or I would be charged $15 for each towel that I did not return. In conclusion, this is an above average resort. Its quality was in line with what I had expected from a Renaissance resort. It will become a top class resort if the housekeeping and poolside services can be improved.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mineola, New York", "Title": "\u201cI LOVE it...Over & Over..Goin Back AGAIN!\u201d", "Author": "Vinnypep", "ReviewID": "UR115593477", "Content": "First, I have been here before but have never written a review...until now because I felt the Hotel & it's employees deserved some recognition... ~OVERALL...This is, in my opinion, a GREAT HOTEL, GREAT ALWAYS Smiley, courteous, professional staff, It has a Great Lobby scene, Clean rooms & Great food (SOLERA during the day is Awesome~Try the steak wrap)) ~I arrived on July 3 at 10am in San Juan. The hotel knew in advance i would be checking in Early ( I always take the 6am flight from JFK). I always expect that they would not honor the early arrival because check out is noon. Well, when I checked in at the front desk the clerks we're SUPER Smiley and polite...They took my cell phone # & as fast as i ordered my first mojito I got a call & my room was READY at 1030 am. Awesome start! That day I had the pleasure of meeting a Manager of the Ocean Lounge, Mr. Michael Tischler. What an awesome guy..So polite, professional & respectful. First asking your name, then for 6 days Never forgetting it and always addressing me as Mr. X(my last name)...No matter what problem or concern, however small or large, He always made you feel as it was his ONLY concern. He invited me into the Ocean lounge one morning and Mr. Tischler, as i watch, made EVERY person in the lounge feel as if they were the ONLY person. Real Professionalism and just a great host. (I bumped into him at the front desk also later on in the week where he was helping a staff that was clearly bogged down by multiple checkins/outs etc...Does this guy ever leave?) GREAT Host & Manager!! ~On to my vacation...The property is gorgeous the pools are well maintained, the Large pool in the center and the infinity pool on the beach are ok, the area a little messy & LOADED with kids running around and screaming...fine (they should make the Upper pool in the center with the jacuzzis ADULT ONLY) I stayed by the new tower infinity pool which IS labeled as ADULT ONLY...so great not to have screaming kids playing beachball in the pool. One day there were some families with kids who got by and Mr Tischler actually asked them to leave the pool area...very courteous & the family apologized and went to the other pool area. There are two things lacking in this area-#1.STAFF-6 days i was there, there was ONLY 1 Server for the ADULT pool/beach area...this poor guy(i think his name was Jomar) was running like a nut all over the place and people were tryin so hard to get drinks etc..WAY understaffed, but Jomar attended to EVERYONE...carrying trayloads of drinks......#2.SECURITY-Really sad that this is a Renaissance/Marriot Property and lackin in certain security. I am a Former Detective and it's just not good and they should take a look at it. Basically anyone can walk up from the beach and use the pools.( I saw it happen more than once while there)The Marriot Stellaris uses a Bracelet system which i think is good. If you want to bring guests up, just show your key or bracelet. Also the inner security, keeping kids OUT of the Adult pool area and Stop unecessary annoyance in the regular pool area, when necessary. ~Also a great manager, Tania, my last day there was a little issue with a wedding on my floor, the cleanup went until 6am...unfortuantely my room was next to the service hallway and i was kept up...i called down & had an angry tone and she apoligized and took care of it..askin the men to please keep it down, always maintaining professionalism ~I was missing one server from my 3 previous vacations here-Sandra Morales Cruz-She was probably the best server I've had at La Concha or any other hotel for that matter. I was told she was on vacation(go figure) and that she also has moved into Sales. The way she was as a server, always professional, yet fun & joking and always knew how to make the guest happy~ I'm sure she'd be an asset to sales...a BIG loss for the servers! ~A Great Casino Shift manager-Rafy Avila- knows how to treat good customers and knows how to get rid of the annoying ones! ~Being there for 6days there was so much that i couldn't remember it all..Happy Good Times! ~Honorable mentions for being GREAT, David & Yalila ~~I really wish, being a 6x repeat customer, i could speak directly to the owners, just to see their expressions when i tell them what a great job their employees are doing!", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort!

The hotel and grounds are really nice - the pools are beautiful and the tower rooms (where we were) are spacious and clean. With the tiny kitchen and the living room, you could live there for a while! Being right on the (lovely) beach is fantastic. Food is good and not expensive. The breakfast is lovely and yummy and nicely priced. Things I did not like - service was ok to poor. To give an example, on the first day we went to the beach and asked for chairs and an umbrella. We were told we were only \"allowed\" two chairs and one umbrella (even though we could see a big pile of both, unused). ( We are a family of five and rented two tower rooms.) When we told the Beach Guy that we had rented two rooms, he \"allowed\" us two more chairs (now total 4) , but was really angry and surly about it and slammed them around, almost smacking my daughter in the legs. Later, when he was off doing something else my husband had to \"sneak\" another umbrella and a fifth chair so we could all have chairs. This seemed ridiculous to me and spoiled the beginning of the day. Between the two room and meals for 5, I spent a lot of there - so to be begrudged a few lawn chairs really irked. Second, the elevator in the garage broke and slammed into the first floor. Although we fell only about a foot, the impact caused the Plexiglas screen over the elevator light fixture to fall down and hit my ten year old quite hard in the head. After being trapped in the hot hot garage elevator for about 20 minutes, the hotel staff thankfully was able to crowbar us out. Elevators break, I know, so not complaining about that, but some inquiry into whether the sobbing girl was hurt and some ice would have been nice. Instead I had to drag her upstairs crying to get ice from the freezer and figure out if she was seriously hurt. (Not, thankfully). Third (and this is not the hotel's fault), a major part of the clientele was just really really horrible. I don't care if people want to curse and drink and be a little wild (I do, sometimes!), but screaming the F-word across the beach and yelling off-color \"requests\" to bikini clad college girls so we all can hear, kind of spoiled the day. Just to be clear, I am separating my opinion of the behavior from the fact that it was so loud that we all had to be involved. If you find this annoying, as I do, don't go.

My first day checking in, I arrived early for early check in after providing me with a room upon my arrival, I checked my room and the air conditioner didn't work. They called the repair guy who took about twenty min trying to fix it. Remind you the room was still hot , the repair guy could not confirm if it was fixed. We then asked to move rooms immediately. I was told Puerto Rico is hot and it is the repair guy job to fix the AC , and initailly told all rooms was booked, but they could place me in a smaller connecting room. I wanted what I requested and a higher level because of the music level in the lobby. So after speaking with a manager , I didn't have to wait long she tried to tell me the same initally about them being overbook. I said I understand but I have arrived three hours early and check in is not until four, so then I gave them time to work on it she came back in fourty min and they got me a new room.

Second, you need to know the area is not clean. Next door the people put garbage out right in front, so for me it didn't feel like a resort and homeless people were sitting on the ground . Please listen to me when I say check your credit card statement, Laconche charges a $400 dallor resort fee in additon to what you are paying . I was told this is normal. , I have stayed in hotels all over. Many hold your card as a reassurance, but do not charge it or just charge the first night of your stay. Well they charged my card by the third night and additional two hundred and ninteen dallors . Then upon check out charged me an additional two hundred dallors and 19 again.I was told my bill was already paid. I only new this because I called my bank and check right away before leaving the hotel . They advised me my card would not be charge it was only a hold. Then later I was told they held the four hundred the money will not be released for seven to ten days. Why would you hold the four hundred after you already have your money for the nights we stayed. Most importantly you should make the customer aware of this initally before arriving. Do you think they apologized are said sorry for the inconvience.Upgraded me any form or did anything to makeup no. I was shocked when I checked out. So I had to have them write a statement to my cc company to release my money back to my card. Remind you when I booked the room I was not made aware of this at all. They never mentioned a four hundred dallor fee in additon to what you are paying. . I paid the full amount the day before for the room.She didn't expect me to call my bank right away thou. The cleaning of the rooms were half done. they just make the beds . The ocean view in the Ocean tower is nice, but no place to sit on your balcony and the terrance sliding door window looked like it had not been cleaned in years. The jacuzzi jets were not working fully. One had a low temperature so it was like being in the regular tub. I will say the lobby bell men were very helpful and my trip to Puerto Rico itself was nice But the hotel pictures makes you feel like you are going to stay some where beautiful. Oh and my trip to the rainforest was cancel the morning of and I planned that also ahead of time. I assumed not enough people to go. But it would of been nice to get a coutesy call the night before .

The La Concha lobby is beautiful and modern. There are 2 infinity pools facing the beach and a main pool in the center of the \"U shaped\" hotel layout that has no beach views but it very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect - right in between Isla Verde and Old San Juan - on a great stretch of sand. 15 minutes East to Isla Verde, 15 minutes West to Old San Juan. Perfect. You get the best of both worlds. The service was EXCELLENT! Room service was quick, friendly and helpful. Concierge took the time to address every question we had and make all reservations for us (check out the tapas at El Convento in Old San Juan). When booking, we were undecided between this hotel and El San Juan, which many of our friends had claimed was \"the\" hotel for San Juan. While there, we made it a point to visit El San Juan and we were both thrilled with our choice. El San Juan hotel is farther from Old San Juan town, which is significant when paying taxi's to take you into town every day and you're dealing with a 30 minute ride each way rather than a 15-minute ride. Also, El San Juan had a gorgeous lobby but many of the facilities were older and seemed run down, the pool area had a very \"suspect\" crowd, and we generally got a \"darker\" feel to this hotel rather than a light, airy, breezy, and elegant feel, which is what La Concha is. By the way, La Concha is in Condado which reminds me greatly of South Beach. It felt like South Beach - not like a tropical island. Note 3 things about La Concha: (1) the rooms are small and, if you are in the corner area with an ocean view (as we did), there is no terrace. They claim there is but it is actually just a large window with a sticker that calls the window a \"balcony.\" See picture. (2) the continental breakfast at Aroma Cafe is not really a breakfast at all. The selection is comparable to a Starbucks - it's a grab-on-the-go place with one coffee and a choice of 2 of the following items: croissant, bagel, yogurt, cereal or fruit cup. On the first day we tried it, noticed the fruit was literally spoiled, and then proceeded to the restaurant for the infinitely better ($22/pp) breakfast with an omlet, waffles, fresh fruit, etc; and (3) La Concha is a trendy nightlife hotel (like Delano in South Beach or the Gansevoort in NYC) so be prepared to have techno music in the elevators and a club scene in your lobby all night long. The music didn't stop until 4:30AM so if you think you're sleeping with an open window and the sounds of the ocean waves, you're sadly mistaken. You'll be listening to JLo and Pitbull instead.

All in all I wouldn't go back there... the service was just not as it should be and for the money I spent it should of been top notch and I'm not a hotel snob by far...but being helpful in the service industry is a must and the whole cleanliness thing really grossed me out!! Another family next to us had a different housekeeping person and they still had bad service! So for fun and party yes the vibe is good for pretty pictures it's great too but the service is not 4 stars at all. I hope they read all these service issues bc seriously I won't be going back there.\u00c2", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olive Branch, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cWe enjoyed our visit to Puerto Rico and stay at La Concha!!\u201d", "Author": "mzmartin07", "ReviewID": "UR115453162", "Content": "My husband and I visited Puerto Rico to celebrate 4 year anniversary.

It must be one of the top hotels in San Juan. My daughter was traveling with a group and they were staying at the San Juan Marriott down the street and it also seemed very nice. Here are my impressions: Facilities: La Concha is a category 6 Marriott, buy you have to keep in mind that it is in a city and in the Caribbean. The design in upscale and trendy but being in a city, they don't have room for the grand entryways, large swimming pools, and lush landscaping that you do find in other Caribbean resorts. That being said, the hotel is very attractive and immaculately clean! The pools are small, but they were not crowded when we were there. One of them is designated for adults only, but it seems not everyone gets that message, so nearly every time we went there, a lone family would come by with kids. The staff don't necessarily say anything unless you ask them to, which is kind of awkward. I would recommend a tasteful sign to help that situation. (I love kids and have 3 of my own, but sometimes I go on vacation without them, and it is nice to be at a pool that is quiet, with no splashing.) Rooms: We stayed in a 2 BR suite, because our daughter was with us for part of the trip. It was great for us because we had two separate rooms (hers had the sofa bed), a full kitchen, and a large bathroom in between the rooms. The jetted tub was a nice surprise too. There was also an ocean view balcony, which was very pleasant. The room was kept very clean and well- supplied. We did have a problem with the AC the first few days, but we seemed to work it out. We heard that in June and July, dust from the Sahara desert settles over Puerto Rico and affects the weather, so it was very humid. It was hard to get the humidity out of the room, so it ended up feeling cold but damp. We didn't complain, just tried to figure it out, and finally when it rained, we opened up the balcony and the \"front door\" to air out and that seemed to fix the problem. Food: We didn't eat much at the hotel, because there is so much right outside to choose from, but what we did have was excellent. Except for the coffee!! When we travel to the Caribbean, I look forward to the great coffee, but something's wrong in San Juan! We only tried the concierge lounge, but the coffee was terrible - very weak. This was not just a problem at the hotel, either. The Dunkin Donuts coffee was weak and overly sweet. Also weak at the breakfast place across the street. Baffling! The best coffee I had was at the Subway right across from the hotel, where you can get a small cup of good coffee. There was a Starbucks several blocks down, but I was discouraged and didn't try that. There are many good restaurants within walking distance, and this was very convenient. There are also some fast food options if you just need something familiar, but \"fast\" is relative, so plan ahead. Subway was fine, but when we went to Wendy's, what looked to us like an average lunch line (10 people?) took 45 minutes to get through! Location: The hotel is very conveniently located to many restaurants, some shopping, and all necessities (There are two Walgreens stores within walking distance.) Old San Juan is a 10 minute taxi ride away. And of course, you are right on the beach. The city was surprisingly clean, and we felt safe walking at night. It does seem that San Juan is suffering economically. There are many hotels or apartments that look like they have been abandoned or are for sale. The restaurants were not nearly full. There were a few homeless people on the streets. But again, we felt safe and were not harassed by anyone. Staff: We had no problems with check in or other services. The concierge was friendly and enthusiastic and gave us lots of good advice. Service at the pools is a little sparse, so you may want to order before you get too hungry or thirsty! But the most memorable part of this hotel was Felix, at the front door. Even on a rainy day, Felix is like sunshine and makes you feel like the most special guest in the hotel! We send him a big, leap in the air high-five! So if you are staying in San Juan, La Concha is a great choice, and probably one of the top few hotels in the city. It is clean, convenient and friendly.

They were right! We had a very late check in (3AM to be exact!) and walked right into the hotel, checked in took 5 minutes, and were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving--what a breeze! I wish all hotels were like this! I actually felt like the hotel's website did not do it justice in describing the rooms. Our room (Ocean Tower, Ocean View room with King Bed) offered much more than described, including a microwave, a more than mini-fridge with an ice maker, a cook-top with pots and pans, a sink, and everything you would need to cook and eat a meal in your room. Although we didn't use the stuff, it was nice to know it was there! We did use the microwave to heat up tons of leftovers -- (the restaurants around the hotel serve very generous portions). The pool areas were beautiful. One pool (somewhat small) is adults only, which we enjoyed. It is one of two small pools that are ocean-front. They also offer bar & food service at that pool via a waiter. The large pool is behind the hotel, which overlooks Ashford Ave. There are plentiful chairs, and the atmosphere was great, despite screaming children. There are 2 hot tubs on both sides of the pool that are covered as well, which was nice when the afternoon showers came through. There are also tables & chairs you can order food from near the pool as well. I'm not sure what some of the other reviews were referring to when complaining about the maid service. Ours was perfect. Our bed had fresh sheets on it every day and we had fresh towels in the bathroom. Everything was always straightened in the bathroom, but they did not touch our suitcases (which I liked). The lobby bar was fun too at night. There were lots of people our age (25-30) hanging out at the bar after 10-11ish and they have a live DJ Friday & Saturday nights, which was cool. We never had to leave the hotel to have a good time at night. We also hung out in the casino for quite a few hours each night (yes, the drinks are free), and managed to win a few hundred on the BlackJack tables. Someone else also hit the Jackpot on a slot machine behind us one night as well for around $2,000. The dealers at the tables were great--I highly recommend Luis and Jennie. Jennie is like a huidini when she deals...and all the dealers speak perfect Spanish and English and go between the two with such ease! The beach was someone empty when we were there, which I kind of liked, but is definitely swim-able, unlike what other reviewers say. The rocks they are speaking of are to the East & West about 100 yards each way, so you have plenty of room to swim. The only complaint I have about this hotel (and I hate to even give them one) was that we scheduled a late checkout (instead of 12pm, we had to be out by 1pm), and we tried to come back to our room at 12:30 to get our stuff to leave, our keys didn't work. It took about 30 minutes to get someone to let us back into our room (The front-desk people tried to re-program the keys, but it didn't work). So we didn't end up leaving our room until about 1:30...but didn't get charged a fee because it wasn't our fault. There were several other people on our floor that had the same issue, but it all worked out in the end. The concierge was very nice and helpful as well. They tell you which tours are BS and which ones are worth it. Our iterary follows: (and I wouldn't have changed a thing!) 1st day: Bioluminescent Bay tour via Kayak at night (Absolutely amazing- once in a lifetime experience that you must do!!--take the late tour on a moon-less night) 2nd day: Rented a car to drive to rainforest--hiked to La Mina falls--beautiful! Night: Ate at Orozco's about a 2 minute walk from La Concha (Authentic PR food- GREAT!) 3rd Day: Old San Juan, checked out forts & went shopping) Night: Ate at di Parma Trattoria (Italian, 2 minute walk from La Concha-- AMAZING) 4th Day: Pool, Casino, Luonge around & check out the rest of the hotel Other notes: There is a Walgreens about a 5-10 minute walk away from La Concha that has bottled water & necessities you forgot at home. *This walgreens does not have refridgerated food like we are used to in the US...FYI. There is also a Wendy's about 2 minutes away as well--convenient and cheap!

In our experience, this is not the place to do so. We requested early Check-in (we arrived at 2:00-2:15ish), and despite my husband's status as a platinum member, we were told we could not check in. Fine--these things happen--but certainly not a good start to our trip. The check-in attendant suggested we walk around and see the area. Exiting the front of the hotel and making a right, there is one block of somewhat high-end shopping (e.g. Cartier and the likes). Go past that block and there is a store where you can stock up on your own liquor/food and, since we had a kitchenette, we opted to do just that. We came back around 3:30 and, much to our surprise, the room was still not complete. They have a guaranteed check-in time of 4; they were done at 3:58. Since we didn't want to wait further, we asked if we could just have our bags instead of waiting for the bellhop to bring them up. We were told they would be brought to us. After waiting another 20 minutes, my husband asked where they were and was told \"Oh they're outside with the bellhop.\" My husband went outside, got them, and we went up to the room. At this point we've been waiting for two hours, but we finally enter the room. The room we were given was a corner room, which led to our initial excitement that finally everything was remedied and we could get this show on the road. We went out onto the balcony and, lo-and-behold, our corner faced the ocean in the front and a very questionable building to the side. It looked like an extremely run-down apartment, with a vacant construction lot to the side. Given our desire to enjoy the balcony's hot tub, this was not an optimal environment. We go inside, my husband requests a change in room, and I begin noticing some issues in the room: there are red stains on the comforter, black spots in the shower, mold spores on the ceiling (along with a dingy smell of mold), even minor things like typos in the menus and such. My husband complained to the manager, and he gave my husband Marriott points (really, we have more than enough of those) and worked on changed the room. An hour later, the room was changed and the manager came over with us to make sure it was acceptable, and it would have been...if it weren't for the smell of smoke in the room. Now, Marriotts are smoke-free facilities, so there should not have been a smokey smell. The manager seemed to not notice it, until we went on the balcony and noticed cigarette burns in the lounge furniture. Granted, the manager was angered by this and would have to fine the previous customers, and this is certainly not his fault. But the fact of the matter is that my husband is sensitive to the smell of smoke. This made it difficult to enjoy the room. Upon stating so, the manager brought room service over to spray the room down. They (1) barely spoke English, so we couldn't ask them anything, and (2) were unable to rid the room of the smell, instead only masking the odor in perfumes. The hot tub--the key reason we wanted that room--had very, very limited instructions that did not explain where the valve to plug it in was located (in a hidden corner behind the tub). Ergo, to our foolish belief, we thought the tub would plug itself or somesuch, which it did not. We called maintenance to help us figure out what to do, which is when we learned of the valve. Also, the digital system on the tub did not work (but note that the instructions discussed using the system to check temperature), so we called maintenance again. He explained that none of the digital aspects of the tub worked in any of the rooms. As such, we were unable to check the temperature. By 9:30 or so, we finally had the tub ready to go. During the tubbing situation, we went to the lounge for gold/platinum guests, which was nice. It was relatively large, had an array of options, an honor bar, and the employees were kind. The TV was a bit blurred though and perhaps should be replaced. We ended up only staying one night, leaving to go to a different hotel in the US Virgin Islands. Yes, once the kinks were worked out, the people were amiable, but it was more of a \"paying-for-what-its-worth\" situation; for the amount we were paying on this vacation (and given my husband's platinum status), we shouldn't have had to go through what we went through. Additionally, the beach area had some vagrants sleeping and walking around on the beach area--it just wasn't comfortable and it didn't make me feel safe.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never written a review before, but after our recent stay, I decided to do so. The moment we got out of the cab at La Concha, we received a very warm welcome. The lobby is gorgeous -- so sleek, bright and modern. Check-in was a breeze. We were in our ocean front room in the Suite Tower within minutes. The room was perfect; separate living room/dining/kitchenette area and bedroom - nice size, very clean and modern with plenty of storage. A nearly full-size refrigerator was a plus also, not to mention the two large flat screen televisions. The bathroom was great; the shower was so nice, with an overhead rain shower --- very sexy too --- with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frosted glass walls which separate the shower from the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable. When we were in the room, we probably spent more time on the great balcony over looking the ocean than in the room itself. A nice touch was the cheese/fruit tray that was sent to our room since we were there for a special occasion. The lay-out of the resort is very good for its size. Very nice atmosphere with beautiful palm trees and tropical plants. There are 3 pools, two which overlook the beach, with plenty of lounge chairs. The pools are not large, but big enough to cool off in. There are also many comfortable areas outside just to relax and enjoy a drink or food. Servers come around frequently to take your food or beverage order, even on the beach. The drinks were great and the food delicious. We found the prices about the same that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay at any nice resort. The food and service at Solera is very good -- really enjoyed the burgers, the Latin sliders and the tapas after 6 p.m. Vladimir and the others waiters/waitresses took great care of us! Dinner was delicious at Voga, as was the outstanding service we received from Rushtid! Breakfast was also very good - omelettes made to order, and anything else you could want for breakfast.

My husband and I had never been to Puerto Rico and wanted to stay close to San Juan, but still be on the beach.

The lobby is very pretty--all white with touches of red and orange. Very modern. The check in process was easy. Our room was not ready, but they gave us two complimentary drinks and called when our room was ready. The hotel stored our bags and delivered them to our room. This wasn't a problem since we were starving. There are dozens of great restaurants walking distance from the hotel. Another reason we decided on the La Concha. Our room was very nice. Beautiful furnishings and an amazing view. The bathroom was large with plenty of storage. There was not a dresser or drawers, which was interesting since we brought shorts and t-shirts. But there was a shelf in the closet that worked. We stayed in room 811 and had a great view. The undertow is extremely strong here and the beaches are not sandy white--that is just part of Puerto Rico. We never had a problem with the neighborhood. Yes there were panhandlers, but we ignored them and they never bothered us. We were there for the weekend of the 4th and there was always a large police presence. In fact we did the three mile walk (during the day) from La Concha to Old San Juan and never felt unsafe. The lobby bar on Saturday is a happening place! Very lively and loud. But once in our room we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear the noise over the ocean. On Monday there was a band at the plaza next to the hotel that we could hear in our room. But they stopped playing by 7:00 pm. It is a $15 cab ride to Old San Juan, which I thought was a little high, but the fares are regulated. Our only problem: Before going up to our room, we stopped at the lobby bar to have a drink. This was probably our only complaint about the hotel. The service at the bar was not great. The bartender looked right at us and then walked away. Finally, after five or six minutes she came over to help us. We were two of twelve people there. This wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a big deal if she was helping another customer, but she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t . Bottom Line: I would stay here again. The location is fantastic. The neighborhood is convenient and safe for a large city. I am always concerned about the safety of hotels and never felt unsafe here. It is great for a relaxing weekend and group trip. But we arrive places and try to embrace the local culture and fare and not fight it. The front desk, beach attendants, concierge and bell hops were amazing! They all deserve huge kudos.

Our flight was delayed for 3+ hours on Friday night and we did not check into the hotel until 3AM...no problem at all. The lobby was still very lively and check in was a breeze. The room was very nice. It had a small refrigerator and it was very clean. The entire hotel is very well kept. I've read many complaints about the shower, it did not bother me at all. I enjoyed the dual shower heads, they both worked well and the shower was spacious. We were very hungry when we arrived so we went up to the room, showered and went out to get something to eat. Easily found food close by at this hour. After, we stopped by the casino and got back to our room after 6AM. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've slept on at a hotel and the pillows are heavenly!! The view from our room was gorgeous but I missed having a balcony. We had an end unit which did not even have any balcony at all and that was a disappointment. Although, I liked that the large window opened up and I could hear the ocean, just not the same as sitting out on your balcony. We had lunch by the pool at Solera and it was delicious...so was the Sangria and White Lace cocktail :) We spent the day at the adult pool and security did great with not allowing any kids in. This spot of the hotel was very quiet as were many other spots. The property is very large, yet you can find plenty of areas to be alone or be within a crowd if you want, I liked that a lot. Pools were small for such a large resort but we never had a problem getting chairs. For me, the beach is nothing to write home about as it looks like most NY beaches just with a prettier atmosphere, but I expected this and didn't go for the beach. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful. It can get noisy at night, we had a party going on outside our room door one night...early morning actually. I didn't complain to anyone about it. There was another door behind the main room door, so I closed it and that took care of the noise problem. No matter what time we got back to our hotel there was always activity in the pools and the lobby, very lively hotel. We had dinner at Latin Roots in Old San Juan and they had live music and very good food. We had breakfast at Voga and it was very good but not enough. I had Eggs Benedict made with crab cakes and it was supposed to have avocado as well but they didn't have any (??) - it was still excellent but I did leave hungry. We had dinner at Latin Roots in Old San Juan and they had live music and very good food but ran out of Pernil by the time we arrived :( We had lunch across the street from La Concha at Angel Cafe or Cafe Angel (not sure) it was very good Puerto Rican food. Had EXCELLENT Shrimp Mofungo here!! I have to say the absolute BEST meal we had was at Casa Lola - I will be craving that steak for a very long time...the Ropa Vieja Empanadas were soooooooo good and so was the cheese flan. The service by our waiter Juan Carlos was fantastic and the restaurant itself is very pretty with a great atmosphere.

There should be someone from mgmt to address this issue ASAP. People from the hotel sa this and said nothing. Cleaning of the room was ok, could have been better.

She checked us in, made sure our requests as Platinum guests were met, greeted me by name daily, and gave us great advise on food and beaches. The Ocean Lounge serves as the Concierge Lounge. As a Platinum member of the Marriott Reward Program, this is often our favorite place to grab meals and drinks on our various travels. Michael Tischler the Manager was a favorite of my wife and kids, as well as Pablo Rivera, who also worked in the Oceans Lounge. They were truly great guys. The staff as a whole was genuinely pleasant and kind. They were always positive and only spoke well of the Island and its attributes. Our room was fantastic. We had an upgrade to a corner suite, which had a separate kitchen area instead of the typical studio suite. The room was \"laid\" in true Renaissance fashion and every amenity was provided. We could see the ocean without getting out of bed. We went to sleep every night listening to the sound of the ocean waves clapping on the beach. The girls shared the the sofa bed, which was okay with them at 11 and 16 years of age, they had a large flat screen television to themselves. A great aspect of the hotel, and there are many, is that you are literally a few yards from the ocean when you walk off the back patio. There are also 3 pools. The location of the hotel was on the main drag Ashford and the hotel lobby turns into a club at night. Truly a good time, with tourists and locals alike. There is Starbucks located 3 blocks to the right of the hotel when exiting it, next to the Conrad. Ivet and her team were very courteous and kind. After day two, they remembered our drinks. La Concha is located 2 miles from Old San Juan which is similar in architecture and layout to the French Quarter in New Orleans. Saturday Night in Old San Juan is a must. We were about 30 miles from the Rainforest and Caves. We were also able to visit some of the local beaches and eat local food in Pinones' . I suggest renting a car and putting your own personal tours together. The paid tours were very expensive and we were able to view the same attractions for a fraction of the price. Danny's International Restuarant, a few blocks from La Concha has great food, and if we had planned better would have gone to grocery store for food to stock the fridge. Instead we bought snacks and everything from Walgreans. Not the most economical decision. There is a subway and Chilli's walking distance from the hotel. This was our first visit to the Caribbean. La Concha and their staff made us feel special every minute we were there. That was the best choice for hotel and I would not stay anywhere else on the Island if given the opportunity to visit again.

We are in our mid thirties and celebrated out 1 year wedding anniversary here at the end of June. Driving up to the hotel, it is not very impressive from the outside, but it the location was right in the middle of a lot of activity such as restaurants, bars, hotels, shops, food, etc. The staff were all very friendly right from the valet, front desk, wait staff and bar tenders. We were greeted at reception with a glass of champagne which was a nice surprise. I had also emailed the concierge a few days before we arrived about a possible upgrade for our anniversary. Well that email came through! We were upgraded from a partial ocean view room to a full ocean view suite. And it was really beautiful! It was two rooms (1 living room with couch, table and balcony, the other,the bedroom w/ wall to ceiling windows facing the ocean that opened). Both had flat screen 42\" TVs as well. The bathroom was kind of small with not so good lighting. The shower was also very weird. No door so no matter what the floor gets wet. 2 shower heads, 1 an overhead rain one and the other a removable one. We could never get both to work correctly with the same temp at the same time, but it wasnt that big a deal. The hotel itself is very stylish and modern. Lots of color throughout, whether with paint or neon lights. The bar in the lobby huge and serves sushi. On weekends they have a DJ and it got somewhat busy. During the week they have no entertainment until Wednesday and that is just some tango dancers showing off their moves. 3 pools, 2 in a courtyard, 1 an infinity pool over looking the beack. They were nice and refreshing. Although 1 should be deemed an adult only pool if I had my way. There were a lot of kids around. 2 hot tubs were in secluded corners which was cool, but the water was cold in one and just warm in the other. The beach is really nice. I read many reviews about it being rocky but saw not one rock on the beach itself. There were some in the water but not many. The hotel shares some space with a public beach, so you get some locals, but that was fine. The real issue is that the waves are non-stop. You really couldnt just get in the ocean and relax. It was more for boogie boarders and wave jumpers. There are 4 restaurants on site and all fantastic, albeit pretty over-priced. But to be honest, all food in Puerto Rico is pricey. The Perla fine dining resturant was fantastic! They have a 3 course and 5 course frice fixed menu along with their ala carte. We went for the 5 course with wine tasting and everything was great! Get there early and get the middle table over looking the water. Best spot in the house! -We only tried the Italian restauirant for breakfast and the food was pretty good. The buffet was $22 though. -The sushi place has a limited menu, but if Edwin is the cook, he is awesome! Ask him to make you his famous fried rice. Its not on the menu but was the best thing we had there! -The outdoor cafe has an awesome steak wrap for lunch with crispy fries. At night they serve tapas. Try the BBQ on mashed potatos and watermelon ahi tuna. Lastly, this is a great location! There is a park next door that had a festival on sat and sun. Hundreds of locals and visitors brought lounge chairs, coolers and food and listened to jazz one night and an assortment the other. A couple of local Puerto Rican restaurants are within walking distance too. Try the Catfish \"Balls\" right across from the hotel. They are delicious! Dont forget that you can buy snacks, wine, beer and liqour right down past the hotel and park across the street at the market. Its much cheaper than $10 hotel drinks.

The Jr. Suite (king) was very clean and set up wonderfully, perfect for two people. Great ocean views! The beach was clean and the chair/umbrella guys were so friendly! One thing my partner noticed was that many were not tipping these employees. Come on people! These guys spend all day on the hot beach catering to us, take care of them!!! Spent most of the day on the beach and running back and forth to the \"adult\" pool for a change of pace. Really enjoyable. Weekends you will find servers on the beach, but weekdays we had to run up to place and order. No big deal really. Drinks were priced high, but didn't expect them to be low. A bucket of Medalla light (local beer) packed in ice hit the spot and was priced right. The pools were clean, but fairly small compared to other sites in San Juan, but being off season they were never packed. No complaints. Noticed alot of reviews complaining about the house keeping services. We were usually out of our room by 9am and the room was always clean by 1:30 or so. So in other words perfect. I think alot of people leave the room late and expect it done in an hour. Not gonna happpen folks... We did not eat on site much. We have tripped to the Condado area many, many times, so we know alot of off-site places that are more reasonably priced. The pastry/coffee bar in the lobby is expensive and you can get a much better cup of Java at the Duncan Donut a short block from the hotel for alot less $$.. \"Bryan\" will take good care of you... Don't be afraid to venture out and walk the Condado along Ashford St. Many shops and great eats along the way. It's very safe and you will meet and see some very friendly locals. The locals will always give you a smile and a hello. Really, really highly recommend II postino!! Great italian food and the service is impeccable.

Also \"Mikes\" about 2-3 blocks from the hotel has perfect pizza and pasta. My only issue with the service was with the main lobby bar. Not alot of smiles and welcoming attitudes with the bartenders there. The Marriot up the road has great happy hours and the bartenders are full of personality, but of course it's not as \"hip\" as la concha and maybe were just not that hip anymore!

The food was fresh and well-prepared and waitstaff very professional. We had drinks in the lounge outside and at the indoor bar as well - the mojitos were wonderful!! The location is great with access to the beach. There are many good restaurants within walking distance from the hotel and some shopping. The rooms were quiet and the location very safe!

The hotel was immaculate and the staff was seemingly always busy keeping it that way. Very vibrant weekend bar scene at the lobby bar. The food and drinks at the pool were fairly expensive, as expected at a resort. The beach directly adjacent to the property was very nice, although small. We stayed in a junior suite, which was very spacious. The only complaints are that the bed could have been a little more comfortable - the mattress sagged a bit in the middle. Also it was difficult to shower without getting the bathroom floor wet - there is no door, just a pane of glass enclosing half the shower.

We have not been back to PR as a couple, except to pass through the airport. Obviously, the scenery has changed, but not the wonderful people who made our experience 46 years later as great as our original time. Our junior suite was an excellent choice. It gave us more than enough room to move about and storage for our clothing and enough shelf space in the bathroom. We arrived before the 4 pm check in time (about 1 pm) and were told our room was not ready, but that they would call us on cell when it was. They did check our luggage. No call. About 3:30 pm, I went to the desk and they said the room had been ready. Some wasted time. However, Carlos brought our bags up and was very helpful in getting us hangars, showing us various technical things and getting someone there immediately to fix the safe, which is important to us. We then went to the concierge to suggest somewhere close for a quick bite. Ms. Emmanuel hit it right on the mark. It was great. Day two. We went to Level 25 on the mezzanine for breakfast. We were escorted to a table inside(we don't like to eat in the heat) and were welcomed by one of the loveliest people we have ever encountered in a restaurant. ,Tatiana. The food was very good, reasonably priced for a resort area and the service, impeccable. Tatiana took care of us on several occasions and was pleasant and attentive at all times. Her other co-workers were also very attentive. On to the beach. There are many area to enjoy the water and sun. However, all the chairs at the beach and pool are lounges. I need a straight chair and my husband was able to find one that he took to the pool area. This could be an issue for someone who can't use a lounge. We met Oswaldo at the beach, who I believe is a security or beach manager. Again another friendly, helpful person, who is also a very knowledgable person, wanting to tell us about his island. Thanks also to Felix at the front door, who was most helpful in securing cabs and getting us to where we wanted to go. Our biggest disappointment was at Perla restaurant.. Perla was said to be one of the best in San Juan. Service was mediocre. When you have to ask for another cocktail in a first class place???????????. Secondly, my husband ordered the filet mignon. It was priced at $39. A six oz piece of meat, that also had some inedible fat, was served. My husband mentioned to several on the wait staff and the answer was, we have to tell the chef. That was it. We do not like to complain, however, most places will tell you the size of the meat portion. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and it was well worth the 46 year interim. We would definitely recommend LaConcha. PS It has a nice casino.

EVERYONE we encountered was friendly and very helpful. They go out of their way to help. The lobby and poolside areas are just plain stunning. How a resort should look. Never had any issues with lounges by the pools. Plenty of them to go around. All the food and drinks we had were excellent. It may be that we were on vacation with really no worries but we have no complaints with the hotel. I know other reviews say the prices for food and drinks are high. In my opinion they are in line with most resorts but with better quality. It's a very well maintained resort so you are paying for what you get.

The whole computer lock was not functioning properly and the only key that worked was the Managers key (David Flores). This was a bit of an inconvenience. The staff were very accommodating because of these issues and took 50% off of 1 room for the night I was locked out and they also issued me credit towards the hotel stay.

Please keep in mind when reading this that we are in the 40-50 year old age range, and have stayed at many luxury hotels all over the world. Overall, La Concha is definitely one of the nicest hotels to stay in the Condado Beach area of San Juan. The Pros...Check in was easy and the staff was wonderful. Our room was a standard Ocean front King. Great view though I would have preferred a higher floor- we were on the 4th. If you like contemporary furnishings ie..white leather couches then this is for you. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The pool area was very nice, especially the adults only infinity pool. It overlooked the ocean right on the beach. The beach was easy access and no problem getting a chair and an umbrella. The nightlife Thurs, Fri, and Sat. night was unbelievable. There is a bar right in the center of the expansive lobby and packed with beautiful YOUNG people on those nights. Our husbands enjoyed \"the view\" very much. If you are between the ages of 18-30, you will love this. We ate at La Perla for dinner, the food was fantastic. Have the chocolate Martini, OMG. The location of the hotel is nice if you like to walk. There are many good restaurants within walking distance. The Cons...There is no spa in this hotel, we would have enjoyed that. The casino is very small, only a few tables and LOTS of penny slots. The biggest problem for us was the noise level. You cannot get a good nights sleep because you are woken up every few hours by some sort of noise. We woke up to kids screaming at the pool at 7:00am, chirping noises made by the elevators, teens screaming up and down the hallways from 1:00am - 4:00am, and construction noises at 8:00am. The walls are thin and the doors are not insulated for noise. In addition, the bathrooms in the rooms could be larger, the door should not be vented, and the shower was poorly designed. It is open with half a glass wall and water gets all over the floor. Overall...If you are between the ages of 18-30 and love to party, this is the hotel for you.

Jose Rivera (bellman) was the bomb!! He gave us so much info & recommendations. He was never to busy to help either! And we bugged him a lot. Thank u Jose!!! The front desk actually let us check in at 6:30 am! Nine hours early. Did they have to? No! But they did! What a view! We stayed in 915 Ocean Tower (older side). It was roomy, nice, and comphy. The only reason I didnt rate higher is for minor cosmetic reasons like slight erosion on the metal parts of furniture probably from the salt and beach, but it didn't ruin my stay. The shower which was cool with blue LED lights made me giggle. I thought it had a shower door but it was a walk in, some parts of the grout looked stained as if it had not been taken care of very well, but it didnt gross me out! After enjoying a day at their awesome clean beach drinking my own mix of pineapple & rum I had no worries about these cosmetic issues! The beach was sooo awesome! Clean sand, clear blue water, perfect place to just play and relax. Best beach I've been to compared to Mexico. We didn't eat at the hotel. We opted for local nearby spots. Breakfast at Pelaya was amazing! Don Jose was okay, nearby Hibachi was super. Liked having Wendy's & Subway next door for quick cheap eats. Old San Juan was fun! Lots of shopping spots, good local food & drinks. Go early, shops start closing at 6. Eat Monfongo! Don't know the name of the eatery but they have pastries in their window and food was yummy! They are next door to a wholesale jewlery store. If you like Coach then stop to shop while in Old San Juan. Ask for directions! Great prices!! You don't want to skip the store. Avoid Senor Frogs (gross)! My biggest regret was skipping the rainforest. We took a ferry $.50 one way to Bacardi Distillery. No signs or info on getting there so was caught off guard by men loading people in vans to drive people there. But thankfully other tourists gave us the all clear and they were right - all was fine! I feel that tour was a waste of time. Yes it was free & 2 free drinks were nice. If you are a bacardi fan then u will enjoy it. If you only care for souveniers then drink, shop, & leave! Skip the tour its boring! And the ferry leaves every30 minutes so be prepared to sit and wait. Everything and everyone moves slow in PR so it made for a long day with no beach time. The people of PR love to jog at all hours of the day all over town. If u love to run join them! If you don't love running you'll actually consider it when they pass by you and you see how in shape they are. And I must add people of PR are very friendly! PR as a whole is laid back and nice. They could use some govt support and funding to improve cleanliness in the city, repair buildings, especially with such beautiful beaches! While there listen for the sounds of the Coqui frog. They sound like birds - super cool! Oh and last but not least...i traveled with 3 other couples, we all stayed at La Concha, different rooms & towers but all our rooms were nice and none of us had came back with bed bugs! We all stayed 5 days and never saw 1 bug of any type! Angel fish, yes....a lizzard, yes...and an enormous sea turtle made her way to shore at La Concha and laid eggs, something very rare!

I enjoyed a very rare vacation getaway with my best friend of 16 yrs and this resort hotel had everything we were hoping for in a week away. The minute we arrived at La Concha we were swept off our feet by excellent valet staff. Each time we either left or returned the wonderful and lighthearted Felix warmly high-fived and greeted my friend and I. There was much charisma in their staff. Everyone was very helpful and were always asking us how our stay was, if we needed anything thing or just was inquiring of our day. The hotel boasts a handful of \"security\" and staff that casually and quietly monitor the grounds throughout the day and night which made us feel very safe and assured while we enjoyed the pools and the beach well into the wee hours of the morning. This is very important for many female travelers such as ourselves. The lobby is spectacular, and an experience in itself. The lobby hosts a wonderful nightlife with awesome drinks and music and the grounds offer many places to sit, which despite it's open-air layout, allows for private chats and restful moments. This hotel is perfect for that getaway to Puerto Rico when you want sophistication and class without that feeling of being \"stuffy\" or uptight. La Concha was the perfect mix for a great week in San Juan. After enjoying excursions, snorkeling, rainforest exploration, shopping and dining, La Concha was the perfect place to truly call \"home\" for the week. It was more than difficult to leave. The only downside I can pass along is the cost involved when dining and enjoying cocktails within the hotel itself. A mojito I enjoyed poolside was about $12, which really adds us quickly without realizing it. It was an added expense that I should mention to future travelers, particularly ones on a restrictive budget. However, this is to be expected with a luxury hotel. Plan on extra expenses with dining and drinking on site if that is what you desire, we definitely spent way more than intended with our drinks some of the evenings. Overall, La Concha was awesome, and I would not take the time to write this if it wasn't a truly topnotch experience. We were so happy we chose La Concha for our best friends/girls' trip! Excellent!

I am trying to write the most accurate review that I can because when planning our trip to Puerto Rico I struggled and struggled with trying to choose the right hotel. I hope others can benefit from reading about our experience. Check In -The doormen were positive and helpful. Gave us a good first impression of the hotel. -The lobby was quite impressive. It's open layout and beautiful, modern decor made it an inviting place to grab a drink or just sit and people watch. -Check-in went smoothly and before long we were in our ocean view spa suite. Room -My husband and I enjoyed our spa suite in the new Suite Tower. It was very nice to have a large veranda where we could sit and enjoy the sights and sounds of the ocean. I would recommend getting a room in the Suite Tower if possible. -The room decor made for a bit of a \"cold\" feeling. That didn't really bother us but for some reason it just didn't feel very cozy. -It was nice to have a kitchenette that included a refrigerator and microwave as well as plates, silverware... -The bathroom was large but the nearly clear shower wall may not be ideal for those who prefer a little more privacy. The wall is shared with the bedroom. Beach and Pools -Thought the beach was nice. We had heard a lot of less than positive comments about the beach area but we found it to be a nice place to relax and get some sun. The surf was a little rough but we still had fun taking a dip! -The beach is public but it was never really busy. We enjoyed having the chairs and umbrellas provided by the hotel -Would have loved to have food and beverage service on the beach but it was not provided. -We didn't spend very much time in the pool areas but we did enjoy the \"adults only\" pool that was situated right below our room. It was quite and a great place to relax with a book. Food and Drink -This is the area in which I was a bit disappointed. We have been a little spoiled in that we have been fortunate enough to enjoy all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, Jamaica, and St. Lucia. It was so nice not to have to pull money out for every drink and meal... While in Puerto Rico I think we ended up spending an additional $800 on food and drinks for just the two of us. -I knew that drink prices would be high but $24 for rum and cokes at the lobby bar seemed a little excessive. They were mixed with Don Q which is a local rum. -We ate at Solera when we first arrived and we did not find the food to be very good. -We ate at Voga and again the food was average but high priced. -Our best dining experiences were outside of the hotel at Jam Rum Bar, Pizza e Birra, and Fefo's Deli. -Also ate at the Latin Star nearby. It was just ok. Misc. -It is important to realize that La Concha is in an urban area. If you are looking for a more resort type feel you may need to check into hotels outside of the San Juan area. -Early June is apparently Prom time in Puerto Rico and the hotel hosted 3 of them while we were there. The loud music from one of the proms played until 3am and it did keep us awake. -Service at La Concha is good. We had no complaints here. -Would have enjoyed a spa but they do not have one on the property. I did visit Zen Spa across the street and it was very nice. -The reviews are perhaps a little inflated for this hotel. I will not deny that La Concha is a great place to stay, perhaps one of the best on the island, but we have been to hotels in the Caribbean that were more impressive.

I only made that mistake once and the breakfast was included in my rate. The staff at the outdoor bar/restaurant was only slightly better but the thing that was missing was the desire to be helpful or courteous.

The reply was there was no need for a tour because they could provide maps etc.. at the concierge desk. When I asked for maps at the concierge desk after I arrived, they said they could not help with that. They gave me a single page of directions that told you to travel on a main road until you intersected with another road. Only problem was that the two roads identified did not intersect. You had to take a different road to find the second road. The room was clean but it was nothing special - not four star level. The closet door was off the track when we went into the room. We called down because the closet door affected access to a dresser. I was told they would take care of it right away. It was still off the track when we left 4 days later.

The hotel isnt the cheapest around, but iam a firm beleiever you get what you pay for and really did feel we had value for money.

We had a room with an ocean view and it was a really beautiful view. The room itself was clean and decent - standard for a chain hotel (Concha is owned by Marriott). The hotel is well located in Condado, with a nice beach, and close to lots of shops and restaurants. The hotel itself has a very popular bar and is a fun place to have a drink at the bar in the evenings. That said, there is techno music blasting all day long by the pool and beach area. I could barely relax while reading a book in my room or on the beach without hearing this music... so if you're not into being trendy and listening to house 24/7 then this is not the place for you. Also, the pool areas are overcrowded and not very relaxing/quiet. The beach is overrun by locals (including groups of teenagers), so it's a nice place to swim and sunbathe but not to hang out for too long (also, the best beaches near San Juan are not in Condado). If it were just for that, we'd give La Concha a 3, but our room wasn't cleaned in two days! First, our room wasn't fully stocked and we had to call for things like more towels (there was only 1 towel in the bathroom). On the day after we checked in, we left for the rainforest at 8AM. When we got back at 3PM, the room hadn't been cleaned, which we thought was strange. We made a call to the front desk around 5PM to ask for room service, and went downstairs to take a dip. When we came back from the beach, the room still hadn't been cleaned, and we had to take a shower with dirty towels!! On our way out for the evening, around 7 or 8PM, we complained to the concierge and asked them to please send housekeeping to the room. When we got back to our room around midnight (anyone see where this is going?) it still hadn't been cleaned.... just totally unacceptable!!

I picked this hotel based mostly on Tripadvisor reviews, and was not disappointed. The room was not big, but it was perfectly adequate, with a great view of the ocean. Service was smooth and super, super friendly, even when the front desk was crowded. We dined twice at one of their restaurants (Voga), and the food, while pricey, was quite good. Other reviewers complain about housekeeping, but we didn't have any problem at all, and housekeepers seemed to be much quieter than in other hotels I have been to. The pools are small and tend to be a bit crowded, but we were not there for the pool, so no complains there. The beach is not outstanding, and the days we were there the sea was a bit 'unfriendly'-my husband is a strong swimmer and dove in anyway, I stayed closer to the beach. The neighborhood has plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance, and a Walgreens nearby if you forgot your sunscreen (also a liquor store if you want to party in the privacy of your room). We did not have any noise from downstairs in our room on the 9th floor (ocean side). The reception turns into quite the trendy night club at night, with fancily dressed crowds. Sometimes you'll ride the elevator next to some beautifully dressed beautiful people, while returning unshowered from your night kayaking trip. Ahem. On the ugly side, we had 'neighbors' who came back from their party night screaming very late at night. When I opened the door to request silence, I was greeted by a very loud \"F... you.\" I immediately called the front desk, and they assured me they'd send security. No more noises for that night, but the lovely neighbor decided to yell the same words at us while heading out in the morning. Can't blame the hotel for their boorish guests, I guess, they did intervene appropriately. Just be advised that some of the guests here lack in basic manners, or (more likely) cannot handle the liquor they ingest. By the way, Condado has quite an impressive police presence during weekend nights. Wireless was excellent. Parking is either valet or DIY. DIY costs 10$ less, but you have to find your way in the underground parking lot with some unfriendly corners.

The bed was big and comfy however the sofa bed in the room was awful. One member of our group had to sleep in it and said the springs were sticking into her back all night so we had to end up getting an inflatable mattress from the hotel to use. Plus it took about 10 calls to reception/housekeeping to get someone to come and actually make the bed up which they did but then no bedding or comforter was provided which we called about again several times and we had to end up going down to the reception to get bedding at midnight which was annoying. In this respect the service was very poor. Also while we were staying many high schools were having proms in the function rooms and we could hear music on the 8th floor throughout the night. There is a business centre with the new wing so it was helpful that we were able to use the internet there. Pool and beach were also good although the water is pretty rough and the red flag was always up during our stay. Restaurants- the Italian restaurant was amazing and service flawless and food amazing. I wish the same could be said for the eating area by the pool. It took almost 1 hour for our food (just burgers) to come and then when we wanted to pay the bill there was no staff around which was annoying. We were very disappointed by the sevice here. We had the buffet breakfast too which we enjoyed- lots of choice with a waffle and pancake and egg station and the other usual items like pastries, cereal, fruit, toast etc. Puerto Rico is fantastic- we loved old San Juan (about $15 taxi ride from the hotel) and our trip to El Yunque and the city feels very safe and the food is brilliant.

It took like 3 hours for someone to come up and change it... until then I couldn't sit on the bed. Unacceptable! Third issue..... The hotel needs to get all new towels b/c the washing cycle is not quite working for them anymore. We received several dirty towels (which I assumed were washed.... but who knows). I had to call down to the front desk to request new towels b/c there was no way I was using those. Fourth issue....

He couldn't have done better! At the end of our visit we decided the best way to describe this hotel was \"posh\". This was our 3rd trip to PR. We've previously stayed at El Conquistador (in Fajardo) and although it was amazing, he decided it was too far away. The location of this hotel is PERFECT. About a 10 min ($12) cab ride from the airport, great neighborhood, many, many local restaurants and boutiques surrounding the hotel. Although there is not a huge \"main pool\", there are 3 smaller pools, each with their own advantages, and 2 large beach areas. Never had a problem getting a lounge chair which was nice, staff provided as many towels as wanted/needed. My husband and I love to try local foods and 3 out of the 4 days we walked to the local restaurants for breakfast (great food and very reasonable at $4-$8/per person) and less than a 5 min walk in any direction. There is a Subway restaurant directly across from the hotel, and right BEHIND that is an Italian restaurant called \"IL Postino\". Their breakfast was amazing, huge portions. We also had dinner there which was equally as good. Across from Il Postino was a Tapas restaurant that was great, and many little local PR restaurants with good food and GREAT hot sauces. Most of them sell the hot sauce as well to take home. Most of the time we had lunch at \"solera\" which is the restaurant that serves food outside near the pool/lounge area. Never had a bad meal there either. The skirt steak wrap was great, as were all of the salads. Didn't have a burger, but they looked and smelled great. As a side note there is also a Walgreens about 2 blocks to the left after you walk out of the lobby. Great to pick up bottled water for the room, cheese/crackers, or anything else you might need. Spent a few late nights in the casino. Had a good time and ended up ahead which is always nice. A lot of locals come to the casino-was fun to meet and get to know some of them Went into Old San Juan one afternoon to visit our favorite ceviche bar-AquaViva. We discovered it on our first trip to PR and make a point of going back each visit. The open air lobby does turn into more of a \"club scene\" around 10p-11p which we really enjoyed. Loud music, great drinks, lots of beautiful people! Reminded us a lot of South Beach. I can see how it might not be as enjoyable for a different crowd however. We saw LOTS of groups of young women here-It is a great place for a \"girls trip\" and will think about that for next time. And another note to the ladies-bring your highest heels so you don't feel left out. I have never seen hotter OR higher women's shoes! Overall had a wonderful experience, would absolutely come back and stay again, probably bring a group of our friends with us as well. We love PR, don't need our US passports to get there, you feel as though you are in a tropical place (which you are), and most importantly we felt very safe.

The hotel is only about 10 to 15 minutes from the airport, which was nice. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived because we were so early, but the staff was very nice about holding our things while we hit the beach and the room was ready a little while later (2 hours ahead of the regular check in time). The Pros: -Great location. Lots of dining choices around the hotel including Dunkin Donuts right across the street and Starbucks, Cold Stone and Haagen Daz down the block. Lots of liquor and convenience stores too (and a Walgreens) within close walking distance. For dinner I would recommend Ropa Vieja for authentic local cuisine. -Friendly and attentive staff. Everyone from the concierge to the people cleaning the pool said hello with a smile. The waiters were all very prompt with orders, although there seemed to be too few waiters on the beach and at the pools (maybe due to the weather though - lots of thunderstorms). -Lots of seating around the whole resort. Whether you want to hang out in the lobby or by any of the 4 pools, there were always plenty of chairs. (this might not be the case during high season). There were also clusters of outdoor couches with umbrellas that I really liked. Cons: - Rooms: They really weren't anything special. We had an ocean front room in the main building on the 5th floor. We didn't have any problem with noise from the pool or restaurants. However, the carpet was really worn and dirty looking. The bed and pillows were soft and lumpy and the sheets were cheap and kept slipping off the edges of the mattress. (We didn't have any housekeeping issues that others have mentioned) - Decor: I knew going in that this was an art-deco type of aesthetic, which isn't my style. However, aside from that, there was a lot of hardscape and not a lot of tropical decoration with the plants. This is a minor issue, but I just couldn't feel relaxed surrounded by concrete. Also, 3 of the 4 pools are crammed into a small area so it feels a bit claustrophobic. - Internet was painfully slow and at times would not connect the our iPad. Food/Drink: We had lunch by the pool almost every day. The menu is basic, but the food was actually pretty good. I'd recommend the Latin Sliders (chorizo burgers w/mushrooms, bleu cheese and onions). All the sandwiches come with fries, which were delicious. Lunch ranges from $12 to $16 approx. Drinks were very good - not watered down at all. Prices were a bit high, but in line with what I've seen elsewhere. $9 to $14 (and up for wine and champagne). The only dinner we ate at the resort was at La Perla, because we felt we had to try it. The ambiance was very nice and the menu was inventive. A fun twist was the wine list presented on an iPad. The food was just okay though, and certainly not worth the price. We eat out A LOT, and I don't mind spending $200 on dinner. But $32 for THREE shrimp on a small pile of rice is a bit much in my opinion. Overall, the hotel had a nice vibe. It's good for a weekend getaway with friends or your partner. There were even some kids there and they seemed to be having fun although it didn't seem there was a lot for them to do.

We arrived to the hotel by taxi for $18 around 4 pm. Waited just a short while to check in and to my amazement our room was ready. We did inquire about upgrading which they were happy to do, but decided we could spend the money elsewhere. We had a king resort view room with a balcony. Very clean and even had a surround sound for the tv which we could not get to work, but able to listen to the local stations and play our cd (which happened to be in the laptop). sliding doors kept the noise out. The only time we heard people at the pool was on Saturday when more guest had checked in, but even then it was still realitively quiet. Also theWe could also see the ocean from our room and I left my laptop out with no issues. The property is very nice. Two infinity pools within the main resort area, one heated (not as hot as the jacuzzi, but very relaxing) and the one overlooking the ocean is not. We did not get to use that one because of its obvious location and it was usally crowded. Beach was much better than I expected from the other photos posted on here. I would say the 3rd infinity pool on the otherside of Perla Restaurant (which we did not use either) was not as pretty from our view on the beach. They are restoring another hotel next to La Concha and there was some graffiti on that building. But then again that was our view from the beach. The staff was wonderful. I would agree with other posts that service can be a bit slow, but we found this to be true at other places as well. Wendy's down the street was by far the slowest. Luis on the beach set up our lounges and umbrella and we tipped. The next day we just found an open spot and sat down. Service is also available on the beach, but you may wait a little while. Felix in the lobby was also great. He secured our bags for us after checkout while we waited until it was time to leave for the airport. The concierge, I think his name was Robert was awesome. The hotel has a neat touch screen at the desk where you can look up area restaurants or other activities. Omar was one of our favs who waited on us in the pool area. The fight was Saturday night and the casino was packed with spectators. We went to La Isla Verde for the evening and by the time we returned around 3 am, the casion was still packed. The bar in the lobby had just closed, but there was still quite a few people enjoying the evening. I would have loved a club in the hotel, but the manager explained to us that not all guests would agree. For me being on vacation without kids and having a place to party all in one would have been great. My only other complaint would be the bathroom. Very lovely, but no fan and not much privacy with the the frosted glass in the door. I agree with other posts that water from the shower does get on the floor, but hey put down a towel. Overall this was a great trip. We enjoyed the hotel so much that we hardly did any of the other activities we had planned. This was truly a vacation in that we simply did nothing but lay out at the beach or pool and relax by day. We enjoyed the nightlife in the area and La Isla Verde. We rested on the beds in the shade at the beach. Weather was perfect, not too hot and very pleasant in the evening. I would definitely recommend the sliders even though pricey for 3, they were delicious. Very contemporary look and feel. Many couples and a few families. I will definitely return.

Overall we liked the hotel. Good things: Proximity to bars/restaurants, concierge and staff down at the entrance, fitness center Bad things: Not enough umbrellas at the pools. Sounds like a minor detail but when the sun is pouring down and there's no shade to be found, it is a big deal!!! Fitness Center: Gets busy by 9 AM but has reasonable selection of cardio equipment and weights AND they don't charge extra to use it!!! Location: The location was great for walking to restaurants and bars, and the Walgreens and Starbucks just up the road saved us loads of money on breakfast. However, our Bio Bay excursion (East Island Company) was marred by a terribly long travel time to Fajardo. They picked us up at 3PM and we were not dropped off at the hotel until midnight. Rooms: We stayed in the main hotel with an oceanfront view. While I did miss having a balcony, the tall windows opened up widely allowing for a feel of open air. The carpeting was dirty and the room was dated. I do recommend an ocean view on a level at least as high as the 6th floor. Otherwise the noise from the beach and from La Perla could keep you awake at night. Housekeeping: The most common complaint I'd seen on tripadvisor (aside from the noise of the bar area, which was not a problem) was inability to get the room cleaned in a timely manner. We only had one day where we had sent housekeeping away when they first came at 8AM (what?!) and then didn't get the room cleaned until 5PM, even with a phone call to the front desk at 3PM requesting it be cleaned. When our sink wasn't draining well, we called and had a handful of gentlemen up and working on the problem within minutes. Very pleased with the service there. Food: We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants aside from one lunch out by the pool. The portions were good as was the quality of the food. Prices were a bit steep but what I would expect from a poolside restaurant. Restaurants/Bars: You MUST walk down to Rum Bar and Bistro. Sunday nights they have half off all wine/beer/drinks and Monday night they have half off all food. Seriously do NOT miss this place. Beef carpaccio appetizer, bread with garlic butter, halibut ceviche and halibut entree....all to die for. Bob Marley drink and Agua de Coco mojitos were phenomenal. Marmalade is sister restaurant to Rum. More formal and more pricey but still delicious and worth the money (in Old San Juan). Across the street, Cafe del Angel has a wonderful bartender named Eduardo who made us up some nice tasty and strong mojitos. Noise: Not an issue, even on Friday and Saturday nights.

Originally we had booked 2 junior suites in the original building. A bell hop brought up our bags and told us where to get food and liquor for the room as well as get our radio going with the best Puerto Rico radio station. We had dinner at Solera on Friday night outside on the lounge chairs - 3 big tapas was the perfect amount of food with a pitcher of sangria. I recomend the Paella and the nachos. Really great and just the right amount of food and drink. On Saturday we managed to be on the beach for 1.5 hours before the rain came in. So we had lunch and drinks at the lobby bar and everyone at the bar were offered blue shots (I'm assuming vodka) because of the rain. So we napped and got ready for dinner at Volga. Again, outstanding food and service. Then we hit the lobby bar which turned into quite the scene! Met a lot of interesting people, many of which were local. After realizing the best beach time was in the morning, we hit the beach early then did a spa day at Zen Spa across the street. I don't recommend that place, most of the girls were disappointed in their treatments. Headed to BLT Steak for dinner at the Ritz Carlton that night but only because it was on someone else's dime. Good food, but honestly, you really don't feel like you are in Puerto Rico. Fancy but too stuffy and not fun.

As we arrived back at the hotel, Victor eased our worries by recommending other locations and even told us to go relax and have fun while he calls some places for us and sets us up! We were able to have a wonderful time the next day zip lining and it's an experience that the girls and myself will never forget!!!!

I used TripAdvisor to find a reasonably priced, upscale hotel that was on the beach, and we gave this one a go. For what we needed, we loved it. Ocean view was fabulous, room was basic but nice, and the fitness center was AWESOME. The only downside I heard from my friend was that room service as spotty and the food wasn't great, but you want to get out of the hotel anyway. The staff was friendly and seemed to want you to enjoy your stay. I had a massage by the pool which was nice. If I had only one complaint it's that the infinity pool on the ocean was supposed to be adults only and was swarming with kids. They should have someone watching that or at least post some signage. There is plenty of room for the kids in the larger, main pool area. The adults need somewhere to relax!

Gorgeous mid-century modern tropical hotel unparalled in its renovated design aesthetic and detailing (I'm an architectural interior designer). So clean and well-kept -- not a spec of dust or an insect noticed in 5 days! Staff was incredibly accomodating (front desk upgraded us), housekeeping was very attentive, restaurants/health club/beach/security/port-cochere staff always smiling and very, very helpful. Food was tremendous at the pool and gardens restaurant \"Solera\". Perla was quite an experience with very gracious and accomodating staff there as well. Beachfront property was absolutely wonderful too. Very close to stores and great restaurants. Minor issues: many little kids (0-5 yrs) - - the hotel should really have more than one adult pool available (the adult pool is a bit away from the action, lacked ambiance, and is waaaay too close to adjacent construction. This construction is no fault of the hotel's and was really only bothersome for one morning on the beach. The two of the main pools central to the hotel are heated - - that seemed very strange as when you are baking in 85+ heat w/extreme UV's you need to cool down your skin in the pool - - not heat it up. Also, the two main pools are loud with lots of drinking and little kiddies w/parents in the pool and we didnt find that relaxing at all. Also, the trade winds at the beach and the adjacent infinity pool are stronger and keep you much cooler. Adjoining Casino was more than fine as we are light gamblers (not many tables open for more active players). Thurs eves many biz functions make use of the property's various function rooms - - but it adds to the lobby vibe at night w/many attractive and well dressed local professionals arriving in their evening best. Friday was a big party night in the lobby but I loved the vibe - - loud but not obnoxiously loud like poolside in Las Vegas! The adjacent street is loud at night (even boisterous at times) so request a high floor/ocean view at all times (you might regret any city views or non-ocean views at this hotel).

He recommended a great place for breakfast in Old San Juan called \"La Bonbonera\", thanks Carlos. Great professionalism and genuine love for his job and the culture of people that surround him.

I mean the lobby presented: marble floors, sky lounge style bar and very chic italian leather seating and much more...We stayed in the mini suite which was very plush, sunk in jet stream tub with a frost glass casing. Oh and two very nice size flat screen tv's with one mounted on the wall. The Ocean view was breathtaking. Me and my wife watch the sunset every night like two teenagers on lovers-lane. La Concha staff couldn't have been more helpful. I needed a USB cord for my laptop and like magic they appeared at my door in minutes. The young ladies at the front desk made sure no patrons were left unattented to when we first arrived. I mean it was so perfect I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop (I'm a New Yorker) so pardon me. I'm so glad we brought some night clothes because these people were dress to impress. The lobby of the hotel has a Upper Manhattan/South Beach style sky lounge that turns into a nightclub. Not annoying with extremely loud music where you can barely hold a conversation with wall to wall traffic. The music is techno/fusion, more of a backdrop for the scene. The restaraunts are very nice as well. We ate at Voga which was very goood for the price we thought. The rest of our stay we ate along the strip on Ashfurd AVE. That's another pro to staying here, you are not confined to the grounds, there's plenty of other options. Oh fellas, be sure to where your darkest pair of shades, your eyes will wonder (no getting around it) the women are beautiful! From the ones cleaning your rooms, bartending, front desk etc they're all knockouts! My wife and I have been together 20 years so it's nothing new for us but to you newbies just be sure to where shades to hide your roaming eyes.

So I hope this helps you chose based on what's important to you! Location: Pros - right in the heart of San Juan, very safe to walk either right or left out of hotel, various restaurants and price ranges to chose from. Probably the best central location of all the resorts, really nice area of San Juan, except for the BEACH.... Cons - Beach is borderline terrible (so chose location wisely - could be the deal breaker :) Although pretty to see the waves crashing on the rocks, rough waters, lots of seaweed, and not a vibrant beach scene. It's just not a nice, tropical beach. The pool is nothing special (especially if you like an active pool scene, tropical drinks/music, swim up bar, etc.). Hotel: Pros - lobby is definately jumping, seems like the place to be. Good nightlife, people watching (there was a fashion show when we were there, spotted Rosie Perez, NBA cheerleaders staying there (doing a promo at the mall)). Cons - not casual/relaxing/low-key place; felt like after a long day couldn't throw on t-shirt and flip flops and just hang out and get a beer. So this is obviously personal preference, just wasn't our scene. But if you like to get dressed up every night, mingle among the hip, techno at night, and you are ok with paying $30 for 2 drinks than this may be for you....We don't mind for one night but certainly not an entire stay (we are also 40 yrs old so been there/done that, lol). Rooms: Pros - Jr suite was the equivalent of a small apt in NYC; very clean consistent maid service; flat screen TV with all the regular cable channels, plentiful aveda products, nice closet system to stay organized, ocean view room was right on beach, could hear waves crashing at night. Very scenic views. Cons - NOISY. Constantly reminded in the city, buses, motorcycles, early morning construction of some sort (7am). if you open balcony door at night, the sound of ocean can override (which is a pleasant sound!), but if it gets hot, then you have to close door... Food: Pros - Only ate 2 places (pool and Perla), both very good. Perla was very nice (possibly the best Sangria I have ever had). Service was excellent. Cons - expensive ($70 for lunch: salad, sliders, and 4 beers); ($120 for dinner: no apps, 2 small meals, split one dessert and 2 drinks). Fine for a day or two, not every day. Venture out - plenty of places to chose from... Staff: Pros - Awesome people. Genuinely friendly, welcoming, desire to help you enjoy your stay. You'll see Felix's name mentioned a lot in reviews.... Cons - this place is busy, so it's hard to get a personal connection with the hotel or staff. you will wait to check in, wait in line to talk to concierge or talk to guys at cab station for advice, etc. Overall - it's not as though there is anything \"wrong\" with the hotel, It's definately more personal preference on what area of San Juan to stay in. If you want to be in the city and feel like you are in the thick of things, don't care about money, then stay here. If you still want to be centrally located, save a few bucks, try the Marriott. If you like this area, but want a little more quiet, I would consider the Conrad. IF you are going to Puerto Rico for a relaxing, Caribbean-type experience, I would strongly consider staying in the Isla Verde area. The ESJ or Intercontinental. ESJ crowd average age seemed to range from 20s to 50s, while the Intercontinental was 30s - 70s. The beach there was very nice; warm tranquil water, some areas of shade by palm trees, areas by the hotels had a vibrant beach scene, also quiet areas to chose from. Pool at the ESJ was gorgeous and very lively at the swim up bar but they also had a 2nd quieter pool. The area of Isla Verde is not as nice as Condado though, as far as shops, restaurants, etc. Walking around Isla Verde was more strip-mall-ish.

The thing that struck me...everyone we met on the tours/charters were disapointed in their hotel choice. They all wished they had booked La Concha, and were using the La Concha facilities during the day. Bottom Line...this is a resort, and you will pay resort-like prices...La Concha is worth every penny if you stay in the Suite Tower.

Our immediate impression upon walking in was beautiful. The lobby was bright, open, inviting and a buzz with activity. Check in went smoothly, although not speedy. Our room was a king, ocean view with a full size sliding window overlooking the beach, pool and ocean. The view was breathtaking and it is the thing I miss the most about Puerto Rico. The room was extremely clean, modern and overall very comfortable. The small couch and chair in the room was not really something you could sink into and relax, but we didn't spend a ton of time in the room. During our stay we ate in several of the restaurants and bar. All areas were extremely clean. The servers were all very friendly and attentive once they finally got to you, but initial service and check time were very slow. I don't know if it was the relaxed atmosphere or just the way things are. The breakfast food was . . . well breakfast food, not bad, but okay. If you eat outside though, watch for the pigeons. The staff does a good job of keeping them at bay, but don't walk away from your food unless you are done eating. We really enjoyed our lunch out in the Tapas Lounge area and the dinner that we had at Voga (Level 25) was fantastic. We visited each of the pool areas on the property as well as the beach, all were cleaned daily and very relaxing. Towels were available in several areas, beverages were served pool side and beach side (on one side of the resort). If visiting with young children, watch the surf on the beach, it can get rough. During our visit, my husband and Luis (the young man assisting guests with chairs) had to save a drowning boy who had ventured out too far in the waves. The beach was very beautiful and for the most part extremely relaxing. Our room cost was what I would deem within reason for this type of resort considering the view that we had. Just prepare to have extra cash for tips. We used the valet parking service, room service, cleaning services, beach chair services, and towel services. Granted you don't have to tip each of these people, but we wanted to and it definitely adds up. Overall we were so very pleased with our stay at the La Concha resort. It was a surprise 50th birthday gift for my husband, he had no idea until 2 days before we left.

It was very clean, the bed was good, there was a big flat screen and the walk in shower was nice. The hotel offers many food options. Simple bar food, sushi, Italian to more fine dining. We only had the more bar type food which was surprisingly excellent. Probably the best hotel bar food i have ever had. Burgers, quesedillas, steak were all excellent. Cocktails were also good although there were a couple of occasions where i think they might have held back on the alcohol a bit. Beach was awesome and not crowded at all. At times felt like being on your own private beach. There are a few pools to choose from as well as a hot tub and the overall layout of the hotel is a bit more interesting that normal.

We had an ocean front suite in the new building- came complete with a lounge, fantastic bath & spacious bedroom. The water pressure could have been a bit stronger, but I understand the need to conserve. The view was fantastic, the sound of the ocean lulled us into a deep sleep nightly, then the A/C kicked on- a bit on the noisy side for such a new building- but again- I understand the need to conserve...... Room had a full sized fridge with ice maker that was well utilized. Bottled H2o changed daily & used glasses replaced. Handy radios in the room with Ipod hookups- great for cocktails on the patio with music. Although the one in the bedroom needed to be moved to the workstation (remember to reset the clock when you move it back........ Learned the hard way :) Bed was comfortable & adequate, nice linens were changed daily (I know.....) Needed to ask for some foam pillows as the down ones were way too soft- easy. On the other hand- I dont think our room was swept or vacuumed daily as there was a wad of something on the tile that was there for a few days- we left it to see if anyone noticed. Bathroom was wiped daily & toiletries replenished daily (Aveda products). When we arrived late on our 1st night we ordered room service- 2 items that were easy- but took ages & were quite spendy & not great...... Lesson learned.... Ate out rest of the time. Pools are great- although if you do not want to be annoyed by screaming kids- opt for the pool in the new building. When we were there & the all ages pool there was literally a screaming contest by all the kids........ The adult infinity pool is right on the beach & they start serving delightful cocktails @ 11AM. Get your chairs early though- we witnessed a few \"kerfuffles\" over chairs that had been \"saved\" early in the AM & not occupied until HOURS later....... Great beach, comfy chairs & nice umbrellas & drink & food service on the beach- Order the steak wrap with carmelized onions- it was great. The lobby bar gets HOPPIN on weekends- great hip decor & music- as well as sofa service out by the pool. Overall a great stay, helpful, happy staff.

Later in the week we moved to the regular rooms because additional people came and the suite just had a small sofabed- not large as advertised.

Good: 1. A great location with good restaurants nearby. Also a walgreens and other stores within walking distance. The are around the hotel seemed safe as well. 2. An OK beach right out back. The beach was small, but big enough. The waves can be a bit strong, but it is the Atlantic side so should be expected. 3. Restaurants seemed nice but we did not partake in them. 4, Great front desk staff. The gentleman that checked us in was great. He saw I was a Marriott Gold member and even though we were on a reward travel, still upgraded us from a standard room to a suite. As our room was not ready he offered us a free drink at the lobby bar. 5. The rooms were recently renovated. We only stayed for a night, but there was a nice kitchenette with a full sized built in fridge. 2 flat screens and nice modern style furniture. 6. Free internet which is a rarity for the top of the brand hotels. For some strange reason, the bargain hotels in a brand's line (Courtyard, Springhill Suites) give free internet while the expensive hotels (JW Marriott, Renaissance) make you pay for it. The not so good: 1. Our room was not ready at 4 when we checked in although check in time is supposed to be 4pm. This was hard because we had to get up at 3:30am to get our flight to get down here and by 4pm we were more than ready to be in the room and having to sit around for an hour (even with the free drink) was annoying. 2. We asked the bell man to get us sheets for the pullout bed, but they never showed up. 3. We had to call housekeeping 2 times to get them to bring up the sheets. 4. Noise. Everyone has a different noise threshold. Mine is pretty high, but on the ninth floor overlooking the pool we could plainly hear loud music until fairly late into the night. We could also hear all of the street sounds, honking, loud motorcycles, car alarms, screaming, etc. This went on until, well, right now as I am writing this review at 5:30am! 5. The aircon unit is also a bit on the loud side, but many hotels have this problem and I am used to that! 6. The beach does have public acess so do keep an eye on any valuables! That is a general comment for everywhere. 7. This is a small critique, but why would there only be one bathrobe in the room? 8. The bathroom is crazy! It is all glassed in to the room. I could not take a shower unless my daughter was in the front room of the suite or she would be able to see me in the shower! Also, if you had to get up in the middle of the night, you could not turn on the bathroom light or you would illuminate the entire bedroom! Designers, think before you do these things!

We'd been to San Juan as a couple, but not with the kids. As we were searching for hotels, we came upon La Concha and liked everything we saw. But the hotel's website along with TripAdvisor reviews left me just a little uneasy if it'd be kid appropriate. We travel a bunch with them and are sensitive to making sure they can have fun in any situation. Rest assured...it is just fine for kids (mine are 5 and 2). While it definitely caters to a young/hip audience, it's not family un-friendly. I love that it's not a Disney type resort with animated everything and mini golf in the courtyard. As long as your kids can make fun with sand, beach and pools - they'll be just fine. Get a room in the Suite Tower if you have kids - full ocean view is worth the upgrade. It's over 500 sq. ft. with a nice family room/kitchenette separate from the sleeping space which is perfect for breakfast/lunch/happy hour. Staff is warm and friendly and willing to help. Only downside is the speed of the housekeeping as noted by several other reviews. We waited for 2 hours the first night for an air mattress for one of the kids (they don't do rollaways) which was a little painful as the kids were ready for bed.

The lobby area was spacious which made relaxing and waiting for friends and family a delight. The food by the pool area was excellent.

A great getaway!\u201d", "Author": "halleymonkey", "ReviewID": "UR104317158", "Content": "I stayed at La Concha to get away and relax for a few days. And it didn't disappoint. I consider myself pretty particular about things, so for me to say it was a wonderful experience, means they are doing a whole lot right. I knew I would be paying more than I wanted to spend but what's important to me was quality - getting what I paid for. And I got that at La Concha. I ended up upgrading to an ocean front room for $25 extra a night. For me, personally, it was worth $100 to be able to sleep to the sound of the ocean and wake to the view of the ocean. If you don't like a loud ocean (eg waves crashing), you'll either want to book a room away from the ocean (partial-ocean view) or close your window at night. Also (and I loved this because I'm not a fan of a/c and I think it's environmentally progressive) the a/c automatically shuts off if the window or sliding door is open. So that may be a problem if you want the a/c on while you hear the ocean - because it ain't gonna happen. Ok, so the rooms are HUGE. They're all suites with two separate rooms. I stayed in the older tower the first night and the newer tower the remaining nights. Both were great. The only difference is the new tower rooms all have kitchenettes (I say kitchenette because it's not a separate room. It's in the living room but it's got a full-size fridge/freezer, sink, and two electric burners with fully stocked utensils, cookware, plateware and glasses. I was really impressed. I didn't cook like I intended to save money, but what I did instead was eat out and then bring home leftovers for a second meal (made my dollar go further) and heat them up on the stove. The rooms are beautifully designed. I always seek out well designed hotels and this one impressed me. The bathroom was big, the shower was big and had the rainforest shower heads as well as a regular shower head. All Aveda products. There's also an iHome docking station in each room for your iPods and iPhones. I stayed in room 751 in the new tower - the pictures are of that room. Very clean, an excellent room overall. No complaints. The first night I stayed in the old tower room 724 - it's a corner suite and also impressive and well designed. I loved both. Speaking of love, Felix at the entrance was a highlight. A great guy. Always smiling and time to stop to say hi, give me a high five and a lovely compliment about how I looked. He seems to love what he does, and it shows. He's an asset to La Concha. I gave him a big hug when I left. Thanks, Felix! I kept hearing that La Concha is THE hot spot. Not that I was looking for that (I went to San Juan to relax and sleep), but then I got kind of excited at the idea of the night life there. I was underwhelmed. Even on Thursday and Friday night it was flat. I mean, there were people at the bar but mostly tourists and bar flys - not the local scene with the hot, trendy flavor of San Juan and beautiful people (mostly middle age couples, families, and some bar fly business types). Y'know, it was ok, but not at caliente as they hyped it to be. Maybe it was just an off weekend. With that said - on the quieter side, I enjoyed it. They had a jazz quartet play in the pool area. They were fabulous. And to sit out there in the balmy evening temps, with a drink - it was lovely. It's a classy joint. I'd defo recommend this place! If you like value for money (and by that I don't mean saving money or cheap prices) then you'll like La Concha. You pay for it, but they make it worth it. I was really impressed and enjoyed my stay! A few tips: 1) if you want to go to old San Juan, take the bus instead of a cab. The bus stop is right outside the entrance of the hotel and it's only $0.75 (coins only). It's a great way to see SJ. Also, the cabs all work by zone fares now. You can find them online. Or just ask at the front desk - no more getting ripped off as tourists. 2) The breakfast bar is spendy ($3 coffee). If you go on the street, the Starbucks is spendier ($4 for a coffee). But the Dunkin Donuts across the street is regular price ($1.50 for a coffee, $1.50 for a sausage and egg sandwich, $1 per donut)! 3) The restaurant just down the street from the hotel - budathai - has a cilantro margarita that's increds. First, I've never had a cilantro margarita. Second, why hasn't this drink caught on like the mojito?", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayne, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful view but not the cleanest.\u201d", "Author": "jerseyTraveler17", "ReviewID": "UR104305351", "Content": "For the most part The Marriott staff were very friendly.

These weren't what I would call nice places, either. We joked that they must have a different menu for tourist where all the prices are jacked up! Crazy! Anyways, Puerto Rico is wonderful and I was so impressed by San Juan's cleanliness. Everywhere we went there were city employees cleaning and maintaing. Also - recycling bins on the public beaches - great!

Upon our arrival in the middle of the night, we were pleasantly greeted and welcomed to the most gorgeous hotel I have ever seen. Waterfalls and sleek leather furniture surround the lobby giving it a contemporary atmosphere. We checked in to our amazing ocean view room and immediately went out the back door to the beach. During our stay, every member of the staff at La Concha were more than willing to help with our every request. One gentleman in particular, Victor, was so kind and helpful that I began to turn to him specifically for all of our queries. He went above and beyond to get me the things I needed. He was extremely knowledgable of the island's hot spots, night life, fine dining and he even helped us book all of our outdoor excursions. If you are a person who travels, you are always hesitant on where to stay and what to do if you have never been there.

We booked a special rate and got a Junior suite with an oceanview room. Upon arrival at 1:30 our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready so we had lunch near the pool and waiting an hour or so. The room was available at about 3:00PM. The room we had was on the 10th floor and the elevators were right in the main part of the hotel. Our room was gorgeous! Our friends were staying at the hotel also and we had seen their room which was smaller but still nice with a kitchenette in it. The room was very clean and the bathroom carried a lot of bath products. However we were missing tissues. Since we were staying only one night we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unpack anything but there was a lot of storage space. When we entered the room we entered the living room with a pull out couch and several soft chairs. This room also had a dining room table and 4 chairs. The outside balcony also had a table with 4 chairs. The bathroom had a walk in shower. In the Bedroom, in addition to the bed there was also a chaise lounge that you could lie down on and watch the ocean through the floor to ceiling glass windows. The room included an iPod on the side of the bed and the bed was very comfortable. We had lunch dinner and breakfast at the hotel and each was very good. There is also a casino in house. My one complaint is that there is a beautiful bar right in the center of the lobby and it is staffed by a large group of bartenders however, each of them seemed really inept at serving people. We waited almost 20 minutes on one side of the bar while they only catered to a small section of the opposite side of the bar. Additionally, with the high price of drinks at this place you expected the drinks to be good, unfortunately, they were very weak. There is a small gym on the property. It only contained dumbbells which went up to 50lbs and a few machines. There were about 3 or 4 treadmills, a couple of ellipticals and one or two bikes. Apparently they offer spinning classes because they had a studio with several bikes in it but I never saw any class going on. The hotel/resort has three pools which were very nice. The infinity pool near the ocean was a favorite of mine. I was surprised at the amount of children at the hotel. The hotel lists itself as not being child friendly yet there were quite a bit of parents with babies in all the pools, not really attractive if you are a young single.

I booked this hotel because of its location and its suites. These two features turned out to be what we enjoyed the most but we found the hotel to be lacking in other areas. I liked the fact that my son could sleep on the pull out sofa with his own tv and I could sleep in the bedroom and watch my own tv. I also liked that our room had a small kitchen with amenities - refrigerator, freezer, small range, dishes, etc., and a small seating area. The hotel is very contemporary and close to things you might need/want - Walgreens for snacks, Starbucks for coffee, restaurants, etc. However, for the price, I found the customer service to be inconsistent or just not what it should be. The front desk never told me that I would be charged a $36 resort fee per night. They also never told me that when I checked in they would hold the whole estimated amount of my stay to my credit card plus $100 per night for incidentials. When I found out about this, the front desk clerk told me that I would have a credit with the hotel if I didn't use it...forget about the fact that I might have wanted to use this credit line for other things on my trip. (P.S. Don't trust the video account review that you view on your tv - for the first two days, it had someone else's information on it.) We stayed in the suite tower. The name is somewhat misleading because the rooms actually surround an atrium. We came home after walking all over Old San Juan all day only to find that our room had not been cleaned AND the hotel booked an event in atrium so we could hear the noise from that group while we were in our room. After waiting 30 minutes after my call to housekeeping, I went downstairs to speak with manager. To her credit, someone finally came to clean our room and by 8:45, folks were clearing out of the atrium. However, I find it annoying that they booked a group in the atrium without regard for the hotel guests. There's an outside sitting area and pool for guests of the suites tower to use. However, we couldn't use that one afternoon/evening because they booked it for yet another an event! In general, housekeeping is either hit or miss in quality...so some days our room was cleaner than others despite that we left a tip every day. The air conditioning in the room is very loud but we eventually got used to it. The other reviews about the ocean are accurate - the surf was too rough for swimming. We were looking forward to spending time in the pools but never did - the three pools are small rectangles and the water in them is cold because they are in the shadow of the building and don't get much sun and the pool area is very shaded with trees. A MAJOR disappointment for us given that we wanted to spend at least one day by the pool. If I'm paying for certain amenities, I expect to be able to use them. All in all, a mixed review for La Concha so I'm not sure I would stay there again. We rented a car from Hertz with a navigation system and were able to do a lot on our own without paying for tours. We drove to the rain forest, the Bacardi factory, and to the marina for a speed boat tour with East Island Tours to Culebra to snorkel and go to Flamenco Beach. That tour was awesome and highly recommended!

Everything had been recently renovated, but a lot of the renovations seemed shoddy and not well-maintained. The staff was very friendly, but there were definite lapses in service while we were there. For example, we arrived late at night and there was only one person at the check-in desk. The person in line before us had some kind of problem, so we had to wait for over 30 minutes to get checked in. And then they did not have the type of room we had reserved (king bed, ocean view) available. They said that one would be available the next day, but it's annoying to have to move. They did give us a discount on the first night (after I insisted), but it was still annoying. Then, when the new room was ready the next day (at about 1pm, when we were of course at the pool), I asked if we could wait to move so that I could enjoy the pool and the staff person I spoke to said I should move right away \"because then the hotel could rent out the room\" we were currently in - as if that should be my main concern. I wound up packing up our stuff just to get it over with, but I had to call more than once to get someone to come pick up our bags and move them to the new room. None of these things were fatal to our experience, but they all indicate a lack of attention to detail. As another example, the hotel has free wi-fi, but it worked horribly. I could not get my ipad to connect long enough to check the weather, let alone go to a web page. On the plus side, the pool and beach areas were absolutely lovely, and the food was very good (although expensive - ask about prices before you order). People also seemed to really like the bar/nightlife in the lobby (though we didn't partake). The Walgreens right down the street was also great for buying extra bottles of water and snacks. Also, we were there for the Ironman 70.3 San Juan triathlon, and the hotel was fairly convenient to that, and a nice place to come back to post-race (though in the future I would stay closer to the race venue).

The Condado area has lots of restaurants, hotels, shops and seems relatively safe to walk anywhere (unlike Isla Verde). Don't expect PR to be cheap like other islands - the cost of everything here was comparable to a regular metropolitan city in the states. Best of all, you dont have to convert your currency! At La Concha, the lobby is a clean, open air, trendy palette of white. The lobby bar is quite big and inviting and sits between the front desk, elevators and the outside patio that leads to the pools and beach. There are several restaurants in the hotel, but I only had the continental breakfast in the lobby every morning - food pretty decent. The pool doesn't seem to get a lot of sun and does have a lot of comfortable shaded areas. Nice place to unwind and read a book. Our room was on the first floor of the cabana building and sitting on our balcony, we seemed to be in the heart of all the action. Because we overlooked the pool area, we did hear the music til about 6 am every morning. The casino was a good size and was always clean. All in all, we absolutely enjoyed our stay at La Concha. Service, location and the hotel itself were all fantastic.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bellmore, New York", "Title": "\u201cHip Sexy Vibe\u201d", "Author": "jenesis105", "ReviewID": "UR101322045", "Content": "We stay in San Juan 3-4 times a year, usually for holidays, birthdays, cruises etc. Our first day down here we always start with lunch out side by the pool under a big umbrella amid the tropical plants. its a beautiful setting and the waitstaff are so sweet and helpful.

We had already researched and eaten at many of the authentic and delicious restaurants in the San Juan area and wanted to make sure we didn't miss any good food during our last two days. Francisco (Frankie) spent forever brainstorming and helping us find the best culinary experiences possible for our remaining two days, including arranging a trip to Guavate to get the island's best roast pork. Louise also spent a long time making sure we didn't waste a meal. These two were incredible, and by far the best concierge I have ever encountered.

I chose this hotel primarily because of the reviews I read on trip advisor. It is a very nice hotel in an excellent location. The strengths of the hotel include its 4 pools, cleanliness, beach location and atmosphere for making new friends and acquaintances. The negatives include very slow pool and ocean side bar service as we had to get drinks a number of times ourselves simply because no server came around. (If I were in college I would take a summer job here and make a fortune as the servers appear to be very poorly motivated to sell drinks and thus make tips. I just didn't understand the lack of pool and ocean side service.) We tried the breakfast buffet our first morning and we didn't come back. Generally, the breafast buffets at Marriott hotels are excellent but this one was lacking in food and good quality. It is definitely not worth 50 dollars for two. However we did have breakfast delivered to our rooms several times and it was all very good and timely delivered. We had a fantastic dinner at Perlas restaurant which is located in the hotel. I recommend it highly for food quality, ambiance and service. Try and get a table next to the large windows facing the ocean. The hotel did not have a spa which most 4 star properties offer in resort areas like San Juan. The pop machine on our floor was never filled up the whole time we stayed at the hotel again another loss of revenue for the hotel. We made a couple of trips to Walgreens nearby to stock up on cokes, etc. It was also disappointing that room service ended at 11 pam. I would have expected 24 hour room service but alas, it was not to be. Housekeeping was difficult to figure out as we had to call several times to get our room cleaned but they always timely responded. Some food was left in the room refrigerator from the previous guests so we just tossed it. I do recommend ocean view rooms as the view is awesome. I would also get room as high up as possible. Sometimes, particularly on the weekends it can get pretty noisy in the hotel lobby bar. This hotel is the \"in place\" to be for week end partying. I knew this based upon reading prior reviews so we were prepared for it. We like to have a good time too even though we are in our 50's but some people complained. La Concha is not the kind of hotel I would recommend for a nice quiet get away. It is a happening place which we enjoyed. Most of the guests were in their 20's, 30's and 40's. I also recommend the \"Latin Sliders\" for simple bar food. These are a combination of hamburger and pook and are really delicious. We tried a fajita sandwhich however which was not edible. The hotel is host to several weddings a weekend and as a result some of the pool areas get blocked for the wedding guests which means hotel guests have to find another place to relax. This was somewhat inconvenient but there were enough pools and the beach to accomodate the inconvenience. All in all we had a terrific time and we would definitely go back to the La Concha. I would give it a minimum 4 star rating which could be easlily improved if the management paid more attention and corrected the deficiencies noted in this post.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood Property, But Service Lacking\u201d", "Author": "Jackcatscal", "ReviewID": "UR100182695", "Content": "We stayed for a few days in an ocean-view room.

The upgrade was really worth it! The room was incredible with a glass wall sliding door, opening to the French balcony and overlooking the ocean. We would sleep with an open door at night time, listening to the sound of the sea. The hotel was renovated about 3 years ago; therefore the rooms are very nice and clean; the contemporary lobby and beautiful grounds w/several pools and nicely designed landscaping make your stay pleasant. The bars offer excellent drinks (try mohitos!). The location of the hotel is also great! There are several bars/restaurants/cafes right next door; you are only three blocks away from Starbucks and a block away from Dunkin Donuts. We even walked to Old San Juan one morning (it took us about an hour). Visit Miro Restaurant (across from Marriott Hotel and adjacent to Starbucks) and listen to Spanish guitar! Great music and the food is excellent. The owners of the restaurant are from Barcelona, Spain, so you'll feel like you are in Europe. Also, definitely try Marmalade Restaurant in Old San Juan! Excellent bar, great service and delicious food! And of course rainforest is a must! But you may want to rent a car and go on your own. We weren't too thrilled with the tour we booked.

My only gripe is that the rug in the sitting area has a strong damp smell to it, which is a bit annoying (and is the only reason I am giving the resort a 4). I guess that is to be expected in a humid climate right on the beach. Make sure to venture away from the resort for dinner and drinks.

As others have said, the hotel is beautiful. We loved the location. It is not a resort in the middle of nowhere but a beautiful property smack in the middle of a real neighborhood. We took advantage of this by eating out on the strip and enjoyed our meals and mingling with the locals quite a bit. The beach was great. We enjoyed the waves and there are plenty of chairs/loungers scattered throughout the property for sun and shade lovers alike. While the hotel is modern and trendy looking the patrons were a mix of young and old and we saw many families during our stay with kids of all ages. We would definitely bring our kids to this property. We had a 1 bedroom on the 7th floor in the tower. The room was spacious and clean. We had a partial ocean view and enjoyed sitting on the balcony for breakfast (from the local Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts) each morning. One complaint is the AC is REALLY loud but you get used to it. The biggest problem was we never really had good maid service. They made the bed only 2 of the mornings and our towels were never replaced and the 1 very small garbage can was never emptied. Finally, on our last night there we were out of towels. We started calling at 4 pm and after 4 calls and 2 trips to the front desk we were given some towels. The pile of old ones were never removed. The spotty service continued at the restaurants where the service was actually a bit bizarre. First, let me say the food is excellent. At the poolside Solera one lunch went smoothly but that was it. The other days we would wait a long time for food or drinks and have multiple people waiting on us. It was very confusing, one would bring menus, a second the drinks, a different person your order. At one point I realized when our food did not arrive after 30 minutes that our waitress who took our order was now tending bar. The manager was great when we spoke to him, brought us a free appetizer, and finally got us our food but it marred the experience. Had an excellent meal at La Perla as well but the service there again suffered from poor pacing and forgotten items. Finally, the oddest lapse in service occurred on our last day. Our plane was in the late afternoon and there was no late check out available. I asked the front desk staff if there was a place to shower change after we checked out I was told yes, there was a shower and changing rooms by the pool. After spending the day at the beach and pool I went to pick up my bag at the front desk to get dressed for the airport. I asked how to get to the area to shower/change, the woman told me the hotel did not have such a place! I was a bit shocked but as a well seasoned traveler I quickly regrouped and rinsed off at the outdoor beach shower and got dressed in that bathroom.

It is part of the Marriott family and is very well kept. We had a hotel room in the old tower, which had a stunning view of the ocean. I'm pretty sure most of the rooms in this tower will have a pretty good view of the ocean, but obviously the higher you are the better. The location of the hotel is perfect. You are in the Colanado area on the main drag with a lot of other hotels, restaurants, bars, etc. The area is very safe, but similar to other large cities, don't travel too far off the main strip if you don't know where you're going. Old San Juan is a quick cab ride away and offers a great historical perspective of the city. The rooms were very clean and the maid service was very good. We would leave for the day and always come back to a clean room, new towels, new glasses, and everything else. The beds were extremely comfortable as ours was a pillow-top. The pillows and blankets were also very nice. There is free Wi-Fi in the rooms, but the coverage is a little spotty and the speed is pretty slow compared to your home network. The bar in the lobby was more of an upscale bar, but had a very nice atmosphere and good service. Outside, they had a beautiful area with many comfortable couches and chairs where you could order food and drink and just relax or read a book. The area was beautifully landscaped and I would say this was the highlight of the hotel. There is also a casino that is attached to the hotel. I am not a big gambler, but I did go one night and had a really good time. Based on the other casinos in the area, this one appeared to be of higher quality than most. No poker tables, but plenty of slots, black jack, roulette, and craps. There are three total pools on site, and all three are very nice. The first is right outside the lobby and is the biggest. It's a two part pool with a waterfall separating them. The water was a little cool, but some (including myself) prefer it that way. There was one gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the ocean that was a blast. The only downside is that the water was definitely chillier than most pools, and the area does not get a lot of sun as it faces directly north (with the hotel immediately behind it). I still highly recommend checking this one out. They have one other infinity pool close to the beach area, but we didn't check this one out. The beach area is gorgeous. Towels are aplenty for hotel guests and there is an employee who will set up chairs and/or umbrellas for you (free of charge!). The area receives sun the whole day and the water is very warm all year round. We had very good waves for duration of the week we were there, and there are stores where you can rent boogie boards, surf boards, jet skis, etc. if you enjoy that. The only negative I have with the hotel is the price. We were there for a friend's wedding so we had a discounted price, but after the hotel fee and taxes, were still paying upwards of $250 a night. Without the wedding discount, you can probably tack on $50-100 more a night. If you're used to paying prices like this, then this is definitely the hotel for you, but we definitely don't normally shell out this amount of cash for a hotel as we generally try to stay closer to $1000 for a week's lodging as opposed to $2000. While the added amenities are certainly nice, we didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel and definitely could have done without them for a lower price. But again, this is just our style and not something I would hold against the hotel, it really just depends on your tastes. All in all, a very nice hotel in a superb location of San Juan.

The safety latch that is on top of the doors were flipped to the outside so the door would remain ajar while they were cleaning.

This was our first time to Puerto Rico and we enjoyed ourselves. Overall it was a nice resort. When you first arrive you think its a very chic / modern hotel. In actuality, it appears to be an old hotel that was \"added onto\" and then remodeled over the years. There is a newer tower that people seemed to like because each room had balconies you could sit out on. Just a word of caution however that the newer tower does have a wing that overlooks the San Juan city - kind of ugly view compared to those with ocean views. The older building (tower) is where we stayed. The rooms we redone and were very nice and clean. Each room had an ocean view which is great. However, this 12 floor tower also had some flaws in that not many rooms had balconies you could sit out on. I was on the 12th floor and had a great view of ocean which two chairs and table. Most rooms however on this tower have only windows or a walk out balcony barely big enough to stand on. This is something they don't reveal on the website too openly and should do a better job explaining. The lobby bar was nice and was lively at night. If you like dressing up and having fancy drinks then this is your place to hang at night to see the local who's who. We also are big pool people and compared to other hotels we felt their pools were lacking. They have 3 pools altogether at this property. Each is relatively small and none with a swim up pool bar. Again, you get the impression that these pools were kind of added on as the property expanded. Sun light was another issue as it pertains to the pool areas. The two smaller infinity pools had no sunlight over them come 1pm, so everyone scattered to find warmth because this property DOES NOT seem to use heaters on their pools. For you beach goers... You could always find chairs and we were there duing a busy week. The staff was willing to set up your chairs and offer you an umbrella if that was your thing. The ocean water was nice, but a little rough for small kids in our opinion. Not a white sandy beach, but more like Jersey Shore sand, yet nice. Finally, and this was my biggest beef with the hotel. During our stay there were two days where they shut down the two small infinity pools for private functions. I don't remember getting a discount for closed facilities so they could use those areas for corporate functions or wedddings. All this did was to force every pool guest to main pool which is not big enough for a busy occupancy week. Would I recommend this hotel to another? The answer is yes now that you know what you are getting into. I hate when my expectations are higher than the reality met upon arrival. I think my review is fair andn pretty spot on. The people and service staff were very friendly to help, but like any other hotel there are always a few who take their sweet old time giving you good service despite your willingness to tip well. As for kids... This is definitely not the most kid friendly place. The smaller pools make it difficult for them to have fun because the adults frowned upon the splashing. The beach is the better place for kids to hang if you decide to bring them. We were there coming off president's week so there were a few families there. I thought the parents seemed stressed because the kids had little to do and not a lot of free running around the pools withought annoying travelers looking to relax.

Great facilities; ocean view room with floor/ceiling windows was wonderful; water was hot and all faucets and fixtures worked. House keeping excellent; beds were made and towels replaced by 3 pm every day. Every staff member was friendly and helpful, which was very nice. Pools, seating area, beach all were excellent and well kept. Hotel location was great for city touring. Bus B21 (75 cents, exact change required, bus stop right outside the hotel) went to/from Old Town and ALSO went to the art museum. A few blocks down the street were Walgreens (we forgot sun tan lotion and also wanted Raisin Bran and milk for breakfast), two ice cream stores (Baskin Robbins and Coldstone Creamery), and lots of restaurants. No complaints at all about any of the above. Problems: 1. As mentioned elsewhere, noise from bar/pool is a problem depending on room location and day of the week. The problem is that the door to the room is not soundproofed and opens onto an open air balcony overlooking the pool, so outside noise easily enters the room. There is no weather stripping, or rubber gasket around the door as is done in colder climates. This problem could be solved rather easily and so it's a mystery to me why it hasn't been addressed, especially considering the price of the room. Noise comes from the band or recorded music by pool or bar, as well as occasional loud motorcycles, car alarms, crying children, or hallway conversations. The problem was worse on Friday and Saturday since there was no band/music during the week. In contrast, noise from the surf was inaudible as long as the floor length window was closed, even though the surf was louder than the band. And we never heard any noise from adjacent rooms. But the trumpet and the drums from the band could be clearly heard even in our bathroom at 3 am Friday night/Saturday morning. We finally solved the pool noise problem by opening the ocean view window and letting the surf noise drown out the band. This worked pretty well, actually. The band quit around midnight on Saturday night and we didn't hear anything from Sunday until Wednesday when we left. I expect that this would be a problem only for rooms overlooking the pool, which were all rooms with numbers ending in 01 to about 12 on any floor. 2. Hotel bookkeeping was error-prone but everything was eventually resolved correctly. We had a prepaid reservation and upon checkin they asked for a credit card for incidental expenses which is standard. But it took the desk clerk 15 minutes of phone calls to make the accounting department understand that the reservation was prepaid so our credit card should NOT be charged for the room fees. Of course, all of this was forgotten by the time we checked out since the room fee was again charged to our credit card. In addition, there was a bar bill even though we had not been to the bar. This time it took the desk clerk an hour to get it resolved. But all the charges were eventually charged correctly. The desk clerks were all very helpful and concerned so it was clearly a problem in the accounting department. So visitors should check their bills correctly to make sure they are correct.

So my boyfriend and I rented a car to get to Fajardo for the bio-bay tour that night, and decided to head to El Yunque Rainforest for the day since it's on the way to Fajardo. On our way to Fajardo, we called the bio-bay company to confirm our reservation only to be told that they had called Nathalia and said they were full. Nathalia failed to let us know that she was unable to book the tour. When we called the front desk, they said she called us, but there weren't any missed calls on my boyfriend's phone and she never even bothered to leave a voicemail. So here we are without a biobay tour our last night in Puerto Rico, because we cancelled our original tour under the assumption that Nathalia would book a tour for us, as promised. We couldn't even find another company on our own, because by the time we found out our tour wasn't set, it was too late to make another reservation since they were all full... Incident #2: My boyfriend had the asked the front desk (Victor) if we can get a late check-out and he said we should be able to check out late (5 or 6 pm) for $75. The following day my boyfriend called the front desk and they said the latest check out is 12:30 pm. After much negotiation, my boyfriend was able to get us a 3:30 pm check out for $75. I hate putting these people on blast, because they're nice and everything, but honestly don't tell your guests something if you can't deliver! In hospitality, you shouldn't set up expectations if you can't meet them.... So bottom line: the resort itself is great, but don't rely on the front desk/staff for much... or anything. Also, service at their pool/beach-side restaurant is super-slow, but that doesn't really matter if you're just chilling on the beach. I'd stay here again, but will be sure to plan my own activities instead of counting on the staff, and double checking everything the staff says to ensure it's accurate.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for a getaway\u201d", "Author": "Monarca_11", "ReviewID": "UR97646268", "Content": "We recently had a great overall stay at La Concha. The room was ready upon arrival in the late afternoon. Given the price we paid it was certainly worth it. We had a gorgeous suite in the newer tower with a view of the ocean on the 10th floor. Everything was in good condition for the most part. The only thing is that for no apparent reason the carpet next to the bed was wet and when we took a bath later that afternoon there was a bit of yellow foam that built up which made it seem a little strange. During our stay we made use of every one of the pools at the resort and enjoyed the beach every day. Our first day we shared the 'duck quesadillas' from Solera which were delicious. We ordered them thanks to reading a previous review from a past guest. The pina coladas were also tasty though they barely poured more than a splash of rum into the mix. The resort is lovely, it is well kept and the staff is so friendly, warm and courteous. The ocean was the perfect temperature and though rough at times it was still fun to play in the waves and watch the surfers and boogie boarders. Natalia at the Concierge was great and recommended a fantastic restaurant in Old San Juan called Latin Roots where they played live salsa music, gave free salsa lessons, and served incredible cuisine, the 'Lechon' was to die for! We did have a couple of incidents that kept our experience from being smooth. One night after coming back to our suite from dinner we found the door open, anyone could have gone into our room. We called Security immediately to check the suite before we went in. David Flores was nice enough to assist us and replied that sometimes when the rooms are cleaned Housekeeping forgets to close the door. He said he would have someone follow up with us the next day to make sure everything was okay. We were a bit shaken up by this incident as it was quite scary not knowing how long that door had remained open but luckily all of our things were intact and nothing was missing. Nevertheless the next day no one followed up with us regarding this incident. Yet the next day after being in the sun we decided to head back to the room and were unable to get in. After trying several times with no luck we asked one of the housekeepers to please have someone come and assist us. Altogether after about a 20 minute delay which set us back a bit with our evening plans, a couple of friendly engineers ended up replacing the battery on our door and provided us with two new keys. At this point the housekeepers were asking what time they could service the room and we said in about an hour. We got ready and went out for dinner, unfortunately when we came back the room had not been serviced. Being a Concierge in New York City I realize that things can always go wrong but it still made me somewhat disappointed given the combination of aforementioned events. Aside from this we really enjoyed our stay and delighted in La Concha, especially visiting la Perla on our last night for our Anniversary dinner which was sensational. Just a few other dining tips: Orale Guey across the street has excellent tacos and $2 beers. Also check out Il Postino for a nice Italian meal about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Bistro de Paris in Santurce is also another great find, the Camembert appetizer is amazing. Also don't forget you're on island time so be patient, enjoy the moments and live it up!

The first several days were spent to the east, at the Wyndham Golf Resort which was a huge disappointment on many levels, for far more money. We found La Concha to be in a different (better) league that the Wyndham hotel. It is surprising that they both carry a 4-star rating - even though the other property was dirty, out-dated, smelly - and none of the room amenities were offered that we enjoyed at La Concha. La Concha is tony and chic and bustling - it is no surprise that it seems to be the PR choice for the beautiful and glamourous traveler.

The pool area is very nice with good locations for getting that tan, reading your latest novel and catching that afternoon nap(make sure you make your lounge chair claim before 9am on busy days).The beach area is okay if you need to spend some time laying by the ocean.

What I found interesting was that the pace of service was erratic and if you go to get coffee, it usually is in need of replenishment whether it is in the lobby or the lounge. The staff just has a hard time keeping up with the little things. Perhaps that is because it is a leisure hotel instead of a business one. Service is slow.

The gyms is comprehensive with all the equipment you would ever need and a great view of the ocean, but we decided to get our exercise buy running on the beach and swimming in the ocean. Every night there was a live band playing by the courtyard pool and we spent our first and second evenings moving between the hot tub and the pool, soaking in the relaxation. Around 11pm the cafe/lounge, adjacent to the lobby, turns into the San Juan hot spot with the beautiful people of San Juan on display in their tropical best. The brunch, served on a terrace between the pool and the ocean, was excellent with great assortment of tropical juices and both healthy and indulgent fare. The Pina Colada was invented in Puerto Rico in 1954 and the \"Solara Flip\" a Pina Colada with Bailey's and banana puree, the house special, is the perfect update to the classic drink. As I sat by the pool with my drink and an order of the lamb sliders (not to be missed!), I realized that the \"Flip\" was the perfect metaphor for this hotel; a sensation from the fifties that has been updated to be even better then the original.

We got in very late and spent some time enjoying the night time views. It is just beautiful! We stayed in the newer towers and the rooms were fantastic. Comfortable bed, sofa bed in the living area, and kitchen. One room had a jazuzzi tub, the other did not. Great flat screen tvs in both rooms. The staff is great here and everyone makes you feel welcome and special. The pools are beautiful, but we opted to hang on the beach everyday. Only negative was that they allow children on the computers in the business center, so when my husband needed to check some things for business, hew wasn't able. There are three computers, and two were occupied by little girls on facebook and a Barbie art cite. I emailed the hotel today and maybe they will take my suggestion of setting an age limit. After all, it is called a Business Center! We ate at Solera, which is a bit expensive, but the food is really good. Try the duck quesadillas.... very good. The drinks are delicious, and again, a bit expensive, but we knew ahead of time that we couldn't worry so much about spending a few dollars more than we would at home. The food that you order on the beach is from Solera. The beach is so relaxing, but the water at this end does have a lot of seaweed. It's fine if you want to just relax in the water (just go out a few feet and the water is clear) but if you have kids that want to ride the waves all you have to do is walk to the other Marriott where the water is clear and the waves are great! (They do not reciprocate and let you use their beach chairs. The guy asked me if I was staying there, and I said no, but I guess you can say yes, and see what happens. We were allowed to plop our towels on the sand, and it actually did feel nice to lay right on the sand) We didn't try the other restaurants at the hotel as we opted for local fare. Check out Orale Guey, which is a tiny local bar right across the street. Try the pork tacos and anything else. $2.00 Medalla beers all day and night! a great deal. We were so disappointed that they were closed on Mondays, as we wanted to go for lunch before leaving Puerto Rico. The restaurant next door isn't much to speak of. The food was ok, and pricey and the atmosphere wasn't horrible. We went to JAM one night for dinner, and have a great time. (they noted on their menu that dinner on Sundays and Mondays are 1/2 price...I would call to confirm this) This is an upscale restaurant, about a 5 minute cab ride or 20 minute walk from the hotel. Food and service is excellent! The other restaurant we tried is Puerto Peru, which is about a 30 second walk from the hotel. Great peruvian dishes and good service. Not as pricey as JAM and the food was just as good. I am glad we did both.

We normally travel a lot and admittedly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the time to write reviews as often as we should. But starting on Day 1, I felt as if I owed it to this place to compose a quick piece. We read the reviews coming in and because of this, booked a room in the all suites tower. This is the newer of the two buildings. Without question and if budgeting allows, you too should stay in this part of the hotel. It is virtually brand new and well worth it. We even splurged for an ocean view room, as it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much more than the alternative. That is where I sit and write this first part as I eat my breakfast on the balcony overlooking the Atlantic. It is an easy flight from NYC on JetBlue. We arrived midmorning, grabbed our bags, which met us timely at the carousel and seamlessly took an $18 cab to the hotel ($15 plus $1 for each piece of luggage). It was a short ride. We were greeted at the front by a pleasant bellman named Robert. Check-in was simple. They even allowed us to look at different types of rooms before settling in. The older part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms had a bit of a musty odor common in the Caribbean. After viewing the suite up on the 11th floor, we fell in love. Where to start? The lobby was chic but not over the top. The pools are beautiful and the ocean is the best we have seen so far. The waters are definitely not calm, but most important to us\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe sand is soft and without rocks. I am not only talking on the beach but in the water itself--no seaweed, no shells--only soft sand under your feet. We barely went into the ocean at Atlantis last month. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me out of it here. The room is Four Seasons incredible at half the price with a couch, table, two flat screen televisions, and two decent sound systems. There is large closet space, and a great bathroom. No tub, but otherwise great. It had a fully functional kitchen with pots, pans, silverware, a microwave and oven top. We were so taken by this that our first stop was to the SuperMax supermarket where we stocked our fridge, bought liquor and cooking spray and had omelets for a mid afternoon snack. We bought so much we had to take a cab back. We eat healthy and often and will likely end up making our money back on the suite and be happy doing it. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a kitchen and mustiness is no bother, then you can consider the regular rooms. Do not, however, cheap out and get a street view room. We are told the noise may be a problem for some. The rooms are very quiet with the exception of the somewhat loud but smooth air-conditioning system. We enjoy the white noise but for some this may be an issue. It blocks out all other ambient noise so far, and we feel it is a plus. The sounds of the ocean are phenomenal, but it is too warm and humid to sleep with the door open. La Concha isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap, but one of the most pleasant points is what you get for your money. No hassle, a pleasant staff, and one of the most important things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nickel and dime you for every little thing. The chairs are not out at the beach and some guy will bring them out for you (so you should tip him), but other than that, it had the feel like an all inclusive without the food or drink. For example, the gym is free for use. It happens to be more than just a room with a treadmill. It was quite decent with LifeFitness equipment. We even did a spin class that was offered on our first night. Classes were few, however, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let that stop you. Towels and water at the gym were provided. They even gave us bottled water for the spin class (nice touch). We had two delicious cocktails at the bar, which as you guessed were $11 drinks and were very small. This was a Wednesday night and the place was mellow. The DJ is always playing so I guess anything can happen. We wait for Friday/Saturday night when the place is supposed to explode with activity. We ate a Buddhathai down the block. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it. The hotel casino is okay, but we are no-limit Texas hold \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem players and there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any tables going mid-week. We did walk to the Marriott that is down the block but their casino was nothing to speak of either. There was a half filled table playing $5/10 limit-poker. The game broke up soon thereafter. Again, we wait for the weekend when there is supposed to be poker here. All in all the hotel was great and we would definitely recommend it. It is not in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of town, but I am not sure that matters.

Two weeks ago, we finally made it back. We had a great time enjoying authentic Puertorican food, entertainment and good old fashion rest and relaxation. This trip was special for so many reasons. One of the biggest reasons can be summed up in three words....\"World class staff \". The La Concha, on top of being an absolutely amazing hotel, is blessed to have some of the greatest staff members we have ever experienced working for them. If you're thinking about visiting La Concha and you'd like to find out about the great food and service at La Concha's restaurant \"Solera\", the excellent fitness center, the four wonderful pools, jacuzzis, or the beachside cabanas and grill, then you should really check out the property and it's amenities on marriott.com. If you'd like to know who were the professionals that made our stay one of the greatest trips we have ever taken, you owe it to yourself to finish reading our review. Please let me start by saying that the unmatched staff at La Concha addressed our every need from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out. Our wish was undoubtedly their pleasure to call their command. They made us feel like my wife and I were the most important guests in the hotel. And by the smiles on their faces we could tell that every other guest felt the same way. The staff was phenomenal! We would like to start by thanking Cynthia, the front desk manager, who addressed an issue we had with our room by upgrading us to a beautiful suite in the main building. The suite was large, extremely comfortable and had the most breath taking view of Condado Beach. Next we'd like to give a special thanks to a special person we had the privilege and honor to meet, Michael Tischler, the Ocean Lounge's Manager. The Ocean Lounge is the hotel's exclusive, members only, lounge for Marriott Gold and Platinum Elite members. Michael went out of his way to make us feel special. He realized that we were staying in the main building and, even though we were pleased with our suite, explained that as Platinum Elite members we needed to be in a Tower building suite, because we've earned it. In a flash, he had us whisked away to a remarkable oceanfront suite. Throughout the rest of our week, Michael went out of his way, daily, to make us feel special and make our stay even more enjoyable. The next person we'd like to thank is Robert. He is the most energetic, accommodating and outgoing bellman that we have ever met. He made our transition from our first suite to the Tower suite quick and effortless. He was very helpful in assisting us in planning our Itinerary and making sure we knew where to go to experience authentic Puertorican cuisine. This added greatly to the enjoyment and experience of our visit to San Juan. In fact, at first, we were going to self park our rental car. After meeting Robert, it wasn't even a question as to whether or not we would use La Concha's valet parking service, even if it was more expensive. Last but not least, we have to give a special thanks to Pablo, who works in the Ocean Lounge. From the first night of our stay, Pablo had the answer to every \"where can we go for the best.....?\" question we could think of. He gave us maps, directions and recommendations to all of the local hole in the wall spots to get some good eats and entertainment. Having Pablo at our disposal was like having our own personal tour guide. Next year, we planned on visiting the JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa in Costa Rica ........ umm, I think that's gonna have to wait until the following year.

Both the hotel and the hotel staff were nothing short of excellent. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the bell staff, then the front desk reception and throughout our stay, every single staff member could not have been friendlier. The hotel has a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153South Beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel to it. Modern furniture and accent lighting is used throughout the hotel. From the lobby, bars, pool area and rooms, the entire hotel takes on a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ultra bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type feel to it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Marriott Platinum Elite member and tend to stay at Marriott properties exclusively throughout the world (Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Renaissance and Ritz Carlton hotels). After walking over to the San Juan Marriott and looking at that property, I was very happy that I decided to stay at the Renaissance. The Marriott looked like something out of the 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and not in a good way. It looked very run down and tired. The complete opposite of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find at the Renaissance. Being an Elite member, I was upgraded from an ocean view room to a one bedroom suite. Keeping with the hotels modern/chic look, the tiled suite had a living room with a flat screen TV mounted to the wall next to a nicely equipped kitchenette complete with a stainless steel refrigerator/freezer, microwave, two burner stove and sink. The cabinets are filled with glasses, plates and utensils. Not that I ever plan on cooking while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on vacation but we did make use of the refrigerator and the microwave. The living room had some funky leather and vinyl furniture. Sofa, corner table, chair, etc. There is a nice size bathroom with glass walls around the hydro tub/shower combination that separate the bathroom from the bedroom. The only drawback to the bathroom is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one sink. One of my Elite preferences is for extra towels and pillows and we received plenty of both. The bedroom has a modern desk and a second flat screen LCD TV. There is a very large double closet with plenty of storage and an in-room safe built in. The bed was comfortable enough but was not a premium bed found in many of the other Marriott properties. I read some previous postings that complained about the lack of air conditioning or hot water in the shower. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience either of these problems during our stay. There are three pools on the property. The main pool is located in a courtyard in the center of the hotel and receives the most sunshine. The other two smaller infinity pools face the ocean but get much less sun (only a couple of hours in the morning), so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much of a crowd at these pools. The beach, while small, never seemed to be crowded. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably due to the constant rough surf found on this side of the island. This is not the location to choose if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for tranquil waters which is why most guests spend their time at the main pool. There is a nicely equipped gym with all of your standard cardio and weight machines. They also offer free classes six days a week. The cardio machines all have personal TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably find yourself staring at the view from the floor to ceiling windows looking out over the pool/beach and ocean. The restaurants and bars were all excellent as well. Service was quick, the food and drinks were all good and the pricing (that some others have complained about), is no different than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find at any other high-end beach resort. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a bargain maybe you should be staying at a Holiday Inn. Since we arrived on a Friday and were leaving on Sunday, we were only able to use the concierge lounge on Friday night. There was a nice presentation of both cold and hot food along with an honor bar. As far as concierge lounges go, this had to be one of the nicest looking lounges in the entire Marriott/Renaissance chain of hotels. Too bad they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep it open over the weekend (something you find at most of the international hotels). If you like to gamble, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a casino right off the lobby. Slots, table games, etc. Only complaint with the casino is their lack of live poker. They appeared to have one table but there was never a game going on so I just had to play craps (and even won a few bucks!). I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t image anyone being disappointed in their stay at the La Concha. Having seen many of the other hotels in the area, this should be at the very top of your list if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning a trip to San Juan for pleasure, business, a pre or post cruise stay or whatever brings you to San Juan.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrence, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cFine rooms, not in Old San Juan\u201d", "Author": "OutofKansas", "ReviewID": "UR94500806", "Content": "After a particularly long wait in line to check in, we were upgraded to a lovely suite with kitchen, living room, and balcony, overlooking the city.

The infinity pools are insane, they light up at night and it's gorgeous. The beach isn't bad. We spent two days out there and I realized we probably visited during a less busy time because we had no issues getting chairs or towels. The beach might not have been the largest but it accommodated all the people during our visit without looking overcrowded at all. 5) Free Wi-Fi = AWESOME.

In this touristy area, it's not uncommon to spend $25 a person (JUST ON LUNCH!) for a meal and drink (with taxes and all). We ate pool side the last night and my sushi and boyfriend's steak were both pretty. Portions could be a little bigger, however (as they are at other restaurants in the area). 2) The hotel should do some minor tweaking...I don't know how reasonable getting rid of the carpet is, but that would definitely make rooms smell less mildewy. The showers as EVERYONE has said are really annoying. Only half of a door and there are two shower heads so it's very difficult not get the bathroom floor wet. We also received a number of towels from housekeeping with holes in them (which is unacceptable for a hotel of this star rating), and the pool area did not seem to be regularly cleared of cups (it's close to the bar and many people bring their drinks to the hot tub/pool areas). 3) The hotel might be a little overpriced. Not sure how it compares to others in the area but I've paid way less for other hotels. If the little problems listed above were fixed, the price might be justified but there is some work that needs to be done around the hotel for people to feel like they're getting their moneys worth. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed San Juan and La Concha. The city is what made the trip for us and our little home away from home at La Concha was great (I mean you can't really beat listening to the sound of waves hitting the shore every night as you're going to sleep and waking up to an ocean view and perfect weather every morning). I would definitely recommend it to others. It's one of the top hotels in the area and didn't have negative reviews about theft or anything like that when I was researching hotels in the area. I always felt like I was safe as well as my belongings.

The food in the hotel was delicious and I really felt the entire time I was staying somewhere 5 star. My complaints would have to be that during peak times (weeknds and afternoons-evenings) it seemed as though the friends of the staff at the hotel were allowed on the premises. This was very annoying as we could never find any pool chairs or tables to use bc the groups of 7-10 people who were clearly being ushered into the hotel by their friends who worked there were occupying the space. This hotel was not cheap and therefore I feel we did not have to endure witness this kind of behavior on my vacation. Also, there was a poor job actually there was no job of monitoring people who would leave there towels on the pool chairs for hours and walk away to either eat or leave the hotel only to return back to take their chairs again. As you can imagine this left for 80% of the chairs in the pool area taken up by white towels with no one able to sit in them. If La Concha is reading this, please change your policies and have your staff remove these kind of place holders if someone hasnt returned or left their belongings in a reasonable amount of time. I paid alot of money to enjoy myself in your resort and feel as guests we are entitled to these basic needs.

The package price was a great value, even with the upgrade. The only negative was the extremely high drink and breakfast prices - $25 for 2 regular cocktails!

Andy from valet parking is a real gem! As has been mentioned in other reviews, there is significant beach erosion immediately behind the hotel, so you cannot walk up the beach directly from the hotel property.

They put the adult only pool in the Towers in an area that hardly gets any sun at all; why is this please?

The location is ideal because you are close to beaches, restaurants and neighboring areas like Ocean Park and Isla Verde. The staff is excellent and very helpful. We had positive experiences with everyone - registration, concierge, manager, etc etc. It is better than other resorts like El Conquistador or Rio Mar which are located in remote areas where you are captive to them alone!

Rooms were of good size, updated nicely and had excellent Avedo brand soaps and shampoos. Alfred Arroyo (manager) was very helpful to us during our stay there (big Thank you). Since I read reviews before and after our stay, here are some things to consider: * It is Puerto Rico - so don't expect the hotel structures to be the same as New York or Miami. You have to factor in the environment and make mental adjustments. It is a fabulous hotel but if you take the stairs you can get a different view of how these hotels really look. * It is located in a \"tourist\" area, so all prices are higher than they can be. But if you do some research and walk around you can get everything you need at reasonable prices./..from Coffee (Dunkin Donuts across the street - 99c) to dinner at local favorites like Beebos, where you will pay less then 50% for a very tasty, local meal vs. what the chain restaurants charge for meager quality food. WalGreen's down the street has a grocery section and is open 24 hours. (rooms have fridges). * If you can avoid it don't drive into San Juan. Take the local buses (75c each way), though you may have to wait for it a bit. If you do drive in be creative and bold. We drove in on Xmas night with 1000s of people, yet found parking within 15 minutes by being innovative. * If you need something, ask for it. I needed pen, paper, towels etc and all appeared within minutes of a call. Also towels are liberally provided at the pool area. * We needed to rent a car. We set it up to pick it up from the Avis office down the street from La Concha and return it to the airport when we left, at no additional charge. Added bonus - renting from that area allows you to skip the 11% tax charged when renting from the airport. We also declined all auto rental Insurance and used our personal automobile insurance which worked fine. PR has a lot to offer from San Juan to other parts of which you must explore.

You will also find all the standard US brands there; Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, Wendy's, Walgreens, etc. You can get anything you want on Ashford Avenue. The hotel and grounds were completely renovated about three years ago. The lobby is what I would call 1960's Miami but it is chic and very nicely done. The atmosphere in the lobby at night is hopping. Every night they had either a dj or live entertainment. The grounds and pool area are lush and tropical in feeling. The casino is large and nice. Our room was on the ninth floor overlooking the ocean. Strangely none of the ocean view rooms have balconies. They open up onto a one foot strip platform with a railing. The rooms are large and ours had two very comfortable queen size beds which you don't get in many hotels. The rooms are all new with 37\" flat panel television but the furniture looks like it came straight from Ikea. Very sparse. The walls were all bare save for two small photographs above each bed. The bathroom is not huge but does have a nice walk in glass shower with both a rain head and a regular shower massage head. The rooms and entire resort have free wi-fi which is a big plus. Though the staff all over are very friendly and accommodating, the service in the hotel is inconsistent in several areas. At breakfast, the staff seemed to be disorganized. We waited on line to get in to eat, yet there were always plenty of empty tables when we went in. The breakfast buffet was very good. Good food and a great variety of things to eat. One morning they were so busy they set up another breakfast in another part of the hotel. The concierge told us to go over there to eat, that it was the same buffet and not crowded. We left our spot in line and went to the other side of the hotel only to find it was a much smaller selection of food. They were of course very apologetic. The inconsistent service carried over with lunch as well. One day I ordered drinks and lunch by the pool and had it within 15 minutes. The next day we decided to sit and have table service and it took almost 1/2 hour to get a drink after ordering it and 45 minutes to get our food. We complained to the manager who again was very apologetic and the food came shortly after. The lunch food is also very good. Great wraps and salads. They are not lacking for staff at all, they just all seem to be running around doing nothing. The other issue with service had to do with room cleaning. Two days our room was cleaned twice. One day they didn't come until I went up to the room around 3:00 to get something and noticed the room was not cleaned. I called and by the time we came up from the beach the room was done. One day the room was not cleaned until after 8:00 pm when we left for dinner. They showed up at 6:00 to clean when we were getting ready to go out. Friends we were staying with at the hotel went three days without their room being cleaned. They complained, got an apology and a basket of fruit. There are two major problems with this hotel. The beach has eroded away 75 percent. There is just a smallish section of beach left on one side of the hotel and it is not that great. The bigger issue is at the pool. There is one main pool area with two levels and two other smaller areas. None of the areas can accommodate the size of the hotel but to make matters worse, we discovered that the owner also owns a Double Tree hotel that does not have a pool. So the guests at the Double Tree can come use the pool at La Concha. Bottom line, no room at the pool unless you go down at 5:00am and reserve a spot. We came away with mixed feelings about the hotel. It is very pretty and has great atmosphere, but the service and pool/beach areas diminish the quality of your stay. At this time iId give it three stars.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing, super friendly staff and great value!\u201d", "Author": "TealTurtle", "ReviewID": "UR91046705", "Content": "The valet staff, especially Felix, really put the icing of the cake!

(75 nights/year to qualify for the next year). I have stayed at countless Marriott properties for both business and pleasure. Generally I am satisfied or very satisfied. This case is no different. The service was up to typical Marriott standards as was the room and the food. One day I had to call at 10:30pm that our room was never cleaned that day. Housekeeping sent two people to clean our room at almost 11:00pm and the room was cleaned very quickly. My big issue is that I rented a car to enjoy some time away. When you check in and pull into the lot, you receive a bar coded parking lot ticket that you bring to the desk for validation as a guest. Every single day (5 days), when I placed the ticket into the machine to exit nothing happened and I had to park the car in the exit lane to walk out and have someone help me. Fortunately, generally, the staff was accomodating and swiped their personal cards. Other times, I was forced to go into the hotel and wait my turn at the front desk. At no time did they every offer to comp my parking or do anything to make this better. it wa a real pain in the backside when you want to get out. This is a good hotel with numerous staff that is willing to help. They do a fine job of representing the Marriott brand. However, if you are planning to rent a car (and are not the most patient person), I suggest staying at the Marriott Stelaris just up the road by 2 blocks or at the Courtyard in Isle Verde if you want Marriott brand. Ritz Carlton is an option as well with their Marriott relationship. Next time here I will probably stay elsewhere so that the car is not a recurring pain.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWow!!

Waited in a line of 2-3 people to check in (around 6p). Polite service though they did not have the room type we reserved on Expedia (king ocean view). They upgraded us to a suite with partial ocean view and provided free breakfast buffet. Room was clean and huge. Balcony was really nice. Bed comfortable, maybe a bit on the soft side. Giant closet. Safe was available but not connected to floor. Liked having a kitchen and the appliances were clean. Bathroom was awesome, though, beware that the shower has frosted glass and anyone in the bedroom can clearly see the person in the shower. Not a problem for us but could be for some folks. Also about the bathroom... giant jetted tub is cool but may be difficult to use if you have trouble stepping over the 2ft edge to get in it. Also, controls are located on the far wall so you really have to get into the tub to turn the water on and off or drain the tub which was a pain. Anyway.. No maid service but thousands if towels so we didn't care. Can't say enough about the awesome free wifi. It worked EVERYWHERE - in the room, on the balcony, in the lobby, at the pool etc. Breakfast buffet was ok, would not have paid for it (hear it was $25 pp) but ok for free. At night they turn the main pool area into a restaurant called Solera (smart use of space!). Went there the first night and liked it so much we went back the second night. They serve light fare so we got two items and split them. We recommend the calamari sticks. Thought the food prices were ok but the drinks are 10-15 each so together, a meal can be quite pricey. As others mentioned, there are lots of food options within a short walk if price of the food in the hotel is an issue. About the pools, there are many. Liked the main pool best. Normally I hate the music at the pool but I though they did a good job with that here. Adult pool is beautiful but very shady after noon. Pool by the beach is very small but nice views. Could not find the hot tubs but I hear they have several. This hotel feels trendy and has lots of neat sitting areas and interesting decoration. Overall, really liked it.

Ask for a room on at least the ninth floor...believe there are only 12. The resort definitely trends young and the lobby bar scene is something to see for sure. The beautiful people do congregate there. If you're 30 you'll love it..we're not. But bring at least twice the amount of money you expect to spend. It's a city hotel on the beach. Oh...tough getting lounge chairs by the pool too. The beach was no problem that way. Another note: the pools on the beach side are NOT in the sun during the day, only the pool areas on the city/street side are. I guess I would have to say we would not stay there again. On the other hand, Old San Juan is where we would go again. We debated staying at the El Covento Hotel right in OSJ and saw it while we were there. Fantastic. I couldn't switch because it was a travel discounter packaged deal. (Which is another topic to discuss at some point) We will only stay there next time. It couldn't be MORE different from the LaConcha...think South Beach Miami for LaConcha area.

We had no idea what to expect and were totally surprised by the excellence of this hotel. From the time we pulled up to the modern, upscale lobby we were given exceptional service and value. The hotel and the rooms are awesome - along the line of the W hotels but much roomier. Our room had a full size fridge and freezer, stovetop, large bedroom, balcony, living area with a sofa, chairs, desk, plus a separate dining area. Everything was immaculate and also cool. There are 3 beautiful pools and a beach with staff everywhere. Also, they have tons of outdoor living areas with sofas, chairs, tables, etc. where people were reading, napping, dining, or just relaxing. With all this we were already sold on the hotel, but as my husband is a Marriott Gold member, we had access to the ground floor Concierge Lounge. This was such a gift - they had a light dinner (they said snacks, but it was enough for a meal) each night with salads, sandwiches, artisan cheeses, appetizers, and a couple of hot dishes. One night it included a delicious chicken pasta that my family inhaled. Later, desserts are offered - cheesecake anyone? I think yes! In the mornings, another generous breakfast buffet is included. This was such a respite from fighting for a reservation or driving - our teens could eat and we could walk somewhere for dinner later - or not. The highlight of our hotel experience was the guy who was running this lounge when we were there - Pablo Rivera. He was so charming, warm, and inviting. He took the hotel experience from great to excellent. When we came back from a week in Rio Mar, he recognized us from our one night visit and welcomed us like family. This is even more impressive considering we came straight from ziplining and kayaking at Camp Rico and were mud covered and pretty grimy. Pablo treated us like valued guests and was so genuinely interested in our visit. He made sure we had everything we needed and is just one of those people who \"make\" a hotel stay and also make it memorable and personal. La Concha was a great experience - we travel constantly and it was way above and beyond what we usually encounter.

You can walk across the street to the local bars and restuarants, and shopping are all around here. The hotel is located on Ashford Street, which is where all the action happens. You can walk up and down the streets to see everything. It's a nice leisurely stroll while you're taking in all the sights. The room was gorgeous. It's very spacious. We had an ocean view, so if you looked over you would see the ocean, going on for miles. When it's very quiet, you can hear the sound of the waves, which is really relaxing. This hotel has it all. The bar in the lobby turns into quite the hot spot at night. It's very modern and cool looking. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The concierge arranged all of our dinner reservations at night. They were very nice. For very nice dinners out, I recommend that you try Koco in the El San Juan Hotel and Pikayo in the Conrad Hotel. Koco is like Puerto Rican fusion type food in a cool modern setting. Delicious. Then Pikayo is a really upscale, fancy spot and the food is amazing. Then for a more casual spot, try the Tapas Bar/Cafe, which is across the plaza from La Concha hotel. It was delicous and not very pricey. Also try Buddha Thai, a fancy thai place across the street from La Concha as well. Be sure to make reservations at all these places. The concierge can do it all for you though. Then at night, be sure to hit up the Orate Guey (spelling might be a bit off). It's directly across the street from La Concha. It's a nice little dive bar. We were there on Thurs night and it turns into a karaoke bar, which was really fun to watch. Then on the weekends it's just packed. It's a lot of locals. The local beer, Medalla Light is a few bucks and free flowing at this bar. It's really good. It's a fun low key place to go. Then you can walk right back to the hotel after you've had enough.

It has a separate kitchen/living room/dining area from the bedroom (stocked with all cooking utensils needed). A full size refrigerator/freezer. Bathrooms were large with either a shower with a rainshower head or a jacuzzi bath. Excellent internet connection as well. There was plenty of room for storage. If I needed anything, the housekeeping staff was quick to provide. The rooms, hotel lobby, pools (loved the aduilt infinity pool) were beautifully decorated. Although on weekends it clearly \"rocked,\" I never heard the noise in my room. They had some great weekend entertainment which guests were invited to. Fitness center also was top of the line with a view of the ocean to die for. Staffing: From the minute you arrive, the valet staff are there greeting you with smiles. Most famous (and well deserved) is Felix who always is smiling and ready to give you a high five. Ricardo and the rest also were very kind. The front desk staff, too, were so kind and helpful. From John Mink, Kristina, Luis, and the others (I don't know all the names)--if you needed anything they were always ready to help and very accommodating. Sometimes the desk was busy and might take some time to check in but the smiling faces of the front desk staff made it much easier. As a Gold/Platinum Marriott Rewards member, I had access to the Ocean Lounge. Michael Tischler did an excellent job in managing an extremely well run and efficient lounge. It had a beautiful view of the water and great seating areas inside and outside. His staff was the finest I have met in a concierge lounge: Pablo Rivera always would get anything you wanted and was always there to help but he also had excellent people with him. While there, I saw Pablo first in the mornings and what a welcome delight. He then switched to evenings and never lost a beat and got whatever you wanted. The other people in the Ocean Lounge also deserve exceptionally high praise: Indhira Payano, Pamela Reyes, Janissa Colon, Christine Bimel, and Luis Perez. They all were very active and ensured that all needs of all guests were met, both inside and outside. The place was kept impeccably neat. and clean. On weekends I had breakfast at Level 25. The manager also could not have done enough as well as the hostesses, Janissa Rodriguez and the others as well. The wait staff also was excellent. The concierge desk with tireless Luisa and Viktor also deserve high praise. They would do whatever they could to make sure you arranged the right excursion or found the perfect restaurant. All recommendations were great! The management of this hotel also deserves commendation because without good management, this place would not be run so well. High praise to Alfredo and Jose Ceprero. The Condado area was great and what I thought was safe. It was great to walk around and many times at the park next door to the hotel there were some great concerts. I would often take walks along the street alone, sometimes late at night, and never had any hesitation. It is a perfectly safe location (not true for some other parts of San Juan). It also was relatively close to the airport and to Old San Juan in the other.

So glad we did. This was our first trip in 7 years without kids and, while I love kids, I didn't want to travel all the way down to watch kids screaming down the San Juan Marriott water slide for 3 days. I had read this hotel was virtually kid-free and it was true. So that's a pro OR a con depending on what youre looking for. At check-in, we were offered a free upgrade to a suite. We turned it down, though, because we did not want to give up the ocean view. That was a wise decision because the view was AMAZING. The floor to ceiling windows were fantastic because you had the full view even when laying in bed. We were on the 8th floor and we also enjoyed watching the surfers who were out there from dawn to dusk. The room was small but found it comfortable. I agree with the people who said the housekeeping was sporadic at best. ALL 3 days, I came up to the room between 3 and 4 pm and the room hadn't been cleaned. I called down to the front desk each time and they'd apologize profusely and send someone up immediately. The half shower door sent more water onto the floor and they took the mat the first day and never replaced it (I used a towel). Good variety of TV channels - even NFL network. But the satellite went down a few times - sometimes it lasted a few mins but during rain it lasted about 45 mins once. The lobby had a very trendy, modern vibe. Reminded me of the type of scene you'd find at a W Hotel lobby in manhattan. Everythng was white marble, geometrically patterned. Lobby bathroom had these space-aged looking toilets that actually freaked me out a little. We were there mid-week and did not experience any noise problems. The lobby bar was bustling and the \"quality\" of the patrons was very good. But once you were in the elevator, you heard nothing else. Spent a decent amount of time in the casino. The casino was pretty good. Variety of slots, plenty of penny and nickel slots. We preffered the casino at the Marriott which was a quick 5 minute walk up the street. (Now that place had a LOUD lobby, you couldn't hear yourself think and I was yelling to talk to my husband). Their table game scene was a little better. As for the restaurants - the breakfast at Level 25 is amazing. A little pricey, but not atypical of hotel food. We ate there every morning, it was so good we had no desire to go elsewhere. Lunch at the poolside restaurant was good. We also enjoyed the Sidewalk Cafe - their gelatto is fantastic! Pool and beach furniture was very comfy - daybeds!!! Plenty of seating. Two very nice infinity pools. Two hot tubs which were VERY hot. Free wi-fi (awesome) and our ipad connection was great by the pools and even at the beach. Walking distance to shopping and a big Walgreens which had a larger grocery section. Very good Mexican place just past the Marriott called Tijuana's. 10 min cab ride to Old San Juan. Cab drivers had a different price for that trip every time! All within 3 dollars of eachother, but kind of annoying. Plenty of good restaurants in Old San Juan - we went to the Parrott Club which was good but no outdoor seating and Al Fresco which had great people-watching outdoor seating. Someone also highly recommended Marmalade to us but we never had a chance to go. Between hotel and Old San Juan, we gave just about every meal an A! A great eating trip. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. We had a great time and would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cService was EXCELLENT from Jannise Rodriguez hostess Level 25\u201d", "Author": "hambone69", "ReviewID": "UR90164807", "Content": "Ate breakfast in the Level 25 restaurant where Jannise Rodriguez was hosting.

From the moment, we arrived it was the most pleasant and engaging experience. From the official greeter Felix, one felt right at home. What was so pleasant about Felix was everything he did was with a genuine smile and we found the hotel followed this motto. Nothing was too much for the staff who made you feel as if you were returning home. From the cool hip vibe of the Lobby complete with Sushi Bar and open air atmosphere, the expeirence was delightful. The amenties of the hotel were numerous and the vistas of the ocean and the beach were magnificient. Also, if you speak Gucci or Louis Vuitton, their shops are minutes away in a very lovely neighborhood. There were several pools so if you wanted complete serenity that was an a option with lush tropical vegitation everywhere and private areas to sip a cool marguerita or read a book. If you wanted people ,they were there too. The service of the hotel staff was exemplary and opposite of what we found at the Ritz. You could tell the people right down to the concierges who introduced themselves really liked what they were doing. We stayed in the new area of the hotel and the rooms were suites and very comfortable replete with LCD Tv's , jacuzzi\"s ,etc. The beach had many private areas to it and there were flat bed cabanas on the beach that were there to be used with no extra charge. The housekeeping of the hotel was excellent and the restaurants were fabulous as we tried them all and would highly recommend La Concha. It was an indulging experience and truly San Jan's better kept secret.

I must say, however, after my stay I can't say La Concha comes close to being a five-star resort. The lobby and pool areas are very sleek and inviting. Perhaps being assigned a \"cabana\" room instead of a tower room accounts for some of my dissatisifaction. The cabanas consist of two floors with ten rooms each adjacent to the main pool. Not quite the oceanview I had hoped. The room was average sized and had some good features. There are lots of outlets and lighting options. The shower and bath area was nice, and was stocked with Aveda products. There was also an unstocked refrigerator but no microwave. The storage armoire was spacious and well-designed, although the sliding frosted glass door often became untracked. I was annoyed that no where in the room were the obligatory pad of paper and pen. I ended up removing a blank sheet of the New Testament when I needed to jot down a phone number. The telephone also lacked instructions for room to room calls and was not user-friendly. Also most of the furniture was glass topped. There were no paper coasters for the glass tumblers, so I ended up using a wash cloth. Three average size pillows sat atop my king bed. A bigger body pillow would have been nice. The hotel directory listed channel 41 to be the hotel channel--I found it to be the Discovery Channel on my flat screen. And you can't depend on the hotel satellite as signals come and go . Don't count on using the hotel internet either, as I had poor reception and instead used my own connection. The shower half-door has been mentioned in many reviews. It didn't bother me, but I was irked that housekeeping on two occasions did not replace the necessary floor mat needed to absorb the free-flowing water. I did like the natural light in the shower and the alcove for personal care products, but missed a bath fan. I did experience loud music on two occasions and it would have been more problematic if it had persisted later at night. Housekeeping was sporadic, particularly over the weekend. Bath product replenishment was haphazard--one fluid oz. of mouthwash provided for five night stay. And there was the bath mat that would come and go. I didn't realize my room was supposed to be stocked with two bottles of water until midway through my stay when they suddenly appeared, and upon departure I was billed $6.00 for bottles I hadn't consumed. By all means, make sure you visit the nearby Walgreens upon arrival. The hotel charges a ridiculous $12.99 for Benedryl and $3 for a muffin that can be bought in the expanded grocery section of Walgreens for at least half of that. I have learned from other reviews since my return not to use the concierge desk to book tours. I was mystified why the cost of a bio bay kayaking booked through the hotel was $85, when the brochure I got from the concierge clearly stated $45. Glad I declined. Must say I've been pretty critical of La Concha here, but there are positives. While the ocean is rough, the various infinity pools are very attractive. I also enjoyed a nice burger at a reasonable price at the poolside cafe.

I found all the service to be extremely friendly and reasonably prompt...both of which are rarities on other islands in this region. I think this hotel attracts a younger clientele, and may not be ideal for older folks and/or families. One Saturday night there was a large party at the hotel that involved music that was clearly audible from inside the room until about midnight. This wasn't a problem for me, and would be a plus for anyone interested in nightlife. The concierge desk was very helpful. At one point we wanted to do a tour of the bio bay at Fajardo (HIGHLY recommended), and the concierge offered to call several tour companies to find the best price.

The lobby area is right next to the bar and main pool which basicly become a night club at night. We stayed in the new wing so the music did not bother us. There was alot of bars and clubs across the street so the loud music goes on well into the wee hours so if your a light sleeper you may want to get an ocean view room to avoid the noise. 3 pool areas the main pool in front of the original hotel and 2 infinity pools facing the ocean. The infinity pool in front of the new wing is absoluted desserted at night so we had it to ourselves and after a full day walking around old San Juan it was great.

Being a Platinum Elite member with Marriott, I will always try to stay at one of their properties. La Concha looked very inviting to us and the rates were so fantastic, I elected to save my points. I have to say this: This hotel was FANTASTIC for a number of reasons. We had a Junior suite on the 10th floor overlooking the ocean. We kept the floor-to-ceiling glass doors open all night as we slept. With temperatures of 75 degrees in the evening and a beautiful breeze, I had the best sleep ever. Great room and decor - no problems here. The weather was consistant and the food great everywhere, including the hotel. We had access to the Ocean Lounge and if you are a Platinum or Gold Elite member, you will not encounter a finer lounge at any Marriott property. This is on the main level of the hotel with floor to ceiling glass over-looking the ocean and the best breakfast and evening snacks I have ever had in a Concierge Lounge. However, the absolute best part of La Concha is the staff. I have never written a Tripadvisor review, but I felt compelled to do so now. Jose Cepero, the front desk manager was extremely helpful. Michael Tischler, the Ocean Lounge manager and Pablo Rivera, the night time manager, were both extremely engaging and made us feel very welcome. Pablo had suggested a day trip to the rain forest as well as a trip to Guavate for roasted pork. He even gave us his cell number if we needed help. I looked forward to speaking to these folks every day. The manager of Perla Restaurant, Ernie Hernandez, made us feel special as well. We met him sitting at the bar of the restaurant and we became engaged in great conversation over a glass of wine. These are examples of people who truly love what they do. The Marriott is a few blocks away and we took a walk to check out this hotel. It appeared very nice, but I was much happier with our choice.

Many of the reviews were spot on. The hotel looks just like it does in the photos. It is very clean, modern, and the outdoor area is lush. We stayed in a suite in the ocean tower. I would recommend it. The hotel has one hot tub and 4 pools: a main pool, a pool above the main pool that cascades down into the main pool, a beachside pool, and an adults only infinity pool. Although we were told that the hotel was close to full capacity, I never considered the pool and beach areas to be overcrowded. I only saw a handful of families with young children, the majority were adults and some families with teenage children. My partner and I are young (26, 28) with no children and we appreciated the upscale enviorment. We did have two small problems while we were there. We had a suite w/ocean views booked and pre-paid from Orbitz. When we arrived they had us as a deluxe room. After only an hour 1/2 they moved us to a suite, but it had city views (not what we paid for) and it took them several hours to get us into the correct room. This was a mild inconvienence as we wanted to unpack, change into our bathing suits and head out to the pool immediately and could not. We were stuck outside in our too-warm-for-PR travel clothes. We may have asked for our bags and changed in the lobby bathroom, but they kept telling us our room would be ready shortly--so we had no idea how long it would take. By 6-7pm we were finally in our room but since we got to the hotel at 12, I felt like we had wasted a day. My suggestion is to call ahead and double check the day before you travel to make sure they have your correct room reservation. The other problem we had was with booking a trip to the biobay through the hotel. The conceirge on duty, Stephanie, gave me a printout with everything I needed to know about the trip, including price and pick up location. We were at the pick up location 15 min early and the driver for the trip came an hour and a half late! Then halfway though the trip he asked us for the $85 (the trip's cost) , but the print out from our hotel said $45 so we were quite surprised! When we showed it to him, he yelled at us and threatened to leave us in the middle of nowhere! We had no choice but to pay the $85 a person (thank God we brought extra cash). The bio bay was beautiful. I would recommend it to everyone but do not book it through the hotel company (E&D) instead use one of the many other companies on Tripadvisor. The manager on duty that night Denisse was very helpful. She appologized for the room mix up the previous day and the biobay fiasco. She gave us breakfast buffet vouchers for Level 25 for the remainder of our stay and a $60 gift card for Solara, the hotel's outdoor restaurant.

The hotel is clean, fresh, modern, with beautiful marble as far as the eye can see. The new suite tower is PERFECT for families...we had a king bed in one room, a bathroom in between and a couch bed for the kids in a separate room. We didn't have an ocean view, but spent LOTS of time on the balcony watching the action up and down Ashford. The bathroom was big and modern, though it lacked a tub. The room had a neat little kitchen, so you could do breakfast or snacks, perfect for kids! The pools were cool and the hot tubs clean, and the waves on the beach were amazing...lots of surfers congregate there. The pool attendants were very polite and you could grab a dry towel and a cup of cold lemon-infused water as often as you desired. Our favorite place to eat was the Sidewalk Cafe, where the homemade soups and wraps were delicious and reasonably priced. The staff at the Cafe was very friendly as well. We met the infamous Felix the night before we checked out, and he did not disappoint! Wish we had met him earlier. DH made very god use of the casinos, unfortunately!

Things about the hotel that were a plus: Modern, cool, breezy rooms were a nice touch compared to the normal \"Downtown Marriott room style.\" The bathroom shower was spacious and stayed hot for extended periods of time through out the day. The room and beach balcony are small quarters in la concha's standard room for four people. The hotel is located just outside of San Juan in a slower more up beat area. The Hotel is approximately 2.5 miles from Old San Juan. Cabs are of plenty in front of the hotel that can take you over the bridge into Jan Juan. There are plenty of outside amenities in the area. My former college roommate now living in the same city of Condado, PR. We were spent after each day of non stop activities many in which the hotel concierge can set up for you. Be warned that the hotel rates for these amazing excursions are at a premium. My friend was able to call individual places making scheduling more geared for our plans. I recommend renting a car two days of a four day trip. 2/3 of a day spent at El Yunque national rain forest. Look for car turn offs from the one road that leads into the forest. There you should find swimming holes in the natural spring waterways many with waterfalls. Have you bathing suit and a towel and other survival gear. Many people frequent the area to loot and pillage tourist. The day we traveled to the rain forest that is 45 minutes away, on the mountain we were trapped on the road side for police activity. My Puerto Rican friend was able to get from the cops that the road was closed for forensics, two locals tried to rob a guy. It turned out the guy was a navel seal on leave with his two other seal buddies. While at the rain forest plan to kayak in the bio luminescent estuaries. Take the ferry from port #2 in San Juan on the other side catch a cab to The Bacardi factory and headquarters. It is free to enter, take the tour get drinks at the outdoor pavilion bar. Its a great morning activity. Its $5 cab ride to the ferry, 50 cent one way ticket on the ferry, and a $4 cab ride from the waters edge to the factory. Their is a guided tour, you can upload your own video at the tour end and email it to people, so have your contact available. When you return to San Juan there are many street side and sidewalk dining options. we found a small 4 table restaurant for lunch. The night life at the hotel is great as well as the near by walking distances places. My friend actually frequents the lobby bar on Friday nights for its crowd of people. There are multiple small bars across the street from the hotel and a couple more one block down. The weekends in San Juan clubs and bars is crazy. And the weekdays are more laid back and not as busy. While there for 4 days I ran into on television entertainer and a former NBA hoopster. The multiple pool decks and two infinity pools it was nice. The beach was about 50 meters long. one of the days on the beach you could not swim in the water at that location. It is a cove that attracts and collects a lot of water vegetation. Even if there were not posted signed stating you can not swim, you wouldn't want to get more than ankle deep. There is serious erosion to the beach just in front of the hotel. In fact the waves were crashing into the building at one time. IF you walk the beach east for about a half mile there is a wind surfing area. The sushi in Condado is excellent and recommend. Also ask around for a good place to get seafood Mofongo. There is so much more to do, sightseeing and adventuring.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Va", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on earth.

We loved the hotel, it was very trendy and looked great. I booked using Marriott points and was upgraded to an ocean view room in the suite tower. The room was great and had a separate living area and bedroom. From the balcony approx the left 30 degrees was a sea view, the buildings in front weren't the most appealing to the eye. As a Marriott Platinum member, we could take advantage of the lounge. The breakfast was OK and they also served some food and free soft drinks early evening. Big shout out to Paulo in the lounge who was fantastic in giving us advice and great service and Pamela who told us some good places to go. The infinity pool outside the suite tower is very nice and then just a few steps down you have the beach. It isn't very big but when it was as quiet as when we were there this was ideal. There are waves in the sea but they were just about the right size to enjoy. There are guys on hand with towers, chairs etc. We spent most of the time at the beach so didn't spend any time in the pool area which was also look great. I would like to recommend Ropa Vieja, which is a 10min walk to the right (as you're coming out of the hotel) - they do great Puerto Rican food, great services and their prices aren't too bad. Apart from breakfast, we didn't eat at the hotel as the prices are a bit too high for our budget. If you walk around Condado there are some nice restaurants. Opposite the Marriott Stellaris is a restaurant with a big happy hour sign (between 4-7) that do great sangria. On our last night we had a cocktail in the lobby ($12) but it was very nice. The rainforest is worth a visit, there is a waterfall that you can swim in at the bottom. Go to Old San Juan and take the free trolley around the city and then wander around the forts. We were pleasantly surprised at Tijuana's on the waterfront, our server was great, loved the food, it was reasonably priced and we had a table overlooking the harbour. There is also a Ben and Jerry's ice cream parlour with a very nice owner. We were bowled over by how friendly everyone in PR was. There is a high police presence in the tourist areas and we felt safe all the time. Service was great everywhere we went. People would see us taking pictures and stop to take one for us. We were worried before we travelled that rain was forecast every day but this usually only lasted for an hour or two.

My choices were the Marriott or the Renaissance. I was told both were nice, but the Renaissance was more for couples, which was what we wanted. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by the nicest bellman. Actually, they were all very nice, but this one in particular, had recently moved there from MD, and he was really friendly and gave us great info. The outdoor lobby area was very nice; lots of water flowing and beautiful landscaping. When we went inside, we noticed the Casino to the left. The indoor lobby was decorated very nicely, and once again we were greeted by a very friendly concierge. We were offered champagne, while we waited, which was a nice touch. I scanned the lobby and was taken aback by how beautiful everything was. I couldn't wait to get upstairs, change, and get back down to the pool area. The room was very nice. I've had better at the Renaissance, but it was clean, well decorated, and comfortable. The bathroom was a little small for my taste, but it worked fine. I loved the blue light in the shower too. We got a room on the 11th floor and the view was breathtaking. At night, we slept with the balcony door open so we could hear the waves. It was amazing. From the bed, all you could see was miles and miles of ocean. I felt like I was on a cruise. Also, the air conditioner cuts off whenever you open the balcony door, which was perfect. There were 3 infinity pools. The pool areas had a little more greenery than I need, but it was beautiful. I take it people don't do a lot of swimming here, but more lounging and wading. The grill/bar area outside was great. The food was pricey, but the drinks were very good. We had long island iced teas, which were not too strong, but had a good kick. I also had the best Patron magarita, which kept me tipsy for a good 6 hours. I think she put Grand Marnier or something in it. I wish I had gotten her name and that recipe! I had the chicken avocado sandwich, which was very tasty. The menu is limited, but they will be flexible and try to make you something not on the menu, if they can. There's also a sushi bar, and 2 restaurants (Perla and Level 25). We ate at Level 25 for breakfast, which was pretty good. The area itself is tricky. When you come out of the hotel (facing Subway), to the left are the other hotels and a somewhat seedy area. There are police on every corner, but I think that worried me more because I'm not used to that. There's also a Dunkin Donuts, Baskin Robbins, Haagen Dazs, Walgreens, Starbucks, and a few small restaurants and gift shops. We ate at Orozco's once. I wasn't impressed with the food, but happy hour was from 4 to 11, so that helped. To the right were Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Ferragamo, Cartier, etc. There was also a Cold Stone and some other restaurants, further down. Old San Juan is about a 5-10 minute drive and the airport is about a 10 minute drive. There is no action in the Condado beach area...just the beach and whatever parties the hotels may be having. Old San Juan was a great place to go to shop and sight see. Definitely visit Latin Roots for salsa dancing. The cab prices are set, no meters...so have cash. The ride from the airport was $17 and the ride to Old San Juan was $14. One lady said they charged her and her friend $18 per person to go to the mall (I think it was Plaza de las Americas, or something like that). We skipped that trip. The casino was cool, but very small. We gambled about $20-30 away and that was it. The beach was small, but very nice and relaxing. The tides were a little high because of hurricane season, but the weather could not have been better. I think we had 85-90 degrees the entire time, and we had a small sprinkle for a few minutes, but that was it. The worst part of the hotel would be the super slow elevators. Most of the time, only 1 of the 3 was working, so they were always crowded. Also, on our last night, we got a few mosquitoes in the room, but we got rid of them. Needless to say, we didn't open our door that night, for fear we'd be invaded by morning. And beware of all the pigeons...they seem to be everywhere. I almost thought I was in NYC. Condado Beach still has a lot of rebuilding to do, but in a few years I can definitely see it being a new South Beach.

However, I have to call it like I see it. I was attending a party at the hotel (local resident). As a surprise birthday gift for my girlfriend I decided to make a reservation for the night of the party. When I was checking in I was given a $25 food and beverage certificate to be used at the hotel. However, a minute later that certificate was taken away from when the check in staff member realized my reservation did not include such a certificate. I was not happy about having the certificate taken away like that, but that was not a huge issue by itself. As a Marriott Platinum Member, I was upgraded to a room on the PH floor with an amazing ocean view and was told that breakfast would be served the next morning at the elite members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ocean Lounge. Later that evening I suddenly realized that there were over 25 mosquitoes on the ceiling. I called the front desk to inform of the situation and ask for a room change. About ten minutes later I was already in my new room, which was on the same floor but a little more worn down. When we returned to our room after the party at about 2:15 a.m. we realized that the party music could be clearly heard at the room, notwithstanding that our room was on the 12th floor! This made it very hard to fall asleep. The next morning I was awoken by sunlight at 7:00 a.m. because the curtains do not completely shut out the sunlight. Even 2 star hotels have curtains that shut out the sun completely. Furthermore, the curtains even had a hole in the middle! Later that morning I called the front desk to verify until what time breakfast was served at the elite members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ocean Lounge. Nonetheless, much to my surprise considering what I had been told when I checked in, I was told that the elite members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ocean Lounge was closed on Saturdays. By now I was completely disappointed with our stay, but the worst was yet to come. When I checked out I was asked how my stay went and I was very honest explaining everything that had happened. However, the front desk employee did not really seem to care about the problems I experienced and definitely did not do anything about it. I proceeded to request my car at the valet. When they brought the car (owned by me, not a rental), the car was completely covered in bird feces and feathers. Furthermore, one of the tires was covered in yellow paint. After having to spend 50 minutes waiting for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parking Incident Report\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be completed, the only thing the hotel did for me was reimburse the $20 valet parking fee (wax and car washing expenses afterwards totaled $70). I am still awaiting further resolution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame because this is a beautiful hotel, with a great location.

This maybe the best trained staff on the island and I have stayed at each of the top 5 hotels on the island over the past many years (yes, I dare say even the service at the Ritz is rivaled here). My 10th floor suite in La Concha Towers opened onto a nice terrace and looked out to the ocean and down to the long private beach below. Dual flat screens, a sleek living and dining area with kitchenette, large and extremely comfy bed, big closet and inviting heavy glass shower coupled with rain-shower-head made for a terrific space to spend a few days. Check-in was utterly painless, not unlike some other top insland hotels, and there is that instantly cool vibe of the lobby bar with those beautiful people and both pool and ocean beckoning you to part take. When I arrived Sunday I dined pool-side and it is quite a calming and special setting there with the main pool's evening lights cycling thorugh a spectrum of sea-foam green color to almost permanganate (there's an upper pool kinda of an adults only area) and the ever-present \"Cocqui\" churping almost in rhythm with the music that made the Don Q Cuba-Libres all the more quenching. Lush tropical planting hide day-beds that are spread out around the poll area. For dins I had the duck quesadilla followed by Latin Sliders (three tasty burgs with blue cheese, garlic aoili and carmelized onions) which were a perfect combo... I asked for some Jicama slaw on the size so could claim I had my ruffage. The breakfasts were solid, coffee is yummy but my only complaint is bacon.

All of that with a genuine smile that never left her face. Just like to say thank you..... \"Daniel\" by the Pool bar was very sociable and good at what he did..... Was always paying attention to the small details and anticipated our needs like no other.

The Room: When I checked in, the clerk said, \"Oh, you got a really good room!\" She was SO right! i was on the12th floor, overlooking the ocean. The view was really nice and the breeze coming off the ocean was so nice that I hardly used the room A/C, I just left the glass sliding door open. The room was also very clean and the bathroom well maintained. there is free wifi, but its a little spotty. NOTE: If sharing a room with friends, the shower portion does not have a door, just a clear slab of glass separating it from the toilet. Hotel Grounds: Everything was really easy to get to and the elevators are really fast. There were tons of beds, lounges, and chairs for you to sit poolside or on the beach. I dont know how crowded the hotel normally gets (didnt seem crowded during my stay) but there were many people enjoying the lounges with many still available. I liked that there was not another charge for a cabana or bed, unlike some resorts. Also, the pool areas are 24 hours. I went down by the Infinity pool at 11pm, and watched the waves. There was a security guard in the area the whole time. Food: Yes, the food is expensive. I had breakfast at Level 25, and it was pricey, but very good. I did not go to the other restaurants. There are local spots nearby with awesome food at great prices. I would recommend Waiters Bar & Grill, which is a 5 minute walk down Ashford Avenue. (Looks like a dive bar, but has great food, drinks, and music) Staff: Everyone was really friendly and helpful. For those worried about a language barrier, dont be. Everyone spoke and understood English. But if you want to practice your Spanish, go for it! Nightlife: The lobby bar was nice, but in my opinion, did not turn into a hotspot at night. I went downstairs at 11pm on Saturday, and people were sitting and talking. No one was dancing and it certainly was not loud. Perhaps I went too early? There are other bars on Ashford and even a pool hall down by Walgreens. The casino was small and the machines had very little payback. Youre better off spending your money at one of the local bars. By the end of my stay, I did not want to leave and am already planning my next trip back! PS. If going to PR, book an adventure with EcoQuest tours.

We loved opening up the windows and listening to the waves. The bed was really comfortable, we slept very well. Bathroom was fine and shower pressure was ok. Overall decor of the room was modern tropical. The pools at La Concha were fantastic with a few infinity pools including an adults only pool. The jacuzzi was also nice. There were plenty of chairs and different spots to relax including an area with outdoor beds and couches to take a nap in. The beach was great too, just the right amount of waves. We used the fitness room which had a nice variety of machines, treadmills and weights so no complaints there. Nightlife was good, we spent parts of each evening at the lobby bar and one night at the ouside restaurant having snacks and a beer while lounging on comfortable couches. The casino was fine, not huge but with a good variety of machines and table games. We ate at the Sidewalk Cafe which had some good deals on sandwiches and wraps for lunch. We didn't get a chance to try the main seashell shaped restaurant this time but maybe in the future. Overall, the hotel was a very \"cool\" place to stay. All the employees we met were friendly and eager to help. I will say that it definitely had an adult vibe to it. Not that we didn't see any kids but there were a lot of couples and adults. I would defnintely recommend La Concha and will most likely be staying here on my next trip. Were there any negatives? Well, it's not cheap for food and drinks but that is expected. There are plenty of other restaurants on Ashford Ave. to check out. Also, housekeeping forgot to replenish our coffee, shampoo & soap but once we called it was brought up immediately.

The lobby is one of 'the' places to be on Friday/Saturday evenings and the area surrounding the hotel is also full of bars with people partying late into the night. The only thing we found annoying is that all the locals who come and sit in the hotel lobby at the weekend tend to act as though they are better than most people there, but for us, that was just something else to laugh at. Expect to be annoyed if you don't like hearing loud music at 3/4 am, even if the bar is empty and the dj has packed up. The drinks are reasonably priced at $8-12 each and free if you are gambling. However i do think the cocktail list at the main bar should be simplified a little for the bar staff - why have 20 drinks if you can only make 4 of them! The food is a little on the pricey side but it is good and not that much more than surrounding options. Extras: Gym is good. Pools could do with a clean.

Pablo, the waiter attending to the buffet for the elite members of the Marriott, noticed I wasn't drinking coffee and offered me the breakfast drink of champions. And that started the week of outstanding breakfast service. With his fluent English, his knowledge of all of the places to go with kids my age, where to snorkel, where to find shells, we had our own travel advisor and with excellent results! And he always seemed happy to see us, every morning. He went so far above and beyond what I percieved as his job, it reflected this hotel's ability to attract, train and retain a staff that makes customers want to come back. I would choose this hotel again because of Pablo, because his talents reflected extaordinary professionalism within the hotel. And when we are so spoiled by expecting the outstanding decor and lavish surroundings, it is this unexpected surprise that makes all the difference.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cAttractive Boutique Hotel on Beach\u201d", "Author": "jujufer", "ReviewID": "UR82384645", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the La Concha for a night before leaving on a cruise.

It seemed like the lobby and bar was a place where locals came to hang out. They had a live band playing most of the evening and the hotel seemed to never slow down. The pool area was attractive and never closed. I can see where lower rooms would maybe have noise issues. We were ocean side on the 10th floor, and didn't hear any noise. The food situation is probably my biggest complaint. The hotel food was pretty fancy and expensive. There were not many options near by. We did try Cafe Del Angel across the street (Puerto Rican food). It was bad, but a little pricy. All food we came across seemed on the expensive side. We ate at the hotel's sandwich place, which was tasty, but $26 for a sandwich, flat bread (really french bread) pizza and 2 drinks (no sides). Getting around was pretty easy. Taxis were always available at a moments notice. Also, the price is fixed depending on which regions you are traveling to/from. A cab ride to the mall (the largest in the caribbean) was $14. To the cruise pier was $15 plus $1 for each bag. Overall, would stay at the hotel again for a short stay. Not much to do around the hotel unless you like clubbing.

Each day when we left the hotel to tour Puerto Rico he was out front greeting other guests and was always interested to hear what our plans were for the day, upon returning from outings he always asked if we enjoyed it and wanted to know exactly what we did. Felix aside there were several other memorable people from this hotel. At Solera, which has amazing food there is a server by the name of Griselle who was wonderful. Actually most of the staff there were fantastic but she especially stands out! Since the ocean was fierce on most days of our vacation we spent many days poolside which was fantastic, and there was a guy there by the name of Chris who handed out towels and supervised the pool area. He also was wonderful, from the first time he and I met he remembered my name and we talked everyday about what I was doing on vacation. One day I really wanted to lay out in the sun and the clouds were filling the sky so he checked the weather for me and gave me the full report and \"spoke to the sun\" (it was hilarious) the funny thing is, the sun came out after that.

You never had to search for wait staff, as they always made sure you were comfortable. The bar was great as well. All in all, this is the best place to stay if you visit San Juan.

You can read my previous review of that experience. Ever since, when in San Juan I stay at La Concha. Each time I stay there, I leave with great memories and another delightful experience. In 2009, I stayed for a weekend in June, and in 2010, I stayed a weekend in August and extended stay during Labor Day Weekend in September. I now am heading back again in October, for Columbus Day weekend. La Concha has been offering some great deals in the last few months. During peak season, it can be a bit expensive to stay at La Concha. La Concha service never disappoints. It is a popular spot for travelers and locals, so you may spend extra time at check-in and check-out times, but the staff does their best to get you in and out ASAP. If your room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready, they take down your mobile number and call you as soon as it is finished, and in some cases some drink tickets to help you start your vacation. My last two stays (August 2010 and September 2010) I arrived early and luckily my room was ready! I never had a problem with room service and the room was clean and ready every time I returned to the room after enjoying the pool and beach. The property has expanded, since I first stayed there in 2008. There is now a small casino, which attracts a nice crowd and a new Suite Tower. Although, I have not stayed in the new suites in the Suite Tower, I hear very excellent things about them from other guests I have encountered during my stays. As well, for Marriott Elite members and others on the Concierge Floor, the breakfast and evening drinks and tapas are quite satisfying in the Concierge Lounge. I must say a very nice addition to the hotel. La Concha remains a destination spot in the evenings, especially weekends. It is not uncommon to have a live band or DJ late into the evening, and lots of fun and dancing. Because a lot of this activity happens in the lobby and courtyard area by the main pool near the lobby, some guests on the lower floors may hear the fun activities late into the night. But I think the rooms are well insulated that it is not too overwhelming once you have shut your door and turned in for the night. If you like to be amongst all the fun, ask for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cabana Room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They are smaller rooms with larger balconies that overlook the pool and courtyard. They can be lots of fun if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind being right in the action and hearing the great music into the night. La Concha is definitely not a quiet hotel, but I like this festive atmosphere. Some travelers do not, so you may want to weigh out your options. But if you are looking for a fun and great time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you will like this place, and after a few cocktails the music won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother you anymore. Relax and enjoy. The central location of the hotel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. You can walk to many great restaurants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ropa Vieja comes to mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and of course there is a Starbucks just two blocks down from the hotel. Next to La Concha there is a park that often hosts weekend events, which can be a nice addition to your stay. If you are looking to stay at a place where you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go far to have a great time, La Concha is for you!

Overall, we had a great stay until Hurrricane Earl started heading toward the island which encouraged us to cut our stay short by one day. It is a beautiful hotel, but quite expensive when it comes to alcohol and food. A Seabreeze in a short glass at the bar was $9.00 plus a lot of tax. Lunch one day $40 without alcoholic drinks. There is an outdoor cafe adjacent to the casino that had great salads, sandwiches and gelato at fair prices. The common areas, especially the lobby and lobby bar are spectacular. The garden areas are beautiful. The main pool was very busy and noisy at all times. All the guys that work outside, bellhops etc., are really friendly and very helpful. The biggest area of opportunity is the ammenities of the room. We stayed in a premium oceanfront room with a gorgeous view, room #611. There was limited drawer space. There was no tub for bathes which my wife enjoys. The rain shower which everyone writes about was nice, but had very little water presssure. With the remodel of the hotel came a very uncomfortable low back white leather couch. Other than the desk chair, there was really no comfortable place to sit. The dresser and desk were not replaced, so you have new chic(?) furniture with older worn wooden furniture. There is free wireless, but we constantly had a weak signal. The flat screen tv was on satellite but did not always have the best reception. There is an in-room refrigerator where we stocked drinks from Walgreens. The hotel was conveniently located in the city. With that comes city life which after dark brings out all types of people. I would recommend not walking far once darkness settles in. It is true that Walgreens, Starbucks and Dunkin' Donut are within walking distance. There is a large grassy plaza located right next to the hotel which featured a huge jazz fest one evening while we were there. Il Postino and Miro are two restaurants that we walked to. Il Postino, Italian, has a great breakfast with huge portions for the money. Miro had several choices. Al Dente, Italian in Old San Juan was definitely worth the ride. It is one of the oldest and highest rated restaurants in Old San Juan. The prices were very modest. As a matter of fact, most of the better restaurants , bars and clubs, historical attractions are located in Old San Juan so you may want to consider a hotel there over the city of San Juan. Just research the quality of the hotel beaches in both areas. All in all, we had an enjoyable time. We typically stay at an all-inclusive resort, but unfortunately Puerto Rico does not have any on the island. Therefore, I don't see us returning any time soon to Puerto Rico.

Had 5 pieces of luggage, I thought I'll just take the elevator from the third floor, well there was no elevator (at least not that I could see) so my girlfriend and I carried our luggage down three flights of stairs, which at the bottom were three workers (I believe one was the manager) I asked them (as I was carrying the luggage down) where the lobby was, and the manager just pointed around the corner and continued talking with his employees. I finished taking the luggage down and finally another worker saw us and said he would get a bell man. We proceeded to front desk (very nice) and were taken to our room (bell man was very nice) and then went down to the pool. At the pool it took me about 20 minutes and to the point where I had to wave my hands up in the air to get some service, 2 drinks a hamburger and some chips and guacamole for 56 dollars, wow! The following night we went out to the pool to have some dinner, I was given two complimentary drink coupons (part of the package, not something nice they did) and I asked the girl if I could use the coupons with her, and she said no I had to use them at the bar (only steps away, it would have been nice for her to say... but I'll get it for you this time) so I just said, ok we'll take water. The girl turned to another girl and told her, they're going to have water (in Spanish which I speak) and the other girl said \"Agua ardiente?\" and they started laughing and left, I don't know what they meant by it (translated it means scalding water) but it could be used for other things. The next night went down to the lobby to have a drink, waited at a table and waitresses passed us but not ONE asked us/looked at us to see if we needed anything, so I got up and went to the bar (and waited/flagged a bar tender) and ordered two drinks, used my two coupons I had (very very nice guy, didn't think I would tip him but he was very nice, but I went after him and gave him his tip) from there we proceeded to the sushi bar and were helped by a nice girl, but too slow, I had to get up and get my edemame and then again to get my sushi rolls, but I was having a good time so I didn't let it get to me (one sake carafe and two delicious sushi rolls 65dollars). The next night was the worst and the one that made me write this review. We went down to the lobby again on our last night waited at a table near the bar, no service (as expected) walked to the bar and flagged down a bartender (as expected) order a couple of drinks and went back to my table. Decided we wanted some sushi again so I alone walked (from a table at the lobby bar) to the sushi bar and asked if I could order some sushi, the guys behind the bar (very nice guys one with glasses) said I had to order it from the waitress, I told them I had been waiting but no one has approached me, so they agreed to take my order and tell the waitress when she went over, she never went to my table. I got up to get my edemame, and they asked me if she had gone over (she being a curly haired waitress) and I said no, they were very surprised to hear that. So took my edemame and went to my table, about 10 to 15 minutes later (furious) I got up and went to get my sushi, I asked the guy if he wanted my room number to charge my room and they said no they would tell the waitress to go over, so I took my sushi to my table, went back to get the little cups for the soy sauce (along with the soy sauce) and then went back to get chop sticks and napkins. At this point I was about to explode and debating about whether or not write a letter to the manager, I decided to do so and went to the front desk and ask for a piece of paper and a pen. As I started writing the waitress goes over (finally) and asked if everything was ok. My girlfriend said that the she had seen I was writing a letter and looked upset, about ten minutes after that in the middle of eating our sushi the girl goes and literally drops the bill next to me, did not ask if we needed anything else, or if I was ready for the bill or anything, didn't say a word and literally dropped the check next to me. I was finally finished with my long letter (first one I had every written for anything, just like this is the first review I write for anything). I signed for the bill but under \"tip\" I put \"zero, I served myself.\" (first time EVER I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tip someone) I took my letter to the concierge, I told Louise everything that had happened and she was extremely nice about it, she offered to buy my girlfriend and I drinks and some sushi, but I politely refused. I thought, we have gone through too much to even be around that staff any longer. She said she would tell her manager, and that he would get back to me, but to this date I have not been contacted by him. A simple apology would do, but I guess this type of service is expected here (NOT!!!) So to sum it up, the hotel is beautiful, the food is good but not for that price, the drinks the same, housekeeping just make the bed and replace most (most) of the towels and leave, and the entire staff with the exception of the girl waitresses and the first three guys when we first got there, were very nice and friendly. (oh one last thing, on our last day, we took our bags down to valet and I went to get the car, because I had self parked, and I was struggling to get 5 big suitcases into a mustang and not one person offered to help) But needless to say I will not be staying there next time I visit Puerto Rico. So if you got to reading this far, trust me when I tell you this, DON'T STAY HERE!! Look for hotel number 4 or number 2 even if it cost a little more.

I requested early check-in when I made my reservation in July (not to mention that I am long standing Marriott Rewards Member). I was told my room wasn't ready.

I was extremely disappointed with the room. It very small. The desks and the furniture were a bit worn. I requested extra foam pillows. I had to ask two nights before I finally received them. The linen on the bed was changed every day. I wonder where the pillows came from. I had to have them replaced as they had a strange odor to them. I have stayed at several Renaissance Resorts and expected better quality, level of service and size of the room. The wait staff at Solera the poolside Tapas Lounge were rude! I sat at a table today (9/8/2010) for ten minutes, while people walked past me. They never acknowledged that I was there until I finally stopped someone and asked if I could be served.

It has an amazing grand entrance that really starts off your stay in the right direction. I found the staff to be very attentive, and well mannered. They treated me like they wanted my business and I greatly appreciate that. The rooms are exactly as they are shown on the website, very modern, clean lines, and updated furniture and fixtures. There are flat screens in each room and the walls are pretty good at blocking sound. If you plan to stay here I would certainly recommend upgrading to a Ocean View Room. We woke up every morning to the sound and sights of the waves crashing aganist the rocks and the shoreline. Our room literally opened up to the ocean. The entire wall in the Ocean View Rooms is a large window that you can open and truly feel as if you are on Condado Beach. The resturants in the resort were fantastic. I read a voluminous amount of reviews on Tripadvisor about the food and I must say I think it was worth every penny. I am a foodie and I write a few food reviews for new restaurants and the food at La Concha was great. Their poolside bar and outdoor grill had anything from burgers and sandwiches to flank steak. Everything had a Puerto Rican flair to it, which I loved. For breakfast we ate in the Ocean Lounge which overlooks the infinity pool and the ocean. This lounge is for Marriott Platnium members and was excellent. One morning we ate brunch at Level 25 where they had an exquisite buffet, waffle, pancacke and omeltte station. The food at Level 25 was superb. On our last evening we dined at their formal dinning facility, Perla. It is on the water, it over looks all of Condado Beach and it's ceiling is an ornate shell which also happends to be a local historic landmark. I had the Filet Mignon and it was simply fantastic...melts in your mouth. The ambience was remiencent of something you'd find in a swank hotel in DC or NY, great music and lighting. We went during the Labor Day Holiday so there was a DJ in the hotel lounge each night during the weekend and a good looking crowd of well estabished trend Puerto Rican trendsetters. The music was ok, but the crowd was better and the drinks were stiff! The staff was wonderful on the beach as well. They were very attentive to our needs, they always hustled to get us some lougne chairs and umberellas. Again, I can't say enough good things about this place. The resort is directly on Condado Beach just as it says which is one of the most beautiful beaches I've stayed on. I travel to the Carribean a lot and this beach is by far one of my favorites. The water was crystal clear, the sand was warm and inviting and the property is set up so that anyone you are you can see the beach. And the pools were amazing!!! The pools went up to 5 feet so you couldn't dive in, but you could surely be submerged in water as you looked out at the ocean. The infinity fool was fantastic... The one and only complaint I have about this property (and PR in general) is the piegon problem. These nasty, germ-filled birds were everywhere...anytime we tried to eat outside by the water they would swarm around our feet trying to catch scraps. It was a HUGE nuisance! They were relentless and every timed we shooed them away, more would soon follow. So stay indoors when you eat if you don't like birds.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cIm gonna give the La Concha a exellent rating for one big reason.....\u201d", "Author": "namebrands777", "ReviewID": "UR78711444", "Content": "Felix P.

He even went and picked my mom up supplies at Walgreen's because hurricane earl was coming so she made a list of emergency things she thought she might need. Felix is the kind of person that's makes staying at the La Concha resort a pleasantry! Because to me there's nothing worse than going to a hotel and feeling uncomfortable.

Housekeeping decided to not come the one day we absolutely needed towels and we had to go downstairs to the front desk and wait for them to give us towels. It was extremely frustrating. The reviews about the noise - I couldn't hear the partying from our room, it was very quiet actually. There was construction going on in the mezzanine right out our room and we never heard it. Our suite had 2 flat screen tv's! The only odd/annoying thing about our suite was that the shower had NO door and was completely see through into the bedroom. If you are a couple, I am sure this is perfect for a good time but with friends this was extremely annoying because no one could be in the bedroom without seeing the person in the shower completely in the nude. Overall this is a great hotel and would stay again. Expect nothing from maintenance and you won't be disappointed. The beach is great and the pools are very nice.

The La Concha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outdoor pool area and beach location are fantastic. We were fortunate to have beautiful weather every day and enjoyed the wonderful pools and lounging in the sun. They gym is very nice also with great views of the ocean. If you are interested in ocean swimming/boogie boarding etc. there are beaches nearby to do so. You can play in the ocean here a little, but there are dangerous rip currents in the area, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get out to far in the water.

Once there, we had lunch (complete with delicious sangria), checked into our rooms, and went to the beach.

Immediately on arrival, the bellman was very helpful and friendly. He gave us a good orientation of the property and great suggestions for dinner in the neighborhood. He was also a freindly face that welcomed us \"home\" every time we returned to the hotel. When we sadly had to leave - the bellman came to our room promptly at the time I had arranged the night before and had all of our baggage in a cab for the airport before I could do the final check-out. (By the way the bill was in perfect order unlike comments from some other people on this forum) Because we were with our 12 year old son and 3 year daughter, we were concerned about the music from the nightclub keeping them awake at night. The staff arranged for us to stay on the 5th floor in a junior suite overlooking the beach which was far enough away from nightclub area that the noise was not really a problem at all. Our room had an amazing view overlooking the Beach and the Ocean and was an absolute pleasure to stay in. Our kids argued about who got to sleep on the couch by the window to be able to wake up to the amazing view. The lobby and public areas were as great as they look in the pictures. There is always an electric feeling in the air in the lobby and you want to take in everyting that is going on. There are lush plants throughout the hotel that are maintained on a daily basis. The accommodations were very clean, well maintained, and comfortable. We did not experience any issues with the air conditioning not keeping up with the humidity even though it was a rainy time of the year and very warm during the days. The housekeeping staff serviced the room early in the day and went above and beyond to make animals for the kids and a \"shirt and tie\" for me out of towels. A very nice touch that made us rush back to the room every day to see what was going to be there. The concierge staff were very helpful in planning outings to Old San Juan, making dinner reservations, and helping us find a great Catamaran outing (highly recommended) as a day trip. The restaurants in the lobby, poolside, and the breakfast room all had a good offering at prices I would expect at a resort. We did not have dinner in the upscale restaurant for dinner so I cannot comment. We always felt safe at the property through the ever present security guards watching the beach area. Also, our daughter fell and hit her head at the poolside restaurant on the first day. We were impressed at the responsiveness of the staff and the arrival of a medic with a first aid kit within 2 minutes. The health club was a great facility and very relaxing to use the state of the art treadmills overlooking the Ocean. We would recommend choosing the La Concha property to anyone planning a trip to PR and are looking forward to returning soon.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is TERRIBLE.

However given that this was my 30th wedding anniversary AND the amount of prepartion with the hotel prior to my arrival, i felt this was an inexcusable experience. My wife and I arrived at the La Concha Resort 30 minutes sooner than I had told the hotel (in one of my 10 conversations leading up to my visit). So when we got to the front desk (which was very busy and stayed that way our entire visit) and they said \"as a platinum Marriott member, your ocean view suite is currently being cleaned so you will need to wait a few minutes\", we were not concerned because we could eat lunch in the restaurant and even gamble a little!!! Ninety minutes later, I decided to check back with the front desk since I had not received a phone call and to my surprise they told me that they REALLY didn't have an Ocean view room, but they could give me a \"city view\". I was a bit disappointed because I had told them several times the importance of my 30th anniversary and they had assured me \"that they would make it VERYspecial\", however we agreed to take the room because it was getting late in the day....BIG MISTAKE!!!!! We walked into a living room/kitchenette, and I could see that the entire room just wasn't \"my style\" because I like more traditional rooms instead of the urban modern style but regardless your taste, things weren't right in this room. For instance, three VERY small drawers to unpack into, REALLY? No luggage stands for luggage ( so I had to use our bedside end tables). No shower doors on the shower so water sprays out onto the bathroom floor, I asked for a feather free room due to my wife ( which is different than MY profile, but when she does travel with me, EVERY OTHER Marriott gets it right) our bed had feather pillows so I called down for foam pillows, only to have ONE Feather pillow delivered. Our view was absolutely awful as it overlooked a very noisy road with an endless supply of muffler free cars. The rest of our \"CITY VIEW\" was a Malaysian restaurant with rusted out billboards and a \"Ocean\" of rooftop cement buildings. Since we had pre-arriangned dinner reservations we got dressed and on my way out i went to the same front desk agent who checked us in and explained how unhappy we were plus they needed to deliver two luggage racks, several foam pillows and they needn't bother delivering the platinum \"arrival gift\" because we were going out to dinner. I even told her that if I could figure our how to change our flights (to Vieques Island) we would be leaving early. Well after a wonderful dinner outside the hotel I realized that at check-in no one told me about the components of my package, so I went to the front desk and requested my \"matching money\" for the casino (of course it would have nice to have that when I was IN the casino for an hour waiting on our room), and the VERY nice front desk agent (sorry i didn't get her name) not only gave us our coupons but also informed me of the breakfast area for platinum members that no one told us about at check-in. We went back to our room and two foam pillows HAD been delivered plus the \"platinum arrival gift\" which we had canceled and still no luggage racks. Other observations about these rooms were, they spent big dollars on kitchenettes but have no glasses, pots, pans, knifes, forks etc so basically it's useless. Furthermore if your fridge icemaker doesn't work (like ours), your out of luck because we NEVER found an ice machine on our floor. What we DID find on our floor (and in fact outside our room) was housekeeping carts!!! I guess they have no storage for them because they were outside our room the entire two days and between 7:15 and 9:00AM, I was apparently apart of a multiple person conversation with the housekeepers because I could hear every word they said as i sat in my bed.......if I only spoke Spanish!!! :) Believe it or not, i actually had two people who went out of their way to help us during our stay. First was Ricardo in Valet and Luggage. He was clearly the brightest spot during our stay and if everyone in the hotel had his attitude, they could really become a first class resort. Second was Michael Tishler who tried to fix my disaster on day two of my stay by having Champaigne and flowers delivered to my room. I must admit he took the brunt of my complaints and tried to resolve my issues but we already had a bad taste in my mouth however i absolutely give him a \"A\" for effort. I have been in business upper management for 30 years and i know one thing, experiences like this don't \"just happen\", they are excepted as an excuse by the General Manager (whom i asked for but never heard from during my stay) and I believe if he or she must except mediocrity so this is the type of experience EVERYONE will get. I will admit that i believe Renaissance appears to be trying to change their image (at least in their room decor) to attract a younger \"more hip or trendy\" clientele which doesn't suit my 50+ more traditional needs (and that's my fault for selecting a Renaissance Hotel) but the customer service was inexcusable and that shouldn't fly at any Marriott Brand.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel on the beach!

There was a bedroom area with a balcony, a large, beautiful bathroom, and a living room area with microwave, fridge, pull out twin sofa bed and an eating area. The room is big enough to have a little party of your own in. The only thing to be aware of is that the shower side of the bathroom wall is kind of see through (although not completely), so you can basically see the person showering. TV in the bedroom was flatscreen and the room had free wifi. The design and decor were both excellent. Hotel grounds: Pretty big hotel. It has a nice workout facility.

The pool area also has a restaurant and bar. The hotel also has a lounge, which looks like a regular bar when you enter the hotel, but at night, they bring in a DJ and it becomes more of a lounge.

USA team coach) and most of the cast of the new Fast & Furious movie (how could someone on this forum say B-cast actors; guess you have never seen their past movies!!). Was an experience to ride the elevators or work out in the gym with a lot of them! So it was just fun to stay at the hotel and mingle with these folks. But the hotel was good for many other reasons. The room and beds were big enough for the 4 of us and we enjoyed the huge sea facing window/view. All staff were friendly and we did not have any check-in/out issues. The walls are also fine: we did not hear anything from the neighbors. We enjoyed the big waves in the ocean and the nice sand on the beach. It is a public beach but was kept very clean contrary to the many other public beaches we visited on the island. At night we swam in the nice hotel pool with the changing colorful underwater lights. Could not get towels after 6pm but the pools never closed. The hotel is very nicely situated near many restaurants. Best one we found is only 100ft away (Jose Jose). We actually first went to the nearby Walgreens and stuffed our hotel fridge with drinks, etc from there. Dunkin Donuts is across the street; we had breakfast there once and bought from them donuts which we took to the beach. We also enjoyed the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $12 Heaven cocktails during sunset but most of the drinks and food consumed on the beach we bought elsewhere (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the advantage of a public beach!). On weekend nights musicians played alongside the pool and we sat in a very cozy corner on comfortable couches (of which there are many) and listened to the nice music and had some good drinks. We really enjoyed that evening! The shower was great; you have 2 options: massive rain flood coming straight down or a traditional hand held device that can also be attached to the wall. When light bulbs had to be replaced they were replaced quickly. Felix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great smile was also always welcome. However, we had 3 issues: we arrived at circa 1am but never got our room cleaned that day during regular hours. Took several phone calls until finally someone came at 7pm. Then one day suddenly 4 of our 8 pillows disappeared. Ended up getting 2 back but the hotel did not seem to have had sufficient pillows for all guests?! Then one day we came back to the hotel room at 4.30pm after a day in the jungle, and found the door latch wedged between the door so that the door was not locked. Saw the maid on the other end of the corridor so it could have been like that for many hours (she must have left it like that after cleaning the room). Fortunately nothing had been stolen.

The hotel has white leather couches and light-wood furniture everywhere. No bathtub but great hand-held shower and overhead \"rain\" shower. Very romantic blue light right there in the shower. Very beautiful lighting on territory at night. Great pools open 24 hours. We swam every night in the gorgeous main pool with changing underwater lights. The service was great. We needed some extra sheets and then extra bath robes (very clean looking, provided) and both times the response was within 10 minutes. The restaurants in the hotel are expensive. Breakfast $12-18. Go outside. There are plenty of places for cheaper and the food is delicious. The Pearl restaurant is gorgeous but very high class. Prepare for $11+ for dessert and $30 for main course. You need a reservation. We went for dinner outside of the hotel but made reservation for dessert only. The portions are tiny but tasty. I wonder how big their main course portions are.

Or you take a bus ($0.75). There is a great creamery on the way. Blueberry ice-cream was to die for. The water there is very still and clear, lots of fish. Good for snorkeling. The bad part is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 feet away from the road. If you continue walking further down, pass the bridge and walk through the Hilton hotel. There is the Escambron public beach. Also great for swimming (especially for little kids) and snorkeling.

The bar is expensive as hell, even in Miami you will pay the price you have to pay here: $13 to 15 drinks n $7 local beer Medalla, and the service is quite slow.

We were not disappointed at all! However, the resort seemed far from a place for young adults only. We saw many older couples and families with small children, and all seemed to be having a great time. We were a little nervous about the service after reading several reviews complaining of poor service, but saw NOTHING to back this up. The service we received was nothing less than phenomenal, from the bell boys, to the guys working valet (especially Ronald, who introduced himself as \"Ronald, you know, like Ronald McDonald!\"), to the housekeeping staff, to the front desk workers, to the wonderful concierge. We were especially impressed with Lily at the front desk and Louise at the concierge. We asked for an upgrade upon arrival at the hotel and were offered an oceanview room on a higher floor at no extra charge if we did not mind waiting for them to finish getting the room ready (we arrived late in the afternoon). She was not able to give us an exact time of when our room would be ready, but we didn't mind waiting and took the time to explore the beach and pool areas. Our room ended up being ready in about 30 min and we were so happy with what we got. Beautiful, very clean room with a gorgeous view of the beach. We also did not have any problems with always having plenty of towels, which were restocked daily without us having to ask- though this seemed to be a problem for some other guests in the previous reviews we read. Louise was beyond helpful in helping us book our excursions of choice... She couldn't have made it easier for us! We did not eat at the hotel much except for lunch at the poolside bar, but we were expecting that based on what we read about the resort prices. There are some great restaurants within walking distance with much more reasonable prices so we didn't mind at all. Pools are very clean and well-kept. Our shower head was broken and the shower could have been just a little cleaner, but other than that-- an absolutely great hotel! Spend a little time in the casino, too... pretty mellow for a casino but very FUN environment; the dealers were very personable and there to make sure everyone at the table had a good time.

Of course there's trash, but you can see that the hotel workers are trying to keep it clean....but I guess you can't stop people from throwing cigarette butts/trash on the ground. The workers on the beach were very helpful and kind. One of the best features of the hotel was that you get free use of the beach chairs and umbrellas all day. I also loved being able to order food and drink while lounging on the beach. Our 11th floor room was lovely. The room featured a full wall of windows, which showed off an amazing view of the beach and ocean. The people were lovely and helpful and seemed very eager to please no matter what the request or inquiry. The fitness center was clean and stocked with advanced equipment. My only issue was that the food and drinks were EXTREMELY expensive (cocktails seemed to start at $11)...although they were delicious, you can find local restaurants that provide better food at a cheaper price.

I am a Platinum Premier member with Marriott so I had the choice of staying that this resort or the Marriott about 2 blocks down for the exact same number of points. Reviews of both hotels were very positive and most of the guide books gave both hotels one of their \"favorite\" awards. I choose the La Concha because it seemed a little different from the regular Marriott properties and most reviews said it was a romantic setting that was more adult focused. After staying at the hotel - I can clearly see why many view it as a very romantic hotel. On the weekends there are candles placed around the walk ways while a live band plays by one of the pools. There are lots of oversized chairs and couches to lounge on while you enjoy the night. There is also a nice \"adult\" pool that is away from the other pools and it is very peaceful at this pool. The bar area in the lobby is very open and the set up seemed very nice compared to most other hotels. We went down to the Marriott - just to see how it compared. The lobby in that hotel was much darker and felt a lot more crowded (not because of the people - just a lot of furniture everywhere). The hotel itself looked fine - but you could clearly see a big difference in the openness and colors of the La Concha resort. The hotel is broken into two sections - I assume that the first section (facing the ocean) is the original hotel and the other section (only the end faced the ocean) is the newer building. We were given a room on the top floor (12th) of the older building. Only the 12th floor has a balcony with a table and chair - the other rooms either had a small walk out balcony or nothing at all. The rooms themselves were very clean and everything seemed to be in good condition. The view from the balcony was great - straight out to the ocean with the shell shaped restaurant below us. Every employee we spoke with was very friendly and always quick to help. We never had anybody working on \"island time\" - either at the hotel or around the island. So that is all the good. As I said - trash and treasure. So every weekend the have a live band playing out by the pool - which is great if you want to listen to the band - not so great if you don't because the way the hotel is designed - you hear everything that goes on around the pool. Also - the pools do not close and for some reason people like to take their children out to the pool at all hours. I remember one night I woke at 2 am to hearing kids screaming with excitement as they enjoyed their time at the pool. We were on the 12th floor - I could only imagine how much those on the lower floors enjoyed the kids excitement. We spoke with the hotel after a couple of days - they suggested we call down if it happened again - but since there is a security guard at each pool 24 hours - not sure why they do not enforce a decibel rule after say midnight. Also for those that love wild life - birds are great - for those that like sleep - birds that have an ear cracking mating call that started every morning at sunrise until about 9 am - not so great. Let's be clear - I am not talking about some chirping either. This was a constant sound that rivaled any car alarm. The first time it happened - people went out the front balcony to see what the heck the sound was. We could not figure it out until we went walking one morning and figured it was coming out of the trees. After listening to it a couple of days - you could actually start picking up on when one bird finished and another would either \"respond\" or start their own call. So bottom line - if you are one who goes to bed very late and gets up very early - none of this will be an issue for you. Or if you are a very heavy sleeper - not a problem as well. But if you come out of that deep sleep - it does get old quick. Oh about those very friendly employees - another trash/treasure - they are so friendly - when the cleaning staff is working - they will stand just outside your door and talk about what ever is the subject of the day (of course in Spanish so I have no clue what they are saying). All in all - nice hotel but if you are in the older section of the hotel - you will most likely hear a lot more noise than you want. If you want a hip place to say - I would say it is the place. If you are a little older and not as \"hip\" - pick another location. BTW - there a lots of small dive like places to eat around the hotel- we tried a lot of them and found all but one to be very good. For the one bad - my guess is I just picked the wrong dish.

However, due to the fix, whenever the desired temps were reached and the compressor cut off, condensation began to form in the room due to the humidity. -During our entire stay, there was no hotel directory/guide.

The staff went out of their way to handle any issues. Hotel decor was very South Beach and location very convenient. Short distance from Old San Juan and walking distances to several restaurants. Several swimming pools but were smaller than expected based on website photos. We had no issues with housekeeping. We left for the beach early mornining and room was cleaned with plenty of towels by noon each day. Food was good and little overpriced but expected for this type of hotel. Service was great at the pools and beach. Tips are appreciated and a few dollars goes a long way. Never had issue with chairs or umbrellas. We did stay during the week so it may be a problem on the weekends but I am sure if you brought it to the attention of the staff they would handle. Overall a great hotel and would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cBeware the 'upgrade'.

Arrived very late thurs pm & front desk thanked me for being good Marriott rewards cust (nearly 40 night so far this year). As such told they 'upgraded me to a suite'. Nice room (bit Spartan in the living room, nice bath & bedroom), but missing the oceanview I paid extra for. Instead, I had a lovely view of a parking lot & a noisy street (loud bar music & car scene). At least it had a balconey. It was past midnight, but I went to the front desk to ask for an oceanview room. After some hassle, they gave me a decent room w/ 2 queens instead of a king (no 'upgrade' w/ the oceanview & no balconey, but a nice wall of glass overlooking the ocean. Overall pleased w/ the room- nicely updated in retro style like rest of hotel. But it was bright as hell in the morning, even w/ the shades pulled. Nice towels, linens, tv, etc. There are 3 pool areas available w/ 1 small pool dedicated to adults. Biggest pools & main beach access loaded w/ kids (hate to see this place during busy season). Lounge chairs ran out on Sunday & I assume they will during the busy season. Plus there are few umbrellas that are taken quite early (before 9am during slow season) At least the staff is very friendly & there are plenty of chairs available on the beach (be sure to tip the staff for setting up the chairs - staff is very good here). Drinks & food are typical resort prices ($5-10 for drinks, $20 for lunch sandwich/wrap). Overall, I'd say this is a decent place if you only want a beach vacation, but beware the 'upgrade' where they'll try to give your oceanview to higher paying guests. Plus there are better (& mucho cheaper) places in Mexico. I'm not really sure why people come here, unless you're a newbie like me or in search of an apparently good gay scene (shared taxis w/ some DC guys who filled me in on the skinny). If you're looking for culture/architecture/restaurats/nightlife, I'd recommend staying in Old San Juan ($12 + tip cab ride away - where I'll stay if I come back).

I decided to splurge a little and upgrade to the oceanfront room, about $175 a night. I'm glad I did. The view from our room was beautiful. Cab ride from the SJU airport was $15 and was about a 10 minute ride. Just walking into the lobby you're already in for a treat. Zen like designs and very modern looking and the bar with the giant screen with the World Cup on was enticing. Check in was rather slow but I can't complain as I was checking in early (around noon) and lots of people were checking out. They were very accommodating and checked my bags and took my phone number so I would receive a call when my room was ready. That gave me time to walk around the area and grab a bite to eat ( I highly recommend the Latin Star restaurant which is 2-3 blocks away). I received a call about 2 hours later saying my room was ready. The concierge we had was helpful and courteous. Not bad looking as well. Her name is Alejandra. The room was more than I expected. Not your typical hotel look, but very modern looking. King size bed (most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in yet) with a leather headboard, a leather chaise and ottoman. Modern looking desk with leather seat chairs. Nice flat screen tv and plenty of closet space and an in room safe. The room didn't have your typical lamps with on/off switch. Each lamp had a sliding dimmer switch, very nice touch. The AC worked like a charm. Only complaints about the room were: the balcony door didn't lock, the walk in shower had no door and the tiles were somewhat dirty (but the rainfall style showerhead made up for it) and the sink stopper needed to be fixed. Housekeeping was a little disappointing. They didn't restock the toiletries the second night nor did they replace the bathmat. But we had our own toiletries and just used a spare towel as a bathmat. The pools should definitely be checked out. There are 3 infinity pools, 2 of which have a view of the beach/ocean. You can actually go right from the beach to the pools (obviously using the showers to clean off first). Didn't get a chance to use the outdoor seatings by the pool as it was raining on/off during our trip. I actually enjoyed the intermittent rain and I've never experienced being in the ocean or pool during rain (but once I heard thunder, I got my butt out of the water). The beach seemed like a private beach as there weren't that many beachgoers, maybe 15-30 people at most. The beach chairs are free to use if you are a guest at the resort. The water is a little rough as you would expect since it is the north side of the island and there weren't any rock lines to break the waves. But the waves are perfect for bodyboarding. Location was great. Condado is not too far from Old San Juan. There is a bus stop (take B21 or C53 to the last stop in Old San Juan) right in front of the hotel that brings you to Old San Juan although their buses left a lot to be desired. They run about every 20-30 minutes and are old running buses. But I'm from NYC, so comparing NYC bus system to PR is like comparing apples and oranges. The ride cost $0.75 each way and the ride itself was about 10 minutes. I did not try any of the hotel restaurants as you would expect any hotel restaurant to be pricey. Business center had 3 terminals available. But there is free wireless internet in the hotel. I would have loved to stay longer than the 3 days I was there but I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in San Juan.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cHotel has very, very serious service problems.\u201d", "Author": "BlueEyedMavrick", "ReviewID": "UR68368924", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I used to be not only be a manager in the hotel guest service business, but I used to work for the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton branded hotels. As a gal that usually is 110% content at a very value-based hotel such as La Quinta or Holiday Inn, I urge this hotel to clean house and get stronger leadership from the very top. My experience should be an embarassment to the Renaissance brand. I also want to say that the Front Office Manager Michael Tischler did his very best to work with me on my negative experiences. He was empthatic and helpful, and I am grateful for his assistance. But I know from experience that this hotel is in over its head and has bitten off more than it can chew, and I feel badly for Michael because I know that dealing with these large issues is exhausting and unrewarding. I did so much research on this hotel, drooled over the photographs on Trip Advisor, and I could rattle off the details of the hotel before I arrived. I was intensely excited to arrive at La Concha for my solo trip, a 4-night, 5-day stay. I bragged to my friends the accolades of my guest room and the service I would receive. Check-in was a nightmare. I was told that I would not be getting the oceanview room that I had paid for on Expedia. I was asked to show proof I had booked it, so I logged into my Expedia account *at* the front desk to prove that I had booked it, since it was not in the hotel's system. They said they were sold out of the oceanview rooms, and that it was impossible for me to have one. So, I was given an 'upgrade' in the new wing, not facing the ocean. I thought, sure, I'll work with the hotel, not against it. So I go into the room, isolated in some creepy corner. No curtains in the window in the shower which faced other buildings, no garbage cans, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, no desk, no chair, no place to put a laptop. No directory, no clock, and behind some slated wall was some sort of engine or pump that was very loud. This was no upgrade; it was 1/3rd of the size of the room I had paid for. After trying to deal with these issues over the phone without success, I went back down to the lobby. I had to be a squeaky wheel. This was not the experience that I had paid for. Michael Tischler helped me get the oceanview room that I had booked. I was very content. This is the room that I paid for. Michael did his best with service recovery. He sat down with me and apologized and offered to treat me to dinner at Solera, which is the restaurant outside near the ocean, off of the lobby. Unfortunately, this experience made my blood go back to a boil. I awkwardly seat myself after 20 restaurants workers mulling around socializing give me weird looks. I was expecting a warm welcome; Michael told me that the restaurant staff was expecting me because I experienced some troubles upon check-in. I was the *only* person there. I wait 10 minutes for the waitress to sulk over and reluctantly take my order. 10 minutes later, I still hadn't received my soda. So I went to the bar to get it. The waitress watches me do it. I go back and sit down. 10 minutes later, the food arrives. It's fine. I need more soda. I wait for waitress to come back and check on me so I can get more soda. She never does. I go back to the bar to get more soda. The waitress watches me do it. I go back to my food, take a few more bites, and at this point, I'm seething mad that I had chosen to come here, I walked out and told Michael Tischler what happened. Again, he tried his best to soothe me, and I was grateful, but honestly, it failed. Beyond this, the rest of my experience was very disappointing. I can honestly say that there was only one employee who smiled at me the entire time. It was one of the doormen/valets. He was so friendly. After years of giving out warm smiles to weary travelers dumping money at my place of employment, I got none from the desk attendants, barstaff, nobody. So disheartening... isn't anyone interested in making me feel welcome? Housekeeping service was mediocre, inconsistent and spotty. Some days I received replenishment of water and toiletries, sometimes I didn't. Sebastian at the concierge desk was helpful, as was another gentleman that I cannot remember his name. Honestly, readers, the only thing that lifted my spirits were a few of the excursions. I LOVED the horseback riding in the foothills of the rainforest and on the beach. The guide even understood how important photos are, and we had a photo op with our horses right on the beach! Very, very exciting, please try it! I also did a snorkeling trip to Flamenco Beach on the high-speed catameran. The boat crew and the lunch were phenominal. Great value; all you can eat food and DRINKS for something around $100 which includes snorkeling and a trip to the beach. I recommend without reservations!! Also, Tantra indian restaurant in OSJ was excellent, as was the PR food place directly across the street from the hotel. Delicious. Also, the spa across the street does in-room massages for $85. Mine was excellent, I also highly recommend that. The Italian restaurant Il Postino behind the Subway is also outstanding; went there twice. The hotel too many bar backs, servers, busboys mulling around, but not enough front offifce staff. There was always a back-up at the concierge and front desk. PBX (aka the people who answer when you press \"0\") seemed to be staffed pretty well. My last night on the way back from dinner, I witnessed a Marriott Platinum Member still trying to get into his oceanview room. It was 7 PM, and he was still unable TO BE CHECKED IN. Here is a PLATINUM member unable to get any level of service. I spoke with him and his wife and urged him to speak to Michael about his issues. They were appalled, as I was. Platinum members are the cash cows of Marriott, and he should have been assigned to an oceanview room by the Rooms Controller, which I doubt this property even has, given as though he can't even check at such an absurdly late hour. Sad. Very sad. For 4 nights, I spent almost $900 to stay here, and I didn't split that with anyone. Knowing what I know now, I could have saved myself the trouble, booked at some value-based property, and spend the extra $500 on something else. If you are expecting warm, welcoming, well-executed service, I don't feel this is the place for you. Sure, the property is gorgeous, but quite honestly, I've had superior experiences at bare-bones properties.

From the amenities in the rooms, to the three small pools with not enough umbrellas to the overwhelmingly loud techno music in the lobby on sat night (we are young and love this music too but not in this context). The food was good overall. There is no spa in the hotel, you have to use one down the street. The spa services were awful. The worst part was the room. We tried to fit three people in a \"suite\" thinking two on the king bed and one on the pullout couch. But the couch was tiny, uncomfortable and right by the entry door with the noise from the hall preventing sleep. This same couch was made of fake leather i.e. plastic and therefore unusable as anything other than a place for luggage. the floor tile in the \"living room\" made it feel totally cold, sterile, and uncomfortable. the 7th floor in the \"new wing\" where we stayed was just being opened and NONE of the kinks had been worked out. The AC never worked properly and the room was always warm and muggy, despite 3 calls to engineering. the \"suite\" was tiny and couldnt fit more than 2 people. The bathroom walls were all cloudy glass, without a door on the shower, so when you showered, the entire bathroom floor got wet. Also, the glass walls offered to privacy to those in the bathroom from those in the bedroom area. On our 2nd night, we found a huge cockroach in our hallway.

We are a low-key couple who enjoys a quiet location, calm poolside experience, a nice/attractive beach, safe neighborhood, and good quality room with good service. For the purposes of rating different elements, I'll use a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is horrible, and 5 is outstanding. Pre-Arrival: I'd have to give this a 5. I corresponded with Ana Aponte via email over the course of about two months. I was rather concerned about the complaints of noise, and had a series of questions ranging from hotel location, to size of room safes, etc. Ms. Aponte always had a response available for me within 24 hours of sending my emails, and the responses were sufficient to answer my questions. She helped to allay some of our fears. Needless to say, we were still a bit apprehensive about the noise issues reported on TripAdvisor and thinking of booking at another hotel (we had stayed at a decent one over in the Isla Verde area several years back, but wanted something newer). But, we moved forward with out plans to stay at La Concha, and we're pretty happy with that decision. Arrival: Bellmen gets a 5. They were quick to respond, friendly and didn't appear to be \"hovering\" like many do because they want a tip. Check-in was pretty efficient. What really made us extremely happy was that our flight arrived VERY early and we were at the hotel at 10:30 AM...and they actually had our room ready for us! We didn't expect that (nor should knowledgeable travelers expect this if the hotel was at capacity the night before. People don't exit rooms until near noon). So having access to the room was a very pleasant surprise, and a VERY welcome relief, since we had to endure a 7 hour red-eye from LAX! Room: This, I would like to give a 5, but I just can't. It's a solid 4. Beds were made, furniture was in good working order, bathroom had been cleaned. And the room was a good size (we had room 920) with sofa, workdesk/chair, large flat-screen TV, and very large storage spaces! The bathroom was pretty cool as well. The shower was a walk-in with ambient lighting. There is not a bathtub, however. Here's why I couldn't rate it a 5. There were indications of water intrusion in the ceiling (painted over mold spots). Near the a/c vent, there was visible mold on the ceiling. There were also mold stains (not actual mold, but the stains from where the water pools in the shower) on the shower grout lines. Lastly, the furniture was a bit banged up. On the night-stand, it almost looked like some previous tacky guest tried to carve something into it. Since it's blond wood, it shows everything. Housekeeping. Gets a 4. When they showed up, they did a super job! No issues to note! The reason I can't give it a 5 is because on two of the seven days, they just didn't show up at all. When we returned to the room one evening, we called and a gentleman promptly brought up towels and soap, but said the maid would stop by shortly. She again never showed up. No big deal since we still had toiletries from the previous night. Restaurants: I think this needs three scores. One for the staff (a 4), and one for the physical space/furnishings, etc (a 5). Most of the staff were very attentive and friendly. We had breakfast almost every morning at the Level 25 restaurant and enjoyed the staff and space quite a bit. The omelette guy could afford to smile once in a while. But hey...I just wanted to eat (just noticed he didn't seem too thrilled to be there each day. Or maybe it was just me). I think the biggest disappointment though has to be the food quality. This, I have to give a 3. The reason is pretty simple. While one would be foolish to not expect to pay resort fees ($20-25 for buffet breakfast) at a resort hotel, one would not be foolish to expect good quality food. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was just not up to par with the pricing. One evening, we walked down to Chili's and on the way back noted, to be fair, that Chili's food quality is exactly on par with what was served at La Concha. Only, it was well under half the price. Same held true for lunch at the poolside restaurant. Just not worth the money spent...every time! (Had some FABULOUS dinner experiences nearby though...Ropa Vieja, Budathai (though don't order the Lo Mein), and in Old San Juan, Raices). But as mentioned, the staff working the restaurants certainly made our time there pleasant enough. Renaissance/Marriott need to upgrade the food quality though! Public Spaces. Definitely gets a 5! Clean, tastefully done to that art-deco to mid-century modern look. Pool areas spotless. Plants lush, grounds well taken care of. Just top-notch public areas! Concierge. Definately gets a 5! During the first half of our trip, we spoke with two young folks who did their level best to help us. In fact, they recommended some of the restaurants mentioned above that we enjoyed. They were always prompt and courteous. But we really have to commend Louise! Having been fortunate enough to travel the world and stay at some pretty top-notch places, I have to say that she is one of the best concierge staff we have encountered. A good concierge can \"size people up\" with just one or two questions. She was able to ascertain exactly who we were, what our tastes included, what our dislikes were, etc. Every recommendation she provided was spot-on! What surprised us was that she had even recommended places that had only been open for two weeks. These too were excellent. Just a fabulous concierge, and someone you feel like you could easily be friends with...very down to earth! She knows her business! Check-out was a 5. There were a lot of people, but they had ever station manned and were doing the best they could. We only had to wait about 5 minutes and they moved the line quickly. Okay....what about that noise issue? This was by far a most nerve-wracking decision whether to stay at this hotel or not. The last thing you want is to dish out a large chunk of change, only to have your whole vacation experience ruined. And I have to tell you that I have to be one of the lightest sleepers around. I sometimes don't think I actually sleep at all...just sort of lay in semi-lucid daze. Anyway, we arrived on a Friday morning and stayed clear through seven nights. NOT ONE TIME were we bothered by noise! Yes...they had a party in the lobby (there's a large bar in the middle of it and people spill out in to the pool area adjacent to it). But the only way you're going to hear anything is to turn your TV off, get up off of your bed, and go rest your ear against the door. Granted, we were on the ninth floor and maybe that had something to do with it. But even then, I went down the balcony hallway to take night pictures of the pool (lit up in really cool colors) and the noise was just not that bad. If you're someone who focuses in on the slightest potential irritant and then amplifies it in your mind, then maybe this is not the place for you. Likewise, I'm sure if you had one of the rooms that's right next to the pool area, that's probably not the best experience either. But the vast majority of rooms are in the tower, and don't start until the third floor. In retrospect, we just don't understand what all the fuss is about! The hotel is definitely \"the in place\" for the 20 to 30 something year old set. But we think it could also be a very relaxing and (yes) quiet location as well. Condado is not known for being a low-key, quiet area anyhow. If we were to return to San Juan for a third vacation, we would certainly consider a return visit to La Concha.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNoisy\u201d", "Author": "Andrew030", "ReviewID": "UR64877182", "Content": "This hotel is great, if you don't like sleeping.

The bellman escorted me, or I should say, transported me from a balmy San Juan day into a cool audio, visual and sensory oasis that is La Concha. You just kind of downshift as you walk into this large and airy white expanse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c floor to ceiling glass pulls you out to the multi-tiered pool scene; very contemporary white leather furniture and a funky bar at center immediately adds another line to your to-do-list, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Return here after 5pm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; and soft hues of sea foam lighting gently moderates the atmosphere while rhythmic background music calms the senses and sets the tone for the pending decompression. Though the lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous glass walls were open to the pool, the lobby is both fairly quiet and cool. Then, for a moment, a shock out my island calm: they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over-sold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I had a confirmed reservation) and I would be staying in La Concha Towers. Was this a bait and switch to some lesser property? It happened at the Loews in Miami, BUT NOT HERE, I was immediately escorted not to some other lesser hotel but instead, to a large natural lighted breezeway just beyond the front desk. Rich white paint, hearty walnut wood and large panels of ocean-side glass led to a condo-hotel tower with full services from La Concha. I paused at a water fall as all of the sudden everything became quiet, there literally was no other noise but the cascading water and I almost thought I was heading to some tranquil spa. Inside the condo-hotel was large atrium being prepped for dozens of pots of greenery. My 8th floor room was a brand-new ocean-front suite with a living area and full kitchenette, angular yet comfy modern leather furniture with a flat screen TV, a set of long closets on across from the bathroom which had a heavy glass walk-in shower and one of those overhead rain-shower showerheads (what are those things called??) and a separate water closet which I always think is a nice touch, as are Aveda bath products. The bedroom was fairly good size, with what I soon learned was a fabulous bed and linens, and floor to ceiling glass sliders lead out to a terrace with hearty chairs and a table. From my perch I can see one the great benefits of La Concha: no other hotels abut the property so the beach is really yours. Once on the beach, there is a partial jetty that protects the eastern side from waves. Bronzing guests spread out along the beach and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel crowded in any way. Staff lead me out with a chaise and towels and within 10 minutes a server arrived. She returned with my Don Q and diet coat and menu. Duck quesadillas were terrific, get them with extra sour cream. A spa and/or masseuse was located just up from the beach but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t partake. The next day was a little windy and I stayed at the pool; they served an excellent burger, poolside from Solera restaurant, dark and hearty fries too. The first time I stayed here I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice that there was an upper level pool, I just walked past main pool area with its vibe, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice the steps in the back to this hidden gem, as I went to the oceanfront pool to imbibe. There are four different and distinct pools on the property. I had a terrific breakfast sitting outside on the patio of Level 25, the second floor dining room overlooking the pool and ocean. Great coffee! The bar scene at was rather enticing, funky music and quite a crop of people, and while I passed on the happenings I can see why the bar is known as THE happening scene in the area. We dined at Restaurant Compostela which was just a few minutes away and it was fabulous. Roast suckling pig is a killer as is their wine list, perhaps the deepest on the entire island. The next night dinner we had an extraordinary meal at hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main restaurant, La Perla which is something you simply must experience. The hotel is named for the enormous conch shell which sits suspended above the beach in a pool of water and serves at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main restaurant. Once inside this wavy ceiling affect of the conch shell is spectacular! The entire space is white and dominated by its conical shape which is probably is 30+ feet at its peek. Well-dressed guests were admiring the fading light and stunning views through glass windows to the blue ocean. Once it was dark, the white room becomes almost other-worldly, where are you, you think? It really is kind of breathtaking. No-one seemed to be in a rush to go anywhere. Look at the pictures on the web-site, put this restaurant in Miami or LA it would be the place to be\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 put the hotel with it and you might never get an open room. Other subtle details: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gamble and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice the casino as sometimes you hear the noises of the slot machines in hotels with casinos. When two shirts were not delivered when promised, I called downstairs and 15 minutes later they called back to apologize and shortly afterward my shirts arrived. I never mentioned it but when I checked out the laundry bill was removed. I noted below in the rating that the hotel was \"quiet\" because my room, the pool, the time of the beach, lobby area et al is quiet , you don't feel intruded on at all, which to me is a big plus, but the bar scene at night is electric so keep that in mind. The look and layout of the whole property from rooms to lobby, pools to restaurants is terrific, and the professionalism of the staff is commendable. The hotel has most everything one would need, and given that you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying quite the high tariff of other hotels, I am not sure you can beat this place, period.

At 3:30 they had not yet called so we checked at the desk and our room was indeed ready and our lugguge was to be sent up.

We did not realize there were only a few rooms with the balcony until we were laying on the beach the next day, glad we booked the deluxe room.

When we got to the hotel, we left our bags with the receptionist and was told that they would call when the room became available. The initial perception of the hotel once you get there is very modern and chic. It was a mixture of South Beach and the Dominican Republic, very very beautiful sight. Upone checking in at 4pm, the room was very nice and clean....we had a room in the first floor, poolside and were very close to the lobby. I really didnt care about the noise to come from the lobby at night....especially since i was prepared for it. I would def recommend a room by the pool, first cause its cheaper, second because I actually like hearing some sounds and music. Get this room if you love to be by the pool and listen to music at night from the lobby. The pools were very nice as well as the the walkways to the beach (its like a mini lounge area with sofas). The drinks and food were excellent, but a bit expensive. This hotel is great for young couples in their 20s or 30s. Loved the locaton of the place....dead center in the Condado region of San Juan (very affluent area). The only complaint was the bus to old San Juan. It rarely comes and when it comes and you dont have change for it, they kick you out. (This happend to me) Make sure you have exactly .75 per person. All in all, great impression of San Juan, and would recomment it to anyone.

So we were in our room by 9:30 and had a whole day to enjoy! Our children enjoyed the pools and I loved lounging near the infinity pool enjoying beautiful weather and unbelievable views. The grounds and hotel decor are truly a sight to see. There are different pool areas to choose from as well. All have beautiful trees, shrubs & flowers surrounding them, with lots of lounge chairs to choose from. The hotel room itself was clean and roomy. Tons of closet space, flat screen large tv, comfortable beds, rain type shower head & walk in shower. Aveda products were a treat as well. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view of the beach & ocean with nothing to spoil it (no other buildings, etc.) The prices of drinks were quite high - $10 to $12 each. Breakfast buffet was $25 and for the kids it was $12. I do highly recommend it as well. Delicious! Subway is directly across the street, where we chose to have an affordable lunch. Found it funny that they serve alcoholic beverages - slushy type tropical drinks for $5! Touring and shopping in Old San Juan was a quick taxi ride away for $14 I think.

The beach was small but with all the hotels so close together I guess that is to be expected. My biggest issue with the beach was the huge eyesore right next door. There are a few abandoned, run down hotels covered in graffiti directly next to the hotel. My fiance didn't see this as a big issue but when you're laying on a beach on vacation why do you want to look at that? Another con was the outlets in the bathroom didn't work, the drain in our shower didn't work either so the water piled up after several days and never went down so after a while it was a small wading pool and we lost about 45 min one day because our key didn't work. Pros: Very nice, clean room with gorgeous view of ocean. I booked directly through the hotel and feel I got an amazing price for the room. Also, food was great.

The infinity pool is just beautiful and one of our favorite features. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant by the lobby was very good. Expensive, but we expected that. The burgers were to die for and - bonus - huge. We had one lovely meal at the Perla restaurant. Highly recommend going at 6 when they first open because we got the best table in the place, overlooking the ocean. Very romantic and the staff was incredibly attentive. Food was amazingly good. I had the sorullos with black beans. I was intrigued by the combination. Glad I went with that dish. Portions are on the small side, but we had ordered salads, so it was plenty. Our biggest gripe was the housekeeping. We had to wait two hours to get our room the first day. Worst part was they wouldn't give us an idea of when it would be ready, so we kept waiting and waiting in the lobby. Liked the free wi-fi. Then, the next day, housekeeping didn't show up until 4 p.m. Seriously?! We just wanted to shower and get ready for our dinner, but had to go entertain ourselves at the pool while she cleaned our room. When we got back, she hadn't left enough towels. The towels we got were rough and were very frayed. Not impressed. The room was small. And none of the rooms have a balcony. In order to enjoy the ocean view (we paid extra for), we had to stand by the window. And because we were in a lower floor, and the window is so big, we felt like anyone could see into our room. So we shut the curtains, which meant we couldn't look at the view. Ugh. The beach right outside the hotel is beautiful, but know that it's really not great for swimming. It's too rough.

The open-air lobby is extremely well executed, with an inviting all-white marble floor, gorgeous in-floor LED ambient lighting, and a big, open bar in the middle. The first two nights, we were in the two-story, pool-side rooms. These are vastly less preferable to the tower, beach-facing rooms for obvious reasons, but even still, the room itself was nice and modern: blonde furniture, inviting desk chair, very updated bathrooms with rain shower and hand-held water sources (though it makes for a messy floor when showering, and there's no tub if you're a bath person), and a spacious terrace overlooking the pool. The Aveda products are great. The ocean-facing rooms offer jaw-dropping views of the Atlantic and a secondary pool, though on this side, only the corner suites have a terrace. The view and the sound of the crashing surf are lovely. The first two nights we paid $300/night (well, someone paid), which is pretty dear. The ocean-facing nights (two for a total of 60k Marriott points) were obviously a better deal. As others have noted, the hotel is LOUD at night, especially on the weekends. The hotel has a casino that I didn't frequent, and a new tower over the casino is slated to open soon. Yes, the restaurants are expensive, but I expect nothing less in a resort. The pool-side bar food isn't bad, actually, and the service is good. But what I really like about this hotel is that it's in an urban location, with street life--albeit catering to tourists.

The beach attendant was helpful in setting up chairs, and quite friendly, as were the valets. The casino was fun. Good shower fixtures & water pressure, nice Aveda products. So overall the experience was fine, but that was it...not great, just fine.

There are three things which I want to talk about specifically in this review: 1. Location of the hotel: The resort is strategically located in Condado, which is a very nice and touristy part. It is in walking distance to many restaurants and pubs (thereby you avoid expensive dining in this resort). The bus stop is right in front of the hotel (though the bus frequency is slightly questionable). We took buses most of the time to go to old San Juan, which saved some $$. The beach is right adjacent, so you can take nice long walks along the ocean. 2. The room itself: Our room was nice, small, and clean. It had big glass windows which could be opened to hear the ocean waves. The view of the ocean from our room was pure awesome. One thing which bothered me was the air conditioning of the room. Puerto Rico is humid, so a good air conditioner becomes even more important for a good night's sleep. In this case, it sucked!! So, most nights were sleepless. 3. Ask for Louise Graulau: She is a staff in the resort and is probably the most helpful resource you will find in terms of guiding you to the best places in Puerto Rico. When we just asked her cursorily about what the more interesting places around were (expecting she will probably give a laundry list of places to go), she actually asked us if we had a specific plan. Based on what we said, she printed us detailed maps and driving directions with suggestions for what to do where and the whole itinerary for the day. She also suggested us the good restaurants around the resort which were not expensive. All, in all, she pretty much planned 2 full days for us during our vacation, which was clearly above and beyond what the staff is most hotels do.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMy Visit to the La Concha\u201d", "Author": "travellady010", "ReviewID": "UR59465653", "Content": "I wanted to express my great stay at the La Concha Resort I had a very relaxing week at enjoyed with my family.

My husband and I were traveling with our 5 month old baby, my parents and my siblings. My parents stayed at La Concha in January and had such a nice time that they decided to take us all there in March. Having previously read reviews where people complained about noise from the lobby, my parents informed the hotel during their January stay that they would be returning with a baby and received assurances from the hotel that this is a \"family friendly\" hotel (to the hotel's credit there were plenty of kids and families staying there during our stay) and that it is very unusual to hear noise in the rooms and in any case we would all be placed in rooms where there would be no chance of hearing any noise in the \"unlikely\" event that there was noise. When my parents called a few days before we arrived for our March trip, the hotel said that they would honor their request to put us in rooms on the 10th floor (where they stayed back in Jan). However, when my parents arrived one day before the rest of the family, they were told that all of the rooms on the 10th floor were taken. To make matters worse, they put my parents in a room the size of a broom closet. When my parents complained, the hotel did do the right thing and offered to change their room the following morning. The next day (when the rest of the group arrived) they gave us all nice sized rooms on the 6th and 7th floors. I really was all ready to write a nice review on tripadvisor based on our experience at the hotel on a Wednesday. The rooms have incredible views of the ocean and we fell asleep to the waves crashing. The pools and grounds are lovely- different pools on different levels with a mixture of beds and lounge chairs and you never have that feeling of being piled on top of each other like at a lot of resorts. Condado itself is very up and coming- great restaurants and some cute shopping. However, on Thursday night the lobby turned into a club and things got progressively worse from there. First of all, in order to get to your rooms, you need to walk through the lobby \"club\". The hotel does not offer any other means of getting to the rooms for guests who don't want to be subjected to the club. The noise was deafening, but luckily we could not hear anything in our rooms. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Friday and Saturday nights, where we were kept up the entire night by unbelievably loud club music in our rooms. And, as if the club music blasting in our rooms (on the 6th and 7th floors!!!) was not bad enough, there were drunken people running through the hallways making a ton of noise at crazy hours too. The hotel has ZERO security with respect to who has access to the different floors. In other words, people who come for the lobby club (non guests) can easily walk into the elevators and go up to any of the floors with guest rooms. There is heavy drinking and partying at the club and any of these drunken individuals can come up to any of the floors that you may be staying on because the hotel has no security personnel checking room cards to ensure that the only people using the elevators are hotel guests. We feel lucky that we only had to deal with the noise of drunken people running through the hallways.... it could have been so much worse (fights, crime, etc.). When my parents complained to \"management\" about all of the noise in our rooms on Friday night, they received an apology and were told that there was a DJ spinoff and that Saturday would be much quieter. Not surprisingly, this was just another lie, as Saturday night the noise in the rooms was 10 times worse (to the point that I tried to put towels in the door crack to dampen the noise). When I called at 1 AM to ask how long the music and noise in the rooms would go until, I was told in the most casual manner \"until 4 AM,\" as if it was perfectly normal to pay upwards of $350 a night to be kept awake until 4 AM by ridiculously loud music in your room. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told that the manager would call back but (again, not surprisingly) he or she never called. I see that a manager named Eddie often responds to people's reviews on this site. We tried to speak to Eddie on Saturday to complain about our experience on Friday, but were told that he would be available to speak to on Sunday. When we tried to speak to him on Sunday (the day we were all departing) we were told that he was conveniently \"off the premises.\" So don't be fooled like we were by his seemingly caring tripadvisor responses.... when all is said and done, Eddie could care less about his guests experiences and satisfaction. Interestingly, when my husband went to the front desk on Sunday to ask for change, he saw a notepad with multiple room numbers and complaints from those rooms. All of the complaints were about noise in the rooms from the club in the lobby. Obviously, this is not a new problem. The hotel is completely aware of the noise in the rooms and is doing nothing about it except lying to its own guests and people on tripadvisor, leading us to believe that they are taking steps to change things or that one person's bad experience with noise is a highly unusual occurrence. If this hotel wants to be like the Shore Club in Miami (which is not the type of place you'd bring the kids to), that is fine. Just don't lie to your guests and make it seem like you are a family friendly hotel when it's clear that you are not and have no desire to be. And even at the Shore Club or other \"hipster\" hotel, I don't think guests would be happy to hear music blaring into their rooms at all hours of the night! The hotel did give my parents some compensation for our terrible experience, but not nearly enough in my opinion. My husband and I are avid travelers with friends who love to travel and will never recommend this hotel to anyone. Although, sadly, I don't think La Concha will care too much about this because my guess is that they make more money off of the club than anything else since they definitely value it way more than the guests staying at the hotel.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ferndale, MI", "Title": "\u201cOver the Top Service!\u201d", "Author": "mdisc22", "ReviewID": "UR59230195", "Content": "As a relatively frequent traveler, about 100K airline and 75 - 100 hotel nights, I have experienced a full range of service levels at various properties and airlines. La Concha rates #1 based on my recent experience. I stayed for 6 nights in March with my then girlfriend and now fiance. Since I was surprising her with an engagement ring at the hotel, I wanted the stay to be very special. I e-mailed the general Concierge inbox well in advance of my stay and very luckily got a response from Emily Vallejo Rivera. She was absolutely spectacular - setting up all of our excursions (which were plentiful and frequently changing), receiving my flowers and having them and champagne in the room upon arrival, having the ring secured in the hotel safe during the stay. She even called our tour guide when she knew I was proposing to make sure everything went OK - and she was done working for the day! Wow. The rest of the Concierge staff were just as good and the manager, I believe, Louisa, was a tremendous help as well. The room was fantastic - 12th floor junior suite. The food and drink were pricey, but relative for high-end resorts. The best part is that there are tons of food and drink options just a short distance from the hotel. Typically when you travel to a resort in the Caribbean, you are pretty much stuck at the hotel and feel gouged. Here you had the option to leave. Very nice. The last part was the newly opened Concierge lounge. For Gold and Platinum Marriott members, you know how nice this amenity is. Typically resorts do not have them, but our arrival date was the opening day for La Concha's. Overlooking the ocean with beautiful wicker furniture, breakfast was served in the morning and appetizers and drinks in the evening. We took full advantage of this and ate every morning in the lounge and had a beer or two each evening. As it was their first days open, I believe they underestimated the demand for food as they ran short a few times during the week. I think it was just opening issues, but I feel it needs to be expressed. However, the staff here were just as great as the Concierge. The manager, Michael Tischler, was fantastic and very approachable. His staff (Janisa, Johanna, Arcino, Dorian, and Luis) were also extremely friendly! All in all, I would recommend La Concha to anyone and we look forward to returning next year to celebrate once again!

Even though they were pricey, I did not mind paying for it since everything else was so nice. The rooms were very comfortable. The bathrooms were updated with glass showers and blue lights that put a different spin on things. They had iPod docks to play your music which was nice for the little time we spent in our room.

To complicate things, we changed affiliate airlines, Delta to American, so both airlines were telling me to talk to the other airline since it was the other ones responsibility. After a hundred dollars of roaming cell phone calls, I went to the front desk with my problem. They aggressively attacked the problem. Once they found out were the bag was (giving me updates every time they made any progress) they sent a driver to the airport to retrieve the bag. It was then immediately delivered to my room, followed by a call telling me my bag was safe. They did not have to do any of this, but took care of everything with a smile.

We are in our 20s and found the activities and layout of the hotel were adult friendly... in fact there were hardly any kids (which was nice). The rest of the crowd was a bit older than us...i'd say the average age is 40, but that didn't bother us much. CLEANLINESS: Place was very clean, including our room. Only complaint here is that it takes housekeeping a long time to get to your room. LOCATION loved the location... it's close to a handful of local restaurants. Had a great italian dinner at a place called Postino. Also, make sure you try some authentic Puerto Rican food (fried plantains and chicken)... so good. The location is a cab ride away from Old San Juan. We spent 2 days cruising old San Juan which was fun, but crowded on one day because of a cruise ship. Seeing the old Fort is a must! (cab ride is $15 with tip)... or take the bus for 75 cents! ROOMS We had a room on the 11th floor overlooking the ocean. It was very spacious and clean. Not sure if this is the norm though from other reviews I've read... I asked for a room that was higher up b/c I was under the impression that the lower floor rooms were a bit smaller. SERVICE Can't say enough about the service. I am a Platinum member for Marriott and the staff was very responsive to my requests. When I arrived, I asked for a room on a high floor and got it. I had free breakfast everyday b/c I am Platinum, but my girlfriend didn't... All I did was ask for her to have free breakfast and they gave her coupons for every day! I was given two free drinks for my birthday plus was bought a shot. One day I chipped my tooth after being rocked by a huge wave... I went to the bar and they gave me another 2 free drinks... which helped with the pain ;-) VALUE Very good value for the stay... I didn't pay for the room since I used my points but I would still think it was a pretty good deal. I will say that it can get pricey. Drinks are between $7 (beer) and $14 at the bar... which is a bit steep if you're from the midwest like I am. Either way, we had $250 free b/c of Marriott gift cards I exchanged some of my credit card points for so it made it pretty manageable.

We had a great stay here and would recommend the hotel to other young couples and our friends. Our room was very trendy and mondern with a great and efficient layout. We didnt use the T.V. at all during our stay, but there was a large LCD in the room. Also, they had an ipod docking station alarm clock that we used to play our own music at times. The bed was the highlight of the room. Both of us have spent a lot of time in hotels for our jobs, so neither of us have trouble sleeping in hotels. However, this bed was amazing and we really got great rest and felt completely recharged when our vacation was over. The resort property was very luxurious and was great for relaxing on the beach or near the pool. The beach at the hotel is a little \"cove\" like. There is a jetty that sticks out into the ocean that causes the surf to be a little rougher than other areas of the beach. Also, as a heads up for oceanswimmers, because of the increased surf near the jetty, this spot seems to be a favorite for local surfers. There were approximately 5-6 surfers there during the weekend of our stay. They didnt bother anyone, but it was a little nerve wracking because it would be very possible to get hit by one of them if you weren't careful. The property has three pools and two hot tubs. In the courtyard area there are two pools, an upper and a lower that flow into each other. This is the most popular spot to sun bath if you are looking for direct sun. There are waieters and waitresses that will serve drinks poolside here and near the beach. We observed this, but didnt use this service during out stay. The one thing we liked was that the wait staff would only come if you did to you if you flagged them over. They didnt hound you to buy drinks if you weren't interested. To some people this may be annoying, but we were happy with this. We booked our stay using Marriott Rewards points so the value for us was great, but without using points the hotel would have definitely been a splurge. The bars at the hotel are awesome and the drinks are well made and very big. I was a huge fan of the mojitos. Just be aware the drinks are pretty similar to NYC prices. We would usually get a drink or two every night and sit in one of the outdoor seating areas in the courtyard bar area. There are lots of spaces that are very private to have a drink and just talk. Also, many nights the hotel had live music or a D.J. We ate lunch at the hotel once and the food was very good. However, we didnt eat at the hotel restaurant or get room service during our stay. At night our routine would be to walk to one of the local restaurants and get dinner and drinks. There are a number of decent restaurants near by. However, I wouldnt say that the food in Puerto Rico was the high point at all. We ate and drank well, but the food was average. For breakfasts in the morning I would usually walk to Starbucks (5 min walk) or Dunkin Donuts (across the street) to grab morning coffee and something light to eat. During lunch, if you wanted to get something less expensive there are a lot of local places and some fast food places like Subway or Wendys nearby. The concierge staff was attentive and will suggest restaurants for you. Also, if you are interested in doing any activities they can help arrange that for you. We drove to the rainforest one day and they provided us with a trail map, background information, and driving directions. The only annoying thing that occured during our stay was that we got stuck in Puerto Rico an extra day due to a snow storm in our area. The front desk made extending our reservation a little difficult. They were polite and courteous, but because we wanted to use Marriott points they gave me a little bit of a run around. I ended up being able to successfully extend my reservation with points, but it was just a little annoying to have to deal with the back and forth.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "trvlr50", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but Un-Organized\u201d", "Author": "trvlr50", "ReviewID": "UR57125002", "Content": "My husband and I found La Concha Hotel last year while visiting San Juan.

They had held our luggage and at the time our room was ready, we asked to take our luggage ourselves up to the room. They insisted they would deliver it for us. Thirty minutes after we were in the room, the luggage arrived but only 1 suitcase. They did not know where the other luggage went. My husband ran down to the front desk (yet another time) to find his luggage as part of the lost luggage was his briefcase with his laptop and other expensive equipment. They did not know where it went. We found out it had been delivered to another room and the gentleman was kind enough to inform them it was not his luggage. This entire fiasco cost us our afternoon of 3 hours which would have been spent visiting San Juan. Additionally, since my husband is a Platinum member with Marriott, we were offered a room amenity basket. We chose the items we wanted and it did not get delivered. We had to ask for the delivery and when it came, the items were incorrect. To add fuel to the fire, they ended-up charging us for the free amenity! We did get that resolved at the time of check-out but the entire experience left us very disappointed. Also, as insignificant as this complaint might be, I wanted to add that while we were waiting for our room, I used the ladies room in the lobby. It was dirty and smelled horrible.

Puerto Rico on this side of the island is not known for their beaches, but the warm temps and sun the best sunbathing is done by the pool but don't expect stellar service, or attentive service I have expected at other \"resorts\". Service is ok, but during my stay it seemed the staff had many opportunites to circulate around and help, like taking drinking orders around the pool - they did not. You had to schlep to the \"bar\" area to get what you needed. The hotel is an area that is a bit distressed and trying to make a comeback. La Concha gets some details right, like the Casino, well appointed, hip, modern. But misses so much more. For $399 per night for a 12' x 24' size room (with view) I found the room details lacking such as a broken remote control, desilvered mirrors, only one bathroom, an iron that was rusted and missing Do Not Disturb sign. So the higher price I guess I was expecting more from the quality and the service which did not deliver. When told about the lack of service (esp. no room service after 11 PM! - WTF?) despite their menu saying cold items availiable, the stay recommend I walk across the street at midnight to the Subway despite them still serving drinks at the bar and the Casino going at all hours. Amazing that not one Pizza joint in all of San Juan would deliver to this hotel. I guess you get better response out of hotel in Duluth, MN than this place. Disappointing. I would recommend this hotel if you are young and single and have some money to burn,but don't expect too much service and a distant attitude to most employees (except valet service - they were great). Also if you have kids be careful about a potential dangerous undertow at the beach area, which had security present but seem to be absent of any lifeguards. Overall I would say I recommend but with reservations and a bit of downer for any special occasion where you would expect above and beyond service.

All hotel staff were attentive and friendly. - There are many great restaurants and bars that are walking distance from this hotel and you can completely get by without eating at the hotel, which is overpriced. The negatives: - If you are on a low floor by the pool, the noise of the night club may disturb you if you are a light sleeper. I could faintly hear it in the room until between 12 and 1. - Almost everything in this hotel is outrageously overpriced. A Bud Light beer cost around $8 at the night club, and a buffet breakfast that was nothing special was $25 a person at the restaurant. The only decently priced restaurant in this resort is the sandwich shop by the casino. - If you rent a car, they charge you $15 a day to park it at the resort. I give this hotel an overall positive review and I would stay there again. You can get around the negatives by asking for a room on a higher floor or adjusting your schedule so that you go to bed late (things quieted down between 12 and 1) or wear ear plugs! This is probably only a problem if you are a light sleeper as I am. It is not terribly loud, but you can still hear the music in your room. As for the $15 for parking, there are so many good restaurants and bars in the area that you won't really need a rental car. Drivers in Puerto Rico were pretty scary anyway! It cost $11 (set rate) to go from the Condado area to Old San Juan (price for one way without tip).

What the hotel does not advertise to it's guests is that the lobby/bar area of the hotel turns into a nightclub on the weekends. They bring in a DJ for the night that spins music until 2:00 a.m. - 3:00 a.m. And since the bar / lobby area that they turn into a nightclub is in the open area of the hotel - the noise from it easily carries to all the guest rooms. Although I was in my hotel room, the party could have been in the room with me. The music was so loud that my room was shaking from it. When I called the front desk to explain my dismay with how loud the music was, (considering it was past midnight and i had gotten up at 5:00 a.m. that day to catch an early flight into PR) the front desk explained the music would probably go to about 3:00 a.m. and unfortunately, I was in a \"bad\" room when it came to being disturbed by the music.

Not too many kids around, and those that were were well-behaved. Only negatives were room carpeting is a bit musty from all that ocean air, but not too bad at all. Kind of nice after a while, actually. Room safe code had to be entered a few times before locking, but then seemed to fix itself. And A/C was off one evening b/c of issue with windows being open, but again self-corrected after opening and closing windows a few times. No big deal. Construction still happening on the condo tower, but looks like it's almost done, and I was never bothered by noise. Condos look like they're going to be nice. La Perla restaurant was excellent - exceeded my expectations. Not cheap, but not overpriced for the quality of the food, and the space is gorgeous. Lamb was the best I've ever had! Service could perhaps been a bit more attentive, but very polite. All in all, a great experience. I'd definitely return. My overall stay in San Juan was a lot of fun. Great balance of relax at beach/pool and stuff to see and do in old San Juan. Recommend Toro Salao (casual tapas-ish, nice outdoor seating in a good people-watching area) and Baru (also shared food, bit more upscale, but not stuffy) in OSJ for food. There's also a good authentic Puerto Rican place for breakfast not far from the hotel, about a five minute walk inland from the beach. The historic fortresses in OSJ are incredible, esp. el Morro. Have lots of room on your camera for pictures. PS Also seemed a gay-friendly hotel.

We took a day long trip to Old San Juan and after 3 attempts to the Bacardi factory we finally made it. I would suggest calling and confirming they are open and how long they will be open for the day. We took the ferry from Old San Juan for 50 cents, couldn't beat it.

We arrived at the pool bar about 11:55 after checking in on a friday and were told that the kitchen was closed by the hostess, not 2 minutes later the bartender said what would you like Ill get the kitchen right on it! and so it went our whole trip - the service was slow around the pool and they gave us free drinks as their apolopgy. It can be loud so I agree with those folks especially on the weekend nights, so you should ask for a quiet room - high up. Definitely the \"in\" hotel!

Clearly, the renovation is incomplete, including our room. The workmanship is poor throughout the hotel and it was evident in the incomplete and dirty hallways leading to our room and the room itself. The shower was moldy and the grout was dirty. The tiles were uneven and many looked like they were slapped on.

When they finally came, I knew they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean anything because the toilet was still dirty, the old towels were still on the floor. I had to go to the lobby at 8pm and ask for towels and soap. The girl at the front desk looked at me like I had 3 heads and took 15 minutes to come back with ONE tiny bar of hotel soap! The bed was so lumpy, it felt like I was sleeping in a big crater and the middle of the bed was a mountain. Also, the hallways are in poor shape, with cracks in the tiles and filth. Cigarette butts and dirty drinking straws all over. I kept note of these to see how many days it would take before they were removed. They were there the entire time of our stay! The halls also constantly smelled like bacon or food from the kitchen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though we were on the 6th floor. Our TV remote control was broken \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again, we had to ask 3 times for a fix.

We picked La Concha after having seen it in 2008, while it was till undergoing renovations to the casino. Back then, even with the renovations going on, we loved the hotel and couldn't wait to come back and stay. We used Marriott points for the stay and unfortunately for us, our flight from FL was delayed to the point that we did not arrive in San Juan until after 9:00 p.m. and didn't get to the hotel till around 10. So we didn't get to utilize the pool or spend time walking the beach, etc., the way we had originally planned to do. What I can tell you is that from the very moment we walked into the lobby upon arrival, the staff and service was exceptional. I don't know if it was because I told our sob story to the gentleman at the front desk who checked us in, or what, but for some reason we ended up in a Presidential Suite on the 11th floor. The views were nothing less than completely spectacular! The room itself was very nice with a good size balcony that had views of both the ocean and the city. Room decor is contemporary - which is not particularly my taste, but if that's your thing, you'll like it a lot. The carpet had most definitely seen better days and was pretty stained. The bed was ultra comfortable! Both the front and back walls of the room are floor-to-ceiling glass. The living room is sliding glass doors that open (wooden slats prevent a clear view from the living room, but there is always the balcony). The bedrom wall is also floor-to-ceiling glass with the upper panels opening completely (no screen). Good closet space. Very small bathroom with shower only, but the shower has a rain-shower type head that is quite wonderful. One thing to note - the shower does not have a traditional door or curtain, but is instead a walk-in type shower only half covered by a glass panel. The floor in the bathroom does tend to get wet, so be sure to put down a bathmat or towel to avoid slipping. I loved the bathroom mirrors, which had lights actually embedded behind the glass - way cool! We did not elect to use the coffee pot, but if we had we would have had to call downstairs as our coffee pot had no actual pot - just the machine. I'm sure it would have been immediately remedied had we called. Since it was Halloween, we went down to the lobby to watch the party. By now it was near 11:00 p.m. and the party was definitely gearing up. Lots of fun costumes and beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) people to watch. We had a cocktail from a very busy cocktail waitress, and enjoyed the sights before retiring around midnight. The next morning we were up fairly early and were downstairs at around 7:30 a.m. The same cocktail waitress who had helped us the night before, was just counting her money at 7:30 a.m. Amazingly, she still looked fresh and energetic. I must be getting old is all I can say. The place was being cleaned up, but there were still plenty of party remnants at that hour. We went in to breakfast and enjoyed a wonderful buffet with a made to order omelet, sitting outside gazing at the spectacular pool views. A couple of party-goers from last night were at breakfast (still in costume) and one \"gent\" felt compelled to lie down across his bench seat. I guess the party was lots of fun! After breakfast we walked down the street to Walgreens - this hotel is ideally situated within easy walking distance of almost anything you could want from ultra high end shopping, to Walgreens, Dunkin Donuts, and the typical souvenir shops. Upon returning to the hotel, it was time to think about getting to the cruise terminal so we gathered our belongings and called for a bellman. Very prompt, extremely friendly and courteous; he hailed us a cab and we bid the La Concha farewell. The hotel is a party hotel on the weekends (we saw this last time we were here as well) and the vibe is energetic and fun. The people who frequent the lobby at night are seemingly young and gorgeous. Cocktail prices are a bit on the steep side, but that is to be expected. The breakfast buffet was $25 but you could make that your meal for the whole day with all that they offered. The pool area is spectacular and I truly regret that we were uable to spend more time there. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is not particularly inexpensive, but I believe there are deals to be had. Main points: gorgeous, sexy lobby and pool areas; great beach with good waves; great location; $19 cab fare from airport; very comfy bed with lots of pillows; unbelievably outstanding service and staff; pricey, but in my opinion worth it; happening vibe on the weekends; great views.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, PR", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location ...

We had read many of the reviews on Trip Advisor, which gave us some great ideas. One fellow had said how easy it was to rent a car from Charlie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather than pay a taxi to take us to some of the special sites. He suggested even places to park. We emailed him with a couple questions on Trip Advisor since he had just recently been to Puerto Rico. He was still on a cruise and emailed us back quickly with some advise which was great. The one thing we really wanted to try was the Zip Line ride in the El Yunque Rain Forest. After connecting with a couple that had commented on Trip Advisor via email, we found it was going to be too strenuous for our age and physical shape. When looking at hotels and places to stay no one offered a shuttle to your hotel in San Juan. By Taxis it would have cost for the two of us $30 just to get to our hotel and another $30 back to the airport. Charlie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car rental had great prices, picked us up at the airport and then back for our return. They also provided us with a nice map and great directions. One thing to remember though, almost everywhere you stay charges you another $15 a night to park, but this is still cheaper than taking a taxi everywhere you want to go. Remember too, that you can take a copy of your own car insurance so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to buy theirs. We looked a many places to stay, but while you are in a place along the ocean it is just perfect to stay where you can lay in bed and look at the ocean and also one that has a pool. We chose La Concha after reading all the reviews. It is a beautiful old but remodeled hotel close in the Condado section of San Juan. The atmosphere is impressive from the time you pull up and all the men dressed in white come to your assistance. All were very kind and helpful. The lobby is open, airy and beautiful. The main restaurant the Perla has a huge seashell shape, great meals but I am not so sure they are worth the price. There is a poolside lounge surrounded by beautiful palm tree, tropical plants and very nice seating areas under umbrellas, which is a nice place to sit and chat or read a book. There is an open passage from the tropical garden to the ocean side where you can pull up a chair in the sand, or relax in the infinity pool under the palms and watch the ocean waves. Wonderful place to relax! The ocean shore along La Concha was very rough when we were there in May. There is a large stone barrier which protects you from the rough water, but this not a place to swim in the ocean. One evening next to the La Concha Hotel is a small city park right along the ocean, where the Puerto Rico Tourism Company put on a great show about the history of Puerto Rican music and dance. They had a great show of singing and dancing for the tourists from the nearby hotels. Of course the Salsa is what they are famous for. There were also many local artisans displaying their wares with many unusual crafts and jewelry. The concierges were extremely helpful with providing us directions and more information about different places we wanted to visit. Our main problem at La Concha was knowing how to use the parking ticket. We got stuck three times at the gate going out when it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take our ticket. Finally a concierge was able to explain that we were to use the same ticket all week\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in San Juan without visiting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old San Juan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. San Felipe del Morro Fort is a must see! It is such a great place to tour and reminisce what it must have been like to be there during the battles. There are just breath taking views. It was a Saturday when we were there and many families were flying dozens of kites on the hillside of the fort capturing the ocean breeze\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just beautiful! The old San Juan area is a wonderful place to spend a day, just strolling through the town and enjoying the blue cobble stone roads, colorful house and narrow streets. It is a great place to shop for touristy things and also enjoy where the tour ships dock and some of the local shops\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I even found some great buys at Marshalls! Take advantage of the locals who are strolling around Old San Juan and waving to catch your attention that they have found you a parking place. Parking is not always easy and we just gave them a tip and they were happy to help us! We like to take our time, get out into the country and drive to see how the locals live. A reminder here on the high ways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c directions are pretty much in Spanish\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. So make sure you know that West is Oeste and East is Este, North is Norte and South etc. We got stuck several times paying one or two dollars on the toll road when we found out we were going the wrong direction and then had to pay the same tolls to come back and get on another road. I would recommend finding a VERY good map that shows the toll roads and directions and read it closely before you get to intersections\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 very tricky! We drove to El Yunque Rain Forest. It is free to get in and beautiful. Make sure you go to the El Portal Visitor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice walk down to the beautiful education center is kinda like walking on the forest top with a great view of the rain forest. There is a short movie describing the rain forest and the ecosystem. The area is beautifully landscaped with flowering plants and trees, many with signs describing them. Make sure you pick up a map of the trials here. We did decide to take the trail down to see the La Mina waterfall. Too late after we had started the beautiful trail did we find that it is not a very easy trail at all! It has many steps, steep in places, narrow at times, and it says about a mile\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it sure seems longer! Wooded plaques said it was about a mile walk to the waterfall, down through the rain forest. It is beautiful trail - take your camera to capture pictures of all the trees, flowers, roots and interesting things along the way. Our movie camera captured the beautiful sounds of the rain forest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice memories to look back on. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start this trail too late in the day or you could get stuck being closed behind the gates in the rain forest. We could hear the falls off in the distance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but we only had enough time to stay a minute and had to hurry to get back to the car. We were exhausted from hurrying up and down the trail! The beauty of the forest and the sounds along the trail far outweighed the beauty of the falls. Make sure you are able to go up and down many steps before tackling this trail. It would be much better to start early in the day with a packed lunch. There are places to stop along the way. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget your bathing suit, many were swimming at the base of the waterfall. It is beautiful. We also drove up to the old Mt. Britton Tower rather than to hike to it. This old tower provides you a wonderful view over the rain forest and out into the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 gorgeous views! It is 3088 ft high up in the rain forest. It was great to hear the little Coqui frogs sing as the sun was going down. If you want to swim in the ocean Luquilla beach is the place to go. It is only about a 45 minute drive from La Concha. There is wide sandy beaches, soft waves and a great place to stroll. You can park right next to the beach and there are many place to relax and enjoy a picnic. There were many locals enjoying their dogs playing in the ocean in the one area. We stopped here on the day we went to El Yunque Rain Forest. We also went horse back riding along the foothills of El Yunque Rain Forest at the Hacienda Carabali. The hotel recommended Hacienda Carabali by as the best place for a trail ride, and it was. I would have enjoyed riding on the beach, but the forest was also beautiful. The best thing about this place is that they suit the rider to the horse. I hate to go on a trail ride where the horses are stuck nose to tail and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really control the horse. I am an experienced rider and it was great to have a horse that I could enjoy. William was our guide on the two-hour ride. There were only three of us on the trail ride. It was wonderful to be able to really enjoy ourselves! We highly recommend Hacienda Carabali! As a reminder\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the two hour ride requires reservations\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but well worth it! Most of the tourist areas speak English well in Puerto Rico but once you are out of the tourist areas most spoke Spanish. We had stopped at several local markets and restaurants along our drive to Arecibo. Most of the adults could not speak to us, but would go gather up a youth to take our order or answer our questions. The teenagers were very pleased to be able to assist us. Most of the adults just seemed shy and would not try to assist us. We drove West \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oeste\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to visit the Lighthouse in Arecibo. It was an interesting drive across the northern part of Puerto Rico from San Juan. You can take the toll road 22 or a local road Route 2 through some of the towns, Manati, and Vega Baja. The restored Arecibo Lighthouse also has a small little village for kids (and adults) to play and learn about the Spanish Conquest. There are replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria. There is a small playground, small animals to touch and a small little Arasibo Indian Village where children and learn and play. There is also a nice small salt-water aquarium to visit. There were lots of school children there that day. This would be a great place to take children. We enjoyed the spectacular views from the lighthouse and the iguanas that scurried along the trail up to the lighthouse. We got some great shots of them! There is so much to see and do in Puerto Rico you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it all in one week! But a wonderful place to visit. Using Trip Advisor is a great place to find deals on hotels and flights!

We ate at the hotel once, at La Perla. AND WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! If you decide to stay here, definitely dine at La Perla.

Unfortunately we were only able to get 2 out of three. We loved the rooms and the view, and the beach was wonderful, but unfortunately the service we received from the hotel was absolutely horrible. When we arrived, we received a nice room and called down to get extra linens for the pullout bed for our children. After calling down we went down to the grill to have dinner. Well dinner took 1.5 hours just to receive all of our meals, and when we came back we still hadn't received the linens. It took an additional 4 calls to get them up to our room. The following day we started having issues with housekeeping, and issues they were. After asking for a 10am clean up with the manager Eddie Sipple, this only happened twice, the rest of the time housekeeping didn't show up till at least 4:30 pm. We then only received turn down service twice out of 7 nights. On the third day the wife took the kids down to the ocean to play in the sand and to play in the ocean. The beach attendant told her that she wasn't allowed to play in front of the meeting room as they wanted a clear view of the ocean. This was uncalled for especially on a \"Public\" beach. Twice while there I contact Eddie to try and correct the problems yet the service still lacked any personality or sincerity. On the last day we were there, everything came to a head and we came home after swimming for 2.5 hours to our door open. We called down to the front desk and we were told that there must be an issue with the door and that it was our fault. After explaining to her that they came in for turn down service and left the door wide open, they young lady didn't even say sorry. I think talked with the manager as we were very unhappy that our valuables have been left available for anyone to take. We were lucky that nothing was taken, but this was unacceptable. The next day we called for a wake up call that never came, and left the resort for back home. Needless to say this day didn't come too soon. We travel the globe to fine places everywhere, and this was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a resort. The lack of sincerity is what confused me. In my opinion, this is a 5 star hotel amenity wise, but 2.5 stars service wise. If you are looking at wanting a vacation of service, fair warning you might now find it here. If they could update the service, it would definitely be a great place to stay.

Everything is modern, chic, comfortable, and stylish. As the hotel is a renovation of a 1950's hotel, the rooms are reached via a balcony walkway outside. It just adds to the ambience of being in a tropical island. The rooms are spacious, flat screen TV, ipod station, computer desk, nice comfy beds, amazing views onto the beach, and even a dvd player. The hotel lobby is a happening place for fun and hanging out at the bar. If your looking for relaxation but no nightlife, this is not the place to be. While we did not participate in the night life, it was fun to have it going on around us, available if we wanted. The pools, chaise lounges, food, and beach are all wonderful. You can truly be in an oasis of relaxation during the day with no distractions. And the steak wrap at the pool is amazing, granted $16 bucks, but when on vacation splurge a little. The hotel is located right in Condado and it has nice stores nearby, a starbucks, walgreens, and other places in walking distance. Some one wrote that the hotel casino was dingy? not at all. and the cafe attached to the hotel off the casino has affordable wraps and food. So, all in all it was a great place to stay, I think the best in the area if you get a good price. Best time to go is during Sept-nov when they have the PR tourism board incentives. We stayed for 4 nights but paid only for two, turned out to be $129 a night. And unlike other hotels, we did not have to pay the additional %14 resort fee. We booked on Travelocity, but all the major sites offer this incentive, you cannot get it from the hotel. Good: Amazing views Spacious Rooms with new amenities Great Staff and good food Relaxing pool and wonderful beach Good safe location Bad: Internet wireless is non-functioning (but when your trying to get away this actually is helpful. They have a laptop in the lobby and computers in the business center if you need to get online) Loud on Friday and Saturday Nights, but gets under control around midnight CAUTION: BEACH WAVES BEWARE-the beach is amazing, and one day we were our the waves were small and fun to play in, but the next day the waves were larger and treacherous. I found this out the hard way when my 325Lb body got tossed like a doll, slamming me into the sand underwater, twisting me like a pretzel, then spitting me up on the beach in a world of hurt.

One of the best I've used in Puerto Rico. Second, the beach really is beautiful and the hotel showcases it well. The large, sliding doors in the room opened up to a mini-balcony and allowed the soothing wave crashes to be heard (if you don't mind having your room feeling a bit damp from the humidity). Third, it is a nice place to relax after a long-day of work. Don't expect a quick check-in or check-out if you have questions. The on-line check out system (accessed from the TV) wasn't working, which was on par with the rest of the technical infrastructure. And, even with a negotiated corporate discount, La Concha is still rather expensive, when compared with similarly appointed places, which makes it a no-so-great value for the money. The one exception is the little cafe adjacent to the rather tired Hotel Casino. The really friendly staff will whip up a made-to-order salad or pizza in no-time. And the value is pretty good.

My husband and I recently stayed at La Concha to celebrate my birthday. ( We stayed from August 28-Sept 1.) Originally we had planned to stay at their sister hotel, El Convento in Old San Juan, but at the last minute changed our minds to La Concha. Boy, I am glad we did it! From the moment you first walk into the lobby area, you already know you are in a for a treat. It's absolutely gorgeous! The resort recently went under renovations so everything is sparkly and new. The architecture and the layout of the entire resort is amazing. When we first arrived we found out that our room wasn't ready, however, Linnette at the front desk was a complete doll in making sure we were taken care of. We received free drinks at the bar, and our wait for our room wasn't even ten minutes. The customer service is impeccable. The room: Okay, so the rooms are lovely, very modern, it's a mixure between luxe/Ikea. The color palette is very fresh with hints of green, blue and white. Honestly, the rooms while beautiful, aren't going to be on anyone's top ten list. But, let me get to the point: The view. Omigod, the view. Most hotels have ocean view rooms, however, whenever you get the there, ocean view, usually means \"halfway blocked by building, sliver of ocean view\". At La Concha, when they say ocean view, they're not playing. The view can only be best described as panoramic. It takes your breath away. The ocean is crystal clear, and the backdrop of the perfect sky is postcard worthy. The resort is full of amenities. There are two very sexy, well placed pools located in the main atrium of the resort, and right next to the beach. There is also an excellent fitness center, which is far better than average hotel. The casino is lively, and on any day you can find an array of people trying their luck at the slots and card tables. The nightlife at the hotel is awesome. Let me clarify something though. I see a few reviews that say the hotel is very noisy, and you can hear the music from the lobby at night. Not so much. There were plenty of times my husband and I would come from the lobby after getting drinks, and you can't hear the noise past the first floor. My husband and I are a young couple who love to party, and be in the center of everything, so that may explain why we are okay with the noise. Besides the lobby,( which by the way, there are absolutely no ugly people in Puerto Rico. everyone is absolutely gorgeous! It's a definite ego boost to be compared, or mistaken for Puerto Rican, as my husband and I were many times.) Things to do: I would definitely suggest getting off of Condado beach and exploring the touristy, and not so touristy areas of Puerto Rico. If you are driving, try to check out the rain forest, and Carolina. Don't go to Wendy's or Mcdonald's, instead try local cuisine. The best places are the hole in the walls. Our favorite food spots were Stop and Go, which is a local convenience store/restaurant located directly across the street from La Concha. It's a very mom and pop style store, with amazing authentic Puerto Rican food. Another favorite was Crozcos, which is located on Ashford avenue. They serve a heavenly breakfast. If you are in old city, try Mojitos, which is a restaurant, not a bar. Let's see,, other things to do..... During the day you could frequent one of the many beaches, or travel down to Old City, and spend a half a day just shopping and taking in the culture. It's a very historic area, so many of the buildings and streets still hold a turn of the century style charm.. Also, there's always the famous Bacardi Factory. Another thing I would suggest is, TAKE THE BUS! There's no better way to explore a place than to take public transportation. We found out so much about the island as as result of this. The bus is only 75 cents, and there is a bus stop located right outside of the hotel. (The route number is B21.) There are cabs everywhere, however, I suggest you negotiate the prices. Many of the drivers add on a few dollars to the regular fare in an attempt to get a better tip, and charge you more, but try to knock down the price some. For instance, not including the tip, you should not have to pay more than $10 or $12 to get from La Concha to Old City. Nightlife is awesome in Puerto Rico . Saturday night we went to Club Brava, which is located on the Isla de Verde. It's a very flashy crowd. Come dressed sexy and fashionable. If you are not a guest at the hotel, then the wait will be very long. (Just jump into the line for the guests, security doesn't check for hotel cards or passes, and the line goes by much faster.) The music is a range between house, reggaeton, and hip hop. There are many bars and lounges in the area as well. The best ones are in Old City. I think that anyone can come here and have a good time. La Concha, and Puerto Rico in general is very family friendly. I don't think it matters if you are an elderly couple or just here solo, you'll have a great time either way.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cLively!\u201d", "Author": "MineralKing", "ReviewID": "UR38871654", "Content": "I stayed in early August for 3 nights at this hotel.

Buyer beware though, because as trendy and gleaming as the lobby and grounds are, this is still very much an old beach hotel. Our first room was very musty and we had to move because the smell was so strong. The rugs were dirty from the usual salt and sand and moisture, giving them an unsightly appearance. The bathrooms are designed without a full shower door (just half) and so with your first shower you learn quickly to keep your clothes and towels on the other side of the bathroom. It also leads to the bathroom floor getting excessively wet which is probably part of the mildew issue. Entry to the rooms is from a common outdoor walkway on all floors, similar to a motel. The doors aren't sealed sufficiently to keep out sound, and if there's a party going on, which there almost always is, you're gonna know it. The beds and linens are very nice and the oceanviews are fantastic from the rooms. The bathroom amenities are nicely scented and well stocked. Towels are crisp and clean. The large flat screen TV's have plenty of English language prgorams to choose from. The wireless sginal, while free... was very weak in our room. It was much more accessible in the lobby. Our second room was much better than the first, there was no noticeable odor except for the scent of the sea with the windows open and that was very pleasant. By far the strongest area of the hotel is it's staff. Every employee, from the concierge to the check-in people... the bartenders, servers, porters and housekeeping... management... everyone was top notch. It is obvious that a premium is put on service here and was the nicest touch of all. Overall, I'd say that this is a very nice beach property... with BEACH being the operative word... that has some nice bells and whistles in the areas that you should be spending your time... that is OUTSIDE your room. The nightlife is a focalpoint, so if it bothers you, think elsewhere. But if you want to feel a strong local vibe and enjoy the nightlife and the sun, surf and sand... La Concha has a lot to offer for an authentic Puerto Rican experience.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cTen minutes from the airport, a perfect place to pamper youself in the Caribbean\u201d", "Author": "victor9000", "ReviewID": "UR38691189", "Content": "With recent renovations complete, La Concha is a great destination for those wishing to escape to an urban resort.

Totally loved this place! You can't cheat yourselfe out of it!\u201d", "Author": "so_ready2go", "ReviewID": "UR38107289", "Content": "This place is amazing! I loved every single thing about it with the exception of the prices (lol, joke) Food and drinks are a little pricey, but worth the money. The hotel is gorgeous, very modern, clean, relaxing, refreshing and everything you would expect! So let's break it down Service - I can't believe I can't remember his name, but the guy who checked me in was great! Service all together was extraordinary. Very professional, amicable, fast, concierge were knowledgeable of the area, attractions, places to eat and dance and offered me a map with specific directions to every location that I wanted to go to. Shortly after I got the the breathtaking room I received a phone call from the front desk to ensure that I found the room ok, to welcome me and thank me for choosing them and to offer their help with anything that I needed. Room - I almost dropped when I walked in my room and saw that \"ocean view\" was in fact ocean view! THEY MEAN IT! The entire wall parallel to the bed was glass from to to bottom and the room was head on with the ocean! OMG! I couldn't help to to stare at the beautiful beach that is just 3 minutes away right behind the hotel (walking distance). Everything was well organized, clean, no smells at all. Nice big flat screen TV, two telephones, big closet for 2, iron/ironing board, plenty of lamps/lights in the room and a safe which was free of charge to use. Water in the room is 3.00 a bottle so don't drink it! lol. The bathroom- totally kool! TWO showers! Yes, two showers, a hand held one and a big one from the ceiling. Regular lighting available or two little blue lights in the shower would make it romantic if that is what you were looking for. Weird enough there is only one door to the shower that covered only half of it so water does go all over the bathroom floor when you take a shower. However, there are plenty towels in the bathroom to take care of that. Ladies, a magnifying mirror was in the bathroom, a hair drying put away in a drawer and plenty of counter space for make up bags and all that we use when we are getting ready. Pools- there are 3 of them, two infinity ones and a regular one! AMAZING! Lights change at night inside the pool and set the mood just right. There is a secluded jacuzzi that overlooks the city which is great too. Plenty of pool chairs, they provide pool towels so you don't have to use your own or the ones from the room. Service is available around the pools for food and drinks if you wish. White lounge chairs/beds also available by the pools. Lobby- it's a bar/lounge that even the locals come to enjoy. No, don't freak out because there is security and the crowed that comes isn't anything to worry about. Music that's played is dance music and also some live bands which I thought was great. Restaurants- there are two. I only utilized the one by the pool and food was great and so was the service. A little pricey though, $80.00 for 2 of us. Parking - is 15 a day for self parking, The ticket must be validated every time that you are going to leave the parking lot or else you can't get out. On one occasion I had the ticket validated but it didn't work so I had to tailgate someone out of the parking lot. It could be a little aggravating, but nothing to ruin my vacation. This is the place to stay! Nothing would make me not come back here. I was actually sad to leave. I am definitely coming back here- NO DOUBT! Suggestions to management- Hotel is in great shape overall and I would hate to see it get ruined. It has been newly renovated I understand so I'd love to suggest to you to attempt to keep it looking nice, new and clean as much as you can. My observations were minor details but with time they could give out the wrong impression and affect how the guests feel in the hotel. Bathrooms and Rooms- make sure to have the cleaning staff spend a little more time in the bathrooms as grout could be cleaner in certain areas. I noticed a few spots/ stains on the carpet that I think should be removed to keep the clean look and feel, furniture wasn't cleaned the second day of my stay. I hate to admit that I was making sandwiches to take to an excursion and because I was running late I left bread crams all over the coffee table and found it there when I returned. Also, air vents are starting to rust - Worked in hospitality at some point so I know to look at these things. Swimming pool by the restaurant is missing a few tiles by the stairs and i hurt my toe there so I suggest you guys take care of it before something else happens.

We booked a short stay at the La Concha and it turned out to be the perfect getaway. I will say that when we first arrived I was a bit concerned upon seeing how close the hotels were together, but after touring the grounds it's obvious that they put a lot of thought into the design and landscaping to create a sense of privacy while you are there. Start with the lobby. I wouldn't normally comment on a lobby but this one deserves it. At the very front there are some beautiful fountains that greet you as you unload your luggage. Once you go inside, the main lobby is quite beautiful. You can't help but stop for a moment to look around. There's a bar in the middle, comfortable seating all around, and various works of colorful art. To the left is a wall of glass doors that are all open to the pool area (but lets not get ahead of ourselves yet) Checkin was simple and quick. We actually arrived at 11:30am and I fully expected to have to wait several hours for the room. We were told the room was ready but needed a final inspection, so we took our free drink vouchers and headed to the bar (yes, it was before Noon but hey we're on vacation). 10 minutes later the front desk called my cell to tell us the room was ready. The room was fantastic and the view was breathtaking. We were on the top floor and when you look out the window you see the beautiful blue ocean. Tons of comfy pillows on the bed, huge shower with the showerhead that rains down on you, big flat screen tv, etc. Since I am a Platinum member they delivered a fruit basket to the room, and I must say it was one of the nicest fruit baskets I've received in my many stays at Marriotts. For our first day we decided to completely veg out by the pool. Once you do head out to the pool, you first make your way through an area of lounges hidden within the foliage. Lots of places to hang out and read if you wanted to. A little further and you see the main pool, which is actually a two level pool. There wasn't many people there and you could easily get a seat. We went to the top level and found a perfect nook for our laziness - off to the corner was one of those big outdoor beds, and right next to it was one of the hot tubs. My wife was in heaven. We picked up some really soft towels from the towel station and within minutes the waitress was by and we ordered drinks. The rest of the afternoon was pure heaven. In the evening we went down to Old San Juan for dinner and we were hoping to see some lively nightlife. While we did have a very nice (but expensive) meal at \"311\" the rest of the area was pretty dead. If I had known this, and knew that the cabs were going to be very expensive ($15 one way from Condado to Old San Juan) I would probably have just stayed by the hotel since there was plenty of places nearby. We finished the night with a visit to the hotel casino. From a previous review I expected a tiny room but it was actually a decent size, with a number of table games available. We played blackjack and were pleasantly surprised with the $5 minimum. We like to play but we are by no means high rollers. Waitress service was great and we easily got our money's worth in drinks (for the uninitiated, if you are sitting at the tables drinks are free, you just give a small tip). The next morning we wound up going to the buffet in the hotel. To be honest we were going to just go and get some pastries down the street, but since I was given a 2 for one voucher it made for a great deal. The buffet is $20pp which seems a bit high, but if you have a big appetite it is well worth it. Fantastic selection of everything - pastries, fruit, juices, healthy stuff (yogurts, egg white quiche, etc), omelete station, waffles, etc etc. The restaurant also has a great view of the ocean. From there we decided to hang out by the pool by the beach, which has a vanishing edge. So from your chairs you can see the pool with the beach beyond. Service again was great - there is always someone around asking if you need something. I could go on and on, but I will close with some last comments/tips: 1) If you have forgotten anything, there is a Walgreens right down the street that has pretty much everything you could need. 2) A nice touch is that the hotel provides laptops with internet service right in the lobby. This worked out really well for my wife so she could check her email 3) If you have a car, and want to visit El Morro or Old San Juan, definitely take the car and not a cab. We went for an afternoon and it was $6 for parking. Beware - only park in legitimate lots and don't trust anyone on the street who directs you to a street spot. I started doing this and then noticed all the other cars around us had tickets on them. 4) The nicer restaurants seem to have a \"No shorts\" policy, but nice jeans were ok. 5) Parking at the hotel is pricey, which might factor into your decision to get a rental car. Valet parking was $20/day, but self park wasn't much less at $15/day.

Overall, we liked the hotel but there was defintiely some room for improvement. I will just go through the pros and cons. Pros - good location, walking distance to many restaurants, bars, big rite aid for last minute sunblock and cheap bottled water. We really like authentic puerto rican food so we ate at a lot of the local restaurants. We did not eat a ton at the hotel itself. We had a snack one day at the bar one day (cheese and meat platter - not very good) and brunch (standard but good) and there are typical salads/sandwiches at the pool. Aside from the brunch, i would say go out for lunch. there are some really great places and they are obviously less expensive. There was one really delicous asian fusion place right across the way. dont remember the name, but its obvious. The grounds of the hotel were well maintained and pretty. The decor was very trendy but cool. The service was very friendly. Our first room was sub-par, but the room we eventually switched to had an absolutely gorgeous view. The pools were pretty and clean adn there were not many kids there. The beach is ok...water is a little rough. Cons - even though the hotel was not nearly full, we were put in a terrible room. first floor directly across the way from the vent from the pool grill. so our room smelled like hamburgers constantly. we actually joked that we must have literally had the worst room in the hotel. We're not really the type to complain, but after the second day we were admiring the rooms on the high floors with the huge windows that overlooked the ocean we decided to move. they were very gracious about moving us, however they were VERY slow. We didnt really mind because we just hung out on the beach, but if we had somewhere to be this would have been super annoying. Overall all of the service was VERY slow. very nice people, but we are from NY and are used to a much more fast paced life.

Not only did we get extra towels when we requested or had our room cleaned when we called, but housekeeping also called to make sure it was too our satisfaction. Great customer service. Gold star for that. Rooms were very nice. Floors were slippery at times but you are in a humid country. The only drawback was the bathroom. Then need to figure out a better solution to the showers. Everytime we took a shower the entire bathroom was soaked- actually it was like a little lake. If you put a towel or two by the shower it will catch the water, but it defeats the purpose of trying to conserve water. I am sure that a $4 dollar piece of rubber put on the shower floor between the glass and the tile would probably do the trick and minimize the complaints from flooded bathrooms and using so many towels.

The positive comments made about this hotel are true! Considering a person's perceptions, I can't deny any person's negative experiences, but I feel compelled to say that one must consider where they are when not satisfied by something. Please remember that PR is a TROPICAL climate and hence certain effects will be hard to avoid (i.e. rust)! I have visited many family in PR and often their complaints were the effects of the year round humidity (and salt) on anything metal, particularly cars! Secondly, when travelling, one MUST consider the culture and lifestyle of the area they are visiting! P'Rican's, stereotypically, have a much more laid back, devil-may-care attitude than most Americans! Although hard workers, a P'Rican's priority is family/friends, food, drink and dance. So, take that into consideration when you feel that the service is too slow. Remember, you're there to RELAX!!!! BTW, I am a P'Rican, so I know how my people are. I have to say the staff were wonderful, very willing to help. The valet staff made me feel like a celebrity. They spoke English very well, even when they were spoken to in Spanish. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Although there is much to do at the hotel itself, make sure you take time to check the island out. Get to know the Puerto Rican people and their island. There are many diverse areas in PR that warrant exploring. Many people on this forum complained about loud music and construction. From where I was (6th floor), I could hear the coquis (Puerto Rican frogs) louder than the music! Having said that, La Concha is the place to be if you want to see beautiful people walking around in very sexy clothes! This is the place to wear clothes that you wouldn't dare wear in the states. Although touted as an adult hotel, not suitable for kids, there were quite a few kids and couples with babies. Observing them, they seemed very pleased, their kids looked like they were having a blast. SInce the hotel has many comfy \"beds\" and couches outside by the beach and pools, I saw several moms with their infants laying on the beds with them soaking in the warm Caribbean air (the beds had canopies).

I literally read hundreds of reviews before picking this hotel. The hotel was so great we spent the almost the whole trip onsite. The decor is fabulous, the pools fabulous, the pool and beach service fabulous,the food and drinks from Solera were excellent. We lived on pitchers of sangria and mojitos. The blended drinks were also excellent at the bar. In addition, the pineapple marinated strip steak wrap, duck quesadillas and sliders were absolutely mouth watering! The breakfast buffet was lacking and not worth the money. They needed more variety and one more chef at the omelet station to make this worth it. After the first day we grabbed breakfast sandwiches from a place down the street near the local drug store. The rooms and view were awesome. My guests have stayed at 4 and 5 star accomodations around the world. In fact a number of them have have been known to check out of unsatisfactory hotels in the past and they all seemed more than satisfied with my choice of hotel. However, I strongly suggest the management rethink the carpet and remove it. My group had 7 rooms and each had an underlying mildew smell that they tried to mask with orange spray. Most caribbean locations just have tile on the floor because carpet does not do well in the humidity. In spite of the floors the rooms were great. No they did not have balconies that you could sit on them but why stay in the room when the beaches and the pool were so great! The rooms do not have tubs so if you are looking to soak this is not your hotel unless a hot tube will do. The hot tubs outside were fabulous! They were a little too hot but fabulous. They also have a great gym with treadmills that face the ocean. I'll say it again, Fabulous! Sadly, the economy has also seemed to hit Condado hard. Many of the storefronts along Asfhord ave were closed. The high end stores however, were open and ready for business. We did not feel unsafe but the site of some of the buildings was not comfortable. We had a spa party at Zen Spa in Condado which is less than a block form the hotel and it was absolutely wonderful. The facilities were extremely modern. Ivette at Zen Spa worked with me by email and phone to prepare a great time for my guests. We had dinner out with our group twice we went to Miro across from the Marriot which is 3 short blocks away and Pamela's restaurant in Old San Juan. Both were awesome and I highly recommend them. Pamela's is on the beach and the staff was so knowledgeable and wonderful. I planned to eat at Perla but the restaurant manager was not very great at returning messages. That turned me off so we ate our more formal dinners elsewhere. We did have a cocktail party in the patio by the pool that I planned on the day of my arrival and the bar staff was incredibly helpful. Finally after reading reviews here I was a little leary of the concierge and I researched a lot of activities myself. I went to the concierge desk for assistance out of curiosity and I figured out that it is not that they don't know where to go but that they must recieve incentives for certain tours and those are the ONLY ones that they recommend. That was a little disappointing because the tours they recommended were overpriced. Search online and you can find better deals.

I really find that hard to believe unless being number one means that La Concha's guests find it perfectly okay to have a layer of dust of the tops of the dressers and the white sofas. Maybe being number one means that guests should overlook the fact that the outside of the buildings ooze with rust and dead foliage or that rust is on all the metal accents in the room including the furniture, lamp posts, and edges of all the mirrors. The carpets were dank and damp. We paid extra for a room with an ocean view...however, the balcony barely had enough room for a person larger than the size of a small child to stand comfortably. The patio furniture was plain gross and had obvious signs of mildew and wear and tear. Our bathroom was mildly clean. Meaning that if one quickly glanced into the bathroom, one may find it to be adequate. However, bathrooms being very intimate spaces and upon a good inspection, the bathroom was not at all acceptable. The grout had mildew, the toilet tissue was damp and the floor had dust on it. I felt completely uncomfortable because I didn't want to touch the floors, the bedding or sit on the furniture. I did not allow any of my personal possessions to rest upon the dust covered furniture. I could write more, but it will only result in reliving the La Concha experience and I choose not to waste another day dwelling on that place.

I must admit, I was rattled by some of the bad reviews on here. In particular, I have a low threshold for questionable neighborhoods. So I was concerned. But we found a solution. We toured this, and other, San Juan-area hotels first before making a decision. We were heading out to the west side of the island for \"Leg 1\" of our trip, so we reserved a few hotels in the San Juan area for \"Leg 2,\" but checked them out the morning we landed in Puerto Rico before heading west. La Concha won the tour, hands down. And when we stayed there later in the week, we never had a second thought. In sum: The Ritz was an unremarkable, low end Ritz; one that you'd forget a week after staying there. Quality was fine. Beach and pool way too windy. Clientele was Americans between 50 and 70, for whom the Ritz was the obvious and only choice. Intercontinental was like a mid-range Sheraton. Bar was a joke. Ate lunch at their beach restaurant, food was a joke. Beach was nice though. El San Juan was a Vegas strip wannabe. If that sounds intriguing then it's the hotel for you. La Concha was the best by far. Here's why: 1. Ambiance. I wanted to stay there as soon as I walked through the lobby. It has a subtle elegance, a subtle feel of excitement, and loads of time-warped charm. You feel like you're in 50's era Havana. There's a little bit of artificiality to it all -- the hotel does try hard to be a chic throw back, perhaps a bit too hard. But so what, it pulls it off. Fashionable Puerto Ricans clearly like it, as they flock to the public areas every night. That in itself makes it worthwhile, if you're traveling to experience something different from home. 2. Location. Condado was not sketchy by any means, but actually a really interesting area. I liked it because it is an actual \"rejuvenation\" success story-in-progress, rather than a fake rejuvenation non-success story. Everywhere you look there are new buildings and major development -- all high quality. There a plenty of restaurants within walking distance -- much more interesting ones than what we saw in Isla Verde. Tons of pedestrian traffic -- tourists and affluent locals. Not a concern about safety. And I am the squeamish type. And the few \"abandoned buildings\" people here complain about are merely the last remnants of the area's old days, which will no doubt be swept up shortly by developers, and at high prices. Also, the pool areas were a solid A-, the pool service and food was quite good, the beach was nice but rough, and the rooms had the same 50's-style charm as the public areas with furnishings/fixtures of good but not outstanding quality. An eating in the clam-shaped waterfront restaurant, La Perla, was memorable and fun. Finally, despite what the naysayers here say, the hotel was perfectly clean. I am a neat freak, and frankly have no idea what the complainers are complaining about. Go for the ambiance and the location -- especially if the thought of Isla Verde strip malls and Sheraton-like \"resorts\" bores you. Admittedly, it's not for everybody. I wouldn't recommend it to my 78 year old mother, for example. One hilarious commenter here wrote about how she and her family were horrified by the late-night Latin music and wound up speeding away at midnight by cab to the Ritz -- where it was thankfully quiet and civilized. The image makes me chuckle every time. No doubt that story's entirely true; at midnight you can probably hear a pin drop at the Ritz. So if that's you, skip La Concha.

It's clearly up and coming, they are building everywhere. The abandonded store fronts everyone is talking about is ONE building diagonal from the hotel that is being torn down to build high-end condos. That's it. I preferred this neighborhood to Isla Verde because it's more residential, you'll see people jogging at all hours and walking their dogs. Isla Vede is a busy 4 lane highway with big-box american stores on either side, no neighborhood.

Most everything about the hotel was ideal. The rooms were very nice and the bathrooms were clean. The closets in the room were perfect in terms of size. Eating at the resort, while somewhat expensive, was a great experience. The food was excellent and the waiting staff very nice. I experienced that the staff in general was very friendly and accommodating. The beach was great and I went there each day of my trip. The casino, while somewhat small, was actually perfect for me-- not too hectic and most of the dealers were extremely amiable. Now on to some of the minor things I was disappointed with. First, it would have been really nice to have a real balcony overlooking the ocean rather than the small ledge that you couldnt even fit a chair on. Secondly, if anyone is thinking about going into Old San Juan, be prepared for a minimum $20 cab ride there and at least the same price going back. Another thing that was somewhat bothersome was the lack of nightlife in the club. I was under the impression that there was a club there, but there certainly is not. Also, the bar closes very early, around 11 pm, which was inconvenient. The last thing that bothered me was something I saw on my way checking out. On top of a roof there were two birds, caged and trying to make their way out. That was very disturbing and I hope that it was a fluke and if still there, someone frees the birds.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it in the morning and during the day it was minimal. Second, was the neighborhood. It was very walk able and busy at all hours of the day. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel unsafe at any time and enjoyed the local restaurants and bars. There are empty shop windows in the area, but there are anywhere in the United States right now. Third, was the comparison to the Marriott. We took a walk down to the Marriott and it was more like a cruise ship than a hotel. It was very crowded and had large number of kids in all parts of the hotel. And lastly was noise from the hotel lobby. Again, we had no problems and thought the scene in the lobby would be more over the top. The bottom line is that the La Concha was great. We enjoyed the pools, the ocean and the food. We ate lunch by the pool a couple of days and it was very good. We also gambled on a few occasions and that was fun.

It's bright, colorful and the decor is simply phenomenal! If you want the hotspot, this is it! *The pool area is beautiful...it has oversized plants and tuck-away lounge chairs and couches all over. Very, very nice. *The walk from the hotel to the beach is only a few feet. *There are police everywhere...you see them all over the beach and on the streets. We felt completely safe the entire time. *There's trendy shopping right across the street (Gucci, Louis V, Cartier etc). *The rooms have an awesome view...go for a higher floor room (above 7 or 8 floor). *Not many kids. There were some, but not as many as say...the Intercontinental or El San Juan. CONS: *The rooms are always moist. It's hard to explain, but it feels \"icky\" all the time. Your clothes will never air dry! Hang them from the balcony. *Construction begins at 8a EVERY morning...aye!!! *Service is SLOOOOOW...no one is in a hurry to do anything! It's ridiculous. And the concierge might as well not exist. This is a PR thing in general. *The music in the lobby (the lobby is a trendy nightspot) is all techno/rave-like. Can you say headache?! *The waves at the beach are crazy! One friend lost her top!! Isla Verde is a much calmer, nicer beach...take a $20 cab ride there. *There aren't many good food spots in the immediate area. Wendys, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, but they all take about 30 mins to order anything! Cafe Angel is across the street- they have good drinks and pretty good food. *There aren't as many sexy Puerto Ricans guys as you probably would imagine :(", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cFancy Schmance\u201d", "Author": "jxb534", "ReviewID": "UR27753019", "Content": "La Concha is a sheek, fancy hotel. I wish I would have taken a picture of the people that the hotel bar attracts on a typical Saturday night. Think gowns, high heels, and button down shirts. A little too much for me. If fancy is your thing, then you'll love La Concha. If you're more of a flipflop, sundress type of girl, you may want to stay somewhere else. The room- The room was very nice. It had a flat screen tv, beautiful view, was clean, and roomy with great lighting and seating. The shower was just ok, but maid service was spectacular. We were never woken up with annoying knocks but always came back to a clean room with made beds. Which I have to say, was very nice. What we WERE woken up by was the construction every weekday morning at 7 am. The constant sound of drilling cement made me want to die. I know it is a necessary evil but it was really annoying. The hotel had a standing balcony with sliding doors. The view was amazing. The location- I liked the location. There are a bunch of restaurants within walking distance (the hotel prices are WAY too expensive). Try Danny's, Columbo, Orchinos, Waiter's. There are a bunch though. Try them all! There is also a Unos and Chilli's within walking distance if you have picky eaters. The beach the hotel is set on is beautiful. The hotel is a short ride away from Old San Juan (you have to go!) and El Yunque Rain Forest. The hotel-As I stated above, the hotel is fancy but cool looking. Marble floors (I don't know how the highheelers don't slip and fall), cool lighting, neat and modern furniture, interesting art work. The grounds are well kept with neat little private areas throughout the hotel (in and out of the sun). There are two hot tubs (one was not working while I stayed) and three nice pools. There was always plenty of seating, both by the pools and the beach. There are three restaurants. We only went to one of them after having a 55 dollar bill for lunch for two. No free refills on soda and they charge 3 dollars a piece! The drinks were ok at about 8-9 dollars for a daquri. Needless to say, we didn't drink much. Room service is ridiculously expensive and the continental breakfast is too. $6.50 cents for a SMALL fruit salad. The staff at the hotel were nice and helpful: Juan the bell man, and Francisco with security to name a few. We picked La Concha partly because of the location and partly because the reviewers said it was a good place for singles. Unfortunately, I don't agree it is a good place for singles. Maybe it was just the time we stayed but there were a TON of kids in the pools all screaming \"Marco Polo\" and hanging out in the hot tub. I don't understand why you'd want to stay at such a fancy hotel with marble and overpriced food with kids. So while I do think La Concha is a better hotel for singles, there were a lot of families there that singles may not want to \"deal with.\" Maybe it was just because we went during Easter break that there were so many kids there. The hotel has free wi-fi. It was nice but it would go in and out alot. A lot of restaurants in San Juan have free wi-fi. The hotel has a casino with slots and tables. Parking was $15 dollars a day. We parked overnight and were charged $30. There is an underground parking garage with plenty of parking. Overall, La Concha is a very nice hotel.

The hotel, grounds, and pools are beautiful. Check in was easy and my room was very comfortable. Some of the folks I was traveling with had coffee, tea, fridges, and microwaves in their rooms. I did not. But, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rock the boat too much since I asked twice for the window to be repaired and washed. I also had lots of problems with the A/C rattling. Although I asked twice, it was never fully fixed. The parking validation system was a little confusing. The parking process was explained to me several times, but I was only able to get out of the gate by myself (with validated tickets) only once out of the 6 nights I was there. I had to keep running to get the valets to help me out of the gate. The breakfast in the hotel lobby was lovely. Nice variety of pastries and fruit. Thank you for the breakfasts. The workout center was wonderful with plenty of options for cardio and weights. The manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception on Wednesday evening was wonderful. The service was fast, the drinks were good, and the appetizers were delicious. Thank you very much. Casino: Many thanks to the front desk folks and Felipe for the nice match play coupons for the casino. The casino was very fun, but NOT generous. I played table games in the casino, consistently for six nights, for hours and hours at a time, even brought some colleagues, and then over the weekend, brought my husband with his checkbook, and was never comped anything. I got a free tee-shirt b/c I had a birthday in Feb. Otherwise, I would have completely left empty handed. On the flip side, the waiter service in the casino was excellent. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait very long for drinks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the staff was very attentive. The little sandwiches served were very good and much appreciated. The table minimums were nice and low during the week I was there. Be aware of the Blackjack tables on the weekends. If you won a blackjack, you had to win the next hand to actually receive your winning from the blackjack you won the hand before. They really make you work for it (at least this was my experience over the weekend). Then, if the dealer forgets you had blackjack (even though the chip is visible near your hand) you may have to speak up in order to get your even pay out. Restaurants in the area: I dined at several Ashford Ave restaurants during my week. The little window restaurant directly across the street was nice if you wanted to grab a breakfast empanada. The Latin Star restaurant was just ok. The Chinese/Japanese/Sushi place a couple streets away from La Concha (on the beach side) was very good and had good service. My favorite place was the Japanese place located right next to the Marriott Stellaris Casino (a few streets down form La Concha). The service was fantastic and they food was even better. They also offer an early bird special before 6:30pm. The soup, salad, and meal was only $22 with tax and tip. Best place in town. My husband and I love to drive over to Highway 813 to try the local foods in San Juan. We had empanadas for $2 and huge steak and chicken skewers for another $2. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the best way to eat local flavor. Rental car: Again, many thanks to enterprise rental cars. We visited San Juan last fall and had the best rental car experience ever with the Enterprises located by the airport and on Ashford Ave. This trip - although the prices were a bit higher in Feb, (maybe in-season prices?) the customer service received was fantastic.

These concerns have been shared with management previously (and repeatedly). First, the pros: -Convenient location, easy to get to from the highway. Plenty of food options at a range of cuisines and price points, and proximity to other conveniences (e.g. drug store) -Like the hotel food options: Solera to eat outside and quite reasonably, Perla for a treat. Nice morning breakfast buffet at Level 25 -Have always had an ocean view room and it's a very pretty view of the beach and ocean Next the cons: 1) (Self) Parking validation just doesn't work. Well, it usually works the first day (probably about 2/3 of the time). The staff will tell you that your parking is validated for the entire stay and you should keep the same ticket. However, 90% of the time we've tried to exit the lot with a validated ticket on our 2nd or 3rd or 4th day, we can't exit the lot. At that point we need to either call the hotel and ask the valet to come let us out or walk to the valet stand and do the same. We all have the hotel # speed-dialed on our phone but it still adds about 3-5 minutes to our exit each time this happens (depending on whether or not the hotel answers the phone, how quickly the valets hustle, etc.). The front desk continues to tell us that our tickets should work and we should keep trying; it does not appear they are actively trying to fix the problem. Several staff have acted like this is a new problem despite the fact that we've faced it for 8 weeks now. We've mostly switched to getting a new parking ticket every day and validating it at the front desk every day. But this annoying thing, though little, is leading us to consider switching hotels. 2) Can be very tough to sleep if you're staying on a low floor (3 thru about 6 or 7) on a Wednesday through Saturday night due to loud music in the lobby until very late at night (past midnight). 3) Several times my colleagues or I have been unable to check into our rooms even though it was after 3 p.m. (and usually 5 p.m. or later). This is a relatively infrequent occurance but it's very frustrating when it occurs because there are literally no public spaces besides a small business center where it's quiet enough to take a phone call or work peacefully. 4) High speed internet is very inconsistent in the rooms. We've had enough experiences of losing our connection or weak signals that we mostly just use our sprint cards now. But this is quite disappointing.

It was right next to the new tower they're building, and as others have written, they start construction promptly at 7 AM, every day except Sunday.

Sorry if you are - but I hope all travelers read my review before making a decision on La Concha. Let me first say that I do like my 4 and 5 star hotels - I expect cleanliness, friendly staff, safety... and I prefer updated decor. La Concha markets itself very well online and many people who have only visited its bar at night think that the hotel is upscale, trendy, modern, exciting etc... But PLEASE - you cannot rate a hotel by its bar at night. In the daytime, the bar is barren with a handful of sketchy locals, slumped over the bartop, making hotel guests feel uncomfortable. At least this was our experience (I traveled with my husband and 2 friends) when we arrived at La Concha just recently. As we waited for our rooms to be ready (we waited 3 hours), we tried to enjoy cocktails at the bar, but were made very uncomfortable by a very intoxicated man who was giving us the finger across the bar while he laughed and laughed, holding up his red napkin and then revealing his middle finger to us (sounds strange, but it really happened and it was very bizarre). As the waittress laughed it off (when she should have SHUT HIM OFF), we all looked at each other and felt very uncomfortably. The man then proceeded to laugh at the top of his lungs at passer-bys and then stumble around in circles on his way to the bathroom. NOT my idea of a great first impression. Later, when our friend's room was ready, we decided to all put our bags in her room so that we could relax and change our clothes. This is not what happened. We soon realized what kind of standards the hotel had. The glass shelf in the bathroom was filthy. The bed sheets and pillow cases were stained with brown and orange stains and we also found hairs beneath the sheets. The carpet was stained almost everywhere and there was a micro-fiber beige chair with stains all over it. The room also smelled musty and old. I do have pictures but I haven't taken them off my camera yet. When I do - I will post them with this review. In addition to the room, the hallways outside the room were filthy - with dirt, leaves and litter. The public restrooms in the lobby were also awful - they smelled like urine and the floors were muddy and the stalls were wet and filthy. We eventually did get all of our money back as we transitioned over to the Ritz (which was beautiful - thank God), but it took about 45 minutes of arguing with the staff. Only when we asked, the woman at the counter called the manager who was \"in a meeting\" and he/she never came out when she told him/her that they had 4 unhappy guests leaving their hotel before even staying one night. She did offer us another room, but based on the looks of the first room, we were very skeptical that another room would be any better, so we declined. I also forgot to mention that the street the hotel is on is frightening. There are old stores that are not in service - with boarded up windows and graffiti everywhere. There are also very shady people everywhere - slumming around and loitering. There are \"gentelman's clubs\" all over the place and other shady bars and restaurants. I found one tiny convenient store, but other than that - the stores were not anything any tourist would be interested in visiting. Like \"cash your checks\" type stores and dirty diners and janitorial supply stores. Seriously - nothing touristy at all. I can't believe they put a hotel on that street that they market to leisure tourists! I didn't feel safe - even in the middle of the day. I can't imagine what it's like at night.

Once again this year, I have only the most positive things to say about this beautiful hotel and resort. My best friend and I traveled together again to stay at La Concha for my birthday. We were joined by another friend whom had not been to San Juan before, as well as three of her friends who had visited San Juan many times and always stayed at the El San Juan Hotel. The hotel staff at La Concha is absolutely unbelievable. During the entire week, we were treated with such kindness and warm regards; it was more like visiting close friends than your typical hotel staff. For example: upon arriving on our first day, the valet opened the door to the taxi, looked at us and smiled (recognizing us from the year before) and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ahh, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come back, welcome home!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So many of the staff members from the previous year were still at La Concha and each of them remembered us from before. Their hospitality and friendliness once again truly made for an enjoyable week. And just like last year, Lousie (from concierge) baked a cake for me and brought it in from home on my birthday. So many others who work here also made the trip memorable, including: Jeannice, Michelle, Carlos, Jaime, Jaemy, and Jorge from the Lobby Bar; Jan-Michelle, Tania, and Doriana from the Lobby Bar lounge area; Lorainne, Carmen and Jessica from Solera, and Michael and Louise from Concierge. I know there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably people I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m overlooking or for whom I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember a name, but in general, everyone is so very nice. Check in was flawless without any kind of wait. During the check-in, I asked if there were any upgrades (as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Marriott Platinum member), but was told that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything available. Moments after entering our room, the phone rang and it was the front desk informing me that she had found a junior suite if I would be interested in the upgrade. Both rooms were on the 10th floor and I opted to take the suite to have more room. We spent a great deal of time staying on property, which is exactly what we wanted to do. We ate a few meals at Solera (still love the Latin Sliders!) and one dinner at Perla (for my birthday). I have to comment that dinner at Perla was amazing! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful restaurant with an incredible menu and view of the Ocean. I will definitely eat there again! Other restaurants nearby include di Parma (wonderful!), Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (we ate there three times for lunch) and the new Sidewalk Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (at La Concha). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to Pure & Natural this year, but I still recommend it for a take-away lunch back to the pool (and it is just outside of the hotel). While I really had no major issues with La Concha last year, I did note in my review that housekeeping often made up the room late in the day and that the elevators seemed slow at times. Noticeable improvements were made in both areas this year: there was only one day that our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned before noon (and that was because we were in the room at the time they originally came to clean) and the elevators seemed to always be available (my only comment would be that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beeping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd noise on the elevators as you pass each floor could be turned down; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of loud). Yes, there is construction in the area (at La Concha and other nearby properties) but that was not bothersome at all. And the music from the Lobby Bar on Thursday through Saturday was not an issue either as we were down in the bar area till late in the night. This is such a fun hotel if you enjoy nightlife. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay anywhere else. The friends who traveled with us, who always stayed at the El San Juan, fell in love with La Concha and have already booked their next trip back to this property for September (my friend and I have booked for two more return trips: his birthday in October and mine again next February). I can not recommend this hotel highly enough and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m greatly looking forward to going back again.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newfoundland", "Title": "\u201cSimply Spectacular\u201d", "Author": "Happyagentnl", "ReviewID": "UR25664375", "Content": "Absolutely fabulous - the coolest hotel I have ever stayed!

As soon as we got our room, the front desk employee wrote an apology note for the delay and gave us a fruit basket!! Room and bathroom were clean and we had a lovely view of the beach. There was helpful staff at the activity desk that helped us pick out different trips to Old San Juan that was near by, The Forts, El Yunque Rain Forest, and The Bacardi Distillery. There is some great places to eat all along Ashford and they range from fairly cheap to moderately pricey, so we just switched it up. The only restaurant inside the hotel that we ate at was the one by the pool. I had some kind of sandwich that was good but a bit pricy for a simple sandwich. If you are into the nighlife, the lobby is a nice place to hang out, sometimes live music and other days they had a DJ. This trip turned out to be really special because on the 2nd day of our stay my boyfriend proposed!! I had no clue because the concierge staff was sooo helpful in planning it out with my fiance.

In Puerto Rico, I've stayed at the El San Juan, Ritz and El Conquistidor over the years. This was my first stay at La Concha.

I also liked that the Condado area has some retail appeal, as opposed to Isla Verde which has none. The hotel staff was very friendly, although s-l-o-w. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in, so we changed in the bathroom (might want to consider a room devoted to early arrivals and late departures) and went back to the front desk to check the bags, but we couldn't get anyone to help us for a half an hour.

I could live with the delay, but I couldn't live with the stench in the hotel room. Musty, mildewy and just plain WET. I've experienced this before in other seaside hotels in Puerto Rico (El San Juan to be specific), but this smelled like a wet sofa. They sent us a bottle of wine to make amends which I appreciated, but I wouldn't recommend a seaview if that's the tradeoff.

The hotel recently added a small casino for those into that sort of thing and the lobby bar is done up in a real modern decor. The lobby flows into the pool area with open glass walls and the two connected infinity pools are spectacular with service available from the poolside tapas bar Solera. There is another smaller infinity pool right on the beach to use to cool down from laying in the sun. Our room was an oceanfront king and I do mean oceanfront! What a view to wake up to and just enjoy whenever we were in the room! There are some reviews that it is noisy on weekends from the live music in the bar/pool area and we didn't find that to be a problem and if something like that bothers you find a B&B somewhere! The beach is clean with attendants available to provide lounge chairs for sunning or just relaxing in the shade of a palm tree. The surf was a bit rough during our stay but we could still wade in and feel the warm waters. We did spend a lot of time at the beach and especially at the pools and the hotel has several little areas around the pool with comfortable sofas and chairs for those who just want to enjoy the warm air. We ate at Perla, the upscale restaurant under the \"shell\" and while it was super expensive it was worth every penny! The food and service was A-1 and it was a truly memorable meal. We also ate at Solera, the poolside restaurant which was casual and al fresco and the food there was also very very good. There are several low to high priced restaurants within walking distance and we went to Ajili-Mojili and Ropa Viejas, again, two really great restaurants only a feww blocks away. There are several breakfast spots just down the block if you don't want to spend the $20 per person for the hotel breakfast buffet each day. We didn't have the buffet but people we talked to all said it was wonderful. For those who MUST have franchise food there is a Subway, a Wendy's and a Chili's nearby. We had a car so we were able to drive to the El Yunque rain forest on one day and into Old San Juan another day and the driving wasn't bad once one gets used to the fact that no one in Puerto Rico seems to use turn signals! Almost all signs are in spanish and english and if you have a good road map you shouldn't get lost driving (even though we did a couple times!).

Our room at the Condado was 229 so we decided to call La Concha to see if they would match the price and guess what....THEY DID! They gave us a deluxe ocean view room for only $220 per night. The usual price is almost $300 per night. When we first arrived, we were instantly greeted by the valet who took our bags and directed us to the front desk. We arrived around noon so our rooms werent available till 4pm which was fine. They called us on our cell as soon as the room was available. As you can see in the pictures the rooms are gorgeous. My boyfriend and I were staying in a king deluxe ocean view and my three friends were staying in a 2 queen bedroom. The room is filled with lots of light and what a view!! Extremely clean. The bed was super comfy. The small living area was a nice a touch and allowed us to entertain our friends before we went out at night. The flat screen was a nice touch as well. I have a big pet peeve with hotel bathrooms. They never feel very clean but the bathroom was really clean, open and spacious. There is a walk-in shower with no curtain or door so if you're shy about showering in front of the person your with then you should definitely leave enough time to get ready. The shower had a rainfall shower head which felt great. The hotel has a mixture of couples young and old, single men and women and gay people. I was very surprised and happy to see many gay couples. My boyfriend and I never felt uncomfortable and the staff was always very attentive. My boyfriend and I went to the forts and the concierge was extremely helpful in telling us when the guides were available and what times we should go as well as the prices. She also made dinner reservations for us at Dragonfly. The beach was great and the beach attendant was always ready to help us get chairs for the beach and towels. Ice water was always available if you needed a quick refreshment. There was also a lounging section on the beach if you wanted to take a quick nap in the shade. I love gambling and the casino if first rate. I play $5 dollar black jack and loved every minute of it. The dealers were very helpful. The best thing is mon-thursday they give $5 vouchers in the morning. I had the $20 breakfast buffet at the restaurant there Level 25 and it was wonderful.

I thought that the checkin was slow but then i later realized that it's just my NY fast paced attitude that expects everything to be done with the quickness. Checkin was nice and easy, the front desk person was very nice. We were in room 317. As soon as we walked into this room we were in awe. I've been to my share of hotels and although most hotels have upgraded their lobbys to look modern chic - most hotel rooms are still classic hotel style. Not this hotel room though. It was very modern and very chic. I seriously think that this room was a hooked up room. I've seen pictures on this site for regular rooms and they do not compare to the room we had. It had a very open layout and the bathroom was pretty cool but you have to get used to it. You definately have to be very comfortable with the person you are sharing this room with because you can literally watch them and hear them do # 2 from the bed. LOL. But we thought it was really cool the way the bathroom was set up. We were quite impressed. The balcony was HUGE - you could see the pool from the left side and the beach on the right side but the view from the front of the balcony was completely obstructed by the Pearl Restaurant. We didn't reserve a room with ocean view so we couldn't complain about the view obstruction because we got lucky to even get a view of the ocean from the right side of the balcony. All in all - the room was pretty awesome. I will definately request to stay in this room when i go back or a similar room with complete ocean view. The lobby was so pretty and the bar looked fun but we were there on a Wed and Thurs night only so it wasn't too crazy - even though I wouldn't have minded. We're in our late 20's so we love loud music and we love staying out late. On Wednesday night we went to dinner at Ajili Mojili which was like a 7 minute walk from La Concha and then we walked around the beach and Ashford Avenue. We ended up at the pool hall next to Walgreens. That was fun. On Thursday we had lunch at Mike and Charley's and then hung out at the pool the rest of the day. Awesome pool let me tell you. Pool service was good - we had two pina coladas and the waitress was really nice. That night we took a cab to Old San Juan and ate at Raices Restaurant. Great Great Food!!!! The bad things about this hotel were that Internet reception from our room was terrible. Could not get a stable wireless connection for more than 2 minutes. Concierge and the front desk were very very slow to call me back for any requests and the elevators were also really slow. We had a couple of problems with our room: there was no safe initially - we had to get one installed - so we had to go out to dinner the first night with our valuables because they couldn't get one for us right away. The balcony door didn't lock - we gave the front desk notice about this the night we got there and they didn't do anything about it until the next morning when i complained again. Also the room had two phones and both of them didn't work on Thursday morning so i had to go downstairs to ask for anything i needed. The problem with that is that the elevators were sooooo slow. I hope the hotel takes these couple of complaints and finds a way to improve the hotel because it really is a nice hotel. By the way - we took a quick tour of the marriot hotel down a couple blocks and the great difference i noticed between the two is that the Marriott had a lot of screaming kids. La Concha was much more quieter and calmer in the day time - which is great for those trying to get over a hangover.

The rooms are also clean with VERY comfortable beds/lines/pillows. At the corporate rate of $209.00, it was worth the money. Now the bad----we arrived at 3:30 but could not check in until 5:30 in the afternoon! Incidentials are EXPENSIVE!!!! Burger and fries are 15.00+, 10 oz. draft beer is $6.50 plus tip and bottle water is $3.00 to $5.00. My neice order room service purchasing a burger, fries and coke and it was $38.00. It was very clear that the hotel would like you to spend hundreds of dollars daily on incidentials. My brother bought beer off site because of the hotel price on beer and was told within 60 seconds at the pool that he could not bring outside beer onto pool grounds! Because of the high hotel prices on food/drink, it was a constant battle to find meals for my family at a reasonable price. I would not go back nor recommend this hotel just for that reason alone. I am far from a cheap guy but $91.00 for (2) burgers and fries and (2) kid's chicken tenders and fries is ridiculous. I wont go back until they change their pricing structure for incidentials----Lastly, the buildings are really close together for a resort area.

We always got clean towels, freshly made beds and replacement glasses, tea, coffee and other amenities.

We stayed at the new Marriott/Renaissance resort La Concha. In short, we had a great time! The weather was OK. The first 4 of 5 days it was partly sunny/cloudy but each day (but one) it rained for a short time and then stopped. It became annoying and led to us cancelling our snorkelling adventure due to the chance of rain and it was also quite windy the first few days. The last 4 days the weather was beautiful-sunny and about 80 degrees far. We did go Kayacking at night (glow), went to a winter league baseball game,and Old San Juan. Now, about La Concha, We booked a Poolview and an Ocean Front and the front desk (Linda) put us in 2 Oceanfront rooms. The rooms were beatiful with full Oceanfront view and sliding glass door that led to a walk-out- no full balcony. Rain shower in bathroom and interesting half glass shower door-but no flooding. The lobby was swank, modern and attractive. The outdoor pool area was bi-level and although we wish the pools were larger they were big enough to cool off. There was another small infinity edged pool in the back overlooking the beach but it was always in the shade.-Great place to read as was the beds to the left of the pool. The staff was very friendly! The business center had 4 computers and was always available free of charge (included in the resort fee). Pool staff was great- towels always available as was ice water. New casino in the lobby was very nice. Last night of our stay was New Years eve and they had a BIG Party that was only open to hotel guests and guests that were invited by La Concha. There were alot of people at this party and it was quite festive, active and loud. They built a stage for live band on the top pool deck (had limited use last 2 days) and we were told that J.Lo and marc Anthony attended- But we didn't see them. I love loud music but this was LOUD!!!!!! Band played till the middle of the night and we could not get away from it. But it was New Years after all. So with all of this great stuff why only 4 Stars? Well, as mentioned here many times -housekeeping was very slow. After a few days of room not being made up by mid afternoon we got into the routine of calling each day to have room made up. This is not acceptable! Also room was really tidied up rather than deep cleaned. Glasses weren't cleaned or replaced. Sometimes they showed up for a turn-down- sometimes not. The hotel has had over a year to correct this problem but I've had better housekeeping at Holiday Inns and other 3 star properties. Pool bar/Grill also VERY SLOW. Order a Hamburger- wait almost an hour till I get a CHEESEburger. Sent it back- only to see the same burger returned to me (10 minutes later) with the cheese scraped off and cold fries. Also NOT acceptable for a high rated resort especially if the hamburger costs $15. Tried ordering the 2nd day- similar wait time- and the pool grill was not that busy. No Concierge/Executive level- so no Marriott continental breakfast/ appetizers/ wine/desserts etc. As a matter of fact no gift shop at this resort to even buy a newspaper.

After settling in, we went to Old San Juan, walked around and had lunch at the Parrot Club, which is fun. We returned to the hotel in the afternoon and hit the beach, only part of which was sunny because of the design of the hotel. The tall structure blocks the sun in the winter months, an unorthodox way to design a Caribbean resort hotel. One area of beach further out was sunny, however, so we got towels and long chairs and enjoyed ourselves. The architecture is unremarkable except for the ugly seashell-shaped restaurant on the ocean side of the hotel. This is perched atop a flat rectangular structure that looks to be a ballroom. A walk along the beach finds several abandoned and dilapidated buildings between La Concha and its sister property the Marriott. We walked around the Marriott and much preferred it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll most likely stay there next time if we want to be on the beach. We had dinner directly across the road at a recommended restaurant that specializes in Puerto Rican food.

We left the hotel for a couple of hours. The strange part is that there was no one dancing or even showing any interest in listening when ever we passed through -- just a few people trying to have shouted conversations over their cocktails. The loud music was probably causing the hotel to lose business, not attract more.Then, with only a note slipped under our door overnight as notification, the hotel closed access the beach side pool for hotel guests all day on Saturday to prepare for a private event that evening. And there was more loud music,this time live, in the courtyard, the only refuge during the private party. This music could have been nice if the band has dialed down the amps but both band members and hotel staff seemed not to understand that idea. Our complaints and those of other guests -- I wasn't alone at the desk -- were meet by the staff with shrugs, polite smiles and occassional words of sympathy but no action. I wrote a letter to the manager that I left at the desk but got no ressponse, not even an apology. As much as I enjoyed the first two days, I would not risk spending my time and money there again.

First impression of the hotel was \"wow\". We have stayed at various starwood and fairmont properties all over north america, but aesthetically this hotel is one of the most unique and beautiful places we've stayed. The lobby is just beautiful and the pool area is fabulous. We had no trouble finding a lounge or a beach bed. The beach itself is public, but it is very quiet and mostly had hotel guests on it. Very modern and clean fitness center. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was an average buffet , but excellent service and atmosphere. Our room had a beautiful ocean view, comfy king sized bed, and we loved the shower. Very modern interior and kept very clean, but there are places were you can tell that this is an old hotel that has been renovated. The staff was very accommodating, we ended up getting off the cruise ship much earlier than we expected and the front desk staff was able to get us into our room by 9:30am and we were out at the pool by 10:00am. My husband was dying to go boogie boarding, and the concierge was able to locate one that had been left in the hotel for him to borrow (the waves are perfect for boogie boarding or beginner surfing). Minor negatives: Even though the alarm wasn't activated, our t.v. would turn on blaring at 2:00am each morning, which kinda sucked. The price of food and drinks: everything is really, really pricey at this hotel. I realize that it is an upper-scale hotel, but $6 for a canned local beer is a bit much, considering you are in the Caribbean. On that note, there are a variety of restaurants within walking distance to the hotel, my advice is walk around and explore, because you'll have better luck eating off the property. We ate at Mike and Charlie's for pizza - great pizza, good value. It is just a block away from the hotel. We also ate at a restaurant just beside the hotel (between the hotel and the park on the ocean side). I can't remember what the name was, but the food was very good and not bad prices, outdoor seating only. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at La Concha.

I am not going to go into detail regarding this as many others have done so already. NOW TO THE CRUX OF MY REVIEW: Let me preface by saying my fiance and I are in our late 20's, we live in manhattan, we are used to noises, we go out dancing late, we have traveled all over the world. This is not our first time off the block so to speak, we are not octogenarian prudes. I am not one to write many reviews, let alone a negative review. However, if you would actually like to sleep at some point in the night,and i mean sometime after 1am or 2 or 3 or 4am, forget it. There is a club called Budathai directly across the street. This club will blast music all night and because of the position of ALL the rooms in La Concha, you hear it. And I don't mean just a little bit, you hear it as if it is being played all the way up in your ear. You hear it as if it is coming directly from your brain. You hear it as if it is some kind of torture device, which for me and my fiance it was. Also please note, this was a WEDNESDAY NIGHT! I can only cringe to thing what a thur/fri/ or sat night would have been like. To make matters worse the hotel staff did not care, they were incredibly rude, telling us that it was not on their property and that they could not do anything about it. They refused to even admit that it was at all inappropriate for the club to be blasting music at 4am that was so loud, everyone in a 2 mile radius in Condado beach could hear the terrible music.

Being a loyal Marriott rewards member, we had two options for hotel stays in San Juan: La Concha and the San Juan Marriot Resort. We chose La Concha based on the feedback from this site and also because it appeared to be trendy, hip, and fun. The hotel is amazing. It was recently renovated and would remind you of a hotel out of Miami. It has two/three pools, two hot tubs, is right against the ocean, and has a hip lobby bar that is packed on Friday and Saturday nights. All the rooms are new and upgraded and face the ocean. The staff is very nice and courteous and the hotel just opened their new casino the week we were there. The food and drinks are great as well. We ate one of our best lunches from the poolside bar and also ate dinner at Perla which is a fancy restaurant inside \"La Concha\" - the actual shell on the back side of the hotel. As for location, the hotel is in an up-and-coming part of town with bars, restaurants, and stores within walking distance including American favorites like Camilles, Dunkin Donuts, Hagen Das, Louis Vouitan, Cartier, and Wendy's. The hotel is also a block down from the Marriott and we stoped by that hotel as well. If you are choosing between the two, the Marriott is exactly what you would expect from the Marriott line. Nothing fancy but nice and clean. La Concha is classy, hip, fun, and trendy and more suited for couples and adults. Only thing bad about the hotel is that it is a cab ride from Old San Juan and you have to drive to El Yunque (the rainforest), Plaza de Americas (the mall), Luquillo beach, etc. Other than that the place is excellent and you will not be disappointed!!!", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Best Vacations\u201d", "Author": "sweett27", "ReviewID": "UR21847336", "Content": "I absolutely loved La Concha.

I suggest ordering your second Mojito when they bring you your first as the service is probably the only let down at this resort. The area is safe, just ignore the odd street bum, and there are plenty of dining options within walking distance. Try the trattoria next door - good light fare. Another good option is Yerba Buena - if just want \"American\" there is a Chilis about 10 minutes walk. The beach is cleaned every morning and is safe during the day. At times there is a wicked shore break so be careful and don't turn your back on the ocean - however if you like playing in the surf you will have a ball.

The hotel is fairly new, I think it opened the previous December. It was very modern. My husband and I joked that it was like walking into an IKEA showroom. We were placed near the new construction, and we could hear the banging in the morning, but it was not so loud that we could not hear ourselves. We left the window open the first couple of nights to listen to the waves as we fell asleep, but then would awaken in the middle of the night to use the restroom and find the tile floors slick with condensation. So we kept the windows closed at night - there is not sound with the windows closed.:-( The overall stay at the hotel was nice. I was a little disappointed in the quality of craftsmanship, there were paint splatters in the bathroom and places where the tile was not aligned well. I don't mean to be over-critical, but when you go to a five star hotel in the States, your expectation is perfection. Beware of the drivers when you rent your car. The posted speed limit might say 55, but no one is going over 50. There are no lane lines on most of the highways, but we did find near the end of our stay a toll highway where there were lines and it was clean and people mostly drove the speed limit. There are many American restaurants near the hotel, as well as some very good local eateries. If you are looking for a really nice place to celebrate a special occasion, the restaurant inside of the shell is ultra fancy (with ultra fancy prices, too!). My husband and I enjoyed a very nice meal and the wait staff were very attentive. Very nice exercise room, which was deserted all but one of the days that I was in there. Nice pools and spas. There was a lot of construction in the area when we were there. My husband and I counted at least a dozen cranes across the skyline in just the Condado neighborhood alone. We went on an all day sailing excursion with Erin Go Bragh. There were only 6 passengers, plus the captain and his wife and activities that they had planned were very enjoyable. I had the displeasure of becoming sea sick on this trip, and Ingrid (captain's wife) was very attentive and had every natural remedy available for my use if I wanted it. We also went on a jet ski tour of the Old San Juan area. We were the only party to show up on the stormy Monday, so we had a very private tour. It was a lot of fun, but the water was choppy outside of the bay, which made it a little scary (my husband would call it \"more fun\"). The tour guide was a little over the top with having us pose for pictures (which he then attempted to sell to us at the end of the tour) and having us act like pirates from centuries ago storming the fort, but it just added to the fun. The fort and castille are not to be missed, and walking around Old San Juan was fun. We even went to eat in one of the restuarants Rachel Ray has done for her $40 a day show. It was called Bombonera, retro Woolworth's cafeteria place that looks a little scary and has gross bathrooms, but there are only locals eating insides, which always says something about the good food. We did go to Bacardi, the tour was informationaly, but the store was very lacking. We did each get two drinks (swallows) for free. A very enjoyable trip, it was nice for grownups, but I would probably wait until my children are in their teens before considering taking them to San Juan Puerto Rico.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln MA", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience, exceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "OrrScores", "ReviewID": "UR19897959", "Content": "Very much enjoyed this hotel.

My two girl friends and I stayed at La Concha for just two nights of our total 4-night stay in Puerto Rico. I think we got a pretty good deal on our beach front room because of the fact that we traveled during Puerto Rico's \"low\" season, stayed there during the middle of the week, and because La Concha is currently in the process of building a second tower. The hotel entryway and lobby is amazing. Awesome modern decor with little flairs everywhere you look. There is flowing water everywhere and its lit up at night to give an extra effect. To the left of the lobby is the first outdoor seating area and the main pool. There is tons of outdoor seating - while it was totally empty while we were there, I could imagine it being full of people during a more busy time. The main pool has two layers with a waterfall between the two. At night the main pool is also lit up and looks gorgeous. My one and only complaint about this hotel is that they close the pools at 7:00pm. What a shame, it would've been great to go swimming when it was all lit up! Continue on to your right and toward the beach and you'll come to another outdoor seating area and La Concha's infiniti pool. This outdoor seating area is just awesome as it features beds and couches that you can lay on and just enjoy the ocean views. The infiniti pool also faces the ocean (see my pics!). La Concha even leaves out a pitcher of water and some cups in case you get parched while you are basking in the sun. The beach is also fabulous. Lounge chairs and umbrellas are complimentary... you just have to ask and then tip the attendant (but the nice part is that they'll haul all this to the beach for you and set it up perfectly). I have never seen such crystal clear water in my life and the waves are just big enough that they are fun, but manageable. All this and I haven't even described our room yet! The modern decor continues into the room. Our room was ocean front. It had a huge sliding glass door, but there wasn't any real balcony. Just about a 6\" ledge and a railing. Only the very top floor rooms have balconies from what we could see. The room was clean and comfortable. There is an in-room safe which is a nice feature for a beach resort. The bathroom was on the smaller side, but the walk-in shower was really cool. We ate dinner one night at 'La Perla's' restaurant on-site. The food was excellent, but I must say that it was rather pricey (about $70 pp). Most of it was fair for the quality, but I thought that their wine list was a little out of hand (nothing less than $60 a bottle). Unfortunately the Asian Grille was not open when we were there. FYI, the touristy area of Old San Juan is a little ways from La Concha. We took a taxi to San Felipe del Morro fortress and I wan to say that it cost about $15.

We were blown away by the view and the fact that we could clearly hear the waves crashing from the 11th floor. The rooms are extremely modern and equipped with white plush linens, flat screen tv sets, ipod stations, dvd player, and stereo system. The bathroom is extremely clean (one of my requirements) and very modern. Although slightly pricey, the food was excellent at La Concha. The buffet breakfast is to die for. The pastry chef deserves 20 thumbs up as well!!! Employees are extremely professional and very friendly! Lastly, this hotel will suit people of all ages. Although this hotel is extremely luxurious and modern, it has a fresh, fun atmosphere that is very inviting. On the weekends, this is the place to be for the locals!!! It definitely has a south beach feel to it. I felt right at home. While you are in Puerto Rico, check out El Yunque Rainforest (take the trail to the big waterfall- i think the name was La Melia Falls), Bacardi, Culebra Island, Old San Juan (Try the Dragonfly Restaurant) and Plazas Las Americas (one of the largest malls that I have ever seen). By the way, make sure to rent a car bc that is the best way to get around- and believe me, you will save more money than by getting taxis to take you around.

The few downsides include the surrounding construction in Condado which is out of the hands of the hotel. The area is going thru a rebirth and will be amazing in a few years. For now, you have to deal with some cranes, etc. Also, La Concha may want to rethink the 4pm check in policy. We arrived much earlier and had to kill time at the bar without our mosquito repellent (it was in our luggage). 4pm is way too late.

Efficient check-in & valet. 5 minute jog east to mostly residential areas of the Condado. Lots of locals mixed with the tourists makes for an upbeat environment. Great lobby/bar area. New rooms (12/07) are sleek & ultra functional. Great floor to ceiling oceanfront windows. Can listen to the ocean, feel the breeze at night!! Improved security in the pool area - Had to show my room key even at 6am! Negatives: Most Marriott properties have a \"Continental Buffet\" for cereal, fruit, etc. Had to pay $20 for the full buffet every morning, yet still only had a choice of 5 cereals - only 2 \"healthy\" choices. Had a delay one morning to get coffee - no waiter was around. Room not cleaned to Marriott standards - saw the same 3 pieces of rice on the floor 3 days in a row; bathroom shelves needed more attention & saw some small ants during my last stay.

We decided that going home together would be a great experience since we would be going as tourists and we had not seen each other in three years. We decided to stay in La Concha because of its location and good reviews. We were given a beautiful room on the seventh floor with a beautiful view of the beach. The hotel is very modern and beautiful and the employees are all very friendly, respectful and always willing to do everything that will make your stay more comfortable. La Concha is a hotel for young people, newlyweds or mature people who like to have fun and stay up until late. I would not recommend it to families with small children. Music and loud people can be heard upstairs until early morning hours. The beach, although very beautiful, can be very dangerous to little ones. The location of the hotel is very convenient as you can walk to other hotels and various good restaurants. The food served downstairs by the pool is excellent although pricey. Ikakos across the street has very good food at reasonable prices. The Luquillo beach is beautiful and if you have time to go to Culebra and Boqueron, do so. Culebra has the most beautiful beach with the right number of visitors. It was a delight to spend the day there. Do not expect any conveniences if you go for the day. Make sure that you fly (takes 15 minutes) and that you take your own towels. Once there, you can take a cab from the airport to the beach for $2.00 per person. Old San Juan and El Yunque are a must. Make sure that you shop for items made in Puerto Rico. Do not confuse them with souvenirs made in China. One note: If you intend to pay the hotel with a credit card, you will be charged for your entire stay plus assumed incidentals on the day that you check in. In our case, the extra charge was very high. It took them six days after we checked out to correct this charge to the actual amount.

Small noise at pool but there is so much construction overall that is it surprising didn't hear more. Would not hesitate not to stay because of it. While lobby was a 'hot spot' on Friday and Saturday night did not hear noise (was on 10th floor) and was on the young side (early 20s). Was not really set up to met people but to socialize with those you were with. Service was excellent, had to have someone come up to change the ipod connection and was done by time returned to room. If looking for towels always were some down at the towel station by the beach. The pool on the beach has a much better breeze than the upper level pools. Service was great except a bit slow ordering breakfast in hotel lobby. Only problem check out - 1st key disabled before check out time so had to go to lobby and get it reactivated. Also two of the three elevators were down for awhile (finally got two of three working) so there was a long wait as everyone trying to get their bags down for checkout - suggest if don't need room until noon, check out early and check bags. Take the barefoot cruise they can set up for you, if you like the water, well worth the $85 per person for the day. Found drinks all over expensive ($10 to $12 for mojito) Columbos (right when leave hotel) for food down the street a less expensive option.

In no way, fashion or form is this hotel located in a \"vaguely seedy area \" of San Juan. San Juan is a very old and very densely populated city, over 500 years old so it is not going to look as pristine as certain areas of North Carolina that have been in existence less than 50 years and are sparsely populated. This is part of the charm of the city. There are stores of the caliber of Gucci, etc within a 3 minute walk from the hotel. A Vanderbilt hotel is being completed next door.These stores and types of hotels do not locate in \" seedy areas\". There is a lot of construction due to ongoing renovations and revitalization of the area and this does detract a little from the \"beauty \" of the area. But once completed, be prepared to pay top dollar for what will be one of the most chic and hip caribbean urban experiences. I stayed here in March and will be staying again there next week. The place has a definite South Beach quality and ambience to it. The beach right on property has rough waters, so it is better for lounging. but within 10-15 minutes by car you can be in Isla Verde beach, where you can swim if you so desire.

It's really been a mixed bag. In some areas La Concha met and even exceeded my expectations, but in others it came up short. First it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the beach in San Juan. Honestly, the beach here is not that great to me; I'm not a big fan of brown sand beaches, but I suppose that is a matter of personal taste. I will say that the beach looked pretty clean and well maintained. The neighborhood does not seem that great to me either. - Vaguely seedy to my eyes, although it does look better at night. There is a good deal of construction going on in the area right now (including a new La Concha Casino and Suites building going up right next door. Also be aware of the extra charges: $26.85 per night resort fee, there's also a room tax...oh, you want to actually stay in your room?...and there's also an occupancy tax. My room itself was decent; medium size, but big enough for my needs. On the plus side, it's got a full wall window with a view of the beach and ocean, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got an excellent bathroom and shower. On the minus side there are significant stains on the carpet. On the plus side they have complimentary internet; both wired and Wi-Fi, and that's an area where a lot of \"luxury\" hotels continue to gouge their guests. On the minus side, the Wi-Fi didn't actually work for 3 of the 4 days I was here, at least not in my room. The wired connection did work, but there was spotty connectivity in the evenings on several occasions. The BIG issue (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been posted in other reviews is the noise problem. This is caused by the fact that the hallways leading to the rooms are open to the outside. This means that anything going on in the street (or more importantly in the park next to the hotel, where they have concerts on weekends) can feel free to come right on in. Also exacerbating the issue is the fact that the door to the room has like a 1/4 inch gap all the way around. I'm on the 9th floor and the noise was a significant issue on Saturday and Sunday night. On the other hand, on the plus side they have one, if not the, best fitness centers that I've seen at a hotel. On other points of interest, we didn't eat at any of restaurants, with the exception of the breakfast buffet at Level 25, which I thought was not a bad value. We had a few drinks at the bar, but I can't speak to the prices since I didn't pick up the tab. Other restaurants in the area are fine, although a little pricey for what you get (I suspect that this whole beach area is gringoland). The pools are great, with lots of couches and chairs all around. The staff was fine. With the exception of one day when housekeeping missed making up my room, no problems. All in all, an average experience; not terrible, but not anything to write home about either.

Well, this was my first time to Puerto Rico and was there with about 60 family and freinds for a Family reunion trip. Our group ages ran from infants up to grandmothers. First off, the hotel itself was very nice. It was trendy in a Miami South Beach sort of way. My husband and I travel often and have been all over the world. We normally stay in HIlton or Marriott properties and are accustomed to well appointed amenities and service. The service here was good. We never felt like we were overlooked. We spent lots of time lounging at the pool in front and the waitresses kept our drinks full and made sure that we didnt need anything. Be aware that you will spend lots and lots of money eating and drinking in San Juan unless you dont mind Subway and Wendys which are right up the street on Ashford. I do have a few recommendations for eating and entertainment. Eating: 1. J Taste: in Old San Juan was delicious. They have a full sushi bar and a full menu fr those in your party who dont eat sushi. There were 6 of us at dinner and everyone enjoyed their food. 2. Dragonfly: right around the corner in Old San Juan. Try the rock shrimp tacos! 3. Columbos: a cheap spot for breakfast, right up the street from the hotel just past the Gucci store. 4. The kiosks at Luquillo Beach: They taste much better than they look. This was the best and cheapest authentic food we had the whole time we were there. 5. Newyorican Cafe(sp?) : Dancing..in Old San Juan.This spot was good for dancind with other people over 25. 6. La Concha lobby, El San Juan lobby or Condado Plaza and Casino were hot spots from Wed to Sat late night (after 11pm) People were dressed to the nines. Luckily I had packed my mini dress and heels. 7. Request a room on the top floor. Our room 1211 had a full balcony, oceanfront so we were able to sit outside and watch the ocean it was great. Other floors just have little walkouts or nothing at all. 8. DO NOT LET YOU CHILDREN INTO THE WATER ALONE!!! A member of our group (25 YEARS OLD AND 6 FEET TALL) was swept away by the rip tide while playing a game af football along the shore. There is a strong undertow and the floor drops abruptly about 20 feet out. he was literally floating out to see until the guy who puts the umbrellas in the sand grabbed a ring and jumped off the breaker wall to save him. They were in the water floating for 8 minutes before the police and some hotel workers came to help him out of the water. He had to be taken to the hospital. There are NO LIFEGUARDS ON THE BEACH>>>BE AWARE! 9. There is lots of noise from the construction next door and we could hear everything starting t about 7am during the week. 10. El Yungue:Easy to find by car. The lady at the Hertz desk in the lobby has directions. We did the shortest trail which is La Mina and even though it was .7 miles it seemed like a million. I would not have missed it and it was worth the work of hiking to see it. You dont need to pay the $3 at the visitor center. The trail heads are fairly well marked. You will see people parked at the trailheads as you ride up the mountain We found that many of the nightspots did not card so there were many young (under 18) people trying to drink and party with you. I am a teacher (and over 30) and partying with this age group was not to appealing for me. All in all it was nice to visit but I do not think that I woul return for a pleasure trip.

Our room was large, clean and well-furnished. We weren't in the room much until late afternoon but it was always cleaned by 2PM. This hotel has a very active night life and there are crowds of locals in the lobby and outdoor pool area most every night.

On a positive note, the music, which definitely could be heard in our room, ended by 10PM. We only ate one meal in the hotel because we're a bit budget-conscious and the food and drink prices are resort-priced! $14 for a hamburger, fries and a 6oz cup of Coke, which they would not refill without charging again, was too much. Fortunately, there are many excellent restaurants within walking distance that are reasonably priced. There is also a Walgreen's a couple blocks away where we could get snacks and water. Speaking of water, the ice and tap water in the hotel is safe to drink but tastes bad. Keep in mind anything you leave in your room is subject to \"review\" by the cleaning staff. We had some leftover food disappear which we were planning to eat the next night. We complained and were reimbursed by the hotel but we still had to get replacement food. After a long, hot day, that was a hassle. The safe in the room is large and ours was well used! We did not need or want a rental car. The bellstand and concierge gave us excellent instructions on how to take the bus to Old San Juan and water ferry to Bacardi.

From the first moment she made us feel that she new us and was ready to help. The room was bright and had all the amenities and most importantly was clean. Houskeepping came all but one day before noon. Each morning we went to the beach, 2 chairs and an umbrella were waiting. The beach was clean, wide and safe. The water was a bit rough the first few days but calm after that. The beachside pool was great. When we needed refreshed we walked a couple of steps and into the pool. The beach waiting staff was great, they came around often and brought cold drinks and food which could be charged to the room so no need to carry money to the beach. The food at the hotel was great, we had the breakfast buffet included in our rate and its was plenty. It was open from 6 to 11 so depending on how late we were out the night before we never missed breakfast. The afternoon sandwich menu was good and the Sliders were a big hit. Louise at the activities desk made our night time choices easy. She was ready and available to help with questions and give suggestions and appeared to be happy to be helping. Both Louise and Karla made our dinner, entertainment and activity decisions easy and worry free. There are a lot of nice restraunts that are within walking distance, all kind of food, and of course night life and casinos. The Friday and Saturday crowd in lobby was fun, if for no other reason than to watch the people. None of the music or construction noise bothered us in our room or at the beach. We went to Old San Juan one day and back one evening for night time dinner and club. We rented a car from Charlie's one day and visited the rain forest and Liquilla beach, fun. One issue, DO NOT try to rent from Hertz which is located in lobby of the hotel, it was a disaster and in the end the hotel helped us solve the problem by calling Charlies for us. They saved our day since Hertz did not have our car ready in the morning and after we waited tried to give us a car with bad tires. There is a lot of construction in the area, but it was not a problem. The shops in area are many and you can get anything you want. Everytime we took a taxi it was between 10 and 15 dollars, and they were available every place. This was the first time we visited PR, other than to fly through, and we will definetly go back. We went to tourist places as well as local places and the people were warm and friendly and more than happy to help and even just sit and talk.

We went for a long Mother's Day weekend and had two stylish, impeccably clean and well-appointed adjoining rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Caribbean. The experience begins with the amazing lobby (which is also a bar, lounge area, weekend DJ scene) that opens seamlessly to the beautiful pool area with huge, overstuffed day beds with pillows, lushly landscaped and filled with clusters of palms in huge pots, making an outdoor living room effect. Three pools, one by the beach, two terraced outside the lobby, connected by a waterfall. The young, friendly, attractive and very attentive staff are always at your service. The food is excellent: the breakfast buffet is an excellent value, poolside lunch menu is just perfect, and served right from the poolside grill. Dinner at La Perla was superb--the equal of the finest any major city has to offer, at probably half the price, as well as an excellent wine list. The beach is terrific, very wide, with plenty of palm clusters for shade. I would happily pay high-season rates for this resort, but the off-season price was incredible--two rooms for what we would probably pay for one in season. There is a $20/day resort fee per room, but well worth it. They are adding a casino and condos next door, so there is some construction noise during the day, but well-screened by waterfalls and other water elements and some mildly intrusive poolside music. I highly recommend this for a romantic getaway or a family vacation with either very small children or grown kids.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Staff\u201d", "Author": "RhondaP13", "ReviewID": "UR15517087", "Content": "La Concha is definitely a work in progress.

The bathroom was adequate, and the bed was comfortable. There was an issue with the air conditioning, but other than that it was a very pleasant room. Our room opened up to construction, but fortunately there was nothing going on, on the weekend. We had no issue with the noise from the lobby, and if you like night life this hotel is definitely a hot spot.

First, nobody is in a hurry....anywhere in Puerto Rico. If I had only stayed at the hotel, I might not have realized that service is not 5 star anywhere on the island. If you are in a hurry, go somewhere else, because you'll be frustrated everywhere you go by longer than expected wait times. Second, the Condado beach area, where the resort is located, is under renovation/revitalization and is smack in the middle of a city of 2 million people. If you want absolute silence and tranquility, go someplace else. Here, the sound of waves crashing on the beach will be occasionally interrupted by construction or traffic noise during the day. Finally, if you want to enjoy calm beaches and lagoons where your small children can play beachside for hours without seeing a wave, then you should go elsewhere. The beaches here, though a tremendous amount of fun, have strong surf and you need to watch how far out your children go. If you are prepared for the above, you will have an outstanding time, as I did with my family - two children, my wife and I. We enjoyed our weeklong stay. We were upgraded to an oceanview room on our arrival. We were on the 12th floor, so noise from the music below was not a problem. The lobby and poolside exterior was outstanding...Southbeach architecture, upscale feel, very friendly and attentive staff (as long as you're not in a hurry). Restaurants were OK (ask for the kids menu if you have kids), but there are plenty of restaurants just down the street that you can walk to and eat at a different one each night. The location is safe, as long as you use common sense. Old San Juan is a cab ride away for twelve to fifteen dollars, if you want to explore something different than Condado. Most importantly, there is a Starbucks and a Dunkin Donuts within walking distance. Try the coffee in the hotel too....its very good. The rooms were nice and clean, with flat screen TVs and iPod Docking Stations. They were cleaned at a reasonable time each day. The resort is very nice....with beautiful lobby, multiple pools and hot tubs, including an infinity pool, ample outdoor and indoor resort seating and lounging and the beach nearby. It really had a beach club feel. After looking at the other places nearby, this one really takes tops in the area.

The hotel was amazing and I highly recommend it. It's possible that I went in the off-season because the hotel and San Juan in general were pretty empty, which was fine with me. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to an ocean-view room (although, I think most of the rooms at La Concha are ocean views.) The room was great. Very clean with a great view of the water and the smaller pool closer to the ocean. The pools were also great and not crowded either. The poolside food/beverage service was excellent and the waiters will keep the ice coming while drinking your carafe of sangria by the pool. The concierge was also excellent, from recommending restaurants to explicit directions to the El Yunque rainforest (definitely do some hiking while you are there!) Overall, no complaints about the hotel...everything was great. Now for those of you who like food, then you should definitely read below...I love to try new types of food when I go to new places and did a lot of research before I went, but also got some great recs from the hotel. If you are staying at La Concha, you MUST go to the Pure & Natural Juice Bar. It is literally right next door to the hotel, directly across from the Dunkin' Donuts. It was the BEST oven-roasted, carved turkey sandwich I have ever had and got it each day we were there. Pure & Natural makes everything from scratch... breads, hummus, juices/shakes... everything was amazing! You should definitely get lunch there and bring it to the pool/beach with you. Plus, it's way cheaper (and better) than the hotel food. For good, local food, you can also go right across the street to Cafe Del Angel. Slow service (as is everywhere else in San Juan) but the authenticity makes up for it. I liked my first taste of Mofongo. For dinner in Old San Juan, the hotel recommended Dragonfly. All part of the same chain as Aquaviva & Parrot Club which are located right next to it. The ambiance was great and it was the most crowded of any of the places we went, but the food was just OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. It was pretty pricey, but my friend and I did enjoy the tuna tartar, the rice, & the pork. Wasn't a fan of the sausage spring rolls though. If we went back, I would definitely try the other restaurants as well. The last night we were there, we had Cuban food at Ropa Vieja. The Cuban staples were good, but you MUST try the blueberry risotto. I've never had anything like it before and it was awesome.

On the positive side, the hotel facilities are beautiful, very South Beach inspired decor, outstanding pool areas, excellent lobby bar. The room (ocean view - 9th floor) was similar in decor - very contemporary. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The ocean view was fantastic from the room (if only there were balconies..) Each service experience was fantastic, especially Luis in the lobby bar who was very friendly. The bar does get very busy at night but it was staffed by 3 or 4 bartenders and service was good. The Fitness Center is very nice - all new equipment on par with a top line health club. The Valet parking was prompt and courteous. Check-in and check-out were prompt, efficient and courteous. I have traveled to San Juan more than 25 times and this was one of my favorite places - much better atmosphere than the Marriott. As a single traveler I find the Marriott way too family friendly (too many kids in the pool area for example) and there were noticeably fewer kids at La Concha. On the negative side, the air conditioner in the room had issues upon my arrival and also a few days later.. it would not keep the room cool. In both instances a call to the front desk and quick response (within 10 minutes) from Engineering fixed the problem. Also a little surprised to see some stains on the carpet and scuff marks on the wall (from the desk chair) . The windows in the room were also very dirty on the outside - there had been a lot of wind and rain and I know the outside windows cannot be cleaned everyday but nevertheless.. a bit annoying with an ocean view. As another reviewer wrote, I had a similar issue with the wireless internet - requiring use of an ethernet cable, which also had to be brought to the room. The room service menu was also missing from the room. It is odd that there is no hotel directory but not a particular negative for me. Regarding the construction - there were 2 mornings where the hotel-condos immediately next door were pretty loud with hammers, etc.. But the work was done during the day and if you weren't in the room during the day then not an issue. The noise was not noticeable in the hotel pool area. The hotel property itself was having some finishing touches - painting mainly - but not a difficulty or disturbance at all. The Condado area is undergoing a renaissance and while not there yet - it is well on the way to being a true destination spot. Final note - the Argentinian restaurant Uomo - about 10 minutes walking past the Marriott - is absolutely the best restaurant I've been in San Juan.. Fantastic... La Concha is definitely a great place and currently a good value (vs. other properties nearby) and upon completion of the condos and additon of the spa will prove to be even better.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLooks great, service disappoints\u201d", "Author": "thoreaut", "ReviewID": "UR14830937", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights for a combination of business and pleasure.

Upon check-in I was informed that our reserved beachside balcony room with King bed was not available but that they could offer me a pool side room with double beds.

Not a good start to our stay when our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready when we checked in at 5 p.m. They took our cell phone number and told us they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call us when the room was ready. An hour and \u00c2\u00bd later I went to check on the room and it was apparently ready half an hour ago. Where was my call to my cell phone? We were just waiting in the hotel lobby! The room itself is very modern and nicely appointed. The balcony is a misnomer, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really just a thing 1 foot strip that you can barely stand on comfortably.

On day 2, we returned to our room at 4 p.m. to find that housecleaning had not yet cleaned our room. I called the front desk and they told me that housekeeping goes from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. and that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eventually get to us! Forget that we needed clean towels to take a shower after a day at the beach! This was a recurring theme each day. On day 3 housekeeping actually arrived at 10 a.m. and just walked into our room despite a do not disturb sign on the door. Fortunately we were dressed but the sudden interruption was another major annoyance. Be warned, only 1 elevator works and be prepared for long waits particularly at night when there are a lot of partiers going up and down. Food is okay but we experienced long waits and poor service at the restaurants and bars as well. There just seems to be a general lack of caring by their employees.

I've read quite a few of the reviews for this hotel and am surprised by the positive ones.......this hotel thinks it is a nightclub and is obviously more interested in the revenue/profit from bar sales than it is the comfort of the hotel guests! In fairness, I was very impressed with the contemporary decor of the pool/bar areas, and the contemporary fitout in the rooms is great. But the decor of the hotel does not make up for everything else. The layout of the rooms and the location of the live music means that you cannot escape the music by closing your hotel room door............and the live music goes on to till 11pm, followed by a DJ till 3am on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. So if you are looking for a hotel for relaxation and to catch up on sleep, this isnt it! Perhaps you should look at the HardRock Hotel for a quieter experience! Also the housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired. When you go to a hotel of this supposed standard, you expect the rooms to be clean......on arrival to the room, sand in the shower from previous occupants, and black hairs in the shower, on the white comforter covers and all over the carpet indicated to me that the room had not been thoroughly cleaned. This hotel is still waiting for the Hotel Information Compendiums for the rooms....over 3 months since they opened. So finding out what services are offered by the hotel is a lesson in discovery. Actually working out how to turn down the brightness of the LCD screen on the telephone so its not perpetual daylight in your room is one such lesson.........
