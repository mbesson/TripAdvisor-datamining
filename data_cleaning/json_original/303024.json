The so-called standard rooms do not have a window to the outside world. The windows open onto an air shaft, which is shared with the adjoining building. The room was dark and airless and not a healthy atmosphere for anyone with asthma or similar breathing issues. We would have changed hotels but we were 'trapped' because we had an airmiles hotel voucher and this voucher is for a specific hotel. What made our situation worse was the fact the the manager would not leave his office to speak with us. I tried each day to see him but was told he was out, in a meeting, on the telephone, or on-line.........any excuse for him not to see us. We were asked to pay another e30/night to move to a better room. Beware that there is at least one of this type of room on each floor of the hotel. I don't have any other complaint with the hotel apart from the standard of these rooms and illusive attitude of the manager. But, a hotel is only as good as its manager ........!

Very moderately priced, and in such a convenient location (minutes from the metro, with tons of restaurants, etc all within walking distance). The lobby was very modern looking and check in was a breeze. The front desk spoke english and they offered a free morning breakfast (if you woke up early enough). Overall Rooms were very small, and the bathrooms were even smaller. I personally loved the decor throughout, but be careful if you have lots of luggage bc the elevators are small and the stairs were winding. During your stay in France, I highly recommend you try the Crepes, get an expresso at the various cafes, and if you enjoy beers from around the world, I highly recommend the \"Desperado\". I've traveled quite a bit and have tried tons of beers from all over, and this may have to be my favorite to date. Unfortunately I've been unable to find any west of the atlantic so its something that I look forward to when i travel back to europe. Prices for food was pretty fair, but drinks can get expensive except for wine so be prepared if you're a heavy drinker like myself. Highly recommend you visit Champs Elysees if you like to shop, and get a credit card that doesn't charge international conversion fees (i.e. Capital One offers a free one). The girlfriend bought a few things from LV, and when they offer you the option to convert it to US dollars real time, ask to pay in euros bc you'll get a better exchange rate. I learned the hard way after my first purchase so my loss is your gain.

Our reservations were made by the educational travel group through which I take tours with my high school students. So, technically, we were a part of a group of about 25, but we extended our stay and we were actually on our own most of the time we were there. We arrived at around noon and our rooms were ready. My sister and I had paid extra to have single rooms (we like our privacy at the end of the night!). She was given room 25--it was HUGE! There was a full closet with shelving, two twin beds put together to form a king of sorts, the sink & shower area was separate from the toilet area, there were double French door/windows that opened onto the street below--there was a TV with about 10 channels and a mini-refrigerator. Very nice room. When I arrived at my single room (#62) I was under the roof on the top floor...My bed was a double bed that was smashed up against the wall (the French door/windows could only open about 2 inches!)--there was no where to even put a suitcase. I put my suitcase on top of the fridge, but every time I opened my suitcase, the top would switch the light off. There was no floor space to fit a suitcase. There was a desk and chair, but I could not sit at it unless I moved my suitcase off the refrigerator. My 'closet' was about 18 inches wide---no shelves at all, only a few hangers. My bathroom was all in the same room, but because it was in a corner/slanted/roof room, I could not look into the mirror without leaning to my right! It was a very strange set up. I will say that the shower was larger than others that I have had in Paris, and it had GREAT water pressure and it was hot. I did try to change to a different room, but since we had a group there along with the other guests, this was not possible. I did finally change with one of the guides from our group to room #32. It was 3 floors directly below 62, but there was no slanted ceiling to deal with so it seemed a bit larger. Both 32 and 62 faced the interior courtyard of the school nextdoor & the Montparnasse Tower--not the street. The lobby area is very neat, but as a previous poster mentioned, the 'sweet smelling lobby' is actually an incense maching that pumps incense into the air. Some people may like it, but I actually found it to be unpleasant. I am not a big incense person. Anyone with asthma may even have difficulty breathing in the lobby. The desk people were pleasant, we had no problems with them whatsoever. The Internet service is free in the lobby area. We used this every day to communicate with our families. We also ate breakfast every day. It was a very typical French breakfast--crosissants, pain au chocolat, rolls, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, some deli meats, coffee, tea, juice. The breakfast was included in our price. The hotel is less than a 3-5 minute walk to either the Vavin or Raspail metro stops. This was great. There is a market that sets up around the corner on Edgar Quinet--they had very fresh food and other miscellaneous items there. The Montparnasse cemetery is right around the corner as well. The hotel is still doing renovations. There was plastic taped to the floor in the stairwell and on the landings near the elevator. I can see why they would do renovations since the light & airy voilet/purple color scheme of the lobby/rez-de-chaussee area is a drastic contrast with the colors of the rooms (brown, orange,yellow wallpaper--very depressing--see my photos!) January is definitely the closest to an off-season when that type of work would be done. It did not bother me. In all, the hotel was fine. We were not there for long each day anyway. I have actually stayed DIRECTLY across the street at the Mercure Raspail Montparnasse (review was posted in 2009). That hotel was, on a whole, a bit better than the Royal. When I stay in Paris again, I will not stay at the Royal--I would certainly choose the Hotel Saint Jacques (also reviewed in April/May 2009), even though it is a 2 star, the upgraded rooms were nicer. If you already have reservations here, I would ask for a room that faces the street--they seemed to be bigger--at least my sister's room was! Bon voyage--you will have a great time. LAST NOTE: If taking the RER line B to the airport--be sure to check for problems on the line--we were left stranded in a town named Aulnay-sous-bois along with several hundred other travelers trying to catch flights. One Frenchman told us that this does occasionally happen. It was a chaotic situation trying to get one of the few taxis from Aulany to Charles de Gaulle. Next time, I would take a taxi from central Paris.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMerci; we will be back!\u201d", "Author": "LCubano", "ReviewID": "UR92319494", "Content": "We selected this review based on a package price, reviews and location.

I have now come back to read the reviews, and I think they are canned responses and not legit.....its a load of tosh!. Once you move beyond the sweet smelling lobby and the candy filled welcome bowl...its downhill. We were met with two quasi grumpy desk attendants that offered very little in the way of suggestions or places that we could eat, they just pointed to the road a few blocks over and said you'll find something there. The one concierge actually tisked when I said I had a budget of 60 euros to eat dinner for myself and my 10 year old daughter....like we wouldn't be fed at McDonalds on that (which I found somewhat amusing)....we dined on the best steak ever and still came home with change. Now to the rooms, the hotel was under construction so hallways were covered in paint and plastic which is ok, I'm not sleeping in the hallways....its when we got to the rooms, which were dated,....the curtains were hanging off rod, the bed was covered in sheets and blankets, (no duvet) the wall paper was peeling and been reglued, fittings in bathroom dangling from ceiling, the free wi-fi never connected or worked, (might only work in lobby)..and I'm sure we had one of the better rooms. One the other patrons was at the reception asking if he could have another room because his shower was on one side of room and his toilet was on the other...the exasperated receptionist who never cracked a smile for me said....but this is French! I think when you work for a place where patrons aren't happy, it makes you a defensive put upon employee. Our room overlooked the glass topped breakfast area and I don't think there were many takers at 12 euros per person, you could eat next door at the Broc and have a big hot breakfast in a quirky but pleasant atmospher with fresh out of the oven croissants, french bread, freash sqeezed orange juice, a hot drink and fried eggs for 10euros. The positives, it was in a decent location, lots of shops down the Rue du Renne, and mostly Parisians so you know you are getting a bargain, and lots of restaurants a block away on Rue Montparnasse...and lots of movie theatres if you want to see a flick in English after your dinner.

We landed at Orly airport and had to catch a bus to Montparnasse, which cost 8 euro each. Sadly the bus ride took longer than anticipated due to protest marches through Paris, so the trip took about an hour, usually though, we were told, it takes 30 minutes. We had to then walk about 3 blocks to the hotel because as we later found out, most maps in Paris are not to scale!!!! The hotel was very nice. The manager was fantastic upon our arrival (and throughout our stay), giving us information on where and how to travel through the busy Parisien streets. The hotel room was very nice, but small, although apparently, by Paris standards it was about average. The room itself was extremely quiet and peaceful. The hotel was also very quiet and peaceful, which was appreciated after a day of sightseeing around Paris. The buffet breakfast costs 11 euro extra per person/per day, its a little bit pricey for what you get, its basically a continental brekkie, but it is all you can eat, so my advice, is to eat up!!! Wonderful restaurants around the corner in Montparnasse Boulevard. The hop on, hop off bus departs a block up the road on Raspail Boulevard, which is very handy. Directly across the road from the hotel there is a bus which will take you directly into the heart of Paris, again, very handy.

I only wish the yoghurt had been flavored rather than plain. Our room was quite comfortable, but laid out in an unusual manner. One entered the room into a hallway, with the bathroom off that hall before getting to the bedroom. Still, it was convenient. The hallway had a hall tree for hanging extra clothes and there was a nice closet with shelves, built into the room. The room was clean and serviced regularly. The negatives: The only English language channel on our TV was CNN, and for some reason that didn\u2019t work after the first day. The heater in the bathroom, designed to heat the towels didn\u2019t work. The shower head had an extra spray out the side rather than in a nice smooth spray.

This hotel is walking distance from Luxemburg Gardens, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Louvre, and LOTS OF Restaurants and shopping!! We always saw lots of Police on bikes or horses and the streets were clean and well lit so I always felt safe. The continental breakfast at the Hotel was AWESOME!!! We took full advantage of it every morning before heading out for the day --- there was a full dining room type area for breakfast which included a selection of breads, jams, fresh meats and cheeses, eggs, yogurt, fruit salad, cereal, coffee, tea etc YUM!!! The lobby had a pc with free internet service and a coffee machine with free coffee 24/7.

I made a good decision when choosing Le Royal. It is a small, intimate hotel, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is by no means, however, a luxury hotel, if that is what you are looking for. I traveled to Paris with my husband and my adult son, who is fluent in French and familiar with Paris. We had a triple room on the 5th floor which was surprisingly spacious. My son had his own twin bed in a somewhat separated section of the room, and my husband and I had a king sized bed (two twins put together) that was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and designed well for three people, with a tub and shower, a separate walk in shower, double sinks, and a toilet that was separated from the rest of the bathroom. We were in the back part of the building, and all in all it was very quiet. The maid cleaned well each day and shampoo and soap were provided. Bring your own hair conditioner and body lotion, as these were not provided. Our plan included the breakfast. The food was the same everyday, but it was good and nutrious--all you can eat boiled eggs, cheese, juice, milk, coffee, tea, sliced ham, fruit salad, cereal, croissants, pain au chocolat, etc.. Breakfast is served between 6 and 10:30. We filled up on breakfast and didn't have to eat again until dinner. While it may be expensive if not included in your plan, it beats walking around Paris in the winter weather looking for a place to eat first thing in the morning. Beware of the phone service. A phone is in each room. I made some collect calls, and my son was using a prepaidphone card he purchased for international calls, but for some reason the hotel still charges for the calls when you use the phone. We were very upset to find a $39 bill tacked on to our final bill for what we thought were free calls, and more upset that we were not warned of this. There wasn't a good explanation as to how the charges were figured. The location of the hotel is fantastic. The hotel is less than two blocks from the Vivan metro stop and within easy walking distance to Tour Montparnasse and the nearby Galleria Lafayette and other shops. Plus there are lots of restaurants and small wine, pastry and other shops around. I was very happy with the location. The building is now equipped with internet service. If you don't bring your own computer, there is a computer in the lounge. You are given 30 minutes without charge and are assigned a password. I'm not sure what the price is after that. If you bring your own computer, however, you are given free blocks of time to use in your room. While it appears that you are limited to 5 hours, that is actually not the case and you can ask for more time if need be.

The women who served breakfast were not proficient in English, but were very kind and we managed to communicate via sign language when we needed something.

The only complaint I really have with the hotel is the odor of smoke which permeated our room, despite it being a non-smoking hotel. We aired it out each evening when we returned from our ramblings by opening the french doors, but it is my guess that when a building is that old, all those decades of smoke are hard to get rid of. When we walked into the lobby each evening, that air-freshener scent that other reviewers have mentioned was present and it was sllightly unpleasant.

The exterior of the hotel is well maintained. Stepping in to the lobby, it was obvious that daily care is taken with the appearance and cleanliness of the entire hotel. The front desk staff were gracious, kind, friendly, and beyond helpful during our stay. They provided accurate directions, made restaurant reservations, and were patient with all our questions. Our room was in the rear of the hotel on the 4th floor. Our large window opened! The room itself was compact yet not crowded and contained everything needed for our stay - bed with padded leather headboard, nightstands, armoire, desk & chair, mini-fridge, and though not needed, a flat screen television. The decor was tasteful and understated, which we found very restful. Our private bath was a comfortable size and while the shower was different from our experience at home, it was adequate. Loved the tub and took advantage of several long soaks! The bed was comfortable and cozy and we slept extremely well. Breakfast is served in a dining room down a short hallway from the front desk. Half of the dining room is under a glass ceiling - so cheerful especially on overcast or rainy days. The buffet offers many choices including but not limited to fresh croissants, beignets, baguette, ham, boiled eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, milk, juices, and cheese. The room is attractive, the furniture comfortable, and like the rest of the hotel, everything is attended to and clean. The staff refill food and drinks on the buffet when empty or low. The staff also quickly clear and clean tables for other guests. How wonderful that the breakfast buffet is available until 10:30am!!! I mistakenly left my prescription reading glasses in the hotel room when we checked out and I was back in the U.S. before I realized it. I emailed the hotel, received a response the next day, and my glasses were returned to me (at my expense - appropriately). Merci, Michel and Narema! We hated to leave Hotel Le Royal. While it's tempting to check out another hotel when we return to Paris, we won't risk it. We'll go back to Hotel Le Royal! For anyone wondering, my husband and I each speak very, very minimal French.
