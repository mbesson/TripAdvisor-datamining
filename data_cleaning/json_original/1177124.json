The bus stop is 100 meters away. The nearest metro station is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 10 am and we were given an early check in. Also at the reception we were given vouchers for 50 percent discount on breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Normal price 17 euros, our breakfast cost $ 8.5. euro. Very good choice for breakfast. Vegetables, cheeses, sausage. There are local specialties - tapas, tortilla, bokadilya. Good coffee. Varied and tasty desserts. You can order a la carte hot - scrambled eggs, fried eggs. The hotel rooms are good. We were given a room on the top floor with a beautiful view. Room with large windows. The beds are comfortable. In the bathroom, modern equipment. There is a shower gel, shampoo, soap. We had a standard room with an extra bed. The room is quite big, the place enough. Very good price. 60 euros for a double room with a child 13 years of age.

My wife and I booked this hotel via some websites. I t was a deal and didn't know anything about hotel just we know about the area.We booked the hotel with a reasonable price and looking forward for our trip to Madrid after Barcelona. First Point is that the hotel is very close to hotel ,it means you are far from the old area of town. The hotel is very modern with modern decoration in all parts with Free WIFI and fitness room in 6th floor.I can not say this is good for tourist but for business trip it is fine, Because the hotel is in residential and business district of Madrid. Despite the Location the other thins are fine such markets and restaurants around the hotel. Great Shopping mall approximately 300 meters from the hotel that make it easy to find everything you need and you don't need to go far to purchase your necessity. So let's talk about how to reach the old district such as Plaza mayor ... There are two ways: first take a bus line number 52 near the hotel and go to downtown or Walking 10 minutes and take a Metro. We didn't use the bus at all and we tried to use Metro and it was Perfect and clean with good employee and they are very polite. The most important negative point here is that if you want to go back to hotel in the middle of the day and take some rest , it is really hard to go back to hotel with Bus or Metro taking 15 to 25 minutes and go back again to down town. If we want to go back to Madrid as a tourist next time we will choose another hotel in downtown to save my time ,maybe it cost a little bit more but it worth to pay to save your time. The conclusion is the Location for tourist is not good but for business trip is good.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Prcoelho", "ReviewID": "UR123150413", "Content": "Nice modern hotel.

We stayed in this hotel twice in a trip we had to Spain this summer. The building, lobby and the rooms have interesting design and colors. The rooms are maintained fairly well and are clean. They put complimentary bottled water, one per day - not many but better than none. The staff at the front desk are friendly, nice and so helpful is you have any question or request. As many people mentioned, the location is a bit far from downtown and Puerta Del Sol. But as a tourist, you would have no problem as there is a bus (#53) which commutes frequently from the hotel to Puerta Del Sol and vice versa. The bus stop is in Calle de Torrelaguna, which is acually only 3 minutes walking distance! There is also a night bus coming back to the hotel, e.g. from Plaza de Cibeles. So even at night it is not a big deal to come back to the hotel. You would not have to take a taxi. There is a metro station, Arturo Soria, close to the hotel also; it is about 10-15 mins walk. I cannot tell the location would be any problem, actually it is an advantage as it gives you the opportunity to use the public transportation and view different neighborhoods of Madrid on your way to downtown or other destinations. The hotel has a fitness centre, not too many facilities but enough that keeps you exercised if you'd like to. The Wi-Fi was fine, we had no problem in terms of speed and accessibility. There is a terrace on the main floor, which is great for relaxing and enjoy the quiet neighborhood of the hotel. There are some restaurants around, again in walking distance, which would become handy. There is also a mall on the way to metro station on Arturo Soria with some cafes. There is a Opencor supermarket close by and open 24/7, which is very convenient! We stayed in Confortel Atrium-Madrid in the begining of our trip to Spain this summer. Initially we thought we would stay in another hotel at the end of our trip, but then we decided to come back to the same hotel as we liked it so much! I would highly recommend this hotel.

Found a very good deal on Orbitz. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Avenida de Paz Metro, and the 53 and 122 buses stop at the corner. The 53 goes to Sol; the 122 goes to Avenida de Americas and the Metro and bus connections there. Rooms were large and modern, comfortable beds, flat screen TV, minibar with free bottled water. Downside was unreliable wifi. The first room I had, it worked fine; in the second, while the signal was decent, my computer said there was only a local connection with no Internet. In that case, I had to go down to the lobby to find an Internet signal. They need to upgrade their hot spot since I imagine most people who stay at this hotel will want wifi access in their rooms. They do have several desktop computers in the lobby, as well as desk/tables with easy access to power receptacles. Also, the weather was nice so one could sit out on their terrace and work there. One weekend night, there were partiers who made a lot of noise in and outside of their rooms, with little sign that the hotel staff or security cared enough to intervene. Apart from that, staff were efficient, usually multi-lingual, and provided baggage storage after checkout. Some tips: Others have mentioned the shopping center several blocks up the street; there is a large supermarket on the ground floor there, as well as a smaller Dia supermarket a block or two walking in the other direction back towards the Metro. Most of the nearby restaurants were closed on the weekend. However, if you walk across the overpass over the large Avenida de America highway, there is a cluster of stores and restaurants there including the old reliable standby, VIPs.

Usually, I would like this hotel - but the fact that the Internet access is so poor in what is supposed to be a business hotel is something I cannot forgive. Let's start with the good. The hotel is fairly new, less than 2 years, and it's nicely designed. The lobby is very large and airy, and the rooms are well appointed - if somewhat in the \"basic-scandinavian\" mode of decor. I do like the bathrooms with very deep bathtubs, and the ample windows in all rooms. Even the smaller rooms are a decent size, but I'd recommend an executive room as you will get more space for very little more money. The TV service has mostly spanish channels, with very few english options (this is fairly common in Spain, sadly) and the beds are sort of hard. Also, as someone else commented, there's no iron or ironing boards - this is common in Spain, but you would expect new hotels to look at international standards and apply them... As far as common services, it has a very nice gym for a hotel in Spain - quite a few pieces of cardio equipment, free weights, nicely appointed with towels and water, etc. The bar downstairs serves some reliable if basic cafe food (sandwiches, salads, some basic entrees). The front desk personnel is nice, though not necessarily very thoroughly trained (you will get wildly different answers from different people to the same question, especially around the internet being slow) Now for the bad: The free wifi service has become really, really horrible - especially on weekdays when the hotel is full. It was ok last year when the hotel was usually emptier but now that they are full a lot of the time, it's just really bad and unusable on weeknights. Coverage is tremendously spotty with some rooms getting very low bars on wi-fi reception. On top of that, the internet connection simply cannot handle a full guest load: consistently over my stay I had the same issue over and over, where it was impossible to pull up any internet sites and would just receive server timeouts between 7 PM and midnight. When I brought this up to the staff I was told several things: that the issue was a group of guests that were tech savvy and were taking the whole bandwidth by changing router settings, that it was a temporary router issue and it would be restarted, that I needed a new ticket number because maybe it was being shared by other people. On the last day, finally, the most experienced person in the front desk admitted (with a shrug, as in \"well, it is what it is and we won't do anything about it\") that the connection always slows down when there's too many people on it. Again the fact that when you bring up the issue they don't take it seriously leads me to believe they will not do anything about it, like getting a bigger line like a T1 or redundant lines separated per floor. It's a shame - this hotel could be the top business hotel for the area (it has little competition nearby) but it just cannot be bothered to solve this simple issue. Considering I was trying to do some work in the evenings, this completely hampered my productivity and again makes it a place you cannot recommend for business travelers. The other issue is location - while this is convenient during the day for me due to my work location, it is really far from anything. There is one bus line outside the door that will take you downtown to Sol in about 30 minutes, and two Metro stations (Avenida de la Paz and Arturo Soria) a 15-minute walk away. But if you are the kind of person that likes something to do in the evenings right outside your door, this is not the place for you. There is a great supermarket in the Arturo Soria shopping center called Sanchez Romero (where you can stock up your little fridge) and a few nice restaurants there as well. It's two blocks away so you can ask the front desk about that Bottom line: if you are a business traveler and you depend on an internet connection to do evening work, in my opinion this hotel cannot be recommended. If on the other hand, you just unplug after a day's work and won't need a connection and are working nearby, I would say it's not a bad place to stay, especially considering the nice gym and the comfortable rooms", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cdefnitely NOT 4* standard\u201d", "Author": "L0nd0njb", "ReviewID": "UR65039062", "Content": "There was very little staff and only a few spoke english.

They spoke okay English and were very accommodating. Someone was knocking on my door various times over the course of an hour my first night there, and there were no peepholes on the door. As a woman traveling alone, I was quite nervous. When I went down to the desk, they just set me up in another room immediately after I explained. I stayed in a superior room as the price difference between standard and superior wasn't huge. The room was big, with a desk, couch, plasma tv, and huge bathroom. I was not impressed at all with the bed...it was extremely hard. So if you're a light sleeper and prefer soft beds, don't stay here. The location was alright. It was a 10-15 minute walk from the Arturio Soria metro station. It took awhile to get into the center by metro...maybe 15-30 minutes but it didn't bother me much. The hotel isn't really around much of anything...a couple restaurants and a little park. There were no vending machines/minibar in the hotel so I would bring some snacks if you tend to get hungry at times when you'd be in the hotel. The gym was small but adequate. It was not crowded at all so I wouldn't let its size dissuade you. I got the breakfast. It was good, but a bit expensive for the quality. I paid 17 euros a day and I think it was worth maybe half that. I think the service was the best aspect of my stay at this hotel and the uncomfortable beds were the worst.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "us", "Title": "\u201cGood, but needs improvement\u201d", "Author": "travelguyUS", "ReviewID": "UR59849006", "Content": "Efficient, clean , comfortable, and well priced.

Free Wifi!\u201d", "Author": "MidwestTravelAR", "ReviewID": "UR36981832", "Content": "PROS: We stayed at Confortel Atrium for 6 nights in late July of 2009. The hotel staff was wonderful, accommodating our every need. They booked us reservations at restaurants, provided us with maps and directions and were extremely accommodating at breakfast. We got the breakfast buffet as part of a package, and it was definitely worthwhile. We originally had a 3 day stay booked, but enjoyed the hotel so much that we booked three more nights. We booked through Orbitz, and this process went seamlessly. We didn\u2019t have to check in/check out again, we just explained to them what we were doing and they gave us the same room. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. It\u2019s a new hotel, when we looked for it on google street view, it was still under construction. There is a computer area for FREE use on the first floor as well as FREE wifi throughout the building. A terrace outside of the lobby was a good place to relax and have a drink. The breakfast area was a really nice room. Some of the seating was designed for only one person and it had personal screens where you could watch news or other tv shows of your choice. The rooms were large by European standards, as were the bathrooms. The room was very well designed, so that you could either watch TV from your couch or you could swivel the TV around so that you could watch it from your bed. This room also has a full length mirror and a safe. Every day we came home to the impeccably cleaned rooms and found several cold, *free* bottles of water in the fridge (free water in Europe!!) I used the blow dryer and it was satisfactory. The air conditioning was fantastic and our room was always cool and comfortable.. The room was pretty soundproof, we heard very little noise throughout our entire stay. The room had a small balcony overlooking Calle Emilio Vargas, but we didn\u2019t use it much. The gym is spacious, well equipped (5 treadmills, free weights, four stationary bikes, two elipticals, other weight machines) and had a nice TV and small clean locker rooms with showers. The hotel is situated between the airport and the city center, so if you are coming from the airport it would be very convenient. The Atocha Renfe station is farther away, and you must take a half an hour metro ride to reach the Arturo Soria metro stop, plus walking from there (or you could take a cab). CON: This hotel had one drawback. We always looked forward to going back to this hotel at night. However, it was a bit of a trek back. The hotel is close ( 5 min walk or less) to a bus route (the 53) that brought us downtown to all the main sites. It IS far from the metro. We personally don\u2019t mind walking so we frequently took the metro and walked 15 minutes home. The metro ride to the center of the city is about 20 minutes. The hotel is also hard to find if you don\u2019t have a map. While it is a large building, most people we asked near the metro stop (which is a very very residential area) could not direct us to the stop. Make sure to have directions in advance, or at least a map and address. This hotel would be good for couples or travelers who plan to stay out and see the city all day. It would also be great for business travelers. We chose the hotel originally because we found a really incredible deal \u2013 3 nights and breakfast for under 200 USD, which is a fantastic deal for all the amenities the hotel offers. The hotel isn\u2019t really close enough that you can come back for a siesta, so if you want a hotel you can frequently return to during the day this is probably not for you.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cUnsafe\u201d", "Author": "frequentflying", "ReviewID": "UR25840070", "Content": "Someone entered my room at night!!!
