Located next to Perisur mall and near to where I am working it is very convenient. The gym is small and not very well equipped, for example the bikes are very old, and the weight machine has 3 stacks for 5 stations, meaning lots of alternating with people if it is busy. Travelling for business, my main beef is that the internet capability is VERY bad. Wireless only and no ethernet backup, the wireless has been basically unusable for 4 days which is unacceptable.

Without exception they are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Since I was only here for two days and had lots of work to do, I ended up eating most of my meals in the hotel. Room service was incredibly quick, the restaurant was very pleasant, and the food was very good. My room was good-sized, and nicely decorated. There are no special or extra touches, you could be in a hotel anywhere, but it was done well. Wireless internet was free and worked well. There were only two drawbacks for me. First is there is only a shower, no tub.....I like a nice hot bath, so that was a bit disappointing. The other reason I marked a 4 instead of a 5 on this category is that the bed was the hardest one I've ever slept on. But neither of these are deal breakers. I would stay here again. One thing I would do differently is request a mountain view room. My room overlooked the road and the shopping mall, and the road noise could be a little loud at night. One other caveat is if you are here as a tourist, it's not really close to any of the sites you probably want to visit, and the city is large and busy enough that traffic becomes a consideration. But the hotel staff will get you a cab or make any other arrangements for you.

The hotel has an open space concept and the surroundings make it unique. If you forget about all the traffic and rush on Periferico Sur, you will realize this hotel is located at the edge of a quiet forested area.

All the staff were very competent and extremely nice. My 3 year old son even told one of them \"you are my friend\" because we had been treated so well. We were first given a room at the front of the hotel, but I thought it would be noisy, so I rang the front desk to ask for a \"quiet room\" and we were immediately moved to one at the back of the hotel. The view from there was fantastic. Since we were there during clear days, we were able to see the \"Ajusco\" volcano and Six Flags Mexico. Our package included a trip to the theme park for my children and we planned to go on the third day of our stay, however they told us in advance that Six Flags was going to close on that day, so we were able to do something else instead, and the following day they arranged the trasportation to and from the theme park. Most of the staff spoke good English and I was delighted to discover that their taxis have seat belts and are driven by excellent drivers. We used two standard taxis from the airport and from the North bus terminal and after the fright I wasn't sure how I was going to get back to the airport to get our flight back to the UK. Luckily the drivers from the Radisson proved to me on several short trips that they could get us in one piece to the airport! They were more expensive than standard taxis but to me they were more than worth it. The food at the restaurant was also great -and well priced. When we visit Mexico we tend to eat at \"Sanborns\" restaurants because we've never been ill and their food is nice. However the food here was superb, and for breakfast they even had a pianist playing all sorts of music, which we certainly appreciated. Another thing I liked was that they even catered for people like me with milk intolerance, so I was able to enjoy cerals with lactose-free milk.

Would highly recommend the breakfast buffet; not free, but tasty and lots of choices.

We got to our room and there was NOT wireless internet connection. The bell boy, the front desk clerk, the Manager and the engineer all got involved trying to solve this problem. The only means of connection is with a dial up system. The engineer was kind enough to configure my lap top so I could use it in the room as I did not have a server in Mexico City.
