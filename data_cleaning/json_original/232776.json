This is how we got there in the end: - Go to Fabra i Puig metro station in Barcelona (on the L1 line) - Get the A4 bus from the bus station directly above the metro station- this comes approximately every 40 minutes. - The bus stops directly outside of the hotel. Ask for a ticket to the hotel, and watch out for the entrance to the Technology Park- the stop is immediately after you turn into the park. You have to request to stop. The village that the hotel is in (Cerdanyola del Valles) is very pleasant and has a lovely bakery near the hotel. There are many bars which do good tapas menus at very reasonable prices. We found the locals to be very friendly although with no English.

If you dont speak spanish be careful. Traveled with ryanair to Girona airport and hires a car from Solmar Car rental. This is a company which I got to know through cartrawler.com. I booked a car through this web site and as I arrived in Girona I found my car waiting for me, exactly as i asked for with a gps and all. I really recomend this company. Stayed at eurostars parc del valles. It is nowhere near the centre of barcellona, as by car we had to drive for nearly half an hour and if you dont have a car there is a walk of nearly 45 minutes to the nearest train station. I found the hotel very comfortable tough as our plan was not just to visit barcellona but also to visit Monserrat, porto avventura, some museums in the area and music concerts and Girona and this hotel was right in the middle of everything. The restaurant and the only restaurant was closed for dinner on certain nights and we were offered dinner in the lounge. One time we ate there but the food was nothing special, dont order veal as well as they serve beef instead and charge for veal steak. The waiter wAS NICE TOUGH The pool is small but nice and clean and the gym is quite old fashioned. Not 4 star to me, more like 2/3. It seems like that the hotel is run with 2 staff members. David and lourdes from the reception. They are exceptional, very nice, efficiant and although they are very busy because they are taking care of the reception, being as porters and even taking care of the lounge bar at the same time -), they go out of their way to help and meet guest expectations. David really helped us a lot and from here I would like to thank him again, especially as he has great knowledge of the area and he speaks english. Again make sure you have a car with a gps if you are going to stay in this hotel or you will waste lots of time walking and finding roads. To eat go to the centre of cerdanola next to the train station called kebab house and they serve very good food and good service and they have got a very nice waitress who speaks english, probably the only one who speaks english in that area, She helps a lot too. one thing I dont understand is why in spain, especially in tourist areas they dont employ people who speak English instead of just Spanish. it was the thing that bothered us most as it made our holiday really hard at times trying to understand people in spanish and they expect us to understand.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cFar from Barcelona, but Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "oliviapulley", "ReviewID": "UR29756984", "Content": "We were so relieved to finally stay at an affordable nice hotel in Spain--with free parking. The big rooms appear brand new--big tvs, huge comfortable beds, funky bathrooms with see-through walls and new fixtures, free internet in the lobby. I would say this is only a 3.5-stars (not 4 as everything claims), given its horrible location in an industrial park far from the train and barcelona and lack of certain amenties that 4-stars have--lots of toiletries, concierge, free shuttles to train, etc. Also, no breakfast included and the gym is really weird and run-down (actually tried the sauna and worried about health & safety and burning the hotel down)--with great cardio machines but like they inherited the rest from a gym that went bust in the early '80s. It's obvious problem is its distance from everything--but the bigger problem is that many tourists seem to choose it and the staff are not very familiar with the bus and train services. We had to rush to make the last bus at 10:30 p.m., seriously cutting out our hopes of Barcelona nightlife. But the front desk made efforts to get us needed information and the bus to downtown leaves from right outside.

But by far the worst aspect is the FOOD, the breakfast was very poor and always stone-cold, and I mean STONE-COLD, how this then gets four stars is beyond me, this wrecked our break. I found a dead fly in my cereal dish, which were dirty having been washed - yesterdays food dried on. The mats on the sun-loungers at the pool were filthy.

The taxi man had a little trouble finding the hotel from the airport and it cost us 39 euros. The hotel itself was very quiet. I think we were one of maybe 20 or 30 guests staying in the hotel. The outside and lobby areas were clean and tidy. The hotel had some redecoration work going on inside on the corridors. The hotel does need a bit of re-modernising but it was fine. The rooms were spacious and the bathrooms were love;y. It has a nice gym that you can use and an outside pool which wasnt open due to it being out of season. We stayed half board and got a pretty good deal. Breakfast was ok and lunch or dinner would have been fab for me only i completely hate fish and thats all that was on the menu. Some of the waitressing staff didnt speak english so i ended up eating bread rolls and a desert for my dinner, and the free bottle of wine! But if you enjoy fish then the food looked amazing. We usually got the bus which was a 5min walk from the hotel into fabra i puig. It cost 1.85 euros. From fabra we got the metro into town for around a euro. The buses were frequent enough but it did take around half and hour. Myself and my partner were there for sightseeing but with the hotel being so far out it was a bit restricting. However we did have a great time and would definately recommend going on the Bus Turistic which takes you on 3 different routes around the city . It is the best way to see it and its cheap enough 23 euros for 2 days. You can get on and off wherever you like. Just to note , all museums are closed on mondays which we were disapointed about and the Tibadado (highest peak in barcelona where you can get a tram from) is only open at weekends!

We have stayed at this hotel a number of times and I just feel that it is hard if near impossible to get better value at any other hotel in Spain.

There is free internet access in what they call 'the internet corner' near reception. Staff could not be more helpful. Reception area is nice and very clean. They have a bar/cafe area at reception which is never very busy. The rooms are large and spacious but definately are far too brown in colour. The airconditioning works well. There is a minibar with spacious fridge in the room. There is also internet access in the rooms but you must pay 22 euro per day for that. The pool is never too busy and the water appears clean. It is quite difficult to find the hotel. It is probably easiest to get to if you head for Sant Cugat and then head for Cerdanyola from there; you should pass the hotel on your way. Cerdanyola itself has very little to offer. There is an Irish bar unfortunately called 'The 1916' there which is very nice.
