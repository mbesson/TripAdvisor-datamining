The room was small but really nicely decorated and had everything you could need eg hair dryer hot water showers etc. I liked it even though paris rooms are small they managed to do as much as they could with it and it felt cosy. Sleeping in the room was a pleasure there was no noise the bed was soft and comfy and we had some great sleeps. We went sight seeing as you do in Paris and as we hadnt a clue where anything was we enquired at the desk. The lady whos name escapes me (shes the owner) couldnt have been more helpful giving us a map, tips on where to visit (including getting off the metro at the stop after the eiffel tower and getting a magnificent view). She also was able to book a resturaunt for us, arrange anything we needed advise us on disney etc. She was fantastic and we cant speak highly enough of her. Always smiling and happy and greeting guests with a warmth you dont get most places. Overall hotel duparc have managed to do a lot with the little space they have and their arent much i can fault it with.

The hotel, though in a busier, bustling area, remained quiet and we felt well rested each night. The only negatives that I might have for this establishment is that it is a bit expensive (but we also learned that PARIS is expensive!) and we had a heinous odour emanating from somewhere in our bathroom on our return to our room on the 3rd day of our 5-day stay. We did notify the gentleman at the desk that night, but were informed that he could not help us as the day staff would need to be notified. The smell was not investigated the next day, but was sooo bad by then that we had to close the bathroom door and leave the window open in order to cope. Having a shower in the stench was a challenge.

I think if you're used to large, American-sized hotel rooms, you will not like any hotel in Europe, where the rooms tend to be much smaller unless you're staying at a 150 euros and up hotel.

The location lives up to the billing: the hotel overlooks a quiet little park (our window opened on to it) so it's not loud, even though it sits just around the corner from the very lively square where Blvd. Edgar Quinet intersects three other streets. The hotel is located in the heart of the Montparnasse neighborhood -- the 14th arrondissement -- on the Left Bank (ie, slightly outside the center city). Not only are there lots of cafes, bars, restaurants and frequent street fairs just outside its door, you're also close to the Tour Montparnasse (which we did not visit) and the Cimeterie Montparnasse (which we did). The Jardin du Luxemborg and the Latin Quarter/Blvd. St. Germain are also within walking distance. The other major selling point when it comes to location is its access to public transit. You are just a block from the Edgar Quinet metro stop and only a five-minute walk to Gare Montparnasse (commuter rail) and the Montparnasse-Bienvenue metro station, which serves several subway lines. We had very easy rides to neighborhoods throughout Paris, including Roland Garros for a day at the French Open. As for the hotel itself: as others mentioned, you do have to walk up two flights of stairs to reach the lobby, which isn't easy with heavy luggage. An elevator from that 3rd-floor lobby serves the rest of the hotel, but it was out half the time we were there. Note: the rooms are pretty small. The double room we were in was a touch cramped for two people and luggage. That said, it was very clean and well kept and featured a fine shower, a small flat-screen TV and air-conditioning. The staff at the hotel was also very friendly. We ate breakfast one day on site, and it was good, though expensive (we preferred going out to the patiserries). There is also one free public internet-enabled computer in the lobby. We would definitely recommend Hotel du Parc. If you're going to spend a lot of time in the room, it may feel small.

I had to cancel one night, the booking system made me forfeit the booking fee of that night, but the owners were willing to transfer that fee to pay for one of the other 5 nights. - The staff were very helpful, always willing to answer questions. - Very good surroundings. With many cafes and restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisine. You'll never starve there. - Updated looks for the rooms. Generally clean and cosy. Good TV programme offerings. - Very close to 3 Metro Stations. This means that you can choose which station to go to as there are many lines in the Paris Metro system. - Breakfast is basically tasty. Not too bad. - Small minimart right opposite the hotel. (Closes at night). - Quiet at night, as it's not facing the cafes and restaurants. - FREE WIFI. Bad points: - There's a long flight of stairs before you get to the reception & lift. Warning for those carrying heavy luggages, and for the elderly who hate stairs. - The lift to your rooms starts at the reception. The lift is SMALL, and dont forget the long flight of stairs even before you get to the lift. - I saw a mouse along the corridor when I was going to my room for the first time. It ran away and I never saw it again during my stay. - The rooms is rather cramped for three people staying in a double room. - There isn't a kettle in the room. No hot drinking water available at night. This means no hot coffee or hot tea at night. :( - FREE WIFI. As it's free, and it's not password protected, it's unstable and may disconnect at times.

This has been our family's preferred area (Montparnasse) for several years; this is the hotel we have re-booked, in fact we booked the dates before we left. Be aware that Reception is one flight of stairs up, not at street level and the lift is tiny but it goes to all floors - from Reception.

If you are too lasy to walk till there, don't worry there is Edgar Quinet Metro station within 200m from the hotel. The personel is very friendly, the rooms are clean and spacious enough. We were impressed to see that we have both bath tub and shower cabin. Maybe the furniture needs a little bit improvement but the bed was big and confortable. The room had an LCD TV, and if you are lucky enough to get a room close to the dinning room, you can have also free WiFi internet connection. Breakfast is also very good (according to french standards). It contains coffee/tea/hot chocolate, one croissant, one baguette with butter and jam and one glass of orrange juice. To reach the hotel from CDG Airport we took the RER B and changed to Metro line 6 at Denfert-Rochereau, until Edgar Quinet Metro Station.
