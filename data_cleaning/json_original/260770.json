The hostel is about 10 minutes walk from the METRO or about 5 minutes from where the No40 bus terminates. We were incredibly impressed by the breakfast in the morning. I have done a lot of travelling and staying in hostels over the last few years and I have to say that it is probably the BEST breakfast that I've had in this sort of place; cereal, toast, croissants and pastries, yoghurts, fresh fruit, juices and coffee.

Breakfast was bleh but included in the price. They put Nutella inside a chocolate croissant WEIRD. You also need to get to breakfast eraly because the seating is limited. The only downside is that the metro is not very close to the hotel. So if you have tons of luggage or are exhausted after a long day of sightseeing, getting to the hotel from the metro is agonizing.

Very clean rooms, along with towels, linen, and a bright atmostphere make this palce a comfortable place to stay for a couple of days at a reasonable price...for Rome. Where my difficulty with this place comes in is when you start talking about it as a hostel. It is obvious that this Hotel has converted some of its larger (and smaller) rooms into dorm-style accomodations in order to drum up some business. This is fine, and the rooms are both bright and large enough (mostly) to accomodate this idea, but they have yet to buy into the rest of the hostel vibe, which can be difficult. There is no secure storage space in this \"hostel\" except for the one safe in each room, the hotel kind with the changable code. That is great if you are by yourself and you get there first, but not so good if you are together with other people or don't get it first. They also do not have luggage storage, and although they are nice enough to let you leave your luggage there, you leave it in the hall, and they do a poor job of monitoring it. The breakfast is good for the price and you can eat as much as you want, which is nice when you are an all-day walker like I am.

May 26th 2011. It was enough. Pros are it is clean, very near to Vatican, nice outdoor terrace on the 5th floor with views, it is an inexpensive price. Cons: No elevator and no one offering to bring bags to your room. Yep, its a walk-up and there is a middle floor they don't count so it your room is on 3 (like ours was), it is really on 4 which is 8 flights of steps up. This may not be a con to some people, but I tell you just as a warning. Other cons: air conditioning is non existent (doesn't work) so windows are kept open at night for air and even 4 flights up, street noise is loud and constant all night. No sleep. Maybe a room that doesn't face the street would be quieter? Something to ask. Bathroom is very small. My 6'3 husband sat side saddle so his knees wouldn't hit into the shower, which by the way is lifted 18 inches or so off the floor with a door opening too narrow for an average size woman to fit thru.A challenge to get into.

(first time we've come across this on our travels) The cons are it can't decide whether its a hotel or a hostel, so you have dorm beds and doubles on the same floor which provides a kind of conflict when young immature travelers staying in the dorms arrive home at 2 in the morning drunk and noisy therefore waking up the occupants of the double rooms who have paid hotel prices in the hopes of a good nights sleep. The other downside is the air con doesn't work (could have been too early in the year) so it was actually preferable for us to leave the window open at night and deal with the street noise as opposed to dealing with the noise in the hallway. There also wasn't enough space for everyone to sit and have breakfast, so there were frequently queues of people waiting to be seated which wasn't ideal.

The weekend we were there, there was a family and one or two couples/ groups in the other rooms on that floor and we never heard a peep out of them.

I'm sure you could be unlucky with revellers, but I've had that experience at 5* hotels...and it's unlikely you'll find many rugby outings here. We didn't opt to stay for breakfast, so can't comment - but we were on a mission to have coffee at as many different venues as possible: why limit ourselves to one? It's part of the fun of being in Rome. Staff are very friendly, multilingual and knowledgeable about the area. And speaking of area, you can not beat this location; 5 minutes from Castel Sant'Angelo and about 10 from Piazza Navona, super close to the Vatican and on the right side of the river for Trastevere.

Unfortunately, being more or less in the city centre, the traffic noise is quite considerable but if you're only staying for a couple of nights it's bearable. We had a room right next to reception on the ground floor. This and the noise was one of the reasons why we couldn't open our windows - a shame. I gather the rooms are varied but ours had only a shower (not a bathroom) and the toilet was across the hall. It was ok, as I said, for 2 nights. The rooms were clean and they even provided toiletries which I wasn't expecting, as it's more of a hostel-type place. The breakfast was excellent but it got quite crowded in the little room where they served it. However, there is the tiniest little balcony which can be accessed from this room and we spent a few hours there every evening, playing cards and enjoying the relative quiet. I really missed the chance to have a cup of tea 'out of hours' as there were no such facilities available. Internet was available with a code from reception and was also provided in the above-mentioned breakfast room. The only thing that I really didn't like about the hotel were the staff.

Now, we've been to many hostels in Europe, and some were pretty horrible. Therefore we were rather apprehensive. We had decided, however, that as long as it was clean and we could feel like sleeping in the room, we'd stay. Hotel Colors turned out to be simple, but comfortable, clean and really good value for the \u20ac75 we paid per night. In fact, we had several pleasant surprises, when we reached the hotel. To begin with, we discovered that the low-budget buss from the airport stops at Piazza Cavour, only a few blocks away from the hostel. Then, although our guide of Rome had told us otherwise, we discovered breakfast was included. It wasn't the best we have ever had, but it was decent enough: coffee, tea, fruits, a large selection of juices, a selection of corns, cakes and bread, as well as cornflakes etc. were served every morning between 8 and 10am. Also, we had no idea that we would be able to go on-line, but here was a free Internet access. One could either connect one's PC or mobile-phone to a network, or use the computer in the breakfast room. Finally, to our astonishment, we discovered that our room was brand-new. We were the first to use it after it had been redecorated and the bathroom constructed. We even had a nice balcony. Needless to say our newly refurbished room was spotless when we arrived. In addition, the room was cleaned every day. In terms of location, Hotel Colors is not in the city center, however, it lies between Castel San Angelo and the Vatican, in a quiet street. Distances in Rome aren't that great: it took us 15mins to walk to Piazza Navona and 10mins to the Vatican. There is plenty of public transport nearby: from Piazza Cavour, via Cicerone and the Vatican. Metro A also stops some 10mins away. On Via Cola di Rienzo, you will find plenty of shops and there are many ristorante and trattoria for your evening meals nearby. The staff was nice and polite, and all of them spoke English. If you just need a clean and quiet place to sleep while you wander around Rome's monuments and don't expect luxuries, Hotel Colors is the perfect choice!

It wasn't a bad place to stay at all. The reason I give this a three circle rating is that, we were able to get a similar standard hostel for less. We paid more than 100 euros for a triple room. While this isnt too much, we were able to get a bit less on a place located near Piazza Barberini which is much quieter, and on the same level of cleanliness. Good points: location which is near the Vatican area, triple room was spacious. Affordable price. Colors is an ok place to stay if you are single and very young- like 18-25 or maybe a bit older, and you really aim to socialize with other travellers but if yu treasure your personal space, you'll only get it inside your room. I am single and not much much older, but I found that there is too much going on here. Too many people with a limited amount of space is a bit overwhelming. Hallways are not very wide, with a computer posted outside. This means that at any given time, there will be somebody there using the computer. Our room was sort of on street level, if not slightly elevated, and we could hear street noise even with windows closed. I do not mind having to share bathrooms as long as it is clean. Well, when i initially checked out bathroom, it was ok and looked clean, however it the shower area was small, even if im svelte (-yah right!) and Asian.

Not touristy, but not in the midle of nowhere either. Close to all the sights by either foot or the nearby metro. The only area difficult to get to is Trastavere, but we did walk there in about 45 minutes and cabbing is always an option. There are some great restaurants (Raf is close, good and dependable) and some great shopping.

On arrival, you'll be presented with a handy guidebook to the city and surroundings containing exactly the kind of unbiased information that you need when exploring a city for the first time. The location is superb: a 5 minute walk from the Vatican and 15 mins from the Centro Storico (by foot). What's more, you're only a couple of blocks from a no.40 bus stop, which connects with Termini station, passing most of the major Roman attractions en route. The nearest metro isn\u2019t far away either. The staff (who all speak excellent English) have a real desire to make your stay a happy one and have ensured that we return at least once a year to reacquaint ourselves with this wonderful city. Colors provides dorm and private accommodation (both with air-conditioning), costing from around 20euros per person per night. This is a little more than some of the hostels around termini but anybody who has stayed at Colors will agree that it\u2019s well worth the extra for location and service. There is a kitchen available for guests to use with complimentary tea and coffee and cornflakes are provided for breakfast. For those who like to be self-sufficient whilst on holiday, one of the biggest and best supermarkets in Rome is just across the road. Back in the hotel, there is a roof garden/terrace where you can enjoy your dinner or a glass of wine on a warm summer evening. All in all, if it\u2019s comfort, value, service and location you\u2019re after (and let\u2019s face it, who\u2019s not?!), then I strongly recommend you give colors a go.
