It was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. The location is great, but that is about the only good thing I can say about it. From check in to check out, it was far from the \"boutique experience\" that Pantages so proudly advertises. The staff were completely indifferent to guest experience. I heard other people complaining as well, so it wasn't just us. At times, the staff were extremely rude. It was so bad and offensive that we complained to the Manager, who in turn offered us free parking. That was nice, but not enough to make me ever want to come back. Our room was clean, but worn. The Pantages website raves of their luxurious jacuzzi tubs, but our jets were broken. Light bulbs were out. When I plugged my hair dryer into an outlet, it blew it up and broke it. All in all, definitely sub-par.

The doorman greeted us by name on our arrival and remembered it- WOW! (good at reading luggage tags because we didn't give him our name), friendly staff on check in and when we went in and out. The hotel has a very small lobby, a nice lounge where you can get breakfast in the morning and in the evening they had a light menu, drinks, live entertainment on the weekends. We enjoyed sitting by the fireplace by the windows, having a drink and dessert while watching the world walking by. Also on the main floor is a 'living room/library' type area where it is quiet and great for small groups to congregate. The rooms are on the 10-17th floors. The rest of the building is condos but the elevators are for hotel floors only. Only a few rooms on each floor so we had no hallway noise. The rooms are spacious with really odd shapes. Lots of light from the windows, but being in downtown in the heart of the city, the views are mainly street or the building directly across. The rooms were well maintained. Standard bathrooms but nice showerhead. Kitchen is well laid out. Washer and dryer in unit. Free wifi. Older style televisions which was surprising considering everything else was so updated. Beds were very comfortable. Pull out couch is fine for kids or teens, not great for adults for sleeping on as the mattress is quite thin. There is a small gym for hotel guests and a very nice spa with hot tub and saunas as well as treatments. The only downside was that on check out, the wonderful attentive staff who had worked all weekend had been replaced with someone with a less enthusiastic attitude. There is no restaurant on site (just the food served at the lounge) but on the corner in the same building is Fran's Diner, an icon in Toronto which has great prices. It has a separate entrance from the hotel. The location is excellent for those wanting to be in the heart of the action (but without the noise we have often experienced staying in other nearby hotels).

I had to actually write to the general manager as his staff were incompetent, insulting and extremely condescending. Here's a story for you: I booked a boutique suite through Travel Sensations valued at $309.00 for 4 guests. I have documentation for this reservation. Upon arrival, I was asked to sign some waivers and was informed that my reservation was correct for the amount and for 4 guests. The woman pointed out that any additional guest(s) will have an extra charge of $50/person. I explained to her that my reservations include the 4 guests so there should not be any additional costs. She clarified it for the second time that the reservation was for 4 guests. Next morning, at the time of checkout I spoke to a gentleman named Ibrahim who surprised me with an amount of $409.00 for the rate of the room. He told me that I was being charged for the extra 2 guests. Astonished, I questioned this charge and all he said was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You signed the papers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even after presenting my reservation documents from Travel Sensations he continued to say that I had signed the papers without providing any explanation. At this point, I asked to speak to the manager. Ibrahim notified me that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was manager on duty but was unavailable as he stepped out. Furthermore to my disappointment, he was unable to tell me when Tom will be back to assist me. I asked Ibrahim to contact me when Tom immediately comes back as I am not authorizing this payment until it is settled in fairness. While waiting for Tom's call, I decided to go back after two hours. To my surprise he was back at reception. After explaining the whole matter to him including the provided documents from Travel Sensations, all he told me was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is this your Signature?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, you signed the papers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How much more clarification do you need?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I not only felt baffled but also belittled as his tone and language was extremely condescending and inappropriate towards any client for that matter. In addition, he stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Personally, if it was me I would have read the papers more thoroughly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After feeling insulted, I asked for his manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number and was presented with the General Manager's contact. After three days I finally got in contact with the General Manager (Mark) who reviewed the case. All he replied to me was \"I have enclosed the adjustment to your credit card and apologize for not making this correction during your check in.\" I am still extremely disappointed with Pantages Hotel as it's not the $100.00 I was concerned about but rather the customer service.

The mattress was rock hard and the pillows were way too big - my back and neck were sore in the morning. In addition, on 2 of the 3 nights we stayed in the hotel, we were awakened by loud people in the hallway. The first night, it seemed to be a group of people who were coming back from the clubs and heading in and out of a room on our floor where someone in the group was staying. The were loud, obnoxious and inconsiderate, but whatever, at least they had a reason to be there. The next night however, it was a group of girls, with one loudmouth in particular. It seems that she thought she knew someone on our floor and wanted to use their bathroom, instead of the ones in the lobby. Since she didn't know what room this \"friend\" was in, she proceeded to knock on every door and call out to the guy to open the door. It was SUPER annoying! At the Cosmo, you are only able to access the elevator with your room card, which felt much safer and kept the rif-raf out.

Also, we woke up with stiff necks and hurting backs from the too big pillows and hard mattresses. We weren't looking forward to our second night. Our second day in Toronto we were going to Wonderland, so we asked for easy, quick directions, which the front desk guy printed off Google Maps (I thought he'd pick the best route) and we ended up taking little side streets in traffic and it took us over an hour to get there...

Before arriving in Toronto, we stayed at a La Quinta Inn, and found that the accommodations were nicer at La Quinta than at the Pantages. This hotel is nowhere near the caliber of the high end chains such the Four Seasons or even more moderate luxury hotels such as Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, etc., We went with another family, and saw a total of 5 of the hotel's rooms, and none of them was great. The hotel is billed as a trendy boutique hotel, and although the decor is modern, much of the hotel was in so-so condition, with badly dented and chipped furniture, frayed sofas, and somewhat dingy hallways. Much of the hotel badly needs repainting. On the 4th floor, the door to the service elevator was kept open and exposed a filthy work area -- hardly what you want to see on the way to your hotel room. The fitness center had no amenities such as towels, nor was it air conditioned on a hot summer day. We also encountered a number of problems in the rooms: air conditioning that did not work; one room with only luke warm hot water. Unless you are a really sound sleeper, noise is another problem: the hotel is located across the street from a large hospital, and there were loud ambulance sirens through the wee hours of the morning. There is also a helipad on the rooftop, and the helicopters fly incredibly close to the hotel, making deafening noise. We also were awakened at 6:15 a.m. one morning when the garbage men decided to empty the large trash dumpsters directly below our window -- it sounded like our room was under attack. There is no concierge at the hotel, and although the staff at the front desk were pleasant, they were able to give only limited information about restaurants and events, and we found that much of the information was inaccurate. To summarize: Pros: Good location. Suites are fairly large; hotel staff were pleasant. Cons: Much of the hotel has a worn and tattered feel. There is a lot of noise at night related to the nearby hospital. No concierge.

We had a rate of $175 plus 16% tax. We thought parking was a bit expensive at $32 plus tax ($4) plus tip ($10), though they did allow us to stay parked after check out so we could do some shopping. They also stored our luggage for a few hours. Staff was very helpful and friendly. There is no pool and the lobby is quite small.

Service was excellent, from the valets to the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff - we were treated to friendly, efficient service at all times.

My old eyes had a hard time seeing well enough to get my make-up on straight. We were in room 1601 which had very cool views from two different sides. It had an entrance hallway, and then another hallway leading to the main part of the room. It had no kitchen facilities, but, strangely, had a washer and dryer. I can't imagine someone needing laundry facilities that wouldn't also benefit from a kitchen; however, we didn't require any of it, so it wasn't an issue for us. The room had an iPod doc, which was a nice touch. A couple of times, we heard helicopters landing on the roof of the hospital next door, but we found it more interesting than annoying.

Then we heard the maid outside our door so were waiting for her to knock so we could let her in and leave.....we had the sign on the door. Well, she left the floor after cleaning all the other rooms so we had to call and have her come up to do ours. The second problem involved a gift basket my husband had sent to us from a local florist that the hotel did receive but because my last name was missing one letter they didn't put 2 and 2 together to realize it was for us. Instead of calling the florist to ask about it or send it back they put it in the hotel fridge and there it sat until I returned home 2 days later.

The hotel was clean and my room was confortable and spacious. I was on the 12th floor and had a room facing lively Younge Street which was a bonus.

Check-In - Professional and seconds rather than minutes. Full marks. Room - The room was spacious and clean. However some of the fixtures and fittings did look a bit tired.

The bathroom was nothing special and can be compared to any standard hotel room. There were plenty of room for luggage and clothes therefore no problems there. The mini kitchen was excellent and I was a solo traveller and could spend a little less money on takeaways. Just be aware of the stocked food.

The corridors and lifts have purple and lime lighting, which to be honest there is no need for it. I can see what they are trying to do with the hotel, however in truth, it is another appartment style hotel in a tourist City spot.

Issue - No issues really, appart that the rooms do NOT have a safety deposit box, which I would expect in a 4* property. There are ones near the reception area that were kept in a unused staff room type. I used one and had no problems, but just to make you aware. Also they advertise a 27\" Flat TV.

We booked the hotel for a Friday night on the 20th since all other places were too expensive or had no vacancies for Valentine's day weekend (that's what you get for booking the night before). We got a really good deal through a corporate promotion and were excited since all the pictures we saw of the hotel were promising. Let me also get one thing straight before I continue. I am the kind of person who only visits 4+ star hotels. I like my hotels to be modern, but comfortable, in a great location and I expect to be treated like a valued guest everytime. Upon entering the hotel, the first thing I noticed was the lack of people, both guests and staff. I checked in around 3 pm and except for a very bored looking doorman and two chatty with-each-other receptionists, there was no-one else there. Checking in took some time since the two staff behind the counter just HAD to finish their personal chat before even bothering to notice me. Once I got their attention though, I was met with what I can only call disdain. Sorry to interrupt your conversation but yah, I'd like to check into my room please. Any question I asked was met with a \"DUH\" kind of look and answer. The lobby to the elevator was very dark and I had some difficulty getting there without knocking my bags into something (no bell hop came to my rescue though). However, once I stepped into the room, I was very happy. We got a deluxe room with its own kitchen and king sized bed. The view wasn't great, but at least we were above the construction happening across the street. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean, beautiful and with all the amenities I wanted (including a stereo with iPod dock). There was more room in there than I knew what to do with and the furniture and decor were exactly to my taste. The kitchen and fridge were well stocked though somewhat pricey. Later on in the evening, the bed was turned down when we returned from dinner. But when I noticed I forgot toothpaste and phoned down to the concierge for some, it took them over an hour and another call to get it to the room. Checking out was easy enough though I was met with the same boredom and total lack of friendliness that I'm used to from other 4 and even lower star rated hotels.

Even more alarming was the management response that they 'couldn't' change shower curtains between every guest. Why not ? Sure, we all want to preserve the environment, but they presumably change the sheets. The manager wrote to say they were taking up the problem with relevant heads of department. - but the solution is in the hands of management.

In October 2006 my wife and I were getting married. We were looking for a nice hotel at a decent price where we could spend our wedding night. After checking a number of hotels, we were very satisified with the Pantages (in terms of price, room size, layout, etc...), and decided to book it at least 3 months prior to the actual night we needed it. Everything seemed to be in order, I even received an email from the Manager a week before our stay saying that everything was taken care of, and I had more important things to worry about then the hotel. On Wedding Night, we arrived at the hotel and recevied the keys to a room not the one we had selected. I asked if this was the same room, and the front staff said it was 'similar'. When we got to the room there was nothing similar about the room. I called back down to front desk and was told that someone had taken the room we had wanted, and left their belongings which meant that the hotel staff could not remove it. At this point I was thoroughly disgusted. I will admit that the hotel manager did get on the line with us and said he would do whatever it took to make us feel better. He said he would comp us for the room, however, that really wasn't what we were looking for. Eventually we ended up going to the Cosmopolitan which is a sister company of their's (which they comped), but the whole experience left us very bitter. After returning from our honeymoon I sent the Manager an email stating how dissapointed I was in their service and the fact that I never even received an apology letter. She did send me an apology letter after and called me as well to tell me how sorry she was, but it wasn't enough. It's been more than a year since this incident has happened, and the experience still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The desk clerks were more than happy to assist me and were very friendly but you could just tell they didn't have the resources to help their guests. It appears the management decided that they would rather put their money in this ugly mesh netting that separates the bar from the entrance way than to hiring enough staff to accomodate this overly high-priced hotel. 2. The bar layout was ok before, but this time it looked like they hired some 10 year-old to move the furniture around... it looked like a garage sale. I could barely tell where the bar started and the hotel ended. As my title suggests this was the trend of things to come. 3. The room was medicore at best, clean and accomodating but on my way upstairs I ran into a older woman with a yappy dog who decided it was ok to bark at my briefcase. 4. I thought that I would head downstairs to the bar and was met by the most pretentious bartenders in the world. This blonde bartender whome I will not name was less than customer service oriented and was more concerned with talking about guests behind their back and feeling it was ok to talk down to the customers. He never once said a word to me while serving me! Talk about stone cold \"I'm better than you\" attitude. 5. I couldn't take this wanna-be high end hotel for more than one night and just had to pack my stuff and leave. Thank goodness that I found better hotel service and a more comfortable room right down the street (AT 1/3 the cost mind you!) If you ask me about Pantages... it appears the staff are well trained (except the blonde one behind the bar, if you see him go down the street to the Senator, it's cheaper and better).

Hotel is a very solid 3 1/2 to 4 star hotel. Concierge had champagne in the room (wife's birthday) and also arranged a car pick up for my mife and I at the airport. You don't need a car in Toronto. Check in was a breeze, although the lobby area is a very small space... on a busy weekend, I can see how the entrance could become very crowded and check-in could become frustrating as others here have complained. We had a standard room with a very comfortable King bed. Bathroom is small, but I'd have to guess that the hotel rooms are probably converted studio apartments. We had no use for the kitchenette but it could be a nice touch for others. Location is exceptional. One block from the Eaton Center and literally 200 feet from the Canon Theater where we watched Wicked. Everyplace we went during the weekend was within a 20 minute walk. For those looking for places to eat -- the best meal we had during the weekend was at the Pure Spirits Oyster House in the Distillery District. Spent an afternoon in the Pantages Spa which was very relaxing. Not quite a 5-star spa but very worth the $$. Downsides -- the Martini bar is nice but expensive and the hotel doesn't have enough staff in the bar if it is crowded. There is no hotel restaurant - therefore no free continental breakfast like many hotels - so you have to include the cost of breakfast into your budgeting. Didn't bother us at all, but it is worth knowing. The hotel does have a door directly into an adjacent very nice diner - but it is separate from Patages. Overall, I didn't want to spend the $250-$300+ a night to stay at the SoHo, Four Season, Le Germain, etc. We had no problems with our stay and at $200 a night, I'd return to the Pantages Hotel without any concnerns.

It didn't work. After contacting the hotel directly I booked lodging and accommodations for a group of seven adults from August 12-August 13, 2006. I was quoted rates for 2 Ambassador Suites, equipped with 1 King bed and 1 Queen sized pull out couch per room. One room was to accommodate 4 adults, the other 3 adults. Rooms were to be on the same floor, and in very close proximity to each other, with the possibility of 1 room in between the 2 suites. Base rate for the suites was $299 per room at double occupancy, with a $35 per adult fee charged for additional guests to cover the cost of additional toiletries, linens and bedding. My first irritation occured when I found out the online specials/packages they had posted didn't apply as I'd booked via phone. When I explained that the site wouldn't let me complete reservations, the reservations clerk told me it was because my request was complicated. Putting 7 adults in 2 suites that each accomodate 4 people doesn't sound complex to me...but whatever....the website looked great, and I was hoping this was just an anomoly. When we arrived at the hotel things declined more quickly than I can even describe--here's a *short* list of the issues: 1.Upon arrival, well past the guaranteed check-in time of 3:00PM rooms were unavailable and I was informed that a city-wide sellout for available rooms was in effect due to several major conferences. I had no choice but to wait. 2. My party was forced to wait more than 3 hours to be outfitted with rooms, and was offered no alternative or temporary arrangement while waiting. Literally we were sitting in lobby disheveled and travel weary from our trip to Toronto. 3. Car had to be valet parked with luggage in the vehicle as room wasn't ready at advertised check in time. Retrieval of luggage was not assisted; I had to carry bags the distance from parking garage to rooms. 4. Rooms were to be on the same floor. Rooms were on the 14th and 16th floors. 5. Housekeeping was still in room at time of entry, just before 8:00PM. 6. King beds were booked, queen beds were provided in both rooms. 7. Suite with 3 guests had bath linens & toiletries for 2. Suite with 4 guests had bath linens and toiletries for 2, bathrobe for 1, 1 extra pillow provided 8. Though all seven guests were recorded, 2 room keys per room were provided. 9. All reservations booked under single name, yet front desk refused to communicate room number to other room. 10. Linens for pull out bed were shoddy and worn--topped with a faded acrylic throw. Hardly the luxurious 400 thread count linens mentioned multiple times in marketing materials and on your website. 11. Rooms were significantly smaller and less furnished than depicted in online tour and photos and descriptions. 12. Room for 4 was very unkempt and notably devoid of most furnishings: a. No bar stools provided b. Artwork & mirrors missing--hanging studs exposed c. No end table d. In-room services binder was defaced and scribbled in e. Phone was missing all marker keys (no idea which button controlled which function) f. Door handle/lock on bedroom was broken g. Carpet was stained and dirty throughout As soon as I became aware of these problems, I reported them to hotel management, who personally observed the described problems. Situation was also explained to the general manager, who was on vacation at the time, as soon as possible. None of these representatives were able to offer any sort of restitution or apology--and most hotel representatives acted as though I was out of order. I am sickened that I paid $800 to such an unhospitable, poorly run facility for rooms that were occupied for less than 12 hours.

At check-in the staff member was courteous but not over friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this seemed to be a common theme during our visit. We always got the impression from the staff that they were not overly interested in assisting you. The reception area is quite small. The hotel bar is adjacent to the reception. The bar is very small and there is no real distinction between it and the hotel reception/lobby. You get the impression that there was not much imagination put into the design/layout of this area. There is no restaurant/breakfast facilities in the hotel but Fran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner is part of the hotel building. The food is good here and they serve breakfast. However for an excellent breakfast at good prices check out the Sunset Grill at 1 Richmond Street West (5 minute walk). On entering our room we were very disappointed. We both thought it looked \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. All the rooms/suites have a European Kitchen with cooker, washer etc. Some people might find these facilities useful during their trip but we thought they took away from the overall look of the room. In addition you have to listen to the fridge all night. When you are in the room it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to shake the feeling that you are in a kitchen with a bed in it.

They also have call girls that live there which quite honestly bothers me. I know I'm a prude...but to me its uneasy to see prostitutes walking about. Also, there was a hustler magazine under our bed when we checked in. I'm sure it was just something that the house keeper missed but just the cover was pretty raw. We did go to the spa and loved it. The people were super nice and it was reasonably priced. I understand that this is a separate business though, ran by different management. They do have a suana and a work out room, but of course you have to pay extra to use them. My boy friend then realized he forgot his tooth brush. Just about every hotel we have been to has cheap toothbrushes that they will give you if you forgot yours. Not this hotel we were told that they were sold in their store (they have conveince type store on the first floor) we go in there and of course there are the cheapy toothbrushes that every other hotel would give you free with a price tag of $6. I ordered breakfast from room service one morning I got a cup of hot chocolate and and pancake and egg meal. The pancake and egg meal was 16$ the hot chocolate was $8 and then there was a $4 room service fee and of course the girl wanted to be tipped. Bottom line everything thing is extra in this hotel. This hotel had a lot of nice features. Eager staff, clean rooms (for the most part) and a realxing atmosphere. However, next time I visit Toronto I will stay with another hotel.

The website looked great, and I had read good reviews when they opened. My friend and I worked to book 2 (adjoining) Ambassador Suites, and 2 spa treatments per person. Arriving on Saturday, and leaving on Sunday, it seemed simple enough, and we booked directly with the hotel, as their website wouldn't accommodate such a complicated request. When we were on our way on Saturday, we called to let them know that border traffic was especially heavy, and what was the policy if we were late. We were informed that there would be no refund, and that all spa services were booked solid so there would be no rescheduling. We were also told that *I* called and cancelled my own 2 appointments. WHAT?! We arrived right as our appointments were scheduled to begin. All of the spa services were nothing special, and a few of the girls complained that their manicures/pedicures were done poorly. One girl even was given a blister due to overzealous filing! Another nail technician spent the whole time lamenting about the other technicians. Very classy. After our appointments were done at 5pm, we were told that only ONE of our rooms was ready. And that they were on two different floors, not adjoining as we had requested. After waiting an additional 2 hours, our 2nd room was *ready* at 7pm. The staff blamed a fire alarm early in the day, in addition to the recent airport security issues as to why our room was delayed. They then offered ONE DRINK at the in-hotel martini bar as compensation. Again..WHAT?! The second room (which we waited forever to get into) was terrible. This Ambassador suite had a ton of damage to it, which I suspect was the reason for the delay. It was missing furniture, wall hangings, a phone, working interior door locks, and working outlets. Though we paid $40 extra *per person* for 4 people to be in the room, it was not prepared that way. We were provided with 2 towels, hardly any tolietries, and no extra pillows for the pullout bed. The hotel services booked was also marked up with black marker, showing that local calls were no longer complimentary. A 30 second call to a restaurant up the block cost us $1.44. Sizewise, it was way too small to be called a suite. After complaining to the front desk several times, we were told the head manager was out of town until this coming Wednesday, and that we should call back then. No room change or credit was offered, as the excuse now was that the AIDS conference was opening that evening, and the hotel was booked solid. We spent $1500 in less than 24 hours, and while booking 3 months in advance, were still treated terribly.

A stay there proved that if you have a choice of great service or a cool-looking place, then take the hotel with great service. The Pantages is cool-looking, but the service is poor. I should've realized the reputation of the hotel, when I got in the cab at the airport, said Pantages Hotel, and the driver said \"never heard of it.\" The counterpart of that was each time I asked for directions at the front desk, they said \"never heard of it.\" There is no concierge, so you just take your chances that whoever is then at the front desk may be of some help. But, they had no street map, no guide/map for the streetcar system, and didn't know where major tourist attractions were located. My prime gripe was that the promised \"suite\" is a hotel room. There is no separate sleeping area, it's one room. There too was no pull-out couch, or any place for a rollaway in their \"deluxe suite.\" So, my kid had no where to sleep, and my wife and I expected a suite to have a wall or divider of some sort for our sleeping area. When I tried to get this remedied by the knowledgeable front desk, the first person I spoke to said 'shouldn't be a problem.' I went back to the room, discussed it with my wife, and when I came back to the desk, a new person was on duty. They said 'no way.' I rented a larger room, but the front desk said that my reservation for the so-called \"deluxe suite\" already had been charged to my credit card, and they were unwilling to refund any of that. My thought was that all three of us would move into the larger room, and give up the smaller \"suite.\" The hotel's idea was to charge me for two rooms, which they did. I will say that the housekeeping staff was excellent, and our rooms always were kept very nice. The location is good, but the parking is not good, and there's precious little space in the lobby. They have no business center, no pool, no coffee shop, and the internet station in the lobby has a keyboard from a ten-cent rummage sale. Just to make my 5 night stay memorable, the A/C quit. When we came back from sightseeing, the room was hot. We called the helpful front desk, and reported the outage. Then, we went out for dinner and some evening activities. When we returned at 11:30, nothing had been done. I called the desk, and asked why no one came to repair it, and they had no idea. They said they'd call back. About 10 minutes later, they called, not to arrange for the repairman to come up, but to offer to move us to another room - at 11:45 p.m.! Packing and moving @ midnight was not a welcome offer, when they'd had the entire evening to have someone fix the problem. Also, twice during our stay, our electronic keys quit working. Sure, they re-coded some new keys for us, but that was after we'd gone up to our room, realized we were locked out, go back to the desk, then come back up with the 'new' keys. When I stay in a luxury hotel or a boutique hotel, esp., on a vacation, I expect excellent service. Many hotels are nice buildings, but for me, it's all about the service. If they don't take good care of me and the family, then that negatively impacts my vacation.

The rooms were well appointed, with comfortable beds and beautiful bathrooms, but I've never in my life seen a more overpriced mini-bar....in fact, it seemed the hotel was constantly trying to take more money out of my pocket. Parking was a steep $35/day, and don't be fooled by the fact this is a 'spa hotel'. In order to use the sauna in the spa, I was charged $17! The spa seems to operate as a very seperate business, so I feel the description is a bit misleading. Other staff we met included the parking valet and the bellhop - again none of them met us with any charm or panache. It felt like we were disturbing them from something else they'd rather be doing....And I'm not being an old fogey re: this - I'm only 32!

We were very dissapointed to find the room so poorly put together with very noticeable worn furniture and accessories, especially the rug by the bed it was a scary looking thing.The room is not like the pictures advertise on the website or as great as the reviews written. The room and bathroom was clean. The bed was very hard and the bedding were less than acceptable for a boutique hotel, we travel a lot for business and pleasure and often stay at boutique hotels for the quality and unique service, this was not the case. We booked a couples massage at the spa and found the price was fair and the attendents were friendly. After the first night sleeping on the uncomfortable bed we decided to check for a room at the Le Germaine even if it meant forfeiting our payment for the 2nd night. Unfortunately there was no vacancy. On the day of our check out we had to leave at 6am to catch a flight at the airport to our next destination in the United states, the clerk at the front desk insisted on calling a cab to the airport for us and told us it was a better rate because of the hotel (even though there were cabs across the street from the hotel). What great service we thought and decided to take him up on his offer, and of course when we arrived at the airport we ended up paying $15.00 more than average (no meter running btw). After arriving at our next hotel and after unpacking our suitcases we realized we had left our electric toothbrushes and bath products behind. I called the Pantage and asked if they could mail just the toothbrushes to my home address at my expense, to my dismay I was told housekeeping had no items in the lost and found. I was shocked and ask if they could check again, and I was told the room was already occupied and anyways there policy was to turn in all items into lost and found (Definately not in this case!). I emailed the Pantage management of this experience and only to receive a reply a week later from the head of housekeeping stating they found nothing in the room and they have returned electric toothbrushes to there guests in the past. Yes, we lost two toothbrushes costing $160.00 each and obviously someone needed them more than we did. Also the Pantage management was less than helpful and courteous!

I think to be fair, the staff performance were satisfactory or good during my stay, for Canadian standards. There is of course room for improvement with regards to customer service there, which often involves a lot of fine tuning and proper training of staff. Security is important. The staff checked whether I was hotel guest whilst I was using the free internet in the lobby. Hotel floors can only be accessed after inserting the hotel room card in the lift, which did not work in the last 2 days of stay. The surrounding streets and the hotel, being right across from Massey Hall and St. Michael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital, are well lit; although downtown has a lot of people on the streets still. Toronto is relatively very safe compared to other North American cities. Check-in was quick and smooth; the lobby was hip with seating on both sides of the fireplace. Serenity suites (without the kitchen appliances) were on the 5th floor, closer to the spa I guess. I had 1416, probably quieter the higher up. The regular suites are very well equipped except there was no safe: magazines, daily newspaper, hairdryer, well stocked fridge, microwave, dishwasher, different dishes/bowls, glasses, wineglasses, linen, sink, faux granite kitchen counter with stove, coffee/tea maker, washer/dryer, iron/iron board, 2 bar stools, and some fake apples. Storage was ample. There was for sure enough room to walk around in, with a custom desk/sofa unit close to but not right against the window drapes. The lighting were appropriately positioned. The bed was queen sized, with quality linen and lots of big pillows. The floor was hardwood laminate, but very clean. The suite resembled the build quality in some Toronto Condos. There were some scuff marks on the laminate furniture and walls. But overall, very clean. Being a downtown hotel, there is bound to be some noise from the streets, namely sirens, which is unavoidable in any big city, no matter how well insulated the windows are. There was the expected fridge noise not too far from the bed. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflatscreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (CRT) TV was good sized with all the channels from Rogers Cable. I did try out the in-hotel gym which was quite new and had a view to the east.

Everything was fine up until the following night when we returned by car to the hotel at around 11:15 pm, and again, there was no valet.

Again, there were cars in the small driveway which left no place to leave the car so while my boyfriend double parked I went inside to talk to the front desk to request someone to come out to park the car. The man at the desk barely loked up and told me the valet goes home at 11 pm. He rudely told me to leave my car where it was and someone would eventually move it. I told him that I was double parked and I was not comfortable leaving the car where it was. He then SNAPPED at me - barking sarcastically \"that's why we have a driveway\". I couldn't believe how rude it was. When I told him that there were cars occupying all the spaces, he didn't seem to care, and told me to park the car accross the street until someone could come out. This hotel is in a dangerous area of downtown Toronto, and I was not about to leave the car unattended for an undetermined amount of time - he got very annoyed, threw a ticket at me and with a raised voice finally agreed to park my car. He came outside and by this point, there was a free spot in the driveway so my boyfriend had just pulled in. He looked at me and accused me of lying about being double parked! It took all that I had inside of me to keep calm because my blood was boiling. When my boyfriend asked him if there was a problem, he was equally as rude to him. He threw us a card for the general manager and told us to talk to him if we were unhappy. We certainly plan on doing just that, but I'm not sure it will accomplish anything.

I was attending at conference at Marriott Eaton Centre but chose to stay at this hotel based on previous positive reviews. We're so glad we did! The Marriott is lovely but Pantages is really special. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the attention to details is wonderful. The decor is hip and contemporary yet warm and soothing. Retro furnishings, black and white photography, frames of bubbling water, soft lighting, wood and Zen touches define the lobby and hallways. A cozy nook in the lobby, with fireplace, is a great place to have an evening cocktail. We really enjoyed the restaurant, Fran's, which offered a varied comfort food menu as opposed to the more formal offerings at bigger hotels (many great restaurants just a stroll away on Elm Street). The staff in the restaurant and hotel were very friendly and efficient. Andy was very knowledgable and helpful with restaurant selections. The lobby also offers a mini-market that is stocked with great little nibbles, including an ice-cream freezer. We stayed on the Serenity Floor which was perfect for us. We did not require the \"suite\" amenities. We really appreciated the cleanliness of hardwood (laminate, actually) floors vs. dusty carpet. The room offered an air purifier, a large vase of tall twigs with a lit, quartz water fountain at their base(great night light), super comfy bedding, TV tucked into an armoire, CD player, separate shower and hydro-tub, beautiful Asian style sink, dimmer lights, wonderfully scented bath products, fluffy towels...it just goes on and on. We liked the unique touch of placing semi-precious stones on our pillows instead of chocolates (bought our own Cadbury's in the mini-market). The robes were thick and warm, something I really appreciated when I came down with a cold during our stay. The Serenity Floor hallways were scented with good quality aromatherapy fragrance...very light and pleasant. I also took advantage of the beautiful spa and enjoyed a great massage. Our room also included full or continental breakfast at Fran's. The full breakfast selection was fine but the continental breakfast offered, among other naughty pastries, an amazing apple streudel. The hotel's location is very convenient though the block it faces is somewhat glum. We were not disturbed by city noise, including the hospital located across the street.

However once one settles in - it becomes apparent that corners were cut at every opportunity with it's cheap bathroom fixtures, hollow doors, low quality laminate flooring, shoddy messy construction and (while a kitchen in your room can be a good idea) the Goldstar microwave, Citizen TV and Danby fridge are bottom of the line. This hotel has obviously not thought through the needs of the traveller and only concentrated on attempting a NYC boutique feel. A phone, but only on the desk far from the bed - inconvenient for wake up calls. No clock radio so you have to rely on hotel wake up calls which are not reliable at all. Dark, jumpy elevators which scratchy repetitive music - same sound track on repeat every hour it seems.

As usual, the reviews on TripAdvisor were spot on. So, let me give you the good bits: * Good location - not in the entertainment district - but after exploring this area found it rather seedy anyhow. The location of the hotel was just right. The eaton centre was just across the road; bars across the road; theatres next door etc. Really just right. * Great Hotel - this really is a boutique hotel (even though some reviewers seem not to agree). The price was super (booked via Expedia and paid \u00c2\u00a360 per night). The amenities were superb - great gym; extensive tv and film selection; nice comfy bed; nice bathroom; everything in the room (and I mean everything! e.g. from chopping board to iron to CD player to dishwasher to dish cloths to washer/dryer!! - everything!). Free internet in the lobby was a real plus and really didn't need to be provided. * Breakfast is included - we took the cooked breakfast at Fran's next door (they have an agreement with the hotel so that the breakfast is provided free to guests). However - my goodness, I've never seen so many miserable waiters/waitresses in my life. When they knew we were from the hotel, they just couldn't be bothered and the service was awful. Not sure why as the guests tip them - having said that, I tipped every day and that is probably my biggest regret! BUT - nice to have a great breakfast in the deal. All in all, I'd certainly stay there again. It was a differently nice hotel, certainly better than a stuffy old Toronto 5 star hotel. (oh and by the way - didn't hear much at all from the hospital - I think some people have sensitive earing.

On one major point, though, I think other reviewers have been overly harsh. The room we were given is in the Serenity Suite and is across the street from a downtown hospital, St. Michael's. But the two nights we were there, we didn't hear a single siren. Indeed, we didn't even hear all that much street noise, which is amazing, considering that Shuter is a fairly busy downtown side street. PLUSES Extraordinarily comfortable (and spacious) bed, probably one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in at a hotel. Big plus. Also nice to have other furnishings -- not just a bed and a desk and a nightstand. There was a chaise longue-type chair on one side of the room and a sofa-type piece set into the desk unit by the window. Terrific location (in the south-central part of downtown near Elgin & Winter Garden Theatre, Eaton Centre, and Dundas Square, and right across the street from Massey Hall), just a block walk from the Queen Street metro station. Extensive cable TV channel selection. Not the largest bathtub in the world, but the water pressure was right and the water temperature was always hot, which was a huge plus. As mentioned above, relative lack of street noise for such a central urban location. MINUSES Harried (seemingly understaffed) and sometimes sloppy desk service -- they are more than somewhat scattered and, although they are apologetic for their lapses, it's irritating to arrive at the hotel to check in after a long day to discover that the front desk is claiming that your reservation was cancelled. Parking when you first arrive is a confusing ritual. There is no clear signage on the front of the building indicating where parking is supposed to occur. The parking is done by valet but that is not evident from either signage or activity outside the building (unless you happen to see a valet actually moving a vehicle). The street is quite busy until after 10pm and it's not a simple procedure to pull to the curb and run inside to ask for the valet. A stack of goodies sitting on top of the fridge and inside that look tempting but are all sealed and come with a hefty price tag -- $4.95 Canadian for a bottle of Coke that you could get for $2 from a vending machine is ridiculous (and that's just one example). No glasses in the room anywhere (except a couple of decorative glasses sitting on a shelf as part of the desk unit), and the front desk seemed mystified by our request for a bucket of ice. Shower was very roomy and sleek, but the water took five minutes to heat up. All in all, the room was handsome and impressive, but in terms of conveniences versus appearance, the hotel is weighted too far toward the latter at the cost of the former. It's nice to have hardwood floors and bubbling fountains inside bamboo floral settings, but it's nicer to have efficient room service and some of the basic amenities that you would find in a Motel 6.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cWe can't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "RetiredGrandma08", "ReviewID": "UR3760330", "Content": "We arrived from Rochester on the ferry early at 12 noon - they had a room ready so we could immediately check in (check-in is usually 3:00 PM).

Very easy to get to if you are flying into Pearson. Has a full service spa on the 5th floor that is open from 9am to 10pm weekdays. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in town.

This was to be a \"getaway\" weekend for me and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. I had read some good reviews on the spa and hotel, and thought- let's give it a try. It was a terrible experience. The biggest problem with the Pantages is that they have great ideas, but are unable to implement with class and consistency. The Serenity Room, which is more expensive that the regular rooms, is not only smaller, but missing most of the \"amenities\" that are standard in the other rooms. Our bathroom had 7 lights, 3 of them missing the covers, so the room was turned into a bright, harsh, sterile white room when the lights where on. There was no dimmer. I actually took out some of the light bulbs. Taking a bath in the Jacuzzi tub was not relaxing, unless all lights were off. The WORST part of the hotel was this- Saturday morning we are awakened at 8:00 a.m. to the sound of hammering. It went on and on and on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Horrible way to wake up. Especially in a room we paid more for and was touted for it quiet atmosphere. That night we tried to change rooms. The woman at the front desk told us wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if there would be construction the next morning, but there might be. We could switch rooms/floors. I talked to my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e about it, and we went back to the front desk to get the new room. The woman was gone, and the man there said, No, we have an emergency going on (flooding), so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move you. I pointed out that the woman said we could and we did NOT want to wake up to construction (not related to the flooding on one floor). He became irritated with me and told me he would call our room if he could do it. No call. Lo and Behold\u00e2\u20ac\u00a67:00 a.m. Sunday the drilling starts!!! I call downstairs- and the front desk says- sorry, it was scheduled! We packed up immediately to leave. At the front desk, we said it was unacceptable to have construction going on that affects of all floors, a floor that is all about peace and quiet! Not only that, we were never told upon check-in that this would be happening. The Director of Finance came out to talk to us- I wanted a refund. She said we had to understand that they had an event on the floor below us the next day, so they had to get it ready. What? I HAVE to understand??? I said, you never gave us the option of not staying on that floor, you never informed us. She offered the following: Attempt 1: a discount on another stay or $100 off. I told her that was a joke. Attempt 2: 50% off. ONE NIGHT I told her that was unacceptable Attempt 3: 50% both nights. Still not ideal, but I was tired of this at that point. We left and will not go back. I did not mention to her that we used the hotel for work travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I wanted her to do the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing without pulling that out.

Cool! two tvs, laundry facilities, dishwasher, full fridge/freezer, cooker, kitchen sets, separate lounge and bedroom .... overall excellent hotel room layout especially for a frequent business traveller or family or two couples to stay in. So we entered the suite and it was freezing, we were reassured that it would warm up, but for the whole two days we were there the thermometer persisted to stay below 16 degrees and the heater would turn it self off after 10 minutes in operation after being reset. The first morning was hell because we woke up and the temperature was below 10 degrees in the room ... we were not satisfied with the resolution to this issue as everytime we would call they only response was it will heat up after reset ! and on top of being frustrated about catching a cold someone was kind enough to knock on our door and give us a small quartz stone the size of my toe to help relax us ... yes a stone. The restaurant downstairs is not overpriced and is really good too and cater for a variety or tastes. but dont rely on the complimentary breakfast to fill your hunger in the morning. Overall a bad experience, we had a good time as we didnt let the lack of life support facilities ruin our weekend, but the hotel really need to fix some things up and pay more attention to giving better service.

It had been a long drive to Toronto so I had to make a run to the bathroom, and having stayed at many upscale hotels, I was interested to find that there was no toilet paper holder in the bathroom, the roll was simply placed on top of the toilet...it still baffles me, how much do those things cost anyways? Another thing that bothered me was that there was no complimentary bottled water in the room, I have always thought this to be standard in a five-star hotel, I assumed wrong again!
