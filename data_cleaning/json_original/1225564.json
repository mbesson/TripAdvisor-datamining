All the people working there do their best to make feel you confortable and indeed they did it. In the room, you will find two tv\u00c2\u00b4s an iron, a little frigo and a cofee maker. The bed is king size and is very confortble. The only but are the pillows, are not super confortable but you have plenty. If you want to visit Montreal, maybee this is not the hotel, since is very far form all the atractions, I mean you can go to the downtown by bus and metro, but yes, is kind of far. But if you are going to have bussines in the zone, or you are on transit this is the hotel!, Is like 5 minutes from the airport.

The lobby area is impressive and spacious, same is true for the dining area. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was the equivalent of an apartment. Huge space, well appointed furnishings, and yes the laminate floors are truly special. The only negative is that it is situated in an industrial area, so no views or impressive location.

The bathroom was a bit more dated, but still had some nice touches to show that the property was very well maintained. The reception desk staff were very pleasant, and are fully bilingual. One poor young agent at the front desk was being treated very badly by someone on the phone (not a guest!), and yet she maintained her cool and was very polite. When the phone call ended, she greeted the people in front of her as if she was having a wonderful day and happy to see them - very professional, I was impressed. We stayed here specifically for the Park, Stay, and Go! 7 day package that they offer. They also offer a 14 day parking option. This hotel was maybe a bit more expensive than some of the others near the airport ($145 plus tax for 1 night + 7 days parking), but after much researching the Holiday Inn Express offered the best mix of features. The shuttle service is 24hrs - some hotels only have the shuttle running at certain hours, like starting arting at 6am, or stops running at 10pm. The parking area is well lit and relatively secure. Lastly, the continental breakfast started early enough in the morning (5:30am) that we were able to grab a quick bite before our shuttle picked us up at 6am (thus saving us from having to buy breakfast at the airport). The hotel delivers on what they promise - no surprises from what is advertised online vs what you get when you check in or out. For our return pickup at the airport, when we called the driver at 11:00pm (our flight was very delayed getting in) to pick us up he said he would be there in 10 minutes, and he was. Because of many other flights being delayed and disembarking at once, he had several trips to make to get all the hotels guest back to the HIE. However, he let people know where they were on the list, and was able to make a return trip to/from the hotel in about 12 minutes. Not bad!! I would strongly recommend this hotel for this purpose - it may be a bit harder to reserve the parking package in the winter months, so book ahead if you can to avoid being disappointed.

We asked the checkin lady at the front desk. 1) You gotta enter the parking at Chemin de la Cote de Liesse and 55e avenue, the other entrances are blocked and chained. 2) You go right and you will see an mechanical arm and SPIKE STRIPS. This is the ENTRANCE to the parking lot. 3) Approach the mechanical arm and it will go up to let you through. 4) DO NOT STOP WHEN YOU PASS THRU THE SPIKE STRIPS, just regularly go thru them, when your tires go on them the recline. There is also parking before the spike strips and mechanical arm to the left when you enter. There was enough parking for all the guests at this hotel and there is no fee for parking. I would say this is the most SECURE parking in a hotel ive ever seen. To exit, there is another mechanical arm with no spike strips. You just gotta swipe your room card or press the intercom to front desk and they will open it for you. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lobby and Checkin: When you walk in there is music, beautiful chairs, and a very nice rolling water ball thingy. Probably one of the nicest lobby's ive ever seen. Checkin was very easy and the lady was knowledgable. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Room: Me and my family stayed in the European Suite on the 6th floor. When you walk in on your left you will see a small flat screen tv with a I guess luggage bench. To your right is a double size sofa bed with a mirror next to it and an cabinet. Next to the cabinet is a rectangular table and chair. Beyond; on your left is a bathroom (cont.) and another bigger tv with a queen sized bed with matching side tables and lights. At the end of the room is a single seat char to the left with a lamp, air-conditioner, and desk with chairs. The room also has nice dark stain hardwood floors! FYI: The A/C unit was pretty quiet and there is very nice lighting everywhere in the room like pot lights, lamps etc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bathroom: The bathroom has nice dark granite countertops with a big wall mirror and adequate sized sink. The shower is a standard bath tub shower with a large shower faucet. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amenities: (All on first floor) Pool: Its a pool.... what much can you say about it. It has salt water which is a nice change from the old smelly chlorine pool at some other hotels. I noticed the the lining of the pool on the of the sides is coming off. Hot tub: Again, what much can you say. It had jets but wasn't turned on. Sauna: Very nice sauna! It was small, but very nice. NEGATIVES: There wen't enough towels and the grounds were dirty. FYI: Needs room card to get in, and the view isn't that great. Computer room: Not really a room, more like a corridor on the side hidden. It has 1 HUGE iMac; very fast, fast internet etc. There was one more HP touch screen computer which i didn't use. It also has a printer (didn't use) and a scanner (didn't use) for light business use. Breakfast Area: Well this is where my title comes in. On the first morning when I went down there at 8 am all the tables were FILTHY. There were plates, food everywhere on the tables. I didn't even see a maid clean ANYTHING up there; but I think this was because there were 3 bus loads of korean travelers but really the hotel staff still needs to pay attention to the cleanlyness of the tables dispite and hoards of guests eating there... very very dissapointed ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Location: Being a native montreal resident I knew how to get around the terrible Autoroute 520/ Cote de Liesse expressway but for new people to montreal the location is HELL. If your comming from the Autoroute 20 East your very lucky. Just at the roundabout take the 3rd exit to Autorute 520 E / Airport and exit 55e. If your comming from the the Autoroute 40 EAST you either exit at Boulevard St. Charles in Kirkland and turn right and then take the 20 E ramp, or take Boulevard Sources in Dollard Des Ormeax (D.D.O) and take the Autoroute 20 E ramp. I suggest a GPS LOL ! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Service: Oh my.... oh my god, the worst service ive ever seen at a hotel. 1) One night we asked for an extra pillow and towel and it never came. 2) Another night we asked front desk to send a technician because the freezer wasn't working. They never came. 3) Another night we asked for TOWELS, for our room to be cleaned ( This was at around 9 PM !) AND MORE TOILET PAPER. They never came. We didn't see that you gotta put the towels on the floor if they were to be cleaned, yet we did with some... BUT THEY NEVER DID IT. We didn't have anymore toilet paper so my husband had to roll some toilet paper from the washroom downstairs so we can use it. Later we went to the front desk for the towels.......... she said someone would come up but THEY NEVER DID. Liked: Room, lobby, public areas (lounge) Didn't like: Staff, Service, Maintenance. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overview: Pretty much if you want a gorgeous room and hotel but want to have the crappy-ist service and maintenance STAY HERE...

We booked a Merchant's Villa suite. I'm serious when I say I've lived in apartments that weren't as large! I don't know the square footage but it was more than comfortable enough for 3 adults. The hotel was booked solid (a wedding or wedding-related event was taking place) but we were able to check in with no delay. The staff was courteous, efficient and very accommodating. The Merchant's Villa suite is as tastefully decorated as the pictures imply, with attractive artwork on the walls, a sleek dining room table with two chairs, a (very) small desk area, sofa (sofabed) and ottoman in the livingroom and a french door that leads to the king bed bedroom. Each room has its own flat panel TV and gets many HD channels. The entire hotel, including the rooms, is wi-fi enabled. Each room had its own air conditioning unit and they were quite efficient (although somewhat loud). The Merchant's Villa suite also includes its own private balcony (although the view leaves a lot to be desired). The bathroom is very roomy and modern. It includes both a tub-shower AND a walk-in dedicated glass and tile shower stall. There is a kitchenette area which includes a breakfast bar (but no chair or stool), microwave, coffeemaker, mini-fridge and sink. It was not stocked, however. It would have been nice to have a few paper towels and disposable plates and utensils bundled up in individual packets. I don't think there was even a bottle of water. Now for the downside: location, location, location. Oy! As an airport hotel, one would not expect to be in or even near downtown. If you're looking for a walking hotel or one that's close to all the action or the sights, this isn't the place for you. We knew that when we booked and we were fine with it. It is in a light industrial area. The bad part is the hotel is on the 520, which is probably one of the most horribly designed roads I've ever encountered. Ever. I haven't been to much of Montreal but I can't imagine a worse area to drive around than the 520 and its surrounds. It is horribly, horribly designed. It is the poster-child for bad road design. The 520 is a limited access roadway with a solid barrier median and one-way \"service\" roads on either side. The service roads go in the same direction as the side of the highway they are on, so they really don't buy you much. There are very few opportunities to go either over or under the 520 and even when you find one, you may not be able to turn onto it because the side roads have minds of their own and may not necessarily lead back to the service roads. Basically when you're on one side of the 520, it is darn near impossible to get to the other side. Even the locals agree the 520 is a VERY poorly designed road. Maps don't/can't convey how bad this road is. I looked at a paper map, my GPS, Yahoo maps and Google maps. I think the mapmakers just gave up on this one. Go on, take a look, I'll wait. Sadly, from the hotel, one MUST drive to get to... well, to get to anything. As an Express hotel, they are not permitted to have a restaurant, so guests must either venture out on their own, order delivery (some really sad delivery choices) or bring something in. How I wish we'd known of the hotel's shuttle service; they will shuttle you to and from local restaurants! I didn't find that out about that until we checked out. I mentioned to the desk clerk how bad the driving was and she said, \"Oh no!!! You should have asked for the shuttle!!!\" They REALLY should play up that feature and tell guests as soon as they check in! We know for next time. And I'm sure there will be a next time. Other than the 520, however, we have only tiny complaints. Although the hotel is only two years old, our suite was already showing a few signs of wear. I don't know what people have done in this room (I probably don't want to know) but there were many, many patches in the walls. We know because the touch-up paint didn't quite match the original. So, we had a room with cream colored walls with pinkish polka dots scattered throughout. The suite had wood floors (not sure, but i think it was laminate). We love wood floors (very classy) but it might have been nice to have small area rugs at bedside (non-skid, of course). Overall, it was a delightful experience (520 aside -- have I mentioned how bad that road is?), and we'd definitely recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA really good hotel but given the location a restaurant in the hotel would be nice.\u201d", "Author": "beaver055", "ReviewID": "UR76120252", "Content": "The staff were very helpful and the room was great.

The hotel is very difficult to get to but that is not the fault of the hotel, it is the poorly designed road system but I think folks should at least be aware. First to mention is that it is not $109 per night as even their website states. As a matter of fact, the woman who checked us in said that their rate hasn't been $109 since the hotel first opened. She had no answer when I showed her a printout of the $109 rate from their website nor would she give us that price. Fine, moving on. The hotel is nicely decorated as are the rooms. But we did not appreciate finding pubic hair on the sheets. It was obvious that the sheets had been cleaned and changed and it's one of those things that I think \"just happens.\" But when we called to have the sheets changed, the attitude was as if we were \"being particular\" or something as if we found some dust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I understand enough Spanish to have picked that much up. Ok, still not going to let it ruin the weekend. I didn't mind where the hotel was located because it is close to Dorval/Lachine where there are tons of great restaurants that line the waterfront. What I did mind is that while the front desk gave a full list of restaurant recommendations in Dorval/Lachine, they failed to tell us that they actually have free shuttle service to take you there. We found this out the next day after we battled traffic and driving around looking for parking. Also to note is that the hotel is located in an industrial area so it does smell like exhaust and fertilizer. Our first morning, we went to make coffee and noticed there was no artificial sweetener in the room. My husband is a diabetic and we called the front desk and were told by Tamara that they do not provide sugar substitute in the rooms. We asked if it would be available at the breakfast to which she replied she did not know (even though the coffee stand is 10 feet from the front desk). Apparently she not only didn't know but didn't think it was in her job description to even find out for us. When we expressed our surprise, she said \"I WORK AT THE FRONT DESK\" - CLICK! and hung up on us. Are you kidding me? Obviously, we immediately called back which is how we got her name. Oh and yes, they DO have artificial sweetener at the breakfast which we only found out after we physically went there ourselves to check it out. I travel a LOT, especially for work, so I've stayed in all kinds of hotels. I can honestly say this is the LOUDEST I've ever been in - you can't hear your neighbors above, below or next to you, but you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the hallways. We had to complain about the noise level the entire weekend and they really do nothing about it because it's usually one person at the front desk and no manager around during \"quiet hours\" and zero security. I haven't been this disturbed at all hours of the night even at convention hotels. On the plus side, they do have a pretty good breakfast included in the room rate - both hot and cold food - which we appreciated. There is no restaurant or bar at the hotel but you can purchase snacks and beer and wine next to the front desk. I will say we lucked out with some phenomenal food in Montreal so not having a restaurant at the hotel was no big deal. We did speak to the manager before we left and voiced all of our concerns. She assured us she will speak with her boss and contact us with a response and what they will do to accommodate our issues. Upon our return, I received an e-mail that said she was sorry about our stay and the inconveniences we experienced. WOW! I was not expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too bad, so sad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reply after the complete unprofessional attitude and behavior of her staff. In this day and age when customer service is so critical and companies compete to separate themselves from their competitors, I find this type of laziness and abundance of excuses intolerable.

This hotel is truly a different (and kinda revelatory) experience. I would up using Priority Reward Points for our 3 night stay, which would normally limit my room choice to a standard 1 or 2 bed room . But the staff at the hotel was nice enough to upgrade our room to a full 1 bedroom suite, which was absolutely perfect for our needs (travelling with our teenage son). We had recently returned from a trip to Prague and Vienna where (relying on TripAdvisor again, we stayed at 2 terrific boutique hotels) and we were more than pleasantly surprised when we entered the lobby at this hotel and it clearly gave us the impression that a lot of thought and design went into creating this new kind of Holiday Inn Express. The staff greeting upon arrival was very inviting and one got the impression that the desk staff truly cared about our experience. We were additionally impressed that though we arrived relatively late (around 11:30pm), there were still 2 people manning the check-in. The look and feel of this hotel is definitely one of far more expensive boutique hotels, and that look and feel carried over to the 1 bedroom suite that we stayed in, which was tastefully furnished, including a dining table and chairs, 2 Flat screen TVs, a large bathroom, refrigerator/wet bar and very attractive and comfortable bedding. The hotel and our room were spotlessly clean, by the way. The breakfast area is also very tastefully done with a combination of tables and counters with bar-height chairs. The breakfast choices are more typically Holiday Inn Express style, but somehow seemed to be of better quality and taste compared to many other HIE locations we've stayed in. The parking lot was huge, well lit, and had wider than normal stall markings, which helps avoid those annoying parking lot dings. Two large elevators in the main lobby meant that even though the hotel appeared sold out, there was no long wait for an elevator. I have visited Montreal dozens of times so I was not at all concerned about the airport location of this hotel because, unlike other major cities worldwide, the Montreal airport is only 8 miles from center city. The hotel was located within a 2 min drive to Rte 20 (E & W) which is a major interstate type freeway which takes you directly into center city in less than 10 minutes.

Two flat screen TV's, laminate floors and a hudge bath with a glassed in shower. The bed was comfortable and the room spacious. The only thing we did not like is the A/C was loud and seemed to operate only on high speed. It was alright for sleeping but the TV had to be turned up too loud to suit me. Also there was a pool of water on the floor the next moring where the A/C had not been draining properly. I turned the unit off and reported that to the management at check-out. The staff speaks clear English which is nice because we don't speak French. Not speaking French makes driving in Quebec tricky. Luckily, our GPS took us through a maze of roads to this hotel. I don't know if we could have found it without GPS. The location seem convenient to the airport but not much else. That was OK for us since we were only passing through town on the way somewhere else. If you've had one HIE breakfast, you've had the majority of them. On rare occasions one will stand out.

We were a party of 2 adults, 2 teenagers and 1 6-month old baby. Rooms are great, large enough to accommodate all of us comfortably, had a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker (super handy with the baby), nice big bathroom, very clean. Free WIFI was also a big bonus for us given the kids had brought along their laptops ;-) Hardwood floors throughout the room, which I really appreciate. The hotel parked not only one, but two cars for us given that my husband and I had to drive down separately. There was free shuttle service the next morning at our convenience (no pre-set times, you reserve it the night before and its 24h service). We had to be out by 7.30h am, and had time to enjoy the complimentary breakfast buffet, which features hot items (eggs, bacon, sausage) and had a nice assortment of cereal, toast, yogurt etc. I was very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast buffet, as these are usually limited to stale croissants and toast. We enjoyed the pool the night before, and ordered out for pizza. I realised afterward that they had a nice selection of catered frozen meals for sale in the little shop downstairs, and would surely have tried that for a more healthy selection had I known. Staff was friendly and relaxed, including the shuttle driver (its just a short drive over to the airport, which is great). They came to pick us up as soon as we called from the airport on our way back, and getting our cars was easy and fast. Bottom line, you can't get better value than this hotel, especially if you are doing park and fly. It makes for a really easy and enjoyable experience. I am for sure going to do this every time I'm flying out of Montreal.
