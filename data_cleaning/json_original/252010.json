As you can see from the photo attached, it is newer construction by Ocean City standards, but the price point, for the fantastic location, is very affordable. The rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, the tv is LCD HD. Rooms have fridge, microwave, hairdryer, coffee maker and the little conditioner bottles. Kids did not get black feet from walking barefoot on the carpeting, which was comfy and newish. It's a ten minute walk to rides, games, boardwalk and the widest part of Ocean City's very clean beach. Excursions leave from the dock right outside the hotel. The sunset photo attached was taken from our hotel balcony 8/8/2012. The reasons I can't give Talbot Inn five-out-of-five: 1. There is not enough parking. If you are lucky to get a parking space the walk to the rooms is very short, but otherwise you have to let their (free) valet park your car for you, and they keep the key until you need it or they can find a spot. 2. There was a hole in the bathroom ceiling right over the shower. A big hole. about eight inches by twelve inches, we could see the insulation and rafters. 3. The smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling by the wires, as if it went off and someone hit it with a broom. How can they not fix this before check-in? 4. No daily changes of bedsheets. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and will be back next year.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Capitol Heights, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201cAwesome time\u201d", "Author": "Cheryl I", "ReviewID": "UR133115352", "Content": "Me and my husband will be the word of mouth spokes person for the talbort inn in ocean city maryland .

They have a bar and grille with great entertainment and food right on location and if you have more of a family-oriented vacation they also tailor some of the boat rides for kids specifically!

I was a bit skeptical since some of the reviews indicated a few issues such as parking, loud music and not being able to sleep but I am here to confirm different. We arrived on Friday evening at peak time when the band was playing and the place was packed but had no problem finding a parking spot write in front. The band was good and stopped playing at a reasonable hour. We had a bay view room on the 2nd floor overlooking a part of the festivities, along with our own balcony which offered a great view and had no problem sleeping. Room was average but clean and came equiped with a very small kitchonette including pots/pans which came in handy and saved on additional added expenses. Location is great if your looking to do some fishing since basically everything is write there or within walking distance - M.R. Ducks (Bar/Grille) has good burgers along with their gift shop write on premises. One thing I would have to say is we did get a great parking spot but since there was alot of activiites going on which brought in the crowds, valet parked the vehicles in the parking lot and blocked our vehicle in which did not bring any problems to us since everything was within parking distance but if we had to use our vehicle there may have been a problem. Considering all of this along with the great room rate, it's worth it and will definitely be coming back.

Ducks we saw there was an inn right there. We asked to view the room and the desk staff seemed surprised that we asked to. We found the room clean but very basic, which was fine. The room was bayside which was nice as it looked over the marina, however it was directly above the bar - M.R. Ducks which happened to have a band and we could hear everything in the room. We went back to desk and said thanks but no, and told them we thought the room would be much too loud considering it was right over the bar, but they assured us that the band would end at 8pm and when we asked what time the bar closed, we were told it quieted down fairly early - maybe 10pm. That was fine with us as we were planning on going out for some drinks ourselves and wouldn't be bothered by the bar's activities. Yes the band did stop, but the bar stayed open until the wee hours. We could hear everything including the bar music plus a couple of fights between people. We would fall asleep and then wake up to loud laughing, or fighting...this went on until 2:40 am. It was the most restless night. Aside from that, the room was clean, but again basic. No shampoo, no hair dryer, towels were small, blankets had burn holes in them and the sheets were old, but clean, typical poly bed covers. Room had a small fridge, microwave and two burners for cooking. I never looked to see if there were pots or plates. Location was fairly good as it was a few blocks from the boardwalk and activities. I don't think that we'll stay again as we like our sleep and we felt we were lied to about the noise.

Nearly all the comments were positive. I would like to add my observations on the motel. Those who had stayed there before me apparently had very low expectations of the facility\u2014or the service had deteriorated by the time I arrived. To be fair to the establishment, the room was very clean and the air conditioning and TV worked fine. The room was Spartan\u2014no pictures on the walls, no tissues, an ice bucket but no ice machine, soap but no shampoo, coffee-maker but no coffee. It was a very hot day, but their soda machine was out of bottled water. The door stuck so badly that I had to force it with my shoulder to get into the room. After we arrived, we went downstairs to M.R. Ducks, owned by the same people who own the Talbot Inn. There was no hostess around and it appeared that no one was in charge. After waiting for a hostess to show up, we seated ourselves\u2014and were completely ignored by the wait staff for fifteen minutes. So we left and went next door to the Angler Restaurant for dinner (which, by the way, was excellent\u2014and friendly). On the second day we discovered that the food we had put in the refrigerator was still warm. The refrigerator did not work. I called down to the desk and the attendant told me \u201cOK.\u201d I assumed that meant that he would send someone up to check it. He didn\u2019t. I went down to the office and asked for some ice. They informed me that it would $1.50 for the ice. After I paid $130.00 a night for a room with a broken refrigerator, they wanted $1.50 for ice to keep my food from spoiling. When we checked out, I informed them that the refrigerator was broken and no one checked, even though I called. The clerk looked under the desk and told me \u201cNo one wrote it down.\u201d He didn\u2019t apologize; he didn\u2019t offer to adjust the bill. He didn\u2019t even ask how the room was or how our stay was. He simply looked at my signed credit card slip and said, \u201cOK, you can go.\u201d A restaurant or lodging facility should offer more than a used bed or a hot meal (although I never got the chance to see if the food really was hot). Patrons have the right to expect courteous efficient attention from those places where they choose to spend their money. They shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate rude and sloppy service. On another day the Talbot Inn and M.R. Ducks may be fine places to sleep and eat.
