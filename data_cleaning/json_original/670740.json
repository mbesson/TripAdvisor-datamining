Pillows too flat! No sports or local channels on Flatscreen tv. Had to pay 25 cents everytime I needed ice for my drink, yes there was a small refrigerator but really? Every room was booked and you must charge for ice?! Coffee in lobby at all times, ok at least that was free. Free Wi-Fi ! Small pool.

The rooms aren't huge, but they were big enough for what we needed - a place to sleep, change clothes, and spend an hour out of the sun - and very comfortable! They were very clean, and the bathrooms were well kept. Housekeeping was very friendly, as were all the staff we dealt with, which always makes you feel better. The location is very convenient, close to a 7-11, and right across the street from the busy part of the Boardwalk. Free Wi-Fi is handy, we did find that it came in best when we were sitting outside our rooms, but you don't mind it too much when it's so nice outside.

No where to hang wet bathing suits or towels unless you used the railing out side. Lack of mirrors was a big deal. No phone to call the office. Towels seemed like they were really old. Paper thin.

However, next time I will definitely spend a little extra money for somewhere better. The location of this hotel is great (right on 1st st just a few minute walk to the beach and boardwalk), but that's where the perks stop. The rooms are small, and lack a clean and updated feeling. Although I read that the hotel was rennovated in recent years, it is still very dated. The room we had had 3 painted paneled walls and a conrete block wall. The bathroom was somewhat clean but was old and could use a deep cleaning. The shower is very tiny, the shower head is some odd contraption that sprays water everywehere. The sink was super low with an awkward metal tray above. There is only ONE mirror in the entire room (which is in the very small, very hot and steamy bathroom). We had mildew and mold on our air conditioner which was disgusting. The beds were okay, some stains on the boxspring, I didn't dare to really look hard. There is no clock in the room, but there is a flat screen tv (with about 5 useful channels), a nice mini fridge and microwave. Attempting to get around the room, to find places for luggage, and a place to hang wet clothes and towels is near impossible. The pool had a green tint to it and was not inviting. We were politely informed that housekeeping comes at 9am...insinuating that we should be out of the room or prepared etc. Although we were early risers, that felt extremely rude that housekeeping was just \"coming\" at 9 in the MORNING!? There is an ice machine, which you have to pay 25 cents for each small bucket of ice. We had housekeeping come in the room once (because we were trying to get ready the first time and just asked for towels) however, all she did was drop off towels, pick up the dirty towels, and change the trash; our beds were still unmade and nothing else was cleaned. I really am not a complainer, but this place was ridiculous. The price and location were two pluses but I would definitely never stay here again.

Finally found it next to the pool... and in front of one of the biggest cranes i've ever seen. we climbed the 3 flights of stairs up to our room.. opened the door... and were HORRIFIED. the room was about the size of a closet. the smell was terrible. only one bed had a headboard, the other had glue on the wall from where one MAY have been at one time. the only light in the room was covered with a lampshade that had SOMEHOW escaped fire, as it was clearly scorched. the beds were very uncomfortable and were covered with plastic sheets, which didnt make for easy sleeping. the bathroom is a WHOLE different paragraph. the shower was a hole in the wall... literally. i'm only 100lbs and i couldnt even fit in there, let alone my boyfriend and 2 other female friends. the window wouldnt open. i dont even think you could close the door and sit on the toilet. and then there were the neighbors. as my friends and i were sitting outside (because theres no way all of us could be in the room at the same time), and we noticed our neighbors coming in and out of their room quite often, checking windows, just being generally shady. all of a sudden a little girl, maybe 3 or 4 years old, was SHOVED out of the room and made to sit on the 'balcony' alone to eat her cereal. my friends and i were shocked. after about 5 minutes the door opened briefly (checking on her perhaps?) and then closed again... followed by a HEAVY smell of marijuana. this happened a few times until the little girl continued to knock on the door until they let her in. The smell continued all night. i would like to state that i am 23 years old and have stayed at my fair share of 1 star hotels, but i wouldnt EVER consider staying here again... even if it were free. granted i only had access to 1 room, that room made a LASTING impression. i would like to suggest the Rivera on 26th for younger crowds and the Executive Motel on 30th and Baltimore for vacationers of any age. The Haven Hotel on 1st and Boardwalk is also very nice. I will be posting reviews for each as i am able.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA Horror\u201d", "Author": "MManis426", "ReviewID": "UR21508364", "Content": "Even though the hotel is very close to the boardwalk and the staff is lovely and very accomodating, the rooms are dingy, run-down and they smell.

Upon contacting this motel the gentlemen that answered was very helpful and willing to even negioate the rates. Whenever a motel negioates a rate, chances are there are reasons for that. Once we arrived the woman at the front desk tried to tell us we did not have reservations and that they didn't have any vacancies. After an 8 hour car ride the fear of god was in my eyes, and she eventually found our reservations. We paid $5 for each key we needed, along with that we found out you have to pay for ice? The room itself is pretty gross, the bed sheets looked like they were never laundered and the mattress was beyond \"firm\". I also did find upon entering the room, a small army of bugs on the floor. The shower stall was hands down one of the most gruesome sights! I barely could fit in the shower, it was such a joke. I will say one thing, the air conditoning worked well and the tv made it a little better. If you can afford to shell out some more money you'd be better off with some of the more well-known places. They even put a tip request in the room for cleaning, uh please it was never clean in the first place and we didn't even get clean towels---not that we wanted their nasty towels.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "morgantown", "Title": "\u201cnice for what you pay\u201d", "Author": "w426782", "ReviewID": "UR8399470", "Content": "the rooms were small but served their purpose to sleep in however if someone ended up sick i would not want to spend all day in the room. the rooms were not spotless but not filthy either they were just ok. the bathrooms were very very small the shower was VERY small no bathtub which i wasn't to thrilled about because i have two small kids that prefer bathing . the rooms also have no phone in them. you also have to pay to use the ice machine which i thought was a little crazy on the plus side it is very close to the boardwalk, beach, and amusement rides. the pool was nice but also small and very rough inside myself and both my children scaped our leg on the pool bad enough to bring blood so be careful of the sides and bottom of pool not a smooth surface.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Madison Beach Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d670740-Reviews-Madison_Beach_Motel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$53 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9 N Baltimore Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "670740", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/79/2c/66/madison-beach-motel.jpg"}}
