{"Reviews": [{"Content": "the worst place I have ever stayed I knew it would happen one day, when I could honestly say that was the worst place I have ever stayed.After looking at photos of the hotel on the internet (bad idea) we decided to book as it was close to where our meetings were and the price was reasonable for Sydney. Upon opening the door to my room, the smell hit me like a right hook. The old bed and furnishings looked like they had been picked up off the street and with the state of the carpet, there was no way I was walking around without shoes on. We had a quick look at the restaurant for dinner and decided to eat at mcdonalds down the street. After checking the bathroom, my thoughts turned to my visit to indonesia, use bottled water to drink and brush my teeth.In short, money needs to be spent either renovating the entire hotel, or demolishing it. I pity anyone who has to stay at this dump. Pay the extra money and stay somewhere else, even sleeping on the floor at the airport would have been a better option.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300622467", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "portis71"}, {"Content": "An Average Motel I am normally quite picky about choosing hotels, particularly over the internet and this was booked by my boss for a work trip, so I basically knew nothing of the hotel when I arrived. On first impressions I was dissapointed, although all I wanted was dinner and a good nights sleep. The motel is tired and worn. It is desperately in need of an update. My room was adequate, but as other reviewers have mentioned - old. The bathrooms need serious attention. If my room had a new couch, bed spread, chairs then they must have shopped at a garage sale because everything was worn and old. The linen was clean however and bed was surprisingly comfortable. The rooms are very noisy though, I heard everyone in the carpark, getting in and out of cars, people in the hall, next door, and upstairs shower running. I was happy to have Fox to watch the football, and the light in the bathrooms was good for doing my makeup! Most girls appreciate good light for makeup.After being exhausted I ordered room service (ridiculous surcharge when they walked all of 5 metres to my room - I would expect a $10.00 toasted cheese sandwich to include the room service fee). The next morning I entered the dated, ugly restaurant for breakfast. I cant be much help on that as I was hoping for some yummy yoghurts and mueslis and fruit - I was disspointed. So a piece of toast and tea was my $15.00 brekky. All in all, not a delightful place to spend your time, but if you are on a budget and don't expect much for your dollar (and don't mind ugly decor circa 1980's), then this place is alright. I was comfortable, and staff were friendly (although lacking personality). I probably would stay somewhere else next time though.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR828361890", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "AussieinLA"}, {"Content": "Not good value The previous review was spot-on. It is tired, down at heel, broken. The location was great (close to train and ferry) with good parking. That's the only thing going for it. The room was old and stuffy. The toilet cistern would keep going and jiggling the button eventually made it stop gushing. The washbasin tap was all corroded. Heaps of mould on the bathroom ceiling (which had exposed pipes). Rock hard pillows. It was clean, but old. The staff were sometimes a bit unhelpful. The $15 breakfast was a $7 at very best. The walls seemed rather thin, you could hear noises from other rooms. I was very disappointed. The Stamford at North Ryde does rooms on Fri and Sat for the same price, and it is stratospherically better. I think 2 star is an honest rating.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR752165229", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SkiBob"}, {"Content": "Its Cheap for a reason! I booked this place because I needed to be close to Olympic Park for a conference. As usual, It was a last minute thing!My first room stank, because the shower was leeking onto the carpet, and I suggest the room had been closed up. Once I advised the staff, they did move me to another (dry) room.In a word, its tired. The bathrooms are clean, but desparately need an update. The room fittings are also very old and a little batterred.The blanket on the bed had a tiger print! are you getting a picture here?Rule no.1 never book a room based on the pictures on the net - I'm sorry but you dont see the detail and of course they always show the best room.On the upside, we were upstairs at the back, so the room was very quiet, and we could sleep with the door to the grubby balcony open, despite very worn stickers on the door advising us to keep the door locked at all times! Also, most of the staff were very friendly.We did not like the look of the restaurant, so we did not eat there. In summary, if you have to, its ok for a night, but dont expect 5 star actually I'd say its more 2 star.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR687061619", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "WhatamIdoinghere?"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d287022-r18319488-Metro_Inn_Ryde-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "287022", "Price": "$86"}}
