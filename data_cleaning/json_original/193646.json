Everything about it was adequate. Not thrilling, mind you, but adequate. (Except for the horrible British TV.) Clean, decent size, decent storage space, large-enough bathroom with decent water pressure, semi-comfortable bed and pillows. In the back of the hotel, so it was quiet. Good size safe in the closet. Could not regulate the radiator heat, but was told the front desk could adjust it. I simply opened a window. One morning there was no hot water, luckily I didn't need a shower that day. Breakfast was decent. Hotel staff was friendly and handled all of my routine requests promptly. The Paddington neighborhood was really nice, plenty of shops and restaurants. Nearby McDonald's had great Wi-Fi. From the hotel, very short walks to \"tube\" and train stations. Travel to all points in London was very easy. Biggest negative was poor Wi-Fi service, available only in the lobby, and most of the time it didn't work at all. (This hotel was booked by a college study-abroad tour company, so I can't speak to the value for the money. I'd pay up to $160/night for this room, based on the high asking prices around London.)", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "corsham", "Title": "\u201cLovely\u201d", "Author": "becky694", "ReviewID": "UR126338337", "Content": "Came here with my boyfriend for my 20th birthday last year.

I decided to try as I am a travel agent myself and our clients often use hotels of approx the same price category and the same location (near Paddindton station). I stayed there for 3 nights when visiting WTM 2011 Travel Market. Let's start with good: location near to Paddingtin station, lots of shops, pubs, fastfood places near, I also liked the reception staff- I always got help what I needed, breakfast was quite OK for London hotel- not buffet, but still there was cheese and ham, and tomato and cucumber and yoghurt and flakes! NB!! The coffee was very very good, made to every client personally in small coffee-pot. But the room- my home for 3 nights- was so depressing: it located in cellar and was very dark, 50 cm from my window there was small garbage-box- there were lots of rubbish thown out from windows... blankets in bed and towels had holes, shower was so small that I could not even wash my legs. both- room and bathroom- just screamed for renovation. so if You need just a bed and pillow to put your head on in London centre, it is ok for You. But if You want a good stay and maybe spend more that 6 hours (night) in room, maybe even to work there a bit, pls do not book this hotel!

Cannot complain about the price, I really got a special deal, so I decided it cannot be that horrible, plus there are some reviewers who actually really liked it. The hotel fulfills the safety requirements (two fire escapes) and I was lucky (?) to get a room on the top floor, which meant nobody was walking on top of my head (seems a bit important in this hotel). But you hear people walking outside your room anyway, very very squeeky hall and your own floor - I was lucky to be the only one in the room, but I was already annoying myself! The outdated design and linen in the room itself is nothing to brag about. It hosts a water kettle, though, thats nice, but the tea/coffe selection was awful, so bring your own. The room view was closed by a concrete wall and past visitors have obviously been smoking here. There was also an ashtray inside the room, but many smokers here obviously choose to throw their leftovers outside of the window to be stopped by this concrete wall for everyone afterwards to admire. The design of the room is very outdated if not depressing. I got a bit sad in there. The bathroom, however, was quite nice, though small. The linen and towels were fresh and clean. The matress has seen better days, but it still had sufficient firminess. If you choose this hotel, EARPLUGS are a must. I was so relieved to find out I have brought my own so in the end, I had a good night rest. They do have free interenet, if you want, but I did not have time to try out the speed. No breakfast was included for me, so you need to check that, but it's not very expensive to have one. On top of it all, the taxi they called for me, wanted a crazy price (almost double than what it should cost).

In terms of location, its pretty good. It's a very short walk from Paddington mainline / underground and set off the main road in a pretty quiet square with grass & trees in the middle. There's a few pubs nearby & the usual selection of fast food & franchise restaurants nearby. The Norfolk Plaza looks great from the outside, but goes downhill rapidly when you get in. The lobby itself is ok & the staff were pretty pleasant all the time we were there. There's a tiny \"bar\" which will seat four people at best and was closed when we arrived back from the theatre, which was something of a disappointment. Finding your room was a struggle too as the numbering system is completely random. We went round the floor three times before finding our room, which turmed out to be right next to the lift!! We had a twin room which could best be described as functional: two beds, small tv, bathroom. The carpets are threadbare and the decor is very tired, while the bathroom was well past its best. There was hardly any hot water in the morning. Had we been staying for more than one night, it would have been a struggle to accept. The beds themselves were just about ok, but the pillows were awful - so not a good nights sleep for me. The breakfast room (\"restaurant\") is also tiny and couldn't cope with the number of people wanting to get served, so we had to queue down the stairs. Again, none of this was the fault of the staff, who remained pleasant throughout. The food on offer at breakfast was basic, but adequate. So on the whole, its an average London hotel at best. Its only real plusses are the location and the price. You can pay a similar price for far better facillities out at Docklands but if you want to have a base reasonably close to the centre of London, this is ok.

Hotel staff very very helpful upon arrival, easy booking, not allowed to check in before 2pm however we arrived at 10am and could leave our bags safely untill we checked which was great, so we went out for the afternoon as planned. The hotel rooms themselves arent The Ritz - they are basic rooms - we had the twin room which is how its described, nothing fancy, small TV with basic channels, trouser press, hairdryer, bath/shower, kettle with tea/coffee - exactly what you would expect from a hotel room. The rooms are clearly old, the rooms themselves could do with a makeover. The 2 man issues we had were - The creaky floorboards. The slightest movement from the room above and we heard everything, 24/7. They must have been cleaning the room out in the morning as from 7am it was constant noise, you couldnt sleep through it. 2nd problem is the bathroom. If you are slightely large/overweight, you cannot stay here. myself and my partner were ok, but we barely squeezed onto the toilet which is located between the shower and a wall, and im a size 10. Pretty bad that they dont state this, but then again they wouldnt would they! Last which I thought was pretty rude was that the maid let herself in and walked in whilst i was sleeping with nothing on! I shouted 'HELLO?' as soon as i heard the door go and she replied sorry sorry and walked back out. But still, not pleasant! Luckily I was sleeping! Apart from these issues, the hotels location is fantastic, and you may get lucky with a bigger bathroom and no creaky floorboards above!

I was told they have the heating on for two hours, then off for two hours so it would come on from 8 to 10. It did, but it wasn't nearly enough to warm the room (considering that my radiator had been turned off all day). They had no blow heater or anything to give me. The response at reception was sort of shrug the shoulders. However, the conceirge was quite apologetic. Generally hotels dont advertise heating as a perk, because I think its kind of assumed. I could not believe the AA sign outside - giving this hotel 4 stars. I no longer have faith in the AA ratings - I guess they must have stayed in the summer. Clearly all the money they saved on heating goes to decorating the reception area which looks very nice (great!) I dont really have any other complaints (I did only stay one night).

When we arrived we were pleased to see that it really was only about a 2 minute walk around the corner from Paddington Underground Station. Upon our arrival the hotel seemed nice, and had a frontage nicer than the other hotels and hostels in the Norfolk Park. Reception is nicely decorated and seems newly renovated as does the bar with the nice big plasma near the reception; that is about as much praise as I can sing for this place. The lady on reception seemed very indifferent to our being at the hotel, we given Room 104 on the first floor. The only way up/down in the hotel, is a very old lift. Our room request was for a double/twin, we received a triple. The room was old, and didn't look like it had received any TLC in at least the last 20 years. The beds were terrible, they were old spring mattresses, the pillows were more like quarter filled sandbags, and the television was a generous 20 centimeter screen. Now I have stayed at many budget hotels, however at a rate of $230 a night I expected a little more. The bathroom was basic - toilet, shower, and basin, however.... Our first morning we could not get hot water for 90 minutes because the boiler was on the brink. The second morning we didn't even need to use the cold water tap because the hot water was luke warm at best. The toilet was very average, I actually got excited when I could flush everything in one attempt. We were also lucky enough to have a nicely cracked toilet seat which had been there for some time. The tiles on the bath/shower were coming off, and the shower head was very, very old. The room was also quite noisy, just beware if you have early risers above you as you can hear them walking around. We did not eat at the hotel as it was a little pricey, there are loads of little cafe's within walking distance that offer a great breakfast for between 2 and 5 pounds nearby. The concierge desk was very helpful when we checked out and happily stowed our bags for the afternoon, the man working there at least had a personality... As far as this hotel goes, it had all the basic required amenities, however it was not very nice, I would seriously consider the 30 pound hostel 100 metres from this hotel which I am sure would offer no less of a room for a fraction of the price, whilst still in the same great location.

The room (502) was on the 5th (top floor) and faced the back of the building so relatively quiet at night even with the window open (I found the room to be very hot).

Beds are super old twin beds that are hard, sagging, thin, with springs pushing through. The bathroom was the worst thing I've ever encountered. (See pictures) So small. I am not exaggerating that the shower (there was no tub) is a 2ft. square stall with one soap dish. There is no way to shave your legs, as there is no room to lift your leg. There was a huge push-out window in the bathroom that wouldn't close completely so it was freezing in there all the time. If you didn't shower by 7:30 a.m. the water would be cold. Some of the students and faculty stayed in rooms on upper floors that had different bathrooms that didn't seem quite as bad. So, if for some reason you must stay here, ask for an upper floor room.

If I hadn't checked the window at first, my son could quickly had climbed up, curiously opened the window and fallen to death ten meters down to the dirty backyard. When I complained, two guys came up and tried to fix it with a stick! Instead of putting a lock to the window. The electric connections in the closet are at least 40 years old and have rusty connections. The furniture is from the early seventies, dirty and worn out. The 20-years old \"satellite TV\" I had to fix myself when I came so it worked. Anyway, of five channels two of them were German and Arabic. The toilet didn't flush properly, the bathtub worn out, the washbowl was cracked. When I closed the door to the bathroom, three plates fell down from the outside of the tub and crashed on the floor. The bathroom smelled mould. The carpet had big stains, and smelled dirty, the baby couldn't crawl on them. The truth is a crappy, worn out, broken dump with dirty textiles of nylon.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "DanGold", "ReviewID": "UR4410709", "Content": "Having seen the poor recent reviews - I could not disagree more.

The rooms are small but tidy enough, it's a two-minute walk from the Heathrow Express at Paddington, and the rate was totally reasonable. My complaint is with the brazen dishonesty of the information booklet in the room, which seemed to indicate that a long-distance phone call to Canada would cost about 60p to a pound per minute. As I was only making one short call and it was a Sunday evening, I went ahead, figuring it was worth even 15 pounds to not have to go looking for a calling card in my jetlagged state. I made an 18-minute call. When I checked out the next morning, I was presented with a bill for 32.50 - a total not too much less than the cost of the room itself. I later spoke with the hotel manager, who declined to reduce the charge and argued that the sample tolls listed in the booklet were only \"approximate.\" Given that I was calling at one of the least expensive times of the week, I can only assume that the manger took the term to mean \"approximately half the lowest toll you can possibly expect.\" In short, not a bad hotel, if you don't mind the manager's apparent comfort with leaving deliberately misleading information in the rooms. And by no means make a phone call from your room under any circumstances. If the building's on fire, fashion a megaphone from your dishonest in-room info booklet and call for help out the window.", "Date": "October 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!!\u201d", "Author": "Londongirl70", "ReviewID": "UR4023463", "Content": "I booked this hotel for one night, at the last minute...the lobby was nice.. but the room was another story..I agree with the previous post SCARY!!

He also decided not to open the bar on the Saturday night which was a bit of a disappointment as we were looking forward to a wee nightcap after the concert.

This could be upgraded to a full English breakfast for a couple of pounds. The hotel was within easy reach of Paddington Station.

The staff were very helpful and gave us a map where they marked all the places that we wanted to visit. There were many good restaurants and shops within a few minutes of the hotel.
