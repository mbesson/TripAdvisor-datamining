The best things about this resort are the service and the intimate and private feel of the beach, grounds and restaurants. We thought the food delicious and the variety fine for a five night stay. We are perplexed at previous reviews about the lack of variety and quality of the food. We completely disagree. We had a couple's massage at the Spa, which was unbelievably good. The Spa overall was luxurious (sauna and steam room!) and the walk through the jungle to get to it was heavenly. We spent most of our time the first few days on the beach beds (fantastic!). However, the wind picked up and we moved to the garden pool the last few days, which was heated and surrounded by a small tropical paradise. We loved it! I recommend taco night on Thursday night and the beach barbeque (lobster, shrimp, fish, steak, ribs, paella, salads, etc....) on Friday night. Both not inexpensive, but the food was incredible. We ate at Freddy's bar on two nights for a casual dinner and El Sol on one night. The service and food at El Sol are not to be missed. The complimentary breakfast is a treat. The rooms are of average decor, but the bed and linens high quality. The linen closet was outside our room, so we did hear noise throughout the day, with staff going in and out of the closet. We did not leave the resort during our entire stay. For our arrival and departure from Cancun airport, we used Cancun Transfers. The roundtrip was $82 (charged through paypal on AMEX). The service picked us up at the airport in a nice car (big black Suburban...we felt like big shots compared to other transportation vehicles). Since we had prepaid for the roundtrip, we only tipped the drivers each way.

If you have any taste whatsoever and expect a level of service or luxury that is offered in well-managed hotels, do not go to this property. If you simply wish to ignore lack of service and pay premium pricing for 2-star quality, let the pictures on Maroma's website and the Kiwi Collection ratings misguide you. Despite all my travel, I have never written a review of any resort, because I do not have the time. This resort was so tragic that I had to take the time. I have included various photos of the problems so you don't categorize me as a bored complainer. The villa (beachfront, one of the highest categories, ~US$1500++ per night) is generally beautiful, despite the age. The problems at the resort, however, are many: 1. Airport Arrival: The driver had the wrong count (2 instead of 3) of passengers and we had to wait 15 minutes for him to confirm with the hotel (who was not answering) before moving. The driver was extremely rude and could not speak a word of English beyond \"Hello\". 2. Hotel Arrival: Though they \"fixed\" the miscount, there were 2 welcome drinks (which I didn't even want) were offered and the very disinterested host showed us around the aged resort. 3. The food, especially at lunch, was terrifying. I had burnt meat on burnt tacos of some sort, and a few other of their limited snack items for US$200. Terrible selection. Terrible taste. 4. The beach is incredibly dirty. Late in the morning, a few people would start cleaning the beach area but would not do the job properly. I have included photos. 5. The A/C unit was completely broken and it took 2 attempts for them to finally fix it at around 11PM. I have included the lovely photo of the technician on the ladder as my bedtime gift. 6. The manager sent us a gift on a note. It was a crumbled-up piece of some sort of cookie in a messy wrapping for the 3 of us. I sent this gift back to the manager in an envelope. I have included a photo. 7. The beach beds were very rarely serviced. The beds were always dirty and towels were piled up on every bed. Clean towels were rarely available after noon. I finally screamed at someone who started cleaning up the beds. I have included many pictures of this mess. 8. I sent an email to the manager highlighting these issues and he hasn't even acknowledged the issues or responded in any way. I assume he's away for the weekend, which is reflected in the ignorant attitude of the staff here. Luxury today means anticipation of what guests may need. I don't need to be called \"Sir\" and I simply wish for a comfortable time at the resort with staff who seem to be genuine and friendly. This place is simply trash. It may have been better in the past based on some other reviews, but I assure you, it falls below a 2-star in terms of service. My recommendations in this area are Rosewood Mayakoba (far better than here) if you wish for a relaxing place, ME Cancun (if you wish for a hip, modern place) or Blue Diamonds (which has inherited the original Mandarin Oriental design for free).

The downside is that you really don't have large windows and need to go out onto the terrace to see the ocean. All in all we had a great time but we are truly beach people. There are no TVs in the rooms and that didn't bother us. There is free WiFi.

A place I usually would not have chosen. Generally will go with Rosewood, Four Seasons properties. But I wanted to try a smaller place with a great beach. Maroma is all about the beach--it is beautiful. Fair amount of seaweed but they are very diligent about cleaning it every morning. Service is very good. Everyone refers to the guests by first name with a Ms, Mrs or Mr preceeding it. Food is ok but not great. Breakfasts are the best meal-it is a bountiful breakfast. good authentic mexican egg dishes. Juice and coffee, followed by fruit, followed by a bakery basket and wonderful tortillas hand made with love by Dalia. Coffee is delivered to your room each morning and left outside the door which is a really lovely touch. Rooms are quite dated in terms of furnishings but the bed was comfortable. Room service is on time and pleasant always. I found the meals outside of breakfast to be very hit or miss. Mostly miss. Spa is lovely. Massage therapists were quite good. The place is lacking in terms of the swimming pools. They are not well taken care of, the grass is worn down around the pool and the area is not really welcoming. I spent much more time at the beach but would have preferred a great pool area. Maroma does not have that. One thing I was not pleased about was that when I arrived at around 430pm, my room was not ready and I had to wait about 30-45 minutes to get into a room. I was told that the last guests had vacated late, which frankly was not what I wanted to hear after a full day of travel. If check in is technically at 3, then it shouldn't be after 5pm before getting into one's room. Once i got into the room, it was another 20 minutes to get my bags sent up. So that felt chaotic to me and set things off on not a good footing. I think that if you are looking for a resort with a great beach, lovely people, and don't particularly care about fantastic meals or great drinks, and you don't want to pay Rosewood prices, then Maroma is a very good alternative.

The staff is so accomodating, especially compared to other Caribbean countries. Moses is a terrific waiter and hi to Jessica at Hospitality! As mentioned in other reviews, our only issue is with the food - specifically, dinner (it's not bad, just gets boring.) We enjoyed the free breakfast every day, especially the handmade tortillas, and love the beach menu at lunch. But after eating one or two dinners, we wanted a change from a Mexican/Mayan meal. The chef will accomodate you - we asked for grilled fish and vegetables on the last night - but we would like to see more variety or specials that are different every night.

This was my 3rd time in Mexico and my fiancee's first. We wanted a relaxing vacation, away from the freezing cold of NYC in the winter, within a 3-hour direct flight from NYC and with some cultural highlights. The hotel - a former architect's home in the middle of a 500-acre coconut plantation - is superb! A beautiful whitewashed hotel that is right on the beach. And what a beach!! It is pure white sand and turquoise water. The hotel is 30/40 min. away from the Cancun airport and about 30 min. from Playa del Carmen (by car). This is a great location as it is away from the cheap thrills of Cancun and close to the local scene in Playa. We rented a car as we wanted to see Chichen Itza, Coba and Tulum (more on this below) so we were able to travel outside the resort, which we highly recommend. Firstly, the hotel is beautiful, very clean and very well kept. While being right on the beach, it still has quite a bit of nature around the premises including large but friendly iguanas which we grew fond of before we left (though we were petrified when we arrived). The main pool is beautiful and heated. The rooms are large - we booked a junior oceanview suite and were upgraded for free to a master oceanview suite (we were celebrating our engagement). The room had a great balcony with a hammock, a large bathroom with a shower and tub, and a separate bedroom and sitting area. There is free Wi-fi in the rooms which works very well and thankfully no TVs. The beach is absolutely beautiful - it has nice beach beds (if you can get one - see \"con\" below) and otherwise nice beach chairs and palapas. The beach will not disappoint. Secondly, the Maroma staff is pure gold - very friendly and attentive. They actually go out their way to be helpful and to remember your name. They are the hotel's greatest asset! Belen, who welcomed us, was a sweetheart - she made everything possible, from our amazing free room upgrade to a master oceanview suite to showing us on the map how to drive out to the Mayan ruins. Luis taught us the intricacies of tequila (it's such a fine spirit if you know how to enjoy it) and even emailed us a sangrita recipe which we will surely use! The Maroma staff actually cleans the beach every morning of the seaweed that is washed up by the ocean during the night so the beach is really quite clean and inviting. The one staff-related issue we had was the room cleaning. For our entire stay of over 6 days, the maid NEVER came before 2:00pm (even though we tipped nicely the first day). So if you want to go back to the room for a shower or an afternoon nap, you will find a messy room and will be disturbed by the maid coming in to do the \"morning\" cleaning. Included in the room is a free snorkeling session per person - they take you inside the great barrier reef (the second largest in the world, after Australia) and they offer private sessions to take you outside the reef. Def. take advantage of your trip - we saw amazing fish and coral during our 40 min. time in the water. My fiancee also wanted to get PADI scuba certified (a long time dream) but the only scuba instructor there was not available for 2 days during our stay and no replacement was considered by the staff, though we understand that the water activities desk is separate from the hotel. The free coffee service delivered in the mornings directly to the room is great and was always on time. The free breakfast in the mornings is amazing - they have full entrees of real Mexican/Mayan dishes - our favorite was the poblano chili filled with an egg omelet but the dishes range from simple eggs to muesli to the Mexican traditional dishes. Also included are unbelievably good exotic fruit juices (papaya, etc.) - definitely try the chaya juice (a local Mayan plant) - yogurt, pastries, out-of-this-world hot chocolate and Santacruz coffee. We loved the coffee so much that we bought a few packs to take home! The sporadic group theme dinners can be great (see \"con\" below for a la carte dining) - they usually run at US$75-125 per person for a buffet plus an additional 24% tax/tip automatically included. Our favorite was La Cantina night which included traditional Mexican dishes and mezcal - def. try this if it occurs on a night you are there. The beach BBQ theme was also great! Below are the cons. We truly hope that management works on these as we would love to return to Maroma in the future. (1) This is the MAJOR con - The a la carte food and drinks at the 2 restaurants and bar on the premises are insanely expensive (by NYC 3-Michelin-star standards) and of passable quality - we definitely did not travel on vacation with the intent to be cheap or even reasonable and we have the funds to splurge; however, you feel taken for a ride when the entrees are so expensive and so very small. It's almost like this is where they make their profit margins as they know that they have a fairly well-off and captive clientele. It really is an unnecessary way to spend money that leaves you feeling a bit cheated. Depending on your order (say, appetizer, entree and wine), each dinner can run in the high $300. We even saw people ordering inside the restaurants food from the outside bar (we assume it was price-point related). This is just not sustainable. To EACH lunch, dinner or drink at the bar or on the beach, or really to ANY service (including the spa, the gift shop, etc.), the hotel automatically adds a 14% tax and 10% service and every item is presented only in US dollars but not charged this way. So a single shot of good tequila at the bar will run about US$20 with 24% additional surcharge - i.e. ~US$25. This gets presented in US dollars but charged in the peso equivalent (not clear why) and your US credit card will add a forex fee to every such charge. So a single drink can turn into quite a feast! Our best-tasting meals were in Playa - definitely try Las Brisas (best seafood salad/ceviche, beers, whole grilled fish, guacamole for US$20) - in Valladolid - def. try Taberna de los Frailes - and in the village of Coba at a great restaurant called Pyramida overlooking the lake near the ruins. (2) Related to the above, there are no other real restaurant options on the premises. There is only a restaurant called Pavo Real about 5 min. drive away (also, technically, on the premises but run by a different staff) but it is not very good, aesthetically pleasing or reasonably priced, though it does have a live piano player. They gave us Mexican sparkling wine when we asked for Italian prosecco and were planning to charge us as if we were consuming the prosecco (a large price differential) until we finally asked to see the bottle and the label as it was so awful. We were refunded the price, but mistakes like this should not be made - and I'm being kind in calling this a \"mistake\" and not an intentional plan to pad the bill. (3) The general clientele at Maroma are folks in their 50s (again, we assume for price-point related reasons). This is perfectly fine, but worth a mention. On the other hand, we partially chose Maroma due to their policy of not allowing young children, but alas it seems this has changed as there were young (under 10 year-old) kids at breakfast - not a deal-breaker for us really as we're in our early 30s, but there's something about kids running around that's a bit stressful when you're trying to unwind. (4) The staff allows patrons to wake up early (if not the night before) and place random belongings on the beach beds - i.e. a newspaper or the in-room slippers. So, by the time we finished breakfast at 8:30AM (with, at most, another 2 couples at the beach-side restaurant), we would reach the beach where there were PLENTY of non-occupied beach beds BUT with random items securing occupation. We were unpleased to have to take beach chairs and see people stroll onto the beach to their \"reserved\" beach beds 3 hours later that us. Unless patrons are going for a dip in the water or a beach stroll or breakfast, they should not be allowed to \"reserve\" beach beds in the morning...or the hotel should invest in more beds. (5) If you do not have a car to travel around, this can prove to be a little suffocating as well as very expensive. If you add the lunch, the drinks on the beach and the dinner, you'll be spending around $1000 per couple per day. With a car, you can travel to the nearby Playa del Carmen, experience real restaurants - with great fresh seafood - and real locals for a reasonable price point. You can also travel there by taxi. We rented our car from Avis at the airport and were very glad we did so (get the insurance!). We drove 3-hours inland to see Chichen Itza which was absolutely amazing - a UNESCO World Heritage Sight and new 7th World Wonder. The highways - both the toll and the rural - were VERY safe and we were able to get there before the tourist buses. We were also able to stop along the way in Valladolid for a great lunch and for cenote swimming - we can provide more details of our itinerary via private message, but you should definitely travel outside the resort. We also visited Coba where we were able to climb the tallest pyramid in the Yucatan and the Tulum ruins. Overall, the Maroma was a great stay but we did not feel that we received true value for our money. We will not return - it was a great, though unnecessarily expensive, stay.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greensboro nc", "Title": "\u201cMaroma changed\u201d", "Author": "llbGreensboroNc", "ReviewID": "UR125512560", "Content": "This was our third visit to Maroma, and sadly, will be our last.

We\u2019ve previously visited Little Dix Bay, Biras Creek, Cap Juluca (we have visited twice and it is our favorite), Peter Island, Villa Del Sol, Cuisinart, and Nisbet Plantation. Though our room was relatively small, it was very comfortable and we did not feel cramped. The covered patio was a good size with two sitting areas and a hammock. Our room was upstairs in the main building. At first, we were worried about noise due to our central location but we had no issues. The food was good but not great. Our biggest complaint was the lack of fresh fish choices. While we were there, it seemed like the only fresh fish was grouper. Grouper was one of the few fish options on the daily menu. It was also the catch of the day and the feature fish in a special dinner one evening. We\u2019ve come to enjoy and expect a variety of fresh fish when we visit Caribbean resorts and, in this regard, Maroma was a disappointment. Breakfasts consisted of typical Mexican and America dishes plus pastries and fruit and were great (after a few days, we started eating in our room which proved to help us make the best use of our time). We had lunch of the beach most days and found the menu to be enticing and food well prepared. Dinners were good, subject to the previous comment on limited fresh fish offerings. Our best meal experience was the Thursday night \u201ctaco night.\u201d It was excellent. The service was wonderful. Each staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, and competent. We heard the phrase \u201cit is my pleasure\u201d in response to almost every request we made \u2013 and we could sense the sincerity behind the statements. The beach experience was also very good. This was our first encounter with \u201cbeach beds\u201d and we are worried that we\u2019ll never be able to be as comfortable in beach chairs ever again. Imagine a comfortable king sized mattress with some large pillows to prop up against and an umbrella that can positioned according to your whims. It was fabulous. The service on the beach was very attentive. We enjoyed complimentary chilled apples and ice cream each day (and frozen grapes a few days). Our only complaint was that unlike most other resorts we have visited, complimentary water was not provided. We got around this by bringing water bottles provided in our guest room and then getting ice buckets but at a resort the caliber of Maroma, this should not have been necessary. Maroma\u2019s beach was well maintained. There must have been a bad storm right before we arrived because there was a lot of seaweed and trash on our first day but it was all removed before the second day and was clean thereafter. The adjoining beach at the end of the hotel\u2019s property is the Secrets Maroma. Their beach was also maintained but had a different feel \u2013 much more crowded and a very different clientele. Beach walking was okay. You can walk a long way on the beach and many of the views are great. That said, portions of the beach in the vicinity of Maroma are not well maintained - there is a lot of seaweed and trash (it will forever change your view on the recycling of plastic when you see all the debris). There\u2019s little the Maroma Hotel can do about trash on beaches they don\u2019t control but it detracts from the beach walking experiences of guests. We had a couples massage and the overall experience was exceptional. Not only were the massages well done, but the physical environment was terrific. We were in a hut and allowed to enjoy a Jacuzzi afterwards. It was probably our best spa experience anywhere. There\u2019s a lot of talk about physical safety when traveling to Mexico. We can only judge things on our own experience but we never felt uncomfortable in any way. As it relates to the other Mexico \u201cthing,\u201d we were told to not drink the water from the faucets in our room. We did drink tap water and use ice in the restaurants without any problems.

The hotel is set on a beautiful sandy beach which is swept everyday in case some seaweed has floated in overnight. Lovely clear warm water. A good range of sunbeds in a number of locations - all well spaced out. There are only around sixty rooms but there are various categories and locations - the pictures on the website are illustrative only and you will pretty much get what you pay for. We asked for an Oceanfront Junior Suite on the ground floor in a quiet location. We had Room 57 which was as far away as possible from the main building, had lovely sea views and was just a few steps from the beach. It had a separate inside lounge (handy for the odd tropical shower!) plus a very large outdoor covered area with 6 seater settee, patio table and chairs plus hammock. There are no TVs in the rooms \u2013 not a problem for us given that we wanted a romantic break. One of the best hospitality services we have experienced (in line with other Orient Express hotels we have stayed at). For example check-in/check-out is tailored to your individual flight times. We experienced some fantastic private tailor made tours (via 4 Worlds Expeditions), in particular Chichen Itza and Tulum plus snorkelling to the underground caves (unique to this area) and the reef. We thought these represented excellent value. Top tip \u2013 opt for an early start to Chichen Itza (0600) to avoid the crowds and the heat. Also, you might want to avoid going to the Mayan temples etc on a Sunday as entry is free for locals so the site is busier. Also recommend the Spa - great 80 min de-stress massage. Food quality is excellent and, although the standard menu choice is a bit limited if you are here for a long stay, there are numerous \u2018speciality\u2019 nights and the chef (Juan Pablo) is more than willing to flex the menu if you ask. The private dinner might initially seem expensive but you need to bear in mind that Juan Pablo tailors the five courses to your personal preferences.

For example it is possible to give a nice not too expensive all inclusive five stars but those five stars do not equal the five stars given to an upscale rather expensive resort. So when I evaluate Maroma the five stars I am giving it really should be 10 stars. This resort is spectacular. The resort is just 35 minutes from the airport but you feel like you are hours away. We arrived at noon a few hours before their regular check in time and we were given another room to change in. We then went to the beach. Maroma beach is a long stretch with only a few resorts. The sand is soft white, the water clear blue. The very little seweed was raked up every morning. Comfortable beach beds, loungers and chairs, palapas and umbrellas line the beach at a comfortably private distance. Every time I tried to move my chair an attendant ran over to do it. Towels are large, plentiful and available. Our pool was nice but not heated. The main pool is heated. It is actually very warm and It is under a canopy of trees. We had an ocean view room in the newer section that overlooked one of the pools. We had a view of the beach, palm trees, birds, the pool and flowers. The bed was very comfortable, the room was charming and we had a great balcony with chairs, table and hammock. Coffee arrived every morning at 7 as requested. The evening turn down service included candles and oils. The days were beautiful and the nights were equally spectacular. We walked down tree lined paths lit by torches and/or candles. Candles were lit everywhere in the restaurants. The meals were very good. The past reviewer was absolutely wrong about prices. Breakfast was free and included anything you wanted. One day I asked for pancakes and scrambled eggs and ended up with 2 separate meals all free. Every day they came around with tropical fruits and bread, pastries and home made marmalades. You could have pretty much any juice including the juice of the day which could be mango guava. We were usually too full for lunch. I was however always ready for the daily ice-cream man on the beach who delivered yummy homemade ice cream cones.Our dinners were typically the fresh fish of the day. The fish was always fresh and very moist and flavorful. Prices were comparable to any fine restaurant. Music in the evening was provided by local musicians. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Maroma is expensive. You get what you pay for. This is a quiet, beautiful resort where the intent is to give you a memorable vacation.

Most hotels on the Riviera are all inclusive and it is often difficult to find resorts that are open to non-staying guests. We love good food, perfect settings and excellent service, right along with simplicity and authenticity and have developed quite a repertoire of breakfast places to go to wherever we travel. I have decided to share my collection of Mayan Riviera breakfast experiences with you. Enjoy. Maroma Beach - the Maroma Orient Express Rated one of the most beautiful beaches in the world by Cond\u00e9 Nast (a few recent experiences with their \"Best in the World\" recommendations made me think of them as Cond\u00e9 \"Nasty\"), this time they are not far off the mark. The beautiful Maroma beach is located half way between Playa del Carmen and Cancun. Watch for signs or the large blue peacock painted on a wall at the turnoff from the highway. Maroma beach fronts a few resorts (almost all are called \"Maroma\" this or that) but without a doubt the destination here is the Maroma Orient Express hotel. The Maroma Orient Express is a 65 room hotel with a spa set right off the gorgeous white sand beach. Reservations for breakfast are required but unless you are traveling between Christmas and and New Year when the hotel is fully booked, you shouldn't have any problem getting in for breakfast (or lunch). Breakfast is served at El Restaurante on the beach and it is a gorgeous, transforming, setting. Tables with white linen clothe and white umbrellas are arranged on the open stone patio at the edge of the white sand that separates you from the beautiful turquoise carribean waters. You feel at one with the sea and sand. Hola amigos, I am home. The breakfast menu is fabulous, offering anything from birchmuesli with papaya, scrambles eggs with poblanos, tostadas with eggs or chicken, juevos motulenos with beans and ranchero sauce over corn tortillas to, of course, pancakes, waffles and other classic breakfast varieties. The tortillas are made fresh by a Mayan woman, rolling them in plain view just inside the restaurant. The woman walks between the tables, offering the tortillas, still warm, to go with your breakfast. The juice selection is enticing, with watermelon, pineapple, Chaya and the likes offered throughout breakfast. Good coffee is served in large cups, inviting you to linger and watch the scene. As always at the end of breakfast we walk down to the water's edge and enjoy a long beach walk, feet in the water, checking out new developments along that beautiful stretch of beach. We sometimes stop by for a drink back at the Maroma, before leaving to return to our own Mayan Riviera abode. Breakfast at the Maroma is one of those special experiences etched in your memory that you can draw on for a spiritual lift when needed.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot what it used to be.....Sadly\u201d", "Author": "lulu33469", "ReviewID": "UR124279170", "Content": "I just got back from Maroma & I'm heart-broken.....it is now grossly overpriced and not the intimate hotel I remember from 7 years ago....

We very soon came to realise that nothing was too much trouble, from housekeeping, to reception, to Freddie and his boys at the bar, to the restaurant and service on the beach - all requests were greated with a smile. Our room had direct views to the beach and was light and airy, we did see some other rooms at the resort, they also had the same feel, the Mexican tiled rooms we saw were in a good location but set a bit back from the beach. The gym area was very well equipped with up to date machinery, and was often visited to ensure all was clean and tidy for all guests.

Unlike The Rosewood and Banyan Tree, Maromas starting Garden Rooms are only 315 sf versus the 3,000 sf monstrosities at Banyan Tree. I disagree with the earlier reviewer that it is a closet...but to some 315 sf is not large enough. The have larger rooms and huge villas for those that need more space. It surprises me that people don't do more research before they select a hotel. For us, we love the bed, the wonderful bathroom w gigantic mexican tiled tub and fantastic balcony w/ hammock to unwind. The service is as warm as you would expect. Freddie at the bar, gabriel, alvaro and marcos on the beach and cute Dalia who makes homemade tortillas in the morning. jessica and Mabel at the front desk are terrific as well. The food is wonderful. Juan Pablo (former chef at Las Ventanas in Cabo) does an amazing job along with Edgar who prepared for us the most romantic meal we have ever had under the stars on the Mirador. We highly recommend it, but be prepared for the steep tab. (bottle of champagne, bottle of wine and 5 course meal with your own server). The beach is stunning and the only negative thing I can say is that in Jan it can be windy due to the northerly winds so expect a little seaweed. The pool is in the garden and of the 3 is most recommended as it is heated around 85 degrees. For those unsure about Maroma this is the only place to stay for those that want to experience a hotel right on the beach without needing golfcarts to get around, amazingly warm service, great cuisine and just truly unwind for the week. We have done the bigger hotels like Four Seasons Costa Rica and Ritz Grand Cayman yet we continue to come back to Maroma for its romanctic and intimate setting.

We travel extensively and we have stayed at some of the finest properties in the world but Maroma remains our favorite place to visit year after year for our anniversary. There is simply no place anywhere that is as special as Maroma. It is classy yet comfortable, understated elegance. It is a very private, intimate, discreet boutique hotel that is the very definition of the word \"romance\". Every night they light thousands of candles all over the property. During the day, you lounge on your \"beach bed\" reading a book and listening to the waves gently rolling in while the wonderful Oneisomo (sp?) or Alvaro serve you food and drinks or adjust your umbrella if you prefer the shade. The beach is absolutely glorious with powder white sand and Caribbean blue water. The buildings with the Mayan architecture and beautiful landscaping and stonework are stunning. Apparently, the 65 room hotel was mostly full during our stay but it never felt full. It always feels private with plenty of room to breathe. It's truly like staying at someone's private hacienda. The food is superb. We highly recommend the romantic dinner for two in Mirador Tower in the moonlight. We also recommend the special Chef's Table dinner where you gather with others to sample amazing food while the charming Chef Juan Pablo sits with you and talks about the spices and traditions of cooking. We also loved the seafood grill outside with torchlight and the Taco Night dinner with the charming lighting and decorations. We so appreciated the marvelous waiters such as Luis and Moses. Gabriel was always so warm and welcoming to us as we entered the dining areas. We love the fact that there are no loud or overly scheduled activities at this resort. This is not a \"party\" atmosphere at all. It is truly a place for couples seeking privacy and romance. It's very nice that they offer special dinners as mentioned previously, but they still maintain an air of romance which is wonderful. Thanks to the thoughtful planning of our lovely friend Laura in Guest Relations, we were truly blessed to stay in a Sian Nah suite. I can't recommend that highly enough. We had glorious patios on two sides with a plunge pool and hammock. We had an exquisite view of the ocean from our living room and bedroom. The bedroom had a domed brick ceiling (stunning) with a beautiful canopy bed. The bathroom has two sinks and indoor and outdoor showers and plenty of closet and drawer space. We had our own workout room with a treadmill and our own spa palapa with a view of the ocean. Wendy did a terrific job of keeping our room clean and she was always so kind and friendly. We enjoyed a soothing massage in our spa palapa while listening to the sounds of waves crashing and birds chirping. We also enjoyed a spa and jacuzzi at the Kinan Spa. We love spas and enjoy them frequently in our travels but Kinan Spa is our favorite. It is absolutely gorgeous and the treatments are wonderful and done with a sense of the sacred, as is true of everything at Maroma. Everything is done with love and reverence and kindness. For us, it is a spiritual retreat every time we visit. We love everything about the place but what really puts it over the top is the lovely staff. They are some of the warmest, kindest people we've ever met. They go out of their way to get to know all of their guests and they treat you as if you are part of their own family. We love them all so much that we greet them with hugs and we are sad to say goodbye when we leave. From the charming men that greet you at the door upon arrival to the lovely Anna in the gift shop, to the amazing Laura and the wonderful GM Federicho, to the gardeners and the housekeepers and the wait staff - the focus on service with love and kindness is uniformly present.

We had a great time snorkeling in a cenote (local underground fresh water system with caves) with a wonderful guide. The food at Maroma is unbelievable. It\u2019s modern Yucatecan, with bold flavors and fresh seafood. On our last trip, my boyfriend and I were enjoying lunch on the terrace. One of the chefs walked by with a tray of freshly caught fish. He noticed that we were looking his way, and came over to our table. He offered to make us a special dinner since we seemed so interested. A few hours later we were treated to a whole fish baked in salt, which was filleted at our table by the chef. It was accompanied by grilled vegetables, fresh bread, and three different salsas (beware the habanero!). After we finished, my boyfriend looked at me and flatly declared that it was the best thing that he had ever eaten. Although the resort is phenomenal, the people are what make Maroma truly special. The staff is incredibly warm and friendly. You will be greeted by name and treated like royalty. They will remember you on subsequent trips. You will feel like a rock star.

We stayed in an ocean front one bedroom suite. We really appreciated the comparatively small scale (in comparison to the mega resorts that dot the coast) and seclusion that Maroma offers. The room was very nice with a great view. The beach fronting the resort is beautiful, and the chaises set up by the staff were very comfortable and a great place to spend the day. The staff could not have been nicer. They remembered our names and really made us feel pampered. The spa was amazing. We had 4 or 5 of the treatments offered over the course of our stay and were very satisfied. The food at the resort was also very good. The Maroma margaritas which can be ordered on the beach or at the restaurant are highly recommended. Overall we were very pleased with Maroma, and will likely stay there again when we come back to the Yucatan. There are a few minor things that prevent me from giving Maroma 5 stars, but they are all really minor and did not affect our overall experience. The first thing is that the resort offers a free coffee/newspaper service in the am. This was a very nice gesture, but the delivery times were often give or take 20 minutes from what we requested when we first arrived. Rather than set up an expectation that the service will be delivered by a certain time, it would be better for management to just give a 30 minute window. Also the level of service in the restaurants decreased on Saturday and Sunday. It seems that the managers we saw on the weekdays did not appear to be on duty for the weekend. Service was still friendly, but it took much longer and there were several forgotten items.

We were not disappointed. The resort is the perfect getaway to 'decompress' - no TV, fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic beach. And, all of the rooms are just steps from the beach, most with a spectacular view. Because the resort is so small, all of the staff are able to be incredibly attentive, and for the most part they knew our names after meeting them for the first time. I must say though that from the moment we arrived to the day we left, Jessica took incredibly good care of us. She is a gem. And Gabriel went out of his way to be exceptionally warm, welcoming and helpful. We were early to bed and early to rise every day - spent the days reading, sunning, and in the gym/spa. My only complaint would be the lack of sound-proofing that we did not notice until the last 2 days of our visit, when new guests arrived above us. I gather this is only an issue in the rooms that are far away from the original house as our friends stayed in the original house and never heard a sound from any of their neightbours. The upside to our room was that it was huge, had a spacious bathroom and had a big beautiful porch to enjoy the day/evening. If you are looking for lots of activity and night-time action, this is not the resort for you, but that didn't stop us from enjoying our cocktails in the room, at Freddy's bar, on the beach and at dinner!

I chose Maroma simply because of the beach. I read in different places it's been voted the best beach of the world several times and no wonder why. We rented a car, so we drove from the airport to the resort, which was easy to find, and fun to get to, since you get to drive through the jungle and see some 'tejones' and other little animals. I was tempted to go for Secrets Maroma next door, but I loved the idea that Maroma is a small hotel which makes it totally relaxing, personal and a very special experience. It is pricy, but I think every cent is worth. There are so many details that make the stay wonderful, starting with the delicious welcome margaritas, or the coffee and bread brought to the room every morning. We stayed for 4 nights, and we chose ocean view room, which is totally worth the price difference since there's nothing better than going to sleep with the sound of the sea and the cool air - we never had to turn on our AC, ever. The rooms are small but cozy, the beds are wonderful, there is no TV which I loved, there is internet so you can check on places to eat outside or where to visit (however you don't even want to leave the place!), the bathrooms are beautiful and have organic body lotion, soaps, shampoo, etc., and at night they light up essential oils of your choice so the room smells wonderful and it makes you have the best night sleep. Breakfast is very good, since they have typical mexican dishes and components put together in a very unique way; I loved the egg chile relleno, and well as the cheese crepe with chilorio, the chilaquiles con pollo, and my husband the enfrijoladas. The juices are wonderful combinations of exotic fruits, and the chocolate drink spiced up with lemon grass was the best, as well as the yogurt, the fruit and the hand made tortillas (Gracias T\u00eda Delia for the morning lessons! I just made my first tortillas back home and will send you a picture of them!). Breakfast is very satisfying so I would feel hungry until the evening, and even though we know the food is excellent at Maroma, we drove to Playa del Carmen (~10 min drive) and explored a few of the great restaurants in town too. The marina services at Maroma are excellent, they have just the professionals! We tried the scuba diving for the first time and it was amazing. We learned the basics in about an hour at the pool, and then we were taken into the ocean to a part of the reef called the aquarium, to dive for the first time. I think I have a new hobby now, so thanks to the marina staff for making it a great first time experience! We enjoyed the beach a lot just sitting on the beach beds and jumping into the water, so delicious I wonder why there was not so many people in the water since it is so relaxing... The beers, and the cocktails were great and the service is perfect, you don't get bothered at all and you're never missing a drink or anything. I could write pages about the details that made our short stay so enjoyable, but I guess you have to figure out for yourself. We are Mexican, and I was very pleased with the experience at Maroma, even though the place is visited mostly by foreigners we were treated with the same standards, and I am very proud of how professional and excellent the team at Maroma is.

I was never in mine except for early mornings, afternoons to shower and back home at night to sleep. There is A/C in every room. They are very comfortable.

We opted out of the Four Seasons and Ritz destinations years ago as they cater to kids. Not Maroma. In fact, no kids under 16 allowed. No kids pool, no kids camp, no kids running on the beach in diapers. Maroma is an adult-only paradise that caters to couples who don't want to be bothered, don't want to do a whole lot except eat, drink and relax and who want an experience to remember. The property is spread out along the one of the best beaches in the world. Maroma beach is pure white sand and the water azul in color. Other resorts up and down the coast have plenty of seaweed and rocks, not Maroma. The beach is perfect for walking, running and on special nights, having dinner. They bring out the torches, candles, set up the table and deliver an incredible experience. We stay in the Sina Nah suite right on the ocean (second level). The balcony opens up to the ocean and features a day bed and two chairs for being memorized. Inside you have more space than needed with a separate living area, bedroom, master bathroom suite that features his and her sinks, indoor/outdoor shower, soaking tub and if that isn't enough, the room next door features a treadmill, climber, some weights and if you can imagine, if you leave that room and walk up a flight of stairs, you come to the massage room. That's right, his and her massage beds in the open air. Food is always a critical component of a luxury experience. Maroma excels in most areas. Breakfast is overlooking the ocean. The tortilla lady (same lady since Maroma was founded) makes homemade corn tortillas and passes them around. Waiters serve fresh fruit, bakery basket and you can order anything off the menu. All good. Lunch is at the beach in all its splendor. They make several ceviches each day and a great assortment of lunch specialties. At 3PM, the \"ice cream man\" strolls the beach serving up homemade cones and the flavor of the day. Amazing. Dinner features two restaurants in the same building and I think the same kitchen. So while the menus are different, the food is similar. Good but not great. They offer a Friday night beach barbecue that is excellent. At night, they light thousands of candles throughout the property for a great touch. There is also live music during happy hour on most nights. The spa is OK. Don't look for a traditional changing room with all the amenities. They do have a small locker room but certainly not what you would expect. The yoga studio on the top floor is fabulous however. The gym is small and the selection of free weights very small as well. With the spa pretty much open air, there are nice scenic areas and relaxation rooms along with fresh fruits and nuts. The shining star however is the service. By the second day, they call you by your first name and remember everything you ordered and like. The staff is super friendly and will do anything for you.

The prices coincide with the meal, you are def getting what you pay for. The couples massage was very relaxing and rejuvenating I would also recommend this. Overall, the highlights were the personable staff, they remembered your names and details of what you like & dislike, for instance my hubby enjoyed a specific fruit for breakfast, the waiter made sure he had it each morning...The beach side service is great also...always someone there to adjust your umbrella or bring you a fresh coconut! We ran into other couples staying onsite and 2 of them were visiting for the 2nd time!

The resorts/trains/camps/you name it are breathtakingly beautiful and the staff is the most gracious, warm and hospitable you will ever encounter. Never stuffy, not pretentious in the least, always luxurious but relaxed..............that's O-E. Maroma is the best in casual elegance. You can spend the whole day in a swim suit and a cover up, and dress in a very relaxed fashion for dinner and that's the way a beach resort should be. I was lucky enough to have a Sian Nah suite but all accomodations here are gorgeous. The ocean breeze is a constant, the summer temps and humidity were much more comfortable than I thought possible; there are great summer prices so don't delay! And yes, they allow children in the summer - They were all beautifully behaved and the beach is so immense that you're never that close to anyone. But I do think if there's a lot of yelling going on from next door (as indicated in the prior review) the resort would probably be happy to move you if at all possible. I do believe O-E will do anything they possibly can to make you happy; they are just the best. I highly recommend the cooking class and tequilla tastings so check to see when those are available. The spa is heaven. The food is really traditional Mexican with some wonderful touches and so delicious; loved breakfast as everyone has reported. I did tip the tortilla lady on my last morning - I wondered if anyone did; she so deserved it as she is a treasure and her tortillas are the best I've ever had. Do get the transportation to/from the airport to help with the relaxation mode and, when you leave, pay in advance for the VIP lounge at the airport so you can get away from the duty free crowds.

Wow! Having both worked in hospitality, we were both incredibly excited and expectations were very high, however we didn't realize what we were in for until we were greeted at Cancun Airport by Maroma transportation. The ride to the resort was short (about 25 minutes), but we were already feeling a bit of heaven from complimentary chilled, lemongrass scented towels and relaxing Mexican music playing over the system. The resort is tucked away off the main highway down a long winding dirt road through lush jungle. Once through the gates, we entered into a beautiful little courtyard surrounded by vegetation and highlighted by a soothing fountain. No fewer than 4 members of the resort staff were on hand to greet us by name and we were handed signature margaritas before we could pass through the foyer. As there wasn't an actual front desk, a member of the hospitality team offered to take us on a tour of the property before taking us to our room. We had reserved a Garden Room and were blown away by the accommodations. The room had a nice sized living area, beautiful bedroom with canopy bed, an enormous bathroom and a porch with what must have been a double bed on it (most of the other porches had hammocks). The bed was decorated with a beautiful floral arrangement and the bathroom was filled with homemade soaps. Our bedroom did not have a TV (who needs one when you have a view of the gulf), but did have a CD/iPod player (with a mix CD that we must have listened to 20 times) and wireless internet. After a quick nap we headed down to Freddy's Tequila and Ceviche Bar which is literally located on the beach. Freddy's features fresh ceviche and what must be at least 100 tequilas and mezcals. We sipped on a variety of signature margaritas, tried some local beer and nibbled on their octopus/shrimp ceviche and guacamole. We both love to eat but we never expected the food to be as good as it was. All of the ingredients were fresh, local and perfectly prepared. After spending some time with Freddy, Sommelier Alexandre and F&B Director Alexis personally introduced themselves to us and invited us to partake in their first ever Cantina dinner hosted by Executive Chef Juan Pablo. We are soooo happy that we took them up on their offer! The Cantina dinner is basically a high-end homage to the Mexican cantina tradition. We sat at a large, elevated table with 5 other hotel guests and got fat and happy on a variety of mezcal and no fewer than 11 different plates of food (my girlfriend loved the noodles with sour cream, I loved the racks of roasted suckling lamb!). Wow! Definitely check this out if you like to eat, drink and have a good time! After the Cantina dinner we strolled the property and couldn't help feeling like we were being pampered to the fullest extent when we found that all of the walkways had been lined with glowing candles (I can't imagine how long it takes to place, light, then remove those candles everyday). Again, having worked in the hospitality industry, I was blown away when, during a 1:30am swim, we were brought fresh towels within 5 minutes of entering their main pool. Breakfast is complimentary every morning (whether in-room or in the dining room) as is in-room coffee service. We opted for in-room lemongrass and cardamom scented hot chocolate every morning with fresh baked pastries and a trio of homemade jams. Again, wow! While every bit of food we ate at Maroma was amazing, we both agreed that breakfast was our favorite. Every morning there were ladies in the restaurant entry way making fresh, handmade tortilla shells. Breakfast offers a variety of fresh squeezed fruit juices to choose from, delicious coffee and, again, homemade pastries and jams. Servers offer table-side fresh fruit service (yeah, old school French fork and spoon service if you're paying attention) and, like clockwork, when your entree arrives, the ladies offer freshly warmed tortilla shells. My girlfriend stayed with the yogurt with homemade granola every morning, I say do not miss the pulled chicken over tortilla chips with a red sauce, sour cream and cotija cheese! Oh, and try the tortilla shells with a light drizzle of the local honey... mmmmm! Again, every bit of food we ate was amazing, however the other treat you may want to consider is their Mirador dinner. While very pricey, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The Mirador dinner is a private tasting menu at the highest point on the property (4 stories up). It offers 360\u00b0 views of the property with the Gulf of Mexico on one side and the sun setting over the jungle on the other. There was a beautiful breeze blowing throughout and sporadic light drizzle added to the experience. We took advantage of the complimentary snorkeling trip and were treated to an array of sea life including eels and sea turtles. Unfortunately, we didn't get to do the whale shark snorkeling trip Maroma offers which really hurt considering reports that it was the season and there were hundreds of whale sharks in the area. Kinan Spa. Couples, Anti-Stress Massage. Wow! We did the 50 minute treatment. I can't imagine what the 80 minute massage would have been like. Our therapists started with a foot massage then moved to a full body massage. I have never experienced anything like this. I didn't mention any of my problem areas to my therapist but she certainly found them and 6 days later I still feel amazing. After the massage, there was therapeutic whirlpool already bubbling, waiting for us to hop in. On the side, chilled bottle water and fresh fruit. The whole Kinan Spa experience was amazing. Just standing in the entryway and looking into the facility was relaxing. My girlfriend took advantage of one of their Yoga classes and had nothing but great things to say. We spent our last day at Maroma sitting on the beautiful white sand beach sipping on margaritas and eating ceviche. For 2 people who don't love \"sunning\", we loved relaxing on Maroma's big blue beach beds under thatched roof umbrellas. It was like sitting on our own private beach. Everything about Maroma Resort was absolutely amazing. We were called by our names for the duration of our stay and treated like we were the only guests on the property. The staff, from house keeping to management, was wonderful and service rivaled that of good old Charleston, SC hospitality. Leaving Maroma was the only low point of the trip and we look forward to making a return visit in the future!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jonesboro,ga", "Title": "\u201cSimply the best.....\u201d", "Author": "tellat", "ReviewID": "UR115290230", "Content": "Stayed at Maroma over spring break and can't wait to return!

The first time was for our 5-year anniversary, and it was a complete surprise for her. This was our 10th anniversary, and I wanted to surprise her again. However, after our time at Maroma, I knew it would be difficult to top, so we just went back! The resort is amazing, as it was 5 years ago. Beautiful grounds, beautiful local craftsmanship, and beautiful rooms. The spa is world class, and you would be crazy not to take advantage at least once during a stay. We sprung for an Ocean View room this time, and it is worth it! Having the patio overlooking the beach is a great way to relax. As always, the local staff is EXTREMELY friendly. From the welcome drinks, to the restaurant staff, everyone is authentically friendly. We especially loved the woman who made fresh tortillas at breakfast every morning, and the beach staff that brought around special treats every afternoon. You haven't lived until you are offered mango sorbet, or a hand mixed margarita while laying at the beach! We would love to single out Freddie, who runs the beachside bar and grill. Many a drink was shared with friends before and after dinner at Freddie's! He even showed my wife how to make her favorite - the Maroma Margarita! Freddie, we made sure to get 100% agave tequila and the Xtabentun before leaving to make our own at home!!! The beach is what brought us to Maroma, and the beach will bring us back again. I originally picked this beach because it was rated as among the best in the Caribbean. It is no lie. We would lie on a giant beach bed all day long, while the staff brought lunch and drinks, and constantly adjusted the umbrella to keep the sun off. The water is a beautiful blue, and the nearby reef provides great snorkeling. You are far away from the big Cancun hotels, and there is only one hotel in walking distance. As a result, the beach is very private. Finally, the biggest change since our last visit was the addition of Juan Pablo Loza, the resort's new head chef. The food is utterly fantastic. We ate at both the regular restaurant and the fancier el Sol. Both menus have great choices, and the food has taken a huge step up since last visit. If you go, try to do the Chef's Tasting Dinner. We had this on a Saturday, and dined with Juan Pablo and other couples. We had the best time trying his courses, all paired with Mexican wines. Juan Pablo literally sat with us for the entire dinner and we really got to know him and his inspirations. We were also shocked at the variety of good Mexican wines - who knew! we also enjoyed the barbecue on Friday. Our biggest regret was not being able to try the new Cantina meal. This is Juan Pablo's newest addition, and is only done on Tuesdays. If have a feeling this will be expanded to other days if it is as good as it sounded!!! Drawbacks are few. The mattresses are not quite up to the standard of an American 5-star resort. You will see some bugs around the hotel - it's a jungle in Mexico! You will also spend some money! While many discounts can be had (air-hotel packages, online hotel discounts, extra nights free), know that you will be paying probably as much for your food, drinks and services as you did for your air/hotel price. Hey, all-inclusives don't give you the level of luxury and service that Maroma does. Live a little!!! I cannot wait for our next trip. I don't think we will be able to wait another 5 years to return.

I also recommend the pancakes with Yucatan honey, coconut cream and Kahlua butter today. Yum! I will miss all the fresh juices and spicy mexican hot chocolate too. They even served Veuve Clicquot mimosas one morning. At the beach, there was one guy whose only job was to make sure your umbrella was adjusted to cover your beach chair as the sun moved. Another guy was in charge of bringing you all the food and drinks you wanted from the restaurant. I recommend the chicken quesadillas and the tacos pastor for lunch on the beach. A third guy would come by every hour or so with a shot of cold gazpacho, an apple, an ice cream cone, or a cold towel. The water was the color of a coke bottle and felt like bath water. We snorkeled one day and saw incredibly colored fish, coral and a sea turtle! In the late afternoon, they put out a table full of Mexican candies and cigars .You would return to your room and find candles lit in every room and homemade cookies. Evening dinners were on an outdoor patio a stone's throw from the beach. The beautiful beach setting with the candles and the ocean breeze was heavenly. I would skip the dinner on the beach pkg they offer and just sit on the patio. It's side by side and you will save yourself about $300. Also, we were in the highest suite # 23. While it is the best location and apparently Prince Charles and Robert Plant have stayed in this suite, it seemed to be the meeting spot for all the grackles. We were awakened to loud squawking every morning starting at 5am. It was terrible. I would opt for something besides #23. The spa was good but it is in the jungle alongside the resort.

There seems to almost always be a person around to help you or to pamper you. - The beach is soft and the water is beautiful - We *loved* the queen sized beds on the beach, and each one had a movable umbrella. There were no problems finding one when we wanted one - The breakfast (complimentary, for us) was very nice, and had a plethora of food choices - The rooms were large and well air-conditioned. There appeared to be a wireless access point in every room. - Our room had a bookcase filled with many best sellers and interesting books. It was definitely not just for display. If I forgot a book, I had a number of books I could choose from to read. - Unlike many hotels, this one is centered around the beach, not the pool(s). It made for an interesting flow, and really highlighted the beautiful view over the ocean. - The beach is long, and we both enjoyed walking miles down it near sunset. Cons: - Despite the 1 to 1 ratio, it was at times difficult to get the attention of someone at the restaurants - Food and drink is *extremely* expensive at the hotel. That being said, neither my wife nor I were very impressed by the food. My $42 steak was not as good as one I could have gotten for 1/2 that in Virginia. $11 for a bottle of water seemed a bit high, and our almost $200 dinner (together) at one of the event nights was disappointing to say the least. Unfortunately, you feel like you are almost trapped at the resort since it isn't anywhere near anything else (it's almost worth it to take a cab) - While we were there seaweed was continuously in the ocean and on the beach. Next to other resorts, Maroma did a *fantastic* job at cleaning it off of the beach and out of the ocean (a completely manual process) - the other resorts looked *awful*. That being said, there were many times in which going into the nice, warm, ocean did not seem appetizing because it felt like you were wading into a jungle. - All of the rooms may be ocean view, but that doesn't mean they all have a good view. Our first one was much farther away than we cared for. That being said, they quickly fixed it for us, and gave us a room where we could hear the ocean.

We opted to have the hotel pick us up from the airport which is pricey but useful if the area is unfamiliar--we took a taxi back to the airport. Maroma is off of the highway south of Cancun down a long, tropical dirt road. We were greeted at the door by Carla who handed us margaritas and showed us the property. The resort is very quiet which we loved but if you are looking for action, this is not the place to go. The room we stayed in was on the far side of the hotel which felt even quieter than the main area. There was a pool directly in front of the room and the beach was a few steps away. Let me say that I've been to beaches all over the world and this was the nicest one I've seen. The sand was silky and clean and the water was spectacular--very warm too! Back to the room--it was cleaned promptly everyday and the turndown service was very nice with a treat and a letter highlighting the events of the next day. Morning coffee service is a huge perk. It came promptly every morning with the newspaper--only on the last day, milk was forgotten with the service. The food at Maroma was very good. We had a package that included two dinners which gave us the opportunity to try each restaurant. Breakfast was quite good. The pastry chef at Maroma is outstanding--all of the breakfast pastries and breads at dinner were excellent. The fresh tortillas in the morning are wonderful as are the fresh jams and juices. We enjoyed dinner at each restaurant and we ate at El Restaurante twice and El Sol once was stellar. As many posters have mentioned, this is not an inexpensive place but given that this is an Orient-Express hotel and the quality of the food, I didn't find the prices out of sync. We also had an early dinner with Freddy at the bar which was quite good. He makes the best margarita that I've ever had! We definitely appreciated the work of Freddy, Moses, Sergio and Alex each day. One of the perks of being on the Riviera Maya is that there are choices if you want to leave the resort. We went to Agua in Playa del Carmen for dinner one night and had an excellent dinner. We had planned to do all kinds of activities while on vacation but we ended up mostly lazing around the beach. We did snorkel which was fun and this is something I would have like to do again.

One night, my husband and I had a couples massage, then were allowed to sit in the hot tub and relax. The white sand beach was the best I've ever seen and the service on the beach also attentive. Fresh tortillas were being made in the lobby. Have one-they are great! Coffee service to your room every day was awesome, since we didn't have to venture down to get it. Candles lit in your room every night added to the ambiance. Gabriel made sure everyone was having a good time and all the staff greeted us by name every day. I wouldn't have left if I didn't have to! It was paradise here on earth. I will be back. Thank you, Maroma, for an unforgettable experience.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cEye watering prices and awful service spoiled the last days of our holiday\u201d", "Author": "Martinicus", "ReviewID": "UR111471250", "Content": "I read many reviews on tripadvisor before finally selecting the Maroma over Tides and the Banyan Tree as our final destination on our trip to Mexico. One theme that was often repeated was that the prices in Maroma are very expensive - I assumed that this was referring merely to the room rates, but we got a rude awakening upon arrival. Everything here is vastly expensive - you can expect to pay between 3 and 6 times as much as you would elsewhere. Just some examples: the morning yoga will set you back $35 (+11% tax, +15% service charge = $44), the cheapest 50 minute massage will cost you $125 (+11% tax, +15% service charge = $157), a meal for two with 2 glasses of wine, 2 mains and a shared appetiser and dessert will set you back $132. A two-tank dive with the resort to the house reef (fairly dead) costs around $240. But, such prices might be considered acceptable if the hotel can deliver on what the prices promise: great food and awesome service. Unfortunately, Maroma delivers neither. Every day (save for our last, more anon), our breakfast was a disaster. Twice I ordered dishes with cheese in them and both times the dish tasted rancid, twice, the dishes we ordered arrived cold. Every time it was a lottery as to how long you would wait for tea or coffee - once my coffee arrived quickly, but I had to wait 20 minutes for milk (asking 4 people, including people offering me things like hot chocolate...), by which time my coffee was long gone cold. Room service was another disaster - our room was only cleaned once before about 2pm, and twice our room had its first clean and its turndown service at the same time! We made our disappointments known to their hospitality staff, and were told that someone from the management would try and fix things for us. Much later, the manager of the hotel spoke to us on the beach and asked us what he could do to 'make things better'. We were unsure how to react as we thought that surely most hotels would know how to make unhappy customers happy. We said we would think about it, and just asked if they could make our last meal there perfect if at all possible. We were assured that this would indeed be possible. Ha! What a disaster from start to finish - to begin with we were forced to eat in their 'premier' restaurant 'El Sol' - I'm not sure why they consider it 'premier' as it is musty and dated, when we would have preferred to eat on the beach (which really is a beautiful setting). A very quiet alarm bell went off when our server chose to 'remember' our order rather than write it down, but I figured they would have given us one of their better members of staff. But no, it was just a simple disaster. They forgot our starters and delivered our mains to us first. The person who delivered the dishes didn't know what they were and asked us 'who wanted the chicken?' - neither of us had ordered chicken - eventually saying, hmm, maybe it isn't chicken - what did you order again? Eventually we realised what had happened and asked for our starter instead. I made the point of asking if we would get fresh mains as I didn't want to eat a cold main (2 cold breakfasts was enough) to which I received the astoundingly insulting response \"Don't worry - be happy\". Seriously. A five star resort, and the waiter spectacularly screwed up our order, and rather than apologise, he tells us 'don't worry - be happy' - incredible. Twenty minutes later, our mains arrived. Mine had clearly been microwaved, while my wife's fish had been cooked afresh while all of her side dishes were allowed to go cold. Since it was our last night, we tried to put a brave face on it but my food was cold and inedible and I had to send it back. When we were finished, we asked for the bill and told \"don't worry, it's been charged to your room.\" We insisted, and insisted again, and on the fourth asking, we finally received a bill - we were mostly interested to see if they were going to charge us the customary compulsory tip of 15%. When the bill arrived, I was somewhat surprised as a number of the dishes seemed to have cost more than they did on the menu, so I asked if I could see the menu again - instead of receiving the menu, I received a new bill with one of the over-priced reduced. I again asked for the menu to check the bill against it, and again I received yet another bill with another item reduced in price, at this point we said can we please just have a bill with everything matching the price that was in the menu and the service charge removed please. Finally, the manager came over and we tried to explain the situation and how utterly contemptuous we had found their definition of 'service' and ot his credit, he said he would not expect us to pay anything towards the meal as we clearly had not enjoyed it at all. We went straight to the hospitality desk and asked them to take the compulsory service charge completely off our bill for the entire stayas the whole experience was just awful - we spent more time saying to each other 'and another thing that is awful here is...' rather than just enjoying the last few days of a holiday which, up until we arrived at the Maroma, had felt like a second honeymoon. The following morning, they made an extra special effort for us, and our breakfast experience was pretty positive with some excellent coffee for me, rather than the usual watery brown stuff we had been served the few days before. The swiss hospitality manager apologised to us in person and offered us a bag of sweets to eat on the plane, and confirmed that the service charge had been removed from our bill. Sadly, it didn't make up for the experiences of the previous 5 days. Our suspicion as to 'what is wrong with the Maroma' is that the fact that the service charge is automatically added to your bill for every single little thing means that there is no incentive whatsoever for the staff to provide you with anything like acceptable service. Coupled with this, at breakfast they do not seem to have people assigned to tables to make sure that you get everything you want or need - it is totally haphazard as to what you get and when you get it. I would strongly recommend anyone to go elsewhere if they are looking for a fantastic experience on the Mayan Riviera.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly, magical paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Melody5", "ReviewID": "UR109407382", "Content": "My husband and I are very fortunate to be able to travel extensively and stay in the world's finest hotels through Andrew Harper Travel.

There are plenty of places in Mexico that are glitzy and glossy but Maroma has a very authentic Mexican vibe that is all too rare nowadays in hotels there. It is beautiful - luscious landscaping and beautiful stonework with lovely Mayan-inspired architecture. At night, there are candles lit all over the property. It is extremely romantic! The hotel is small, private and quiet. People who love a party scene should go elsewhere. Maroma is for couples seeking romance and tranquility in a gorgeous setting. The spa is one of the most beautiful and relaxing I've been to - and I've been to many. The food is wonderful and the service is excellent. What sets Maroma apart is the authenticity - the authentic kindness of everyone who works there, including housekeepers and gardeners - the authentic decor, the authentic food.

For about 6 days we did nothing but lounge/wander on the beach and drink tequila and frozen drinks at the beach bar. I loved the fact this resort is very quiet (we came during a week when the occupancy rate was low) as we are not the kind of couple that enjoys random chatting with fellow guests. There were no children at the resort (I think there is an age limit of 14) and in our walks along the beach into other resort properties, we were struck by how much more elegant the property was than the tacky Vegas/chain resorts next door. We got exactly what we were looking for in a fairly isolated, quiet place with a great, friendly staff. The only thing I would criticize about the resort is their dining options. Though there is a \"fine\" dining option available, I was disappointed by the quality of the food as it was just a very typical, possibly 3-star, menu at 5-star prices. I was really hoping for a more authentic taste of Mexican cuisine, not a Mediterranean restaurant with only a small Mexican twist and ended up only eating there once. The majority of our time was spent at Freddy's bar on the beach, where we indulged in delicious cerviches and other small dishes from El Restaurante's menu. Overall, a wonderful experience that I loved and would recommend highly to vacationers who are looking for relaxation rather than adventure.

I had been to the property in March of 2008 on a work incentive trip and hadn't forgotten my incredible experience! Maroma was where we had to go for our honeymoon- sharing this magical place with my husband was a wonderful experience and we look forward to going again in the future. To give you some details about our experience: Affording it First of all, Maroma is very expensive and quite honestly, we couldn't afford to book directly through the resort. I found a fantastic deal through LuxuryLink.com that included a 5 night stay, Ocean View Room, breakfast every day, a snorkeling trip for two, a 50 minute massage for two and a three-course dinner with a house bottle of wine. However, although Maroma is expensive (in fact, the most money we've EVER spent on a vacation...but hey! it was our honeymoon!), we thought it was all worth it. The beach is stunning and well taken care of (they literally rake the beach five times a day!)...it's very low key (no kids), secluded (you won't have people hawking sunglasses and t-shirts on the beach) and the service is impeccable. From the wait staff on the beach to the hospitality staff and folks manning the Maroma Activities spot, they're all top notch. Dining/Cuisine Excellent. We booked a private dinner at El Mirador (at the very top of the resort with a 360 degree view) with our own personal waiter and a menu designed by the head Chef, Juan Pablo. We also took a cooking class paired with a tequilla tasting where we learned the secrets of making ceviche, tasty guacamole and tinga. The Chef's Table night was phenomenal- a four-course meal focused around the tomato, with a wine pairing....mmmm! We also enjoyed fantastic breakfasts every day-- with fresh squeezed juices, fruit (never tasted better mango!) and huevos. We did partake in taco night and yes, it's quite expensive at $75 per person not including beverages (as other reviews have lamented), but it was a feast reminescent of a wedding reception....traditional soup, salads, tacos of all kinds, tostadas, desserts like flan...amazing. Don't forget the enthusiastic Mariachi band! Drinks Freddy's Bar is the best! We love Freddy and his team! The Maroma Margarita is so unique! We got some of the anise/vanilla liquor to make this special cocktail for our friends here in the US. They also have an extensive wine menu, so if you're into wine, this is a great place to induldge! Room I've stayed in a Garden View Room (Room #3) an Ocean View room (Room #20) and quite honestly, I liked the Garden Room better. More space with double sinks, a huge bath tub, nice outdoor space with a hammock. It faces the Garden pool where the temp almost 90 degrees and soooo relaxing! The Ocean View room we got through LuxuryLink was fine, but it only had a standup shower, no hammock and just an okay view of the ocean. Kinan Spa I really induldged in the spa! Three treatments in three days! I highly recommend the Anti-Stress Massage and the Kinan Ritual. There's a fantastic sauna/steam/cool plunge pool room that's open to anyone on the resort as well. Very tranquill space and wonderful service. Activties My husband went out with Dive Master Laura for a scuba excursion one day and he also took the snorkel trip. He loved every minute of it! There are other trips offered- like to Tulum to see Mayan ruins- but we were pretty content to stay on the resort. Bottom line If you're into a TJ Maxx kind of vacation, this probably isn't for you. This is like shopping at Bergdorf Goodman-- you may find things on sale (like our deal with LuxuryLink), but you'll always spend waaaay more than at TJ Maxx. You can't go on a trip like this worried about what you're spending. You have to decide ahead of time to just enjoy it and be okay with it. We estimated what our costs would be and they came in right around that amount. So, we charged it to the credit card and are transfering money over from our \"honeymoon trip\" savings account to pay it.

The service is one of the friendliest we have ever encountered in a hotel and, despite a few lapses in the dining room, it was very efficient. When we arrived we were upgraded to a master suite and whilst this was most generous of the management, having seen our originally booked ocean view junior suites, we were disappointed with our suite (Room 21) as it is not worth the increased cost. Whilst the room had its own seperate sitting room, the bedroom faced the back of the hotel with a view of roofs and one only had a sideways view of the sea from the sitting room. We felt that the quality of the furnishings and general decoration fell slightly short of a five star hotel requirements. That said, the management make a virtue of it being rustic - in our view a bit too much so! We had a few rainy days and the lack of television in the rooms made life a bit boring. The hotel is in a truly fantastic position, opening onto a gorgeous long white sandy beach, and the restaurant is virtually on the beach. It was stunning. The food was 'correct' without being memorable and we found it extremely expensive. The one great plus was the staff was very accommodating and would prepare almost anything one wanted, even if was not on the menu. The best meal was breakfast - lots of choice and do have the double fried black beans; delicious with a fried egg. There are two main restaurants, the 'Signature' one being El Sol. Again this was very expensive and we found the decor slightly gloomy. The main restaurant was, in our view, better value and is in a much nicer position, most of it being in the open. We had one big hiccup in that El Sol is not open on Sunday. On our second Sunday the hotel and restaurant were extremely busy. We were told that we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table - not justified in a five star resort hotel. Why did they just not let people sit in El Sol, as it is next door and you can have the normal restaurant food there? The service was sometimes very slow and haphazard but as we were on holiday and all the waiters were so charming and friendly this did not really matter. We visited Chichen Itza, taking the hotel arranged tour at an eyewateringly expensive $750. We found this to be, actually, reasonable value as we had an excellent day. However we avoided the nearer and shorter (4 hour) Tulum arranged tour for $600. We found a friendly taxi driver who drove us there and back, and waited the two hours we were there, for $150 and we got a very good tour guide there for $50 - a saving of $400! My criticisms are mainly petty and the overall impression of our stay in this lovely hotel was wonderful. The position, general quality of amenities and service were outstanding. However we did think it very expensive. We negotiated a discount on our original booking and were upgraded, however if we had to pay the full 'rack' rate for our suite we would have been very disappointed. That said, it is no more expensive than most top flight Caribbean hotels.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cMaroma Has Set The Standard By Which I Will Judge All Other Resorts.\u201d", "Author": "razorweb", "ReviewID": "UR97857869", "Content": "Quite simply, Maroma Resort has raised my expectations for what a hotel can deliver to its guests. I did not want for anything during our stay. The staff bent over backward to accommodate our every request, and always asked if there was anything they could do for us. I don't think I've ever been to a place where each and every staffmember was so helpful and friendly. The grounds are gorgeously maintained. Night-time is when Maroma is truly in its glory - hundreds of candles line every walkway, hallway, and everywhere else you can think of. It is really magical. At night, we played pool and board games (provided by the hotel) as we sipped margaritas and watched the moon rise over the ocean.. The rooms were clean and authentically decorated, a welcome departure from the modern chocolate/beige collections so many other hotels are sporting these days. Each room has a hammock on the balcony which we used after a long day on the beach. We also took full advantage of the oversized tub (the resort provides bath salts daily) and rainshower. Each night after turndown they would leave a little treat to enjoy which I thought was a great touch. The beach was impecabbly clean, as it is cleaned regularly by hotel staff. About two dozen beds line Maroma Resort's beach, where we relaxed all day while table service and the occasional refreshment were serendipitously d We partook in the included coral-reef snorkeling trip, which was a fun thing to do after a full breakfast. Maroma has its own boat to take you out to the reef, and a friendly dive instructor who guided us along. The food was excellent and varied, both at the beachside restaurant, and at the indoor fine dining restaurant. We took part in a special chef's menu one night, and it was incredible. We later learned that the head chef had previously trained at Le Circque in NY, among other places, which explains the high quality of the restaurants. Every morning we had breakfast at the hotel, where fresh juice, fruits, pastries, were available (in addition to your breakfast entree). The drinks were also excellent, including the passion fruit margarita. Maroma is a very different experience from the cookie-cutter resorts I've known (and formerly loved). It feels like a more authentic experience. What distinguishes it from its competitors (in my humble opinion) is its seclusion (a far more private resort than others nearby), its authenticity, its excellent staff, and its amazing food. I would definitely return and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect\u201d", "Author": "JVC1967", "ReviewID": "UR97817654", "Content": "After reading the numerous excellent reviews of Maroma, we decided to give it a try and in most aspects it was near perfect. The setting is beautifully laid out with spectacular views and overall the property is excellently maintained. The staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. They work incredibly hard and are always pleasant and kind to their guests. And considering most people will eat all their meals there, the food is great and prepared well. A couple things stopped us from giving it 5 stars though. First, while the staff in the restaurants tries hard, a little more training is needed. A couple times the wait staff forgot we were seated and never came to our table until we had to get up and find them, another time my husband was brought the wrong dinner order so I had my dinner 15 minutes before his and a few times the waiters brought us meals for intended for another table. And one other thing, Maroma DOES allow children. There were several children there on our last stay. All were well behaved but we asked the management about this. Their response was \"Oh, you caught us. We do allow children when a VIP guest comes\". This sounds like a policy that is waiting to backfire on the Maroma. These are the difference between a 4 and 5 star resort. When you are paying in excess of $1,000 a day, things need to be near perfect and they almost were. The vacant property directly to the north of Maroma is rumored to become a Four Seasons.

At the time, we truly enjoyed our experience and were delighted with our stay. But now, a year and a half later I feel like I must leave a comment for others considering Maroma....why? because other resorts just aren't matching up...in a sense, Maroma has spoiled us rotten. Pros Service is pleasant, welcoming and not forced in any way. Food, fantastic. Our worst meal was actually when we went into town. They do a great job at Maroma of making dishes that are ethnic but still palatable to americans. The Beach is calm and beautiful. It is cleaned everyday of seaweed and you are relaxing on a nice bed (if i'm not mistaken, everyone gets a bed). The service on the beach for us was extremely attentive and friendly. Clientele... if seeing this in the Pros column resonates with you, I need not explain further. But if you are looking for quiet and relaxing, you want to be surrounded by the same mentality. Our experience was just that. That doesn't mean people don't talk mind you, we met some great people who we'd spend afternoon and evenings talking to. Its hard to explain I guess, but there is something to be said about everyone there leaving their problems at home. Maybe thats a credit to the service, I dunno. No kids...its not that we don't like kids...its that not all kids are angels...and you don't want a devil on your trip. okay, Cons The room was somewhat small...no TV and the toilet was behind a saloon style door. To be honest this didn't really bother us, its more to prepare you for what you are going to see. The room is adequate for the amount of time you spend in there...I wasn't sure how I would feel about no TV, but it actually set a nice tone for our time there... you don't care after a day or two...and if you do, there is a place to go watch TV. The saloon door toilet issue, well I had to ask my wife to read on the patio a couple times...but it worked out. Nightlife...yeah, there is none...at least not during our stay. we might have a drink or two after dinner but that was about it. I'm putting this under a con because it is fun to meet and talk with other people, but keep in mind there are only 60 something rooms at Maroma...its not a packed place. (Pro) To wrap it up.... Maroma may not be perfect, but it was perfect for what we wanted. They clearly worked very hard at making our stay pleasant and enjoyable. And we are learning more and more each trip how lucky we were with our experience at Maroma. we have recommended Maroma to others who have walked away feeling the same way as we did and we will continue to do so. So to the staff at Maroma, please continue to provide a true 5 star service...don't make a lair out of me. And to people considering Maroma, I wish you the best in your decision...If you want to do absolutely nothing but sit on a beach and read, you are correct to consider Maroma.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sunshine_1482", "ReviewID": "UR97233697", "Content": "We stayed there a few days for our honeymoon.

We debated whether to try something new (i.e Mandarin Oriental, Tides), but in the end my wife and I decided that Maroma was just too perfect the first time for us to venture away to try a new resort. Let me say that we were very happy with our choice to return, this 2nd trip was even better than the first, and not only because of the location/beach/seclusion/intimacy of resort, etc.. but rather the service this time was flawless, and here's why: The first night we happen to stay on the end of the resort closest to the largest villa. This was a disaster because for such a quiet, peaceful resort it was anything but this. Reason being because there was a very large, LOUD group of young europeans who had ZERO class and kept us (and other guests) up all night. We literally could not sleep until close to 3AM, it was awful. Here's why Maroma is a cut above the rest.... The next morning the manager (I believe his name is Eduardo) completely turned our vacation around. After apologizing over and over he not only moved us to the opposite end of the resort away from the loud villa, but upgraded us to the master ocean suite which was amazing. The next 4 days were perfect and the first night was a thing of the past. Many resorts would have just apologized and moved on with their day, but not Maroma. They are a class act resort, a class act company (Orient Express) and deserving of our business moving forward. Anytime we go to this part of Mexico there is really no need for us to consider staying anywhere else. The white sand beaches and beach beds, the privacy/intimacy of the resort, the great food, and the impeccable service....paradise.

And returning to bitter cold and endless Christmas commercials doesn't help! I've traveled to many luxurious places, but Maroma is a new favorite. If you want an enormous, sprawling resort with lots of nightlife, this is not the place. If you want laid-back luxury, intimacy, quiet, romance, top-notch service, charm, sophistication and a spectacular beach setting, keep reading....Maroma is for you. I'd like to thank all of the previous reviewers, yet again your thoughts and suggestions proved very helpful. After a quick flight, you're whisked away by a friendly driver and a clean SUV w/water, hand towels, etc. A fairly quick ride, and you are there...(sure beats our trips to Hawaii) Like a few of my favorite spots, there is no front-desk/check-in routine. You are given a tour and then shown your room. Rooms are just personal preference, garden-view, suite, etc., but if you want a larger room, spring for the suites. We were in an ocean-view room and it was perfect. A little small, but not bothersome. It was open and airy. And hammock, huge tub w/rain shower. Nice art and authentic Mayan touches-- you feel like you're in someone's home rather than a 5 star resort that's over-the-top, trying too hard to maintain their 5 stars. Maroma is not stuffy, which we loved. Most importantly, the BEACH. One of the finest stretches of private beach I've ever seen. And I guess you could call me a beach snob. I like my beaches! I'm not going to pay big money to stay at a beach resort with sub-par beaches. Pools are nice, but it's the beach that gets me. This one is clean, immense, wide, private and great for wading or serious swimmers. (It's even roped-off in deep water which is helpful for laps) There are beach beds, quick service with a smile, and a view that transports you into eternal bliss. I do hope that they eliminate the tolerated bad habit of saving beach chairs/beds. I'm told mgmt is ordering more beds, so that should eliminate the problem. 30 mins is one thing, but putting your book down at 8am not to return until 11am is unfair to other guests. But for those of you going during high season, they should have more beds, and also--keep walking...the further you go down the beach, the more beds there are, which you don't really see on your first day! FOOD-Excellent. Portion, flavors, variety. Enough said. I'm not an expert foodie, but each plate was vibrant, delicious and fresh. Authentic. The chef and his staff did a magnificent job. Next time I'm doing a cooking class! And the waitstaff hustled. They were always on their toes, wanting to please. And like other reviewers have noted, you can order from various menus, ask the chef for variations, switch entrees and apps, etc. You get the picture. The alcohol is pricey, but we kept it in moderation (and brought some wine with us). And yes--spend time at the beach bar. It's friendly, cozy, and the margaritas are excellent. And again, great service with a smile. Oh--and one of my concerns...water. Potable water is free here, and that is where they could really get you, charging for water...but they don't, thankfully, and there are free bottled waters in your room and available at meals. (And Evian, Fiji, Pelligrino for those of you that prefer that) And yes--the included breakfast is deeelicious! And it's not just muffins and juice--a very plentiful menu! And yum, Mexican hot chocolate... No car needed. Sometimes when you don't rent a car, you feel trapped. Not here. You feel like you're guests of honor in someone's beautiful home, and we never even felt the need to leave. But yes, if you want to see Mayan ruins, go into town, or take one of their tours, they'll happily set it up for you. SPA. Wow. Best massage my husband and I have had in a long time. Beautiful, beautiful spa, without trying to hard. I've been to some nice spas, but the setting and service here was top-notch. Special touches. I don't want to ruin it for first-timers, but this is one area that helps set this resort apart from others. From turn-down service, coffee service in the morning, mid-day thirst-quenchers on the beach, and candle-lit pathways at night, I was impressed by the details. I like having no TV's in the room--but they have TV/internet/lounge rooms that satisfy that craving. The Reef snorkel was fun, but we weren't impressed with the reef. Perhaps the section of the reef we visited is just a smaller section, not too vibrant, etc. Because if that's the 2nd largest reef in the world, you come w/high expectations. But then again I've been fortunate enough to visit the Great Barrier Reef, so everything pails in comparison. The guys who run the snorkel/dive/marina spot are friendly, helpful and do a good job. Another thing we liked about Maroma is not having to think about tips and costs at each meal or activity. But they will happily print you a receipt per meal so you can keep track, verify, etc. Fitness Center: I was pleasantly surprised, the fitness center was great. New-ish Cybex machines, free weights, balls/mats, treadmills (they worked fine, but I hope to see new ones next time I go) bikes, elliptical-style machines...It was cool, clean and well-maintained. The right size for the resort, not huge, but not cramped. I just wish you didn't have to pay extra for yoga, but it's nice that it's offered, as well as other classes. POOLS-We saw two beautiful pools and swam in one of them. (The heated one!) Gorgeous, tranquil, clean...and just a stone's throw from the beach. And beds there too... I wish I could thank the staffers individually, because they make your stay so enjoyable. There is an enthusiasm, genuine smiles, and a work ethic that is very impressive. And if there was ever a stumble, they'd work hard to make up for it. And if you try your Spanish, they will be happy to help you along and teach you new words. One thing I really like about this resort is the size. 65 rooms. So again you feel like you're guests in someone's home. They learn your name, and it doesn't take 20 minutes to find your room. And when it's low season, it's even quieter. Heavenly. And unfortunately, the resort is pricey, but like others have said, it was worth it. A very relaxing vacation. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Maroma! Feel free to email me w/any questions.

But a few minor hiccups spoiled my unreserved recommendation... Firstly, my room was not available upon arrival; the hotel knew when I was arriving, they even picked me up at the airport, yet when I arrived on time, housekeeping was still working on the room. Secondly, the showers in the room seemed incapable of delivering truly hot water, warm yes, but hot no... This may just be the particular room, as I had a hot shower in another room prior to departure... However the biggest disappointment was some aspects of the service; room service and the restaurant were flawless, however coffee service in the morning, and turn down service at night was patchy at best ... bar service was occasionally \"forgetful\", and the worst was the lack of available beach service. don't get me wrong, the guys at the beach are great, but the service was confused (at the bar) and there were not enough staff on the beach to cover the guests adequately. To their credit, management responded very positively when we raised these issues and we noticed an improvement thereafter, but the overall experience was not what we expected of a $1000+/day resort. Of note, when I felt unwell one day the management were very helpful, offered a doctor, and brought me some chicken soup, and a TV+DVD player at no cost ... much appreciated!

We rarely return to a venue but found this one so perfect for its beauty, quiet, understated elegance, and extraordinary level of service that it made for a perfect 4-night getaway of total relaxation. Our second visit exceeded our very high expectations. Without exception, every member of the staff we ran into met us with a smile and greeting and could not have been more warm. Our accommodations (a one-bedroom suite) were spacious and tasteful beyond words. We could easily have just set out on our balcony looking at the ocean for 4 days and had a wonderful time. All of the good things about Maroma have been said many times before. In my prior evaluation (and in those of others), the only weak area has been the on-property food. I'm happy to report that serious progress is being made. Breakfast continues to be, in our opinion, the highlight of the dining experience. Excellent and delicious offerings of Mexican cuisine on the oceanside terrace with the option, of course, to order whatever you'd like, accompanied by fresh fruit and delicious baked goods. Guests may order off any menu for dinner and lunch in the main restaurant, and we prefer the \"Beach\" menu (with many more choices added since our last visit), which can also be personalized. On most nights, we were happy to eat a late breakfast, skip lunch, and eat dinner (usually chicken quesadilla) at the beach bar in the company of the most amiable of bartenders - Freddy or Fillip. Both make you feel like you're part of the family. Just to give a fair evaluation, we also tried El Sol and the main menu at El Restaurante and found both restaurants to be much improved from our last visit 6 months ago. El Sol now boasts a menu that includes tapas and small portions. Kudos to management for hearing the concerns and making adjustments. Be prepared to learn some spanish, as the staff takes pleasure in assisting willing guests with a few phrases. So good are they that when I got to the ticket counter at Cancun for our return flight and greeted the agent in spanish, he started a full-bore conversation with me in spanish, necessitating a quick explanation of my limited vocabulary. One last anecdote and then I'll stop. The last time we visited, we bought an arbol de la vida (a ceramic \"tree of life\") from the gift store which by the way, has a wonderful inventory of authentic crafts. We wanted to get a few more of them for holiday gifts and emailed Maroma before our arrival and asked if they could arrange to have a few on premises to choose from and avoid our having to take a taxi to Playa del Carmen. Sure enough, when we arrived the gift shop remembered our request and had brought in an assortment for us to look at. Yes, I know it meant a sale, but to me, that epitomizes the type of individual attention and service that distinguishes this property. There is a sincerity to the service at Maroma that resonates with us. Most seasoned travelers are accustomed to the forced smiles and the subtle (and even not-so-subtle) sense of imposition and resentment that can sometimes accompany a response to request. Similarly, at some places the sincerity seems hyperbolic and uncomfortable and the service hovering and suffocating. Not so here. At Maroma, the smiles seemed genuine, the service at just the right level of \"presence\", and there was never a moment when we didn't feel welcome and appreciated. Maroma is now our \"go to\" place for a quick getaway from the northeast.

Within one month we were here. We are on day 2 of our dream vacation and NOT disappointed. The beach covered in powder like sand without shells. The water is like bathwater. There are small waves in the afternoons. We spent many hours just floating in the water today. The service is exceptional. Moses is our favorite so far. He truly wants everything to be \"special\". As stated by others these people make you feel like they would do anything to make every moment unforgettable. The spa couples massage was wonderful today (my husband's first massage) The rainforest setting is magical. We spent time separately in the sauna, steam room and plunge pool then sat outside near the waterfall in complete serenity. Tonight we went to try Freddy's famous margaritas. We were not disappointed! We had appetizers and skipped dinner. We think the menu variety is superb. If you don't like what they have they will make you anything you want. Last night we selected our own fish and side items. Try the caesar and tortilla soup!! Tomorrow we plan on snorkeling about 1mile off shore at the world's second largest barrier reef. As for our accommodations: we stayed in cilantro and splurged for a master beach front suite no 56. It is the top suite at the right end. It is upstairs and has the best view. We can see the pool to our left and the ocean for miles. We highly reccomend this resort/spa and can't wait to come back. We are here two weeks before high season begins and a great special taking place. There are less than 20 people here and at times we feel like we have the whole resort to ourselves.

The food is of good quality although for a 5 day stay the menu is somewhat repetitive. Specially deserts - I know it's maybe a silly detail but for me food indulgence is part of the vacation experience. The dessert menu didn\u00b4t change during my stay - always the same few options for lunch and dinner. Apart from theme nights the main restaurant's menu is always the same. However I have to say that Breakfast is excellent. Almost all staff in both restaurants are very friendly however we did find one of them to be rude and always had an angry face, so we just avoided his area of service - no big deal but when paying 1000USD a night you would expect consistent service from all employees. Something that really upseted us was that on the left side of the hotel there is a cheminee and they burned something there every afternoon during our stay (I have no idea what). The problem is that the wind is coming from that direction so we couldn\u00b4t stay in our terrace during the afternoon because of the smoke and smell. We made a comment to a staff member but nothing was done about it. Regarding the rooms, both were really nice. However the water of the plunge pool in the Sian Nah suite is very cold, so we didn\u00b4t used it - therefore I would say that the junior suite is better value for money. Again, this is an excellent resort, one of the best in the Caribbean... but I think that when you reach the level of 1000USD per night all the details matter - But I have confidence that Maroma management will try to improve these!", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cEstupendo\u201d", "Author": "voyageur \u00e0 paris", "ReviewID": "UR76205974", "Content": "Maroma is a beautiful hotel,where the service is impeccable.

There, we were greeted by an attentive polite gentleman whose welcome to Mexico set the stage to what awaited us at Maroma Resort and Spa. Upon our arrival, Laura's welcome, as well as our refreshing Margarita Maroma's, to the hotel began our journey that would last for our week's stay. Our week in paradise consisted of superb food personalized to tastes, outstanding service and a very special feel of traditional timeless warmth. Everything from the architecture to the original furniture and pottery throughout the hotel, and especially our discussions of Mayan language and culture from our hosts has made our five-year anniversary one that is all honesty surpassed our expectations and will forever be immortalized in our memory. I would like to take some time to thank particular friends that we will always be thankful for making our stay \"perfecto\": Senor Ansielmo, whose morning \"special\" Mayan comida and discussions of his culture began our daily journey with guava juice and a smile Senor Moises, whose friendliness and attentiveness to our every detail made it hard for us to say bye A very special note of thanks and appreciation to my amigo nuevo Filiberto, who really took the time to establish for me an appreciation for tequila. From sangrita's of mango, tomate y tamarindo that I never knew of, to the recognition of the tastes and essences of a reservado y un anejo that I will always remember whenever I order tequila. A great deal of thanks to Senor Manuel from hospitality for setting up a perfect adventure to Coba, Tulum, the Cenotes, and Playa de Carmen. His assurance in making our day memorable and unique by setting up our day with senora Gabriela Calderon Aviles (Guide*) and senor Johnathan (Taxi), is one that we will always remember. Our adventures with Johnathan and Gabby not only ended with over 100 pictures for us the remember, but also a wealth of knowledge that we could never have experienced alone as well as a special lunch at Don Cafeto with senor Johnathan.

The toilet was behind \"saloon-style\" doors, which was a bit odd and did not quite provide privacy (but I would not say this detracted from the overall comfort of the room, though.)

Having delicious coffee delivered to the room each morning to be enjoyed on the balcony was also a nice touch. The spa was nice and the gym was fine. We did the temazcal, which is similar to a sweat lodge where you go into a special hut with a small group of people and an instructor/leader. Hot lava rocks are brought in and the room gets progressively hotter. It was a very interesting and enjoyable experience. Hitting the ocean afterward was perfect.

I am so thrilled that we decided on Maroma as we had such a great vacation there! From the moment you drive up, prepare to feel pampered and genuinely welcomed by the staff at the resort. They are so friendly but the service does not feel forced at all, like I have experienced at other 4-star properties. Even though we were staying at Maroma when they were hosting a wedding with 40 guests, which meant almost a 1/3 of the guests at the property were attending the wedding, we never felt ignored or like we were receiving less than great service due to their focus being on the wedding. I will attempt a detailed review below, as we relied heavily on Tripadvisor when making our decision on where to stay. Rooms: We had an Oceanview room booked through a luxurylink.com package. Room 22...we were in the main building, near El Restaurante. I was concerned at first that there could be noise as a result of being located in the main building, but we never heard a peep at night. The room was on the third floor which meant that our terrace offered maximum privacy. The terrace was comfortably large and included a built-in comfy bench and a table. The room itself was small but more than adequate for our needs. The bed was very comfortable. The A/C worked great and since we like our bedroom extra cold at night we pumped the A/C down alot every night, but it continued to work great the 5 nights we were there. The bathroom, as other reviews have mentioned, was smallish but again, adequate. I would not call the bathroom luxurious by any stretch, but it was comfortable. We thought it offered plenty of privacy, as there was a door that closed off the shower and toilet area from the sink area, contrary to what others have said about other rooms. We liked having no TV in the room. Beach: FANTASTIC! Sand is so soft, and beds are great. We never had a problem getting a beach bed. The service provided at the beach is great too...a mid-morning snack of fruit juice and skewers and ice cream around 2pm...fantastic. Not much else to say about the beach that others have not discussed. Food: As others have said, the food is expensive. And the wine list is not great...we actually had to send a bottle of pinot noir back one night at dinner. But, the quality of the food is great and we did not mind paying for it. The guacamole and homemade chips are great, as was the ceviche. On our last night there was a seafood BBQ, and my husband had the best chilean sea bass he had ever eaten. The hashbrowns at breakfast were not great, but that was literally the only bad thing I had here. We ate every meal at El Restaurante, the main one on the property, and never got bored. The Mexican eggs benedict at breakfast was to die for. Spa: Great, very relaxing. Just walking around the spa is fantastic, it is so peaceful and beautiful. We had massages and facials, and we both agreed the massage was better than the facial. The steamroom and sauna in the locker rooms are also great, and can be used any time. Pools: there are 3 pools on the property. As noted in other reviews the \"pool scene\" is not what this place is about...stay elsewhere if that is what you want. The pools here are, however, secluded and relaxing, and never crowded. We enjoyed ending our day in the pool with a swim before dinner after a day on the beach...very refreshing. The pool was so close to our room that it felt like we had a private pool, which was great. Bottom Line: If you are trying to decide between Maroma and Secrets, stay here if you want to spend quality time with your significant other for a vacation you won't soon forget. The potential extra expense from the food, drinks, etc will be worth it. We enjoyed not having to fight for beach space, and not having obnoxious people and blasting music around all the time. The staff at this resort really cares about their jobs, which makes staying here so enjoyable.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cParadise found...\u201d", "Author": "mmdesjardins", "ReviewID": "UR64334638", "Content": "We flew 40 of our family and friends for our wedding in Mexico.

Maroma Resort & Spa is truly a paradise not to be missed. I had read all of the glorious reviews ahead of time and our experience there far exceeded what I had imagined ahead of time. :) :) :) We stayed at Maroma for our honeymoon for 4 nights and 5 days and it rained every day except for the day we first arrived....and I can STILL say this was the best trip I have ever had and the very best resort I have stayed at. The staff at Maroma is like none other and every person we encountered made us feel like the most special people there. The secluded and private atmosphere makes you feel like a VIP from the start and everyone at Maroma continues that feeling during your stay. We reserved an oceanview room and upon arrival we were upgraded to a beachfront room (Room 29) in the main building and from our window we could see Freddy's bar below and the restaurant off to the right side....we loved it! The rooms had character and we especially enjoyed the nightly turndowns and special letters and notes we would receive. :) We also loved the daily coffee and tea delivery to our room every morning! Considering it rained almost the entire time, we appreciated the location because we were close to everything! :) I ordered a rose petal turndown on our first night and it was absolutely gorgeous and we came home to a super romantic candlelight tub with rose petals....great way to start our honeymoon. ;) We had originally planned to have a private beach dinner as well as a private dinner at the Mirador, but rain cancelled both of those plans...but...Maroma to the rescue. :) Narcisco (who is an absolute treasure!!!) surprised us with a private dinner in the wine cellar the night of the planned beach dinner and the table was decorated so beautifully with flowers....just awesome. :) The night of our planned Mirador dinner, again we were surprised with a beautifully decorated table at El Sol and we were able to have the dinner menu we had originally planned for the beach dinner! Maroma provides so many lovely details during your stay, you can't help but feel loved there. :) We really want to thank Narcisco for helping to make our dinners there so lovely and wonderful....he was a great help throughout our stay and Maroma is very lucky to have him there!!! :) We also want to thank Anselmo for the amazing service he always provided at breakfast every morning....we always looked forward to seeing him. Additionally, Gilberto, Miguel & Pablo were always there greeting us with smiles and warm welcomes and we always appreciated that. :) The few hours we did have sunshine on that first day, we were treated like royalty thanks to Daniel at the beach and Gabriel always greeted us whenever he saw us...he felt like an old friend! :) Although we never got to hang out at Freddy's bar due to the rain, we did finally meet the infamous Freddy indoors and he is as cool as we anticipated. :) We really enjoyed chatting with him! He made me a tamarindo margarita that was out of this world!! Finally, we wanted to thank Jaime and Miguel at El Sol. They both provided excellent, excellent service during our 3 dinners there and in particular, Jaime. :) He is just the sweetest man and he made us feel like kings. It was a joy to see him every evening and he is also a great treasure at Maroma. :) As everyone mentions....the stay will cost you a pretty penny....but it is SO WORTH IT!!!!! :) You can't match that kind of service anywhere else (at least in my experience so far) and the location is just out of this world....from the rooms to the beach.....paradise, paradise, paradise. My husband promised me we will go back one day so we can have our beach dinner and one at the Mirador. :) I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could truly go on and on about every detail of our stay, but you have to have some surprises when you go yourself....so go already!!!! :) :) :) Book a trip and go there now!!! :) :) :) hahaha! Thank you to Maroma for an unforgettable honeymoon!!!! P.S. Don't forget to make a trip to Kinan Spa...my husband and I had massages (Lomi Lomi for me and deep tissue for him) and we were able to have a big room to enjoy the massages side by side AND we got to enjoy time in a jacuzzi decorated (as always) with beautiful flower petals....amazing!!! :)", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Magical Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "landshark75", "ReviewID": "UR61769831", "Content": "My wife and I have stayed in some very nice high-end hotels over the years. However, the setting and service at Maroma far exceeds anything we have ever experienced. We stayed there for 5 nights in April 2010 to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary. We chose to rent a Jeep at the airport and make our own way down to the hotel which we're glad we did because it gave us the freedom to come and go as we pleased and take excursions off the property on our own when we wanted. Finding the hotel wasn't easy and we passed up the main entrance several times before locating the main gate. At first this was a little frustrating but when we finally found it the fact that the hotel entranced is not well marked on the main road significantly added to the allure of the place. Many other luxury hotels in the area have monstrous gates that you cannot miss but we loved the seclusion of Maroma and it's long winding gravel road from the main highway to the hotel lobby. It felt like a hidden gem. Upon arrival at the gate, a staff member took our name down and let us through. When we arrived at the main lobby, we were greeted by name and offered complimentary margaritas (the best we've ever tasted; so good in fact that we each ordered one again every day during our stay!). We were given a short tour of the property and led up to our room where we completed the quick check-in process. Our room was an ocean view room on the 2nd floor of a building adjacent to the main building. We were set back a couple hundred feet from the beach which was just far enough to experience the beautiful view and warm ocean breeze while maintaining complete privacy and tranquility. The room was somewhat small by most standards however the size was overcome by ambiance and character and the large balcony out front with two chairs, a table, a built-on sofa along one wall and a very comfortable hammock (which holds two!). We spent quite a bit of time on the balcony and really enjoyed it. We ate breakfast there (room service) every morning except one day when we ate at the restaurant. One thing to note about the room itself! It provides little to no privacy. There is an open shower that doesn't have a shower curtain and the saloon-style door to the bathroom doesn't leave much to the imagination when you or your significant other are using it. However, if you're completely comfortable with your significant other you will not find these items to be a problem. The beach at Maroma is unbelievable. It has the softest sand I have ever felt and is the whitest I have ever seen. Every morning they rake up any weeds or trash that have drifted in from the sea. It is spotless. There are a variety of options for enjoying the beach including large beach beds, loungers and Adirondack chairs under thatch roof umbrellas. I loved sitting in the Adirondack chairs on the beach with a cold margarita and just covering my feet with the cool, soft, clean sand. It was wonderful. On the day of our anniversary, I had previously arranged for my wife and I to have a special private dinner in the Mirador (a tower at the top of the hotel). The 360-degree views of the region and the property were spectacular! The food we were served (prepared by our chef, Felipe) was incredible and the hotel's sommelier gave us a wine pairing with each course that was spot on! Our server Luis (El Conde!) was fantastic and was very good about bringing each course at the right time and making sure that we had everything we needed. This was a very romantic experience and my wife and I cherished every moment of it. Other activities we did at the hotel included horseback riding on the beach (fun but we've had a better horseback riding experience elsewhere), treatments at the Kinan Spa (excellent and very tranquil), snorkeling on the reef (very worthwhile and would definitely do it again) and the Tezmacal (an awesome experience; glad we did it but probably would not do it again). Lastly, a word about the service. We were treated like royalty or celebrities (neither of which we are) every single day! The staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. If we wanted to move a chair and I would begin to move it, a staff member would appear quickly from out of nowhere to assist. Any special requests, no problem. We ate at El Sol one night and I ordered something completely off the menu. No problem. The staff seemed able to accommodate our every desire. Definitely go and enjoy Maroma! If you're concerned about reports that the cost is high (and it is) know this: It is worth every penny!", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cNo \"no's\"\u201d", "Author": "AirMilesLuvr", "ReviewID": "UR61108242", "Content": "After much research & debate over where to stay, we settled on Maroma as it appeared to meet our needs. We were looking for a relatively small/intimate property, not family/children oriented, luxury service & direct beach location. Not only did Maroma meet our needs, it surpassed our expectations! However a fair review you will get. POSITIVES: -Although I've had friends rave about the Bayan & Mandarin Oriental, they completely agree that paying such high prices without being on the beach is ridiculous. We enjoyed the most amazing, uncrowded & clean beach daily from our villa directly on the beach. Fantastic. -During our entire 5 night stay & despite any & every special request we made, we did not hear the word \"no\". Not even once. We were accommodated each & every time & always with the best of dispositions & warm smile. I've traveled the world, always at 5 star properties & had never before experienced this. -Since the property doesn't allow anyone under 16, we were never disturbed by any children. For those that don't have kids, this is obviously great. But even for those that do, as we met a couple who purposely chose this hotel as their 1st romantic getaway from their infant child & didn't want to be bothered with others'. -The food (even from room service) was great. --The property offers a romantic candlelight dinner on the beach (it's on the website). I highly recommend this dinner for any couple looking to do something special. NEGATIVES: -Although the food is in fact great, it lacks variety. By the 6th day, I don't know of many people who will not be fed up with Mexican food. It is also overpriced, as we paid close to US$20 for a salad that was lettuce with a few tomatoes thrown in. Not kidding. -We reserved a standard room w ocean view. Although this was technically what we were given, the fact that it was in the main building & directly over the restaurant made us feel like we'd be staying in the help's quarters. Not only would the noise never allow you to fall asleep & wake you up the moment they begin serving breakfast, you have zero privacy while on your balcony. We upgraded to a villa whose price ended up being more than what we were originally quoted, but was SO worth it!

The color of the Caribbean Sea is turquoise and it is extremely clear. I have a hard time leaving to eat. Speaking of eating, the breakfast is wonderful and it is included with the rate plan. We think the Huevos Motulenos is gourmet. We eat late for breakfast and usually eat a dinner meal as well. The dinner is very good. If you are there during the night they have \"grill night\", don't miss it. It was gourmet!! They have a snorkle trip to the second largest reef in the world. It is worth the time spent doing this.

Having been enchanted by Maroma during our first visit in 2004 and lucky enough to have stayed in the same room that Tom Cruise occupied, we had always intended to return for the special type of hospitality offered by this beautiful resort. True, there had been not one but two hurricanes in the tim since our visit and the hotel had been devastated by both. Also true that two other resorts, one an all-inclusive, had been built just down the beach. How would they impact the scene? We frankly wondered if our little slice of Mexican heaven would be the same, which explains why we tried Villa del Sol in Zuatinejo, Sandy Lane and Cap Juluca numerous times, before returning. While those other resorts offer their own special experiences (we remain concerned about Cap Juluca's new ownership and plans to expand) we can report that Maroma has pretty much covered all the bases and offers two things the others don't: (1) greatly improved fitness and spa services, along with expanded choices for eating and (2) the most sincere and friendly staff we have yet had the pleasure to experience. Names? Oh yes, Moses at Cilantro waited on us for breakfast and lunches, with attentive, perfect service, always followed with \"it is my pleasure [to serve you]\". Knew our names and remembered them, knew our likes and introduced us to the pleasures of Pineapple an Chaya, a most refreshing drink like no other. Then there is Anselmo, who works at other primary (casual) restaurant (next to del Sol). He was certainly special in his own way, charming, friendly, a great story teller and a local of Mayan ancestry who personally directed a special ordered Mayan breakfast on our last day, taught us Mayan phrases and introduced us to his brother, also a waiter. Anselmo and Moses were stand-outs in a stellar staff, and hopefully if those at the resort are reading this, they will be lauded for their efforts. We again met Nancy who operates the Temazcal (clay pyramid sauna). I will not describe it here as it is well characterized by others on the site and in the Maroma webpage. I will say that we have now done it three times (2 x in 2004, 1x last week) and highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about Mayan culture, are organic-oriented eaters or enjoy Yoga and the like. It's a wonderful experience and Nancy is truly devoted to her craft. Everyone else, including the woman who sits at a stool and makes tamale shells in a clay pot (she'll show you if you'd like to make them yourself), all five stars. The Kinan Spa, which had not been built the last time we visited was a place we spent too much time and money, but it was well worth it. Rueben performs a Thai massage that is relaxing in the extreme. We also had chocolate-based massages followed by a couples jacuzzi, and a couples 80 minute massage, all perfectly executed. The spa is architecturally in harmony with the Mayan theme and a place to easily spend an entire day reading or sitting by a pond of trickling water. Our trip was a perfect 10 out of 10, off to a great start when the hotel was unable to honor our request for the \"Tom Cruise suite\" this time around, and instead upgraded us to a villa-sized suite with private gym, his and hers dressing areas, inside and outside showers, soaking tub, 270 degree ocean view living room, king sized bed, day bed outside, hammock, two ponds, fully stocked wine cellar and snack bar and privacy, privacy privacy!!!

And offer the observation that when one\u2019s expectations are so very high and there are so many opportunities for lapses, there will undoubtedly be some. But in my opinion, they are minor and do not affect my overall perception that this place is pretty darn close to perfection. The transportation from the airport went well. Don\u2019t be distracted by the gauntlet of private transportation companies trying to convince you that you need to deal with them to secure your ride. We had a comfortable vehicle with cool facecloths and water. Upon arrival, we were given a marguerita and a tour of the premises. Our guide was a well-meaning and pleasant intern. Being in a service business myself, I understand how important first impressions are, and I would not have had a guest be met and introduced to the property by an intern. While fine, she naturally lacked some of the polish I would have expected, and I wonder if some of our uncertainty about various services would have been clarified at this juncture. We had paid for an oceanfront room and received one (#32) in the main, older building. The difference between cozy and cramped is a matter of perspective. This was right on the line. We did ask our intern guide about a possible room change but she never got back to us. The great part about the room, however, was its convenience to the beach, the bar, and the restaurants. We could easily drop in and out during the day to check email or whatever. I guess the message is to try to find out in advance what room availability is and try to snag one that meets your preferences. Kudos to the property for having free facility-wide wi-fi. In fact, I\u2019m sitting at the outdoor bar at 6:30 am right now doing this review in draft. Service is amazing. The guy washing the floor behind the bar just asked if I would like any coffee. It seems like everyone here is committed to guest satisfaction. They all make an effort to learn guests\u2019 name and call them by name at every opportunity. Coffee/tea arrives as promised on our patio every morning. And, yes, there are candles along the walkways still. Turn down took place every night while we were at dinner. A shout-out here to Carlos and Fili, the nighttime bartenders. Carlos is an amiable host at the outdoor bar (where we stopped enroute to dinner every night) and makes the world\u2019s best bloody mary. This was our first \u201crelaxing\u201d vacation where a big part of the day is spent doing nothing on the beach. This is a perfect place for that. The beach is immaculate and uncrowded. Of course people from other properties walk along the water, but hey, it\u2019s a public beach and it\u2019s not a big deal. In fact, as we walked up and down the beach, it made us appreciate the quality of our own beach even more. And the mid-morning cool drink and the afternoon sorbet cone (hopefully these won\u2019t show up on our bill!) were nice touches and exemplify the small details that in the aggregate make this such an extraordinary place. Someone earlier mentioned hearing music at night from an adjacent property. That happened to us one night (out of six) also. It wasn\u2019t so bad, but I did talk (not complain) to the manager so I could get some information to pass along in this review. Apparently, that is the second time this has happened, and it\u2019s not the adjacent hotel per se, but private parties that it hosts. As you will see when you walk the beach, the other hotel is much more a spring break destination than Maroma! Maroma management is jumping on the problem and working with management of the other property, and I would not worry about it. And kudos to the management for taking the time to talk with me about it. They most assuredly care about preserving the very high and well-deserved reputation of the property and take the observations of guests quite seriously. We abandoned our commitment to vegging on the beach for 6 days to take two trips off premises. We took a taxi to Playa del Carmen for an afternoon to see the town and hopefully pick up some hand-crafted pieces that serve as souvenirs of our various travels. Sadly, it is a pretty tacky place, and the shops that Fodors had recommended for such things were long gone. We did find (and recommend) two places for better quality items. The first is Yulunga, located at Calle 14 Norte off 5th Avenue, with beautiful and fairly priced handcrafted silver jewelry made by the co-owner. The other shop we liked was Caracol, on 5th between Calle 6 and 8, offering a wide variety of quality Mexican crafts, including a selection of ceramic arbol de la vida (trees of life), which we had never seen before. We were pleased to find that the shop on the hotel premises itself had high quality crafts and other items as well, staffed by very knowledgeable and friendly salespeople. Unlike most high-end hotel shops, the offerings were priced quite competitively and fairly. We also took a day trip to Chichen Itza (we got the CI package for 3 of our nights here, which I think is cheaper than paying for the trip by itself when dinner is added in). We also had the Richard/Galo combination and enjoyed the trip very much. It would be hard to imagine being this close and not seeing this stunning sight. Finally, a word about the food. As mentioned before, the restaurant staff was attentive and professional and service was fine. The live music every night was a nice touch. The food itself, however, was just ok, and pretty expensive for the quality, which was, frankly, less than we expected. Although Maroma itself is very expensive (and worth it!), we were not keen to overpay for food on top of it, and the logistics of eating off premises are difficult. The trick here, which we learned a few days into our stay, is that there is no need to limit yourself to the menu offered, so you can get something light. Our strategy was to eat breakfast (included in the room charge) late in the morning, skip lunch, and order off the lighter and less expensive lunch menu at dinner, which was just fine with the restaurant. It\u2019s not like we were burning calories big time sitting on the beach, so eating a big meal at dinner wasn\u2019t a high priority. Mid-afternoon on some days, we did succumb to the Maroma nachos at the beach bar; they are delicious and held us over nicely. We didn\u2019t use the spa, but everyone who did absolutely raved about it. It is a beautiful facility. My wife took the yoga class one morning and reports that it\u2019s not for novices, but was in a spectacular setting and the instructor was very good. She reports (I wouldn\u2019t know) that the fitness center was very well equipped. A one-hour walk on the beach provides a good workout as well. We have traveled the world extensively and stayed in some of the nicest properties. Except for the room size and food, Maroma met our very high expectations handily. We recommend it without reservation. It\u2019s now 7:15 am, and I\u2019m watching two guys raking up the very small amount of seaweed that washed up on the edge of the beach last night.

Maroma is nestled in a beautiful jungle setting that opens up onto one of the most prestine white sand beaches I have ever seen. From the moment you arrive it is clear that this vacation is all about you. The bellmen are all extremely helpful and courteous. Our room upon arrival was gorgeous. We had a beautiful third story view of the ocean. The beds are adorned with mosquito netting and have a very romatic feel. We were in the main house - the original home from which the resort evolved. It has amazing old world charm with all the comforts you could want. Each morning tea/coffee is delivered to your door at a specified time. The beach is amazing. It is well groomed with people constantly cleaning even the most minor amounts of seaweed. The water is warm and relatively calm. Maroma has lots of beach beds set up as well as chairs set up under thatch huts. The staff is extremely attentive. They set up your towels for you in the morning, constantly check to see if you want drinks or food and there is a free sorbet offered in the afternoons. Just great. There are three pools. One by the Cilantro restaurant, one by the spa and another just off the beach. All are well kept and the one by the beach is nice and warm for a post-beach swim. At night, the main pool at least was surrounded by candles for a very romantic setting. The restaurants are overall very good. El Restaurant is quite good although some additional variation would be nice, although they do \"grill nights\" on Mondays and Fridays to mix things up. While there isn't a lot of variation for breakfast, we thought it was great. There is enough of a difference from Cilantro to El Restaurant to keep it interesting for our one week stay. The best part of breakfast is the women making fresh tortillas and brining them directly to your table still warm. El Sol is a bit overpriced since it is on par with El Restaurant, but the food is very good and its a nice change of pace. We didn't feel the need to leave the property to eat and it seems that many of the guests with us felt the same since we saw the same folks at dinner each night. The outdoor bar is also a great treat. The civiche is excellent and Carlos and Fili (the two evening bartenders) are great fun and very knowledgeable about their tequila. I would say this is primarily a couples focused resort. While there were some families there with older children, I would expect they may get bored in the evenings as it is a bit quiet and there are only two common TVs. There are lots of activities during the day. We had a great snorkeling trip, essentially private with only one other small group, that is close by and beautiful. We did a private tour of Chitzen-Itza which is well worth it. Our tour guide and driver, Galo and Richard, were so friendly and knowledgeable and the ruins are a once in a lifetime experience. We highly recommend doing this. Other than that we primarily enjoyed the resort - the tennis courts, the beach, the pool and enjoyed the peace and quiet for a week. Playa del Carmen is close by and there are some good restaurants there but in our opinion it was somewhat chaotic and the local vendors are somewhat aggressive and we were very happy to return back to Maroma. The one thing to be aware of is the Maroma is expensive, but you get what you pay for. We thought every dollar was well worth it. I have read many of the reviews on this site before going and since returning and think many of them are spot on but I think the ones that give low marks are being overly critical. As with any place, if you want to find flaws, you will. It is set in a jungle setting, there are going to be a few bugs here and there, but nothing that should disturb your stay. The restaurants can be a bit repetative, but if you do ask, the staff is more than willing to bring you something different. Sometimes it does take 5 minutes to get a drink when sitting on the beach, but you're on vacation, I never saw this as a problem. We always felt like everyone there was striving to give us the best stay possible and succeeded. We would absolutely return to Maroma and recommend it to all of our friends. As you arrive the attendants say to you \"Welcome home\" and this is truly how we felt while we were there.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Beach - Service and food need upgrading\u201d", "Author": "Travelscambuster", "ReviewID": "UR58289580", "Content": "We have now had a week to reflect on our experience at Maroma. Overall we enjoyed our stay but do have a few comments and suggestions that significantly improve the overall experience. We want to provide a balanced review because clearly Maroma has a lot of things going for it, especially the beach and overall setting. We thought our pick up, greeting and check-in process were outstanding. We arranged to be picked up at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun and thought that the incremental fee charged for this deviation was reasonable and appropriate. We were disappointed in our original room. It was much too small for 2 people considering that we were staying for 5 nights. There was nowhere to put our luggage and my wife and I kept bumping into each other in such a small space. There was only one chair in the room and therefore only room for one person to sit down at a time unless we used the bed. This room was much more appropriate for a single. We had to upgrade to a junior suite (at an additional cost). The suite did have an ocean view, but only barely. While the suite was much roomier, the only seating was 2 very uncomfortable straight back chairs. A small couch or love seat would have been much more appreciated and would have easily fit into the same space. We booked our trip through Expedia and felt that due to the discounted price we paid through them we were given a substandard room. We thought the beach was world class. The couches, palapas and service at the beach were outstanding. Also the late morning complementary cold beverage of the day and mid-afternoon ice cream snack were great! Special kudos to Sergio, his service was terrific. He knew our names and preferences after one day. Overall we were disappointed with the food quality and especially the pricing. The breakfast menu never varied and got to be boring after the first couple of days. The fresh tortillas were outstanding. Lunch was the best meal, especially the cevice. The lunch menu also had good variety and was reasonably priced. Dinner was a big disappointment in terms of menu, variety and especially price. Why in the world would you think that a lobster dinner was worth $85.? We ate at the Mandarin Oriental one evening in their top restaurant and paid $42. for lobster. We ate at Pavo Real just outside the main gate of Maroma and paid $35 for lobster. BTW - Pavo Real was a great find. It is a beautiful restaurant, in a great setting, reasonable prices and excellent service. The menu is somewhat limited, but the food is at least as good as Maroma and in many cases much better. Maroma never mentions Pavo Real when you ask for restaurant recommendations because once people try it there would be no reason to eat dinner at Maroma. Several other guests discouraged us from eating at El Sol (Maroma's top restaurant) because of quality and price. It was disappointing and inconvienient that we had to go off-site so often for dinner. In general we found the staff to be friendly and attentive. The one exception is the wait staff for breakfast and dinner. While they were friendly they seemed to be poorly trained and disorganized. On multiple occasions we asked for something (a condiment or additional cup of coffee or juice) and it never arrived or we had to ask for it again. They seemed willing to please, but clearly lacked the ability to provide the type of service that you would expect at an Orient Express property. We never used the Spa (not our thing) but did tour it and it appeared to be world class. Would we come back? Probably. However, we would hope that some of these issues were corrected so that the property lives up to what we expect in every area when we book a resort with the Orient Express name attached to it.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful place...but, not as good as last year\u201d", "Author": "tjandfv", "ReviewID": "UR58096125", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our second stay at Maroma Resort. We went last year the same time (end of Feb first few days of Mar) and loved it so much we returned this year. While we were very pleased to have a wonderful oceanfront room this year and terrific weather, we were disappointed to experience a decline in service. Housekeeping services were definitely not as good as last year. Our first full day, we returned to the room at 2:30pm to find housekeeping had not yet cleaned the room. I had to call to request service. And, turn down service was almost non-existent. Three of our five nights we returned to the room after dinner to find it was not done. One night we saw the staff downstairs and she told us to return in 30 minutes. The next night I called and they came and cleaned while my husband and I stayed on the terrace. Our last night we returned after dinner to find the room not turned down but, we did not bother calling since we had to pack. Someone came at 9:30pm to turn down but we did not have them bother. Also, the service in the restaurants and on the beach just was not as attentive as it was last year. It was obvious that there was not enough help. This year there seemed to be quite a few smokers on the beach and at the outdoor restaurant.....cigars and cigarettes!! At this level of hotel, Maroma should be smoke-free. Lastly, last year candles lit the walkways everywhere every night. This year that did not happen during our stay. One night there were not candles on the sidewalks and the other nights varied as to how many were out. We missed the full effect of the previous year. Please know the waiters and all staff that are there are nice, helpful and always ready to try to meet your needs. But, the management seems to have decided to go with fewer employees.....definitely a mistake if they want to continue to attract those who are willing to pay the rates at a place such as Maroma. One last suggestion we have is that Maroma consider a little more creativity with the menu. Since there is really only one restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner, some variation would be good. On the positive....Maroma is a gorgeous setting with lovely rooms and a beautiful, soft sand beach with beautiful water. The beach beds are wonderful, the spa is very luxe and the staff does its very best to accommodate your requests. Hopefully, Maroma's management will address some of the above issues.

Still, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I hate the feeling of booking a very expensive hotel and ultimately being disappointed, which seems all too frequent. Happily, Maroma surpassed expectations in all areas. It has an intangible qualities which are hard to put into words in a review; it feels very exclusive but quietly so, very elegant in an old-world way, amazingly beautiful and truly classic with seamless service. When you check in, it is all about you. They wisk your bags away, hand you a drink, and tour you around the property. The small amount of paperwork gets done once you arrive in your room, rather than standing in the lobby. We stayed in a garden-view room, which was lovely and charming but not luxurious. It had a sweet terrace overlooking a beautiful pool and gorgeous landscaping. Turn-down service happened every evening when we were at dinner, and was never a bother. Morning coffee service was like clockwork. Our room was close to the spa, which turned out to be a real advantage. We had breakfast each morning (included in room price) at Cilantro, the spa restaurant. It was a beautiful setting and delicious, healthy food. The spa itself was absolutely gorgeous, and even if you don't have any formal treatments, you can enjoy the relaxing steam room, sauna, and plunge pool-which are all easily accessible on a complimentary basis for all guests. Food at El Restaurante was good, though service varied. Restaurant service seems to be the holy grail of the hotel world. It ranged from very good to somewhat indifferent. Perhaps that staff didn't get the same memo that everyone else did, because by and large the staff was amazing-friendly and helpful. The beach service is over the top, and the beach beds make you feel like royalty. They deliver your food on a tray to your beach bed, which is a very decadent experience. The hotel is more spread out than I expected, but everything is within easy walking distance. Strolling over to the main building at night for dinner was one of the best parts of staying at Maroma. The paths are lined with hundred and hundreds of small candles, and it is hauntingly beautiful and very romantic. My husband and I marveled at the effort involved in doing this every night. It is just one of those touches that makes you feel that you are at a very special place. When you arrive at the main building, a wonderful group of Mexican musicians are playing in the gorgeous lobby. Maroma is an expensive hotel, but it feels exclusive and pampering in a very elegant way.

On my birthday they weren't serving dinner outdoors because it was cold, so they lit a fire and served us dinner. When we didn't want to eat off the menu, they made us whatever we wanted.

I made my reservation on January 9, 2010, to visit Maroma Resort the third week of May. I paid my deposit (approximately $1500) on the day I made my reservation and I bought airline tickets. I just got a call from the hotel, informing me that the hotel just booked a wedding that has reserved the entire resort, and they asked me to change my dates, since the wedding party is going to basicaly be taking over the whole hotel. I advisd them that changing dates is not an option. I booked my flights, and our work responsibilities have been taken care of, and I have lined up care for my 4 year old son so that my husband and I could travel for 4 days. The hotel rep repeatedly asked me if I could change dates. When I said for the 5th time that changing dates was not an option, he told me he would look into alternate accomodations at another hotel in the area. Unfortunatley, he mentioned Rosewood Mayakoba, which I have already visited. So, now I am stuck with plane tickets and no hotel. Let's face it... no one wants to go to a hotel where the entire facility, including beach, restaurant, all rooms, spa, is catering to one event. I am just so frustrated. I have never heard of something like this and the fact that the only thing he kept recomending was that I change my dates is unacceptable. I should get a full refund PLUS interest plus a very nice room in a comparable hotel plus perks for this hassle. I will never visit Maroma Resort....

We have stayed at many hotels in the 100 mile stretch between cancun and tulum. It is a beautiful hotel on a beautiful beach. Really classy, awesome landscaping, gorgeous rooms and views, and very expensive. I have no problem with super expensive hotels, but I do expect certain levels of service for high room rates. These are my beefs. 1. I stayed for 4 nights and got turndown service on 1 out of 4 nights which is pretty much not acceptable. Everynight my husband and I left our room at dinner time to return 3 to 4 hours later, to come back to our made bed and dirty towels on the floor. Good hotels know when you leave for dinner and come sneak in and turn down your bed. They did not at Maroma. However someone would call at about 9:30 and ask if we wanted turndown service and the maid would knock on the door after we were in bed.So I didn't think this was to cool for a 5 star hotel that is supposed to anticipate your needs. 2. The first morning we went down to have breakfast outside on the dining patio .It is quite lovely with fresh bread and fruit delivered to your table, choice of juice and whatever you wanted for breakfast. I sat down and asked for an ashtray. The waiter kind of dissapproving said \" You want an ashtray??\" gesturing to other guest seated 5 tables away. So I figured you can't smoke OUTSIDE even though you can smoke everywhere else in Mexico, but I was like o.k I won't smoke in the dining room and will have my breakfast in the bar with the ashtrays on the table 20 feet away. No problem. So the next day I asked to be seated in the bar for breakfast.... where we were basically ignored. No fruit, no breadbasket until I asked. Which arrived after the food.On an uneven table.As i got up from my rude breakfast ,low and behold there were people smoking on the dining patio. I think this was totally unacceptable, very rude. The waiter did not try and say that I had to move to a certain section of the dining room to smoke, or try and accomodate me in some way. He just blew me off and made me feel quite unwelcome. It you are selling cigars in the dining room, guest should be allowed to smoke. But it would appear that only I was not allowed to smoke. I don't know why, but it was not cool and pissed me off. 3. The beach service kind of sucked.Understaffed .The beach boys were very nice, but they seemed to have 1 waiter trying to serve 100 people on 1000 feet of beachfront. So you waited a long time for a drink or your food. You had to wait a while for towels or to have your beach bed swept off. You had to move your own 300 lb beach umbrella. I stayed at Esencia last year and if you even tried to move your beach chair the beachboys came flying down the beach at a dead run to move it for you. Here they didn't. 4. Couldn't have dinner in the restaurant because all I had was flipflops and boots ( coming from Maine). No \"beach sandals\" in the restaurant for dinner. Which is just stupid. They \"dress for Dinner\". Thanks for letting me know. Again more unwelcoming snotty crap.I understand when its one of the all inclusives trying to keep you out of the sitdown restaurants and in the buffet, but for $600+ a night joint they should let you in with no shoes. So although the hotel is very nice, very intimate and beautiful, I found the service to be lacking, and in my case downright unwelcoming and rude.

I haven't seen a Caribbean resort with such an extensive wine list in a long time. Service at all times in the restaurants was attentive and they could sense the pace you wanted to move and made everything happen according to your needs. Breakfast was complimentary with a large selection, not just toast and coffee but omelettes, pancakes, fresh squeezed juice, etc... The fresh guacamole is to die for. Drinks on the beach are such a nice treat, especially when coming from a cold place up north. There were some special items we did on the trip which included a private tour to Coba, the tour guide was not only knowledgeable but taught us a great deal more about the ruins, the people and the Mayan culture as it is today. I recommend booking the spa ahead of time. The concierge was extremely attentive and responsive to requests within 24 hours of email. One of the highlights of the trip was a fun Tequila tasting class taught by Stephan. He is so much fun and I learned that tequila is much more than what I drank back in college. However, the most special item that I highly recommend is the wine tasting private dinner in the El Sol cellar. the menu was customized to our likes and dislikes and the chef prepared some very impressive dishes that went beyond our greatest expectations. In addition, Alex created the perfect pairings for the menu. The wine list is quite impressive and Maroma deserves to receive its 3 consecutive Wine Spectator award. All in all, the staff is friendly, the food is great, the overall atmosphere is fun. If you are looking for the \"it crowd\" or a trendy spot, this isn't for you. If you want expansive beach, and just pure relaxation its worth every penny.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location, but overpriced and they nickel and dime you.\u201d", "Author": "sunnybear2010", "ReviewID": "UR53649711", "Content": "Maroma is a beautiful resort located on the Riviera Maya.

My advice is the following, if money is of no object or concern, then you will be happy at this hotel. You will be charged $11 for a bottle of water at dinner and the food is extremely expensive and the spa services are overpriced. If you care in the least about your pocketbook, go somewhere else. You can visit the resort for lunch or dinner if you really want to see what it is all about. The hefty price tag is not worth the stay. Also, be wary of the \"gifts\" they give you in the hotel room. A bag of M&M's will cost you $8. We were given a tray of snacks as \"gift\" by one of the staff, later to find out that this was part of the \"mini bar\".

Set among a coconut plantation overlooking white sand beach and pristine light blue waters, it is the place for rest and relaxation. I brought my parents and sister here for a special Christmas vacation and Maroma delivered just what I expected. I have a special thanks to Gabriela Sanchez for being so helpful. I had a ton of questions before our arrival at the resort and she was very good at responding quickly and answering all my questions. We had two ocean view rooms, both with spectacular views. My only regret is not having spent more time on the balcony in my hammock overlooking the ocean. We observed the staff cleaning the beach of seagrass and setting up the outdoor tables for breakfast every morning. Breakfast was always served with fresh pastries, fruit jellies and fresh tropical fruit. My favorite breakfast entree was the Huevos Benedictos. Always served perfectly. It was very windy during most of our stay at Maroma, but the wind was a warm wind so it wasn't cold. You could hear the roar of wind and the ocean crashing against the shore all the time, but this didn't bother us. I would not consider the noise a negative at all, because it was actually very nice soothing background noise and adds character to the resort. We were fortunate enough to have a clear night sky and no wind our last night at Maroma so we laid out on the beach bed and watched the starry sky. To our amazement we saw shooting stars! It was magical and utterly romantic. The staff was genuinely friendly and helpful. We were served homemade passionfruit sorbet in waffle cones on the beach. My sister and I couldn't get enough of this and requested seconds. One of our waiters saw that I was struggling with moving a beach table closer to my lounge chair and ran over immediately to help. Kudos to him for the service! Issues: Both my parents and my rooms were not served our morning coffees. We notified the resort well in advance of our coffee orders for the mornings in our Guest Profiles, and our host confirmed our orders and time of delivery at the end of our resort tour the first evening of our arrival. Since we were going outside of the resort for early tours our first two mornings, we requested to have our coffee served at 6:30 a.m. Neither my parents room nor my room were served. We kept checking and nothing arrived. The same thing happened the next morning, but since it was so early and we were having breakfast anyway it wasn't such a big deal the first two days. It was, however, important to us to wake up with the coffee service for the remainder of our stay. I notified Hospitality services of this issue the second day we were without our coffee. I also changed the time of the delivery thinking perhaps it was too early and unusual for the staff, and also we no longer needed to receive our service that early. We did not receive our coffee a third time. I notified hospitality a second time of the issue, re-emphasizing that this was the third time it had happened, and we were personally reassured we would definitely receive it this time. The same thing happened again, and it was our last morning at Maroma! Normally, something like this would not have upset me, if it had been handled differently by the staff. When I checked out on Saturday, I mentioned this to hospitality services again and they had no idea what happened. When a member of the staff personally guarantees the service will be provided, I expect her/him to follow-up personally. Obviously he/she did not. What was even more upsetting was that the person that helped me during check out said he couldn't really do anything since he did not know of this issue. The response was that this was the first time he was hearing of the complaint and none of the other guests had this issue. I brought this up THREE times with hospitality! And the two women I spoke with previously regarding the issue were sitting right next to him managing the bills! Another issue was the christmas dinners. Before our arrival, I checked with Gabriela what the food programs would be like during the holidays and she informed me of the special prix fixe menus but the entire regular dinner menu would be available if we did not want to participate in the arranged dinners. I'm very particular about what I eat, and I did not want what was offered in the prix fixe. When we arrived at the restaurant for X'mas eve dinner, however, we were told only a special prix fixe dinner was being offered. I explained to them that I was informed that the regular menu would be available, but our waiter explained to us there was only one menu. Instead of making a fuss, I consented thinking that maybe the food will be ok. The problem with mass prix fixe is that the food is cooked beforehand and set in a heat source to stay warm, which dries out the food and overcooks it. This was the problem we encountered with our appetizer (portabello mushroom & crab cake) and entree (beef wellington). It was HORRIBLE! The portabello mushroom was dried out as well as the mayo style garnish decorating the plate. The beef wellington was dry too. I requested something else to see if it was possible to replace the entree with something else. Our waiter returned later to tell us the best he could do is give us a new beef wellington done medium rare. It was better the second time around, but what was supposed to be a fabulous dinner was ruined. AND, what I wanted was the options from the regular menu (which is fabulous by the way), NOT the prix fixe. I guess what happened was the resort changed the plans to offer the regular dinner menu, which is fine, but I was not notified of the changes. I was disappointed this had not been communicated to me in advance and even more disappointed that little effort was made to make up for the mistake. This is a high end boutique resort and my expectations will be no less than that of a high end resort. The food, however, was only terrible ONE evening and fantastic all other times. I blame it on the prix fixe, and preparing too far in advance. Our first dinner at Maroma was wonderful. We had the most amazing seafood. I LOVE fish. I would've preferred just to eat seafood the whole time. I will post some pictures up later, but the texture of the fish my mom and I had, scallops for my dad, chicken for my sister, were perfect. I loved the use of veggies on the side, all grown locally and so delicious. We had lunch at Cilantro on Christmas day and my dad and sister loved their beef wraps. It is difficult to please my dad's palate, and he was very happy with his beef wrap. I ordered the grilled baby vegetables and that was delicious as well. I hope to return soon. Maroma is amazing, but there are certain aspects of the hospitality services that could use improvement.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, One-of-a-Kind Luxury Resort with Exceptional Service\u201d", "Author": "Padrino1", "ReviewID": "UR52314825", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Maroma from December 12-19, 2009 for our belated honeymoon after getting married earlier this year. This was our first trip to Maroma and we were in awe of the incredible beauty and unbelievable service we experienced at this wonderful resort!! For brief background, we are a couple in our early 30's who in the past five years have stayed at a variety of excellent 4 & 5 star resorts throughout the Carribbean (Caneel Bay, Galley Bay, Couples Swept Away, etc.). In deciding where to stay, we specifically look for smaller scale resorts/locales that meet our list of different criteria (i.e., beautiful beaches, wonderful grounds, spacious rooms, great food, charming people) that will allow us to unwind and detach from our hectic lives back home. The Maroma Resort & Spa exceeded our high expectations in every way and we are already dreaming of returning to this very special paradise!! The attention paid to every single detail at Maroma is truly remarkable and one-of-a-kind and has left a distinct, lasting impression on us from which we will judge all other resorts in the future. Booking/Airport Transfer/Arrival: We booked our honeymoon at Maroma by winning a vacation package auctioned through LuxuryLink (1st time we ever did this). After winning the auction at great savings, it was incredibly easy to book the exact week we wanted through the resort and I highly recommend people check out this process. The resort even allowed us to add 2 additional nights onto the package so that we could stay for a full week. 2 weeks before leaving, the Maroma staff emailed us a short questionnaire to complete listing our preferences (early morning coffee/tea service, newspaper delivery, dietary requests, activities, etc.) in order to make sure our stay would be special and tailored to our desires. It was sign of great things to come. At the airport, the Maroma staff was waiting for us and quickly took our bags and whisked us away in a private SUV on our way to the resort, offering us bottled water and cool towels along the way. It's an easy 25 minute ride to the resort. The entrance to the resort is very low-key and located right off the highway. You then travel down a long, single-lane dirt road through the mangroves for about 10 minutes before reaching the actual resort property itself which is jaw-dropping. As one previous poster described, the resort resembles a large Mexican estate spread out over a lush landscape. The main building was originally built by a mexican architect and his wife as their personal residence and the architectural detail and thought that went into every aspect is profound. The newer, expanded section of the resort is seamlessly spread out over the property in the same intricate style and atmosphere as the main building. Gabriela greeted us by first name on arrival, handed us some punch, and offered a personal tour of the property, which was wonderful. Her tour made us feel like family and got everything off on the right start. We arrived in the morning, and at the end of the tour she offered us a hospitality suite to change into our bathing suits so we could relax on the beach until our room was ready. The property is pretty large and we wandered down the beach until settling in one of their great beach beds where we had drinks and ate lunch. Gabriela found us a few hours later on the beach and led us to our room where our bags were quickly delivered. Room/Resort: We stayed in a wonderful Oceanview room, Room #54, located in the new section. The huge, comfortable bed in our room was wonderfully decorated with roses for our honeymoon. The room had great mexican accents, a large bathroom with water closet, large shower/tub with handcrafted tiles, and an attached closet for our clothes. The room also had a spacious verandah with a hammock, table/chairs, a built-in sitting bench, and an unobstructed close view of the gorgeous beach and beautiful water. The different sections of the resort primarily consist of 2-story, white stucco buildings with beautifully curved walls/archways and thatched roofs which are carefully spread out over the large property. The buildings are connected by meandering stone walkways and blend wonderfully into a landscape dotted with ancient mayan accents. At night, all of the stone walkways throughout the resort and the interior of the main building are lined with tiny small candles to create a dreamy, romantic ambience as you walk from your room to the main building. The staff completes the look by lighting lanterns on the umbrella stands along the beach beds up and down the beach. Many couples headed out to the beach beds after dinner to gaze at the stars. Beach/Pools: If you're reading this, you have probably already heard about the beauty of Maroma beach, which stretches for a few miles and is now dotted with a few resorts that have been recently built directly south of the Maroma Resort. The beach is rather large with soft, white sand that never gets too hot, making it great to walk on. The ocean water was a bit wavy for our first 5 days causing a bit of a seaweed issue which the staff did a wonderful job of raking the beach clean every morning and during the day as needed. The last 2 days of our trip, the ocean flattened out and was absolutely tranquil with beautifully clear, turquoise water like the islands we've visited in the Caribbean. The best part about the beach at the Maroma Resort is their exquisite beach beds and the wonderful beach service they offer throughout the day. Johnny and Alberto took turns serving us throughout the week on the beach and both were absolutely tremendous. You can order food delivered to your beach bed from any 1 of the 3 restaurants on the property, no matter where you are along the beach. The frozen Mudslides we enjoyed on our beach beds were to die for. The resort has 3 pools spread out across the property. Directly outside our room was one of the 3 pools located on the property, built with a curved stone patio, glass tile, and decorated with palm trees and comfy lounge chairs. It gets a bit breezy and the pools were a bit chilly due it being December. My only suggestion/critique for the resort would be that I think the pools should be heated for the winter months, based upon the luxury level of the resort and the price you are paying. During the first few days of our stay when the seaweed was present, we would have liked to use the pool more. Restaurants/Service: The service at Maroma is truly exceptional and at a level we have never experienced anywhere before. Any request you had was always met with a warn smile and the response of \"It would be my pleasure.\" The entire staff knew us by our first names by the 2nd day and their genuine, warm smiles and wonderfully pleasant attitudes makes this resort such a special, one-of-kind place to stay and one we are eager to return to. In particular, we want to give praise to Johnny, Alberto, Jorge, and Freddy for making our stay so memorable. they are great assets to this resort and we look forward to seeing them again. Everyone else was fantastic as well and we apologize for not being able to remember everyone by name. There are 3 restaurants on the property. 2 are located in the main building (El Sol and El Restaurante) and offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor dining areas are so beautiful with their floor-to-ceiling windows, stone floors, wood ceilings and low lighting that it is just as wonderful as sitting out on the terrace on the beach with the water just steps way. Breakfast is included in the room-rate and they offer a variety of made-to-order options sure to satisfy any taste. We enjoyed the omelettes, pancakes in particular. They also serve you a great selection of fruits and breakfast pastries. Lunch and dinner was also extremely good. My wife loved the hand-made gnochhi with shrimp in a red sauce so much she got it twice. Because it was our honeymoon, I arranged for a romantic beachside dinner one night and although it was expensive, I am really glad we did it. The staff put together a beautiful table set up on the beach at the end of groomed sand runway lined by tiki torches. We had a private waiter and were allowed to create our own menu for the dinner. The chef did a masterful job and even came out to speak to us to make sure everything was perfect. Well done. Finally, one last compliment I need to mention....our 2nd night, there was some sort of beach party by a small group of guests that lasted well into the night near our room. The resort is definitely not a party place at all and the noise kept my wife up to the point where she emailed the managing director of the resort in the middle of the night (mainly to make sure it didn't happen the rest of our stay). The next morning, the managing director (Federico Echaiz) called our room, profusely apologized, and informed us that he had already taken the previous night off our bill. Despite us telling him that it was not necessary at all to take anything off our bill, Senor Echaiz insisted and said that it should have never happened and assured us it would not happen again (which it did not). His prompt response and genuine concern for our stay and the manner in which he handled the issue was remarkable and something that was greatly appreciated. We can see where his great staff get their work ethic and professionalism. Our stay at Maroma Resort was an absolutely wonderful experience that we will always cherish and one we hope to repeat again in the near future.

This is a perfect place for honeymoons, anniversaries, etc. That said - I would not recommend it for people looking for late night parties or nightlife.

However, after being a member and reader on this site for a few years, this is the first time I have felt the need to post a review because our stay was simply something we have not experienced anywhere else. My wife and I just returned from our 1st trip to Maroma and WOW, what an experience. I planned this trip months ago at the suggestion of our travel agent. I planned the trip as a surprise for my wife for our first anniversary, only telling her she needed bathing suits and a passport. While taken aback at first flying into Cancun (brought back memories of different times?), she quickly forgot those as the Maroma staff met us at the airport and quickly whisked us away in a private black Suburban with cool water and air conditioning waiting for us. The majority of the 30 - 45 minute drive is simply a long highway. You then take a turn down an unmarked entrance which brings you down a long, jungle road which only has room for 1 car. This part takes about 10 minutes to finally enter the Maroma main gate (after passing through a primary gate) at which point you feel like you have entered a different world. Upon arrival there are a number of staff members there to greet you. They greet you by name when you get out of the car and immediately hand you some delicious Margarita Maroma (what better way to start your stay)? A staff member then takes you on a tour of the hotel while your bags are brought to your room. The grounds are, to say the least, amazing. Every detail has been thought out and carefully constructed and maintained. This is by no means some super modern, clean lines type of hotel that some expect from a place that has this cost associated. Instead, it is a very warm hotel that immediately makes you feel like you are home. For only being 65 rooms, it feels larger than some resorts I have been at such as the Four Seasons Maui. This is because Maroma is filled with winding paths through tropical landscapes. Simply walking the grounds is an amazingly relaxing experience. Our room was a junior suite at the end of the hotel. This was perfect for us as there was a wedding going on towards the main building and this allowed us more privacy and quiet to enjoy our trip. We woke up every morning to coffee, tea and delicious hot chocolate waiting for us on our patio as well as the mornings newspaper (well usually, this did not show up everyday). After our morning get me up we would either eat breakfast at Cilantro behind our room (if we wanted to be healthy that day) or stroll down the beach to El Sol. Both options are delicious, however very similar in fare. Cilantro simply offers healthier versions of what El Sol serves. The food was very good, though I can see how after a week we started to tire of it a little bit. The BBQ on our first night was different than is typically served, but we were enjoying hanging out with Freddy a the bar and tasting tequila to realize it... The staff at Maroma is something on another level. After the first day everyone we came across referred to us by name. They also figured out my wife was fluent in Spanish and she enjoyed conversing with everyone as such. They really go out of their way to make sure your stay is as pleasant as possible and try to tend to every need you can imagine. From the hospitality staff to the F&B staff to the spa attendants. At no point was anyone ever anything beyond extremely helpful and nice (and genuine too!). The hospitality office had helped me arrange a few special treats for us during our stay. The first was a Muyil Float and Forest tour which came highly recommended above the others, and I must say it was quite an experience. Except for the mosquitoes that is... Our guide was amazing and extremely knowledgeable about the Mayan culture and the tour itself is simply out of this world. Floating down a natural canal taken by the current, in fresh water for over an hour while it gently takes you around curves was amazing. You are surrounded by mangroves and little fish and you truly feel like you have entered into another era. The private tour also included a snack and a lunch which were both delicious and served by a waitstaff at a table that they set up for you... my only recommendation is to bring long pants / shirt and some bug spray for the hiking portion or suffer the wrath of the mosquitoes. Gabriela also helped me set up a special anniversary dinner on the beach which was simply stunning (I would post pictures but they are on my other computer). If you are looking to have a romantic dinner, there is nothing better than this option. They set up a private table on the beach in front of the main building and have a sand \"carpet\" laid out for you. You are surrounded by tiki torches and candles and the night sky. It was truly a special moment and almost brought my wife to tears when she saw it. The beach is another gem of this hotel. It is simply magnificent. Pure white sand (which is cleaned daily by the staff as they rake up any seaweed from the tides), warm water in shades of blue and green and crystal clear. The beach beds are absolutely fantastic and the beach side service for drinks and food is just as good as at the restaurants. They have a delicious beach side menu of ceviche and nachos among other things (those were our favorites). The snorkeling trip was fun as well and worth going out. We also enjoyed the spa a bit. The staff was amazingly helpful in helping us choose our treatments and the couples room was fantastic. It was very relaxing and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. The rest of the is very beautiful as well. At night however is when Maroma really shines (pardon the pun). They lay out countless candles along all of the paths on the property. It really sets quite a mood when you are heading to dinner or just relaxing. They also set candles out on the beach so that you can relax on a beach bed or chair as well. The lighting is so perfect on the property that you can tell a lot of thought went into it. Even though the hotel was about 50% occupied, we still felt as though we were the only ones there because the size of the property. Finally, what can I say about Freddy? We loved hanging out with him at Freddy's Bar and trying the tequilas, margaritas and other concoctions he gave to us. It certainly gave us a little bit of that fun we were looking for. Overall, I would certainly recommend this hotel to the discerning traveler. However, one must remember that this is a hotel meant for relaxing, not partying (if you want that, go to Secrets next door). There are no TVs for entertainment and people are typically in their rooms by 10pm (i.e. no partying). However, we both enjoyed being able to hang out in the hammock on our patio with the sound of the waves reading books and enjoying each others company. After all, isn't that what it's all about?", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201c2nd visit...Maroma is paradise\u201d", "Author": "pax671", "ReviewID": "UR50980828", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from our 2nd stay at Maroma (last visit was 2yrs ago). Our stay could not have been more perfect. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is excellent and the food/drinks exceed expectations. The guests consist of mostly couples, as Maroma is a very romantic setting. We spent most of our time either relaxing on the \"beds\" which are all along Maroma's beach, or lounging in the hammock which is on the porch of every guest room. I cannot stress enough how helpful and friendly is the staff at Maroma. By day 2, they know you by name. The staff arranged for us to take a cab into Playa Del Carmen for a few hours one day, and also arranged a tour of the nearby Mayan city of Tulum. Other than that, we had no desire to leave the grounds. Maroma has its own dive shop on the beach. We went snorkeling one day at the reef which is just off of Maroma's beach. On our last visit, we had really enjoyed our room location, so we requested the same room once again. Of course, our request was met. On the last night, I asked the hospitality staff if there was any chance of trying a similar room but in a different location of the hotel, just to try it out. Not only did they grant our request, but the manager at the time moved us into an upgraded room right on the beach. And that is what Maroma is all about...service which exceeds expectations.

The two are very different resorts but on balance we preferred the latter. Here are what we considered the pros and cons of the Maroma: Pros: The resort grounds are beautiful and filled with lots of nice touches, not the least of which are the candles on the walkways at night. The small number of rooms and very high staff to guest ratio make for a intimate and well-attended experience. The staff is wonderful and friendly. The waitstaff and meals were also exceptional. The rooms are only steps from the beautiful beach. The workout facility has good equipment and was spacious for a resort of this size. And now the cons: The services and amenitites at the Maroma were quite expensive, particularly in relation to other resorts at which we've stayed in the area. A visit to their spa ended up costing almost as much as our room for the entire stay. The rooms were somewhat dated and generally not up to the level of a five star hotel. A knob in our shower, for example, kept falling off during our stay (others have had similar experiences based on the reviews) and the front plate to the safe broke off. Also, the air conditioning was supplied by a noisy wall unit. None of which was anything more than mild disappointment in what was otherwise a wonderful experience; rather, the cons are examples of some things that were unexpected given the cost and category of the hotel.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cParadise in Riviera Maya\u201d", "Author": "nychuman", "ReviewID": "UR50439010", "Content": "As a frequent traveler to Mexico, Maroma resort is the most authentically Mexican and yet, luxurious hotel that I have been to in the country.

The entire staff speaks English very well, but they entertained our broken Spanish. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the ocean was like a turquoise bubble bath. We reclined on the well-equipped (towels, umbrella and comfortable cushions) beds on the beach every day. And each day, Daniel was there to bring us beverages and food all day long. I\u2019m a huge spa fan and the Kinan Spa at Maroma is really one of the best spas that I have ever been to. In addition to the grounds of the spa being completely beautiful the treatments are all incredibly well-done and begin with a ceremonial washing of your feet, which feels terrific.

Like many, my wife and I find a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton to be dependable, but also predictable. We have very discerning taste and really seek out hotels that execute a notch better than the \"standard\" for excellence that a high-end chain like Four Seasons typically sets. We find that most often the smaller, quaint boutique hotels can cater to this better because there are less guests, giving these properties more latitude to individualize the service and enhance your vacation experience. Toward this end, I must say that Maroma qualifies as an absolute \"jewel box.\" This place is a find! Prior to departing on our trip, Maroma sent us an email with various questions in an effort to elicit our likes and preferences, ahead of time, so that upon arrival they already know how you want your in-room bar stocked, which choice of newspaper you prefer to receive each morning, how you take your coffee (or substitute if desired) that is delivered to your room everyday before you wake up, etc., etc., etc., -- all in an effort to diminish the \"getting to know you\" part, and instead make you feel like you have returned home to your regular staff that has already \"got it.\" When you arrive at the airport, a representative of Maroma greets you outside baggage claim and escorts you to a new Suburban SUV, complete with bottled water and fragrant towels to cool off with, which then takes you to the resort down a surprisingly quick, \"smooth\" divided highway getting you there in about 25 minutes. While you pass other resorts having huge grand entrances along the way, Maroma's entrance is, by design, discreet and looks more like a gate to someone's estate. It is no wonder that the several celebrities that frequent Maroma on a repeat basis love this place. Indeed, you pass through the gate and proceed down a dirt path for quite some distance before the resort finally appears in front of you. With only 66 rooms, you arrive at the manor house (you really do feel like it is an estate, not a hotel) and are greeted by name, with a cocktail waiting, as if they already know you. Indeed, you are truly treated like you are the only guests arriving that day/time. You actually check-in inside your room, following a personal escort through the property getting you familiar with the amenities and setting the mood. What we admire about Maroma (which is distinctly true about other Orient-Express properties, too) is that there is nothing cookie-cutter about it. The buildings' architecture and mahogany materials and bamboo/thatch ceilings remain, intentionally, indigenous to its Caribbean setting so you feel immersed in this tropical oasis. We don't travel all the way to the tropics only to arrive at some place that looks and feels like you're really still only in south Florida. Indeed, we looked at the Myakoba resort nearby with its Rosewood, Banyan Tree and Fairmont hotels within it, and while its glitzy, ultra-modern architecture would really appeal to us if we were enjoying a California coastal vacation, it most definitely does not appeal to us when visiting the tropics. You don't travel to Italy to eat hot dogs. I cant' tell you how sterile it feels to sit at a beach bar in a Caribbean resort that has poured-concrete columns, a granite countertop and a standing-seam aluminum roof to it (Four Seasons, if you can believe that -- both in Nevis and in Great Exuma, Bahamas)! Maroma, on the other hand, is exactly how a beach bar should be in a Caribbean environment -- twisted bamboo tree columns, with a varnished, solid wood countertop and a bamboo and thatch roof with a clever glass window at its peak filtering light in. Oh yes, and complete with upscale higher-end and higher-maintenance furnishings and cloth rather than paper napkins, creature comforts that remind you that you are staying at \"the best.\" The indigenous ambience of Maroma by day gets even better at night time. This is the only Caribbean resort we have been to where you actually don't care if you are eating outside or inside -- the atmosphere inside (both) restaurants' indoor areas are so atmospheric with the stone floors, wood ceilings, indirect lighting and largely-open-to-the-outdoors windows, anyway, is just as much fun as sitting outside on the terrace right on the beach with the ocean literally steps away. It's that nice. The same applies to the bar/lounge area where you enjoy drinks before or after dinner (although the beach bar is open, too, at night and offers a splendidly contrasting atmosphere compared to day time, as well). But the real treat at night time is walking from your room to the main building -- and seeing literally 1500 candles lining the stone walkways to, and then throughout the interior of, the main building. All set out and lit, by hand, each and every night. They even light lanterns on the umbrella tables alongside the beach lounges up and down the beach, just to complete the look. I mean, this place is nothing short of \"dreamy\" at night. It's almost indescribable. They even light candles in your room at turndown, which no other hotel has done for us. Very romantic setting. One of the candles comes with aromatherapy oils that you select before leaving for dinner, and then the maid pours it in the special dish that gets heated by the candle she lights underneath, which then disperses the fragrance throughout your room which you enjoy upon returning to your room at the end of your evening. One evening I requested the romantic turndown, and we came back to a flower pedal design on the bed, and a bubble bath drawn with candles lit around the tub and flower pedals strewn around the candles and throughout the water. Well done. Lastly, the service. Unmatched, says it all. Can't read the menu in the candlelight? Before you lift your head a waiter (who all know you by name) anticipates your problem and hands you a menu flashlight, which he attaches to the top of your menu before you can say a word. I mean they anticipate, rather than react to, your preferences. Their execution is impressive. Even on the beach, they operate a second service bar for the beach waiters so that you never have to wait for him to walk all the way back to the main bar to retrieve what you're looking for (like happens at so many other beach resorts). They will even serve lunch right to your beach lounger -- complete with silverware and cloth napkins and real glassware (not plastic). It's not inconvenient to them; they're properly setup with special beach trays etc. so that it is as easy for them to set you up as it is for you to eat without disrupting everything else you have with you. It's a neat experience eating on the beach some days as an alternative to the terrace -- because they execute it in such a no-hassle manner. Compared to other Caribbean destinations, we must say that the service that Maroma delivers is striking. We say this because even the nicest resorts elsewhere in the Caribbean still have to rely on the island natives to carry off the service, and they are so often either friendly but slow and impossible to train to high enough standards, or worse, act disinterested on top of it all. The Maroma family in contrast is a \"well-oiled machine,\" with staff that has been there for a long time, and really, truly cares.

Upon arrival in a complimentary black SUV, we were immediately greeted by the staff, a welcome margherita, and the resident guacamayas. Then, we were escorted around the resort to get familiarized with our new surroundings. And what surroundings! The most subdued, calming, peaceful place I have ever been. Luscious jungle foliage, hand-built Mayan/Moorish architecture, tranquil pools, pathways, lounges. We were then brought up to our room in the main house (which, mind you, is designed and built in an open manner to where you look straight through to the beautiful turquoise ocean). The room was peppered with romance- a bottle of champagne on ice, rose peddles scattered over the bed, a gorgeous balcony overlooking the ocean. After picking our jaws up off the floor for several hours, we settled into the mantra/aura of the place. One can get used to extreme luxury and comforts. The beach: Perfect. Soft sand. Calm, warm waters. Comfy beach beds. Amazing beachside bar/food service. Wonderfully friendly attendants (who will cut up and serve you a fresh coconut if you ask!). And a man who combs the beach every morning for the seaweed that washes up on shore for heaven's sake! The room: Simple. Elegant. Not posh or tricked out. No TVs (but yes there is A/C). Great views, spacious balcony. comfortable bed and sheets. Romantic candlelight turn down service with aromatherapy. Room service at all hours. Don't forget the handmade soaps and local/organic bath products! The spa: Top of the line. In tune with nature and its surroundings- Mayan and spiritual/peaceful. The plunge pools, saunas/steam rooms are free. All other services are billed to your room. They have signature \"Mayan rituals\" that I would recommend (including the temazcal- a Mayan sweat lodge) beyond the usually spectrum of spa services. Workout facility and 2 pools: Looked nice. Never used. The food/restaurants: 2 restaurants. Beyond breakfast (complimentary), which was very delicious, and the bar/beach food menu and room service, we only ate off the 'El Sol' menu once, and that was for a private dinner in \"El Mirador,\" the tower atop the main building offering 360 views of the surrounding area. What I can say about the food is that it is 5 star. My wife and I are foodies, so believe us when we say 5 star. Mayan, local flare to all dishes which were mostly seafood based. Try the ceviches. Fantastic. The cost: Very expensive...but not unfare. You don't see a bill until you check out, so brace yourself. But relax- it's well worth the expense. Pros: See above. Let me also mention here the fact that the grounds are bathed in tea lights at sundown (super romantic) and that there were maybe 9 other couples staying while we were there.

My wife and I never are the type that would go to the same place twice, but if we ever go back to the Yucatan again, and can afford it, we're going to stay here again. Since everyone has an opinion, I will try to fill the below with more useful information than opinion. For starters, so you understand where I am coming from, my wife and I make a fairly good living and so can afford to stay in nicer places like Maroma, but we do not make so much money that when we go to a place like Maroma we can just spend whatever we want on drinks, dinner, spa services, etc., without flinching. We like to be spoiled like the rich, but have to watch our money closely once we are in their presence. We generally try to stay in the nicest of places, but our lifestyle usually only allows us to stay one notch below, with the occasional splurge, which is what we would consider Maroma. Accordingly, our expectations may be slightly lower than the elite travelers that no-doubt frequent Maroma. Economy/Swine Flu - According to Maroma staff, they are currently running at 30% occupancy, and actually have the southern portion of the resort largely shut down, though the ritzy beach-front villas and spa are still open and the pools are still useable. What this currently means is plenty of attention (not too much) from staff, no having to fight for reservations/beach chairs/beds, and a couple of apparent cost cutting measures (but my perception was it generally was a plus for us). Location - Maroma beach is nice; can't comment on how nice verses other areas on the Yucatan, but the water seems as crystal clear as it could be and the sand is white. Waves are present but small. The resort beach is situated towards the middle of the crescent cove that makes up all of Maroma beach. There are two all-inclusives immediately south of the resort (Secrets and Catalonia; Maroma actually share an entrance with Secrets), and there is an empty lot and a partially completed condo development immediately to the north, with tons more all-inclusives visible in the distance (over half mile away). Playa del Carmen is no more than 20 minutes to the South. As for driving directions, the hotel seems shy to admit that you have to use the same entrance as Secrets Maroma, and so the driving directions they give are not adequate. Get their directions, and then on your drive down, look for Secrets Maroma and that is the gate. Grounds - Beautiful and constantly being cared for. Maroma cleaned its beaches of seaweed and trash each morning, whereas the all-inclusives directly south did not, and the difference is obvious (and nasty for those at the other resorts). Unfortunately there is a lot of litter that comes in off the water and collects on the beach (if not picked up) and these other resorts had lots of garbage and seaweed on their sand and in their water but Maroma kept its beaches virtually spotless, and picked up items later in the day if the need arose. In fairness to these other resorts, they seemed to amass more junk because of the way the current worked and because they were near a point and behind a reef, as well. But a walk south down the beach and look at these resorts completely affirmed our decision to go with Maroma over any all-inclusive. Room Choice - This is not a cookie-cutter all-inclusive, so the rooms/buildings aren't fungible or easy to compare. We stayed in Room #6, Ocean View and couldn't have asked for anything more. Ocean View means you can see the water from your balcony, but you don't necessarily have an unblocked view. Our original room was a first floor, and we asked at check-in to move to a second floor, and they accommodated without any issue or delay. In previous reviews we read that second floor was better for bugs and/or privacy, and again, it's kind of a crap shoot. Second floor rooms may generally have more privacy because your balcony is not a patio on the ground, but some of those balconies are directly above the restaurant or bar and actually offer less privacy. A few ground floor Ocean Views open directly out to the beach bar (less than 10 yards). The garden view rooms open onto the pools and walkways between rooms and look like they may be short on windows, but we did not go into one. Room 6 was perfect FWIW. Food/Prices - For starters, just as with the room prices, everything is hit with 25% of fees, so add 25% to everything below and anything you spend money on at the resort. We booked our reservation through Expedia as part of a package with air travel, and got a discount off the rack rate. As is noted in previous reviews, the food and dinks are expensive, but there are ways to mitigate this. For starters, the food quality was extremely good, and we enjoyed our meals. There is the fancy restaurant, Sol. Entrees run $35+. There is the less expensive, but very nice restaurant (that is really the same restaurant, just one room over), that has basically a Tapas menu ($12 or less each) plus entrees in the $20-$30 range). This restaurant is just as good and seemed more popular, including because you could sit outside basically on the beach. Then you can also eat at the beach bar at least through the afternoon, not sure about the evenings. Great selection of appetizer type foods like Quesadillas, Nachos, Guacamole, for $15 or so, and the portions are fairly large so you can easily share one. Regardless of where you are, beers are $6, mixed drinks and wines are $12+, and bottled water is $6 (except for your room; more below). To keep cost under control, eat your free breakfast (which is very filling), order a late afternoon item from the bar menu and share it, and then just get a few Tapas to share for dinner at the outside restaurant. More advice on saving on drinks below. Again, the food was excellent and of good quality in our opinion. Service \u2013 Every person we met was extremely friendly, happy and helpful, and they made the stay so much better. At the beach, there is the perfect level of service throughout the day; not to much, but there when you need it. You get a free fruit skewer and juice at 11:30 AM or so, and then they bring around free sorbet on waffle cones at 2:30 or 3:00. Doing it on the Cheap \u2013 We took the advice of another reviewer and stopped off at a 7-11 on the drive in and loaded a cooler with beer, bottled water and snacks. I would carry what we needed down to the beach in a bag, and the waiters would actually provide ice buckets to every person on the beach, which they didn\u2019t seem to mind me using for my own beverages. Because I was not buying as much of the resort\u2019s refreshments, I tipped them throughout the day. May not be the classiest, but they didn\u2019t seem surprised by it, and it saved us a ton. I actually could have gone without the cooler, as they also bring ice to your room every night. Bugs \u2013 We read reviews that had us scared of the mosquito situation, as my wife is allergic to them. We found the bug/mosquito situation not bad at all, and worst case, on par with what you get on the U.S. Gulf Coast. As long as you were in sight of the beach, the breeze completely kept them away, and the hotel provides a fancy non-chemical repellant with your room. Cons \u2013 No place is perfect, so I will spell out the few cons we encountered, though for us these didn\u2019t even represent a minor blemish on the trip as a whole: (i) our room had one of those wall-unit type A/C\u2019s that was making lots of noise the first night and started dripping water. Without even asking, we walked into our room after breakfast and they were fixing it the next morning, after having noticed we had placed a trash can under it to collect the drips. It was much better thereafter; (ii) this is the only evidence of cost-cutting we saw; they supply your room with two quart size bottled waters at all times. If you leave the empty bottles in your room, they refilled them, as opposed to providing you new ones, which is a little weird; (iii) at the beginning of the trip, they ask you if you want a tray of coffee/tea/juice on your patio waiting for you in the morning, and the time, and what paper you wanted. They didn\u2019t seem to follow our time, and the paper service was a bit spotty; (iv) getting hot water in the late evening seemed spotty. The hot water was excellent through early evening, but after around 10:30, it was iffy; not sure why, and you could still get warm water, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWondeful place and experience\u201d", "Author": "littlebit_9", "ReviewID": "UR33739065", "Content": "The beach was beautiful so is the resort.

The waiters on the beach worked very hard all day to keep us in the shade on our large beach beds and to ensure we had everything we needed. The complimentary snorkel trip revealed itself to be quite fun and full of exotic fish. The Temazcal sweat treatment was energizing, mystical, and very well guided by Nancy. Our standard room had a great sea view from between the palms and a spacious terrace to lounge privately on (Room 33). The textures and lush foliage envelop the rear side of the resort inviting one to lounge under the cool jungle leaves by one of the pools as a pleasing alternative to the beach. Unlike many hotels, nature is the principal companion to the architecture, not design. This lets one feel like each corner is special, unique, and private. Although in the end we opted for the beach every day anyway. All the details in the Maroma are hand-made, and the feeling is one of simple pleasures made luxurious through the inherent quality of the materials. There is no multi-layered sophistication attempting to hide over weaknesses. The very foundation of the property is based on principles that come through as pure, fresh, aromatic, and full of color. It is the best place to go to simply disconnect, relax, and be pampered. The staff manages to make you feel like each gesture is genuine and meant especially for you. A very romantic setting!

My husband and I stayed at Maroma Spa and Resort from April12 to April 18, 2009. After weeks of preparation and planning, we arrived on April 12 and were looking forward to a relaxing week at the resort. The grounds and the location were beautiful. From the servers on the beach to the waiters in the restaurants, all were very courteous, friendly and helpful. We stayed in room 55 and from the moment we began to unpacked we noticed the room had its problems. As we opened the shutters to let some light in the shutter broke off and fell. In the bathroom the toilet paper dispenser broke and fell to the floor. I then wanted to take a relaxing bath and the faucet came unscrewed and the top piece fell off into my hands, little did we know that this was just the beginning. We thought they were minor problems and had no reason to believe that the problems would be indicative of the days to follow. The first two nights were the only nights we slept peacefully. Every night after, for the rest of the week we were woken up in the middle of the night from noises from the plumbing. The noise was so loud that it woke us up out of a dead sleep. The first night I was so frightened that I ran into the bathroom and saw rust colored liquid backing up in the sink and in the tub! That evening when we tried to take a bath we noticed the bath water had the same rusty-tint. I called the front desk and they said to they would let the manager know and he or she would get back to us. Unfortunately, the manager never got back to us at all. Since we were leaving the next day we decided not make a big deal about it and reported the problem to guest services and never received a call from anyone regarding this problem during our entire stay. I then called the front desk to ask for new soap because the soap was sitting in the rusty and filthy water in the tub. Again no one got back to us or provided any soap. I then asked one of the maids and she was happy to help. My husband and I decided to let the water run and after 10 minutes the water was still rusty. We had a car scheduled to meet us at 7am and didn\u2019t have time to wait for someone at the hotel to get back to us. We were determined not to let this ruin our vacation and hoped the problem would be solved upon our return from our day trip. We had arranged for a private tour to the ruins and my sister who staying a few minutes away at a different hotel and joined us for the tour. On our return we had planned to stop at our hotel for drinks and appetizers at the beach bar. After being in the sun all day my sister asked to take a quick shower in our room. The water seemed to clear after letting the water run for 5-10 minutes. I then called guest services for soap and was told I needed to buy it at the gift shop! This was rude and shocking!!! On our last night we stopped at guest services to express our disappointment and the problems we faced. We were told that the manager would be told and we would hear back from him or her. We did not, as a matter of fact to add insult to injury our experience got even worse! As we were checking out of the hotel, my husband and I settled the bill and pulled away from the resort. We were chased by an employee from Maroma and the driver was stopped as we were pulling away. I thought to myself that perhaps it was the manager wanting to apologize. To our shock and amazement it was guest services, who wanted to collect $8.00 from us from an unpaid bill from the gift shop, which was never applied to our bill. After spending almost $10,000 in one week at Maroma, we were chased for $8.00! Not only disappointed, but now embarrassed by other guests that witnessed this scene in front of the hotel! Words cannot describe how humiliated we both felt when we were stopped. It seems ironic that the values and philosophies that Maroma stands for were the very things lacking in this situation. There was a clear lack of concern and not even the slightest of considerations were extended. As a frequent guest of Orient-Express for business and pleasure, I will certainly think twice about booking a room at Maroma. I am most dissatisfied and extremely frustrated by the sequence of events resulting in this review for future travelers to Maroma.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shreveport, LA", "Title": "\u201cGo back NOW!\u201d", "Author": "kimhoney", "ReviewID": "UR31029730", "Content": "We were at Maroma May 17 to 24. This is our fourth time to this resort. We found out about it on the Travel Channel several years back when it was number one on the Ten Best Carribean Beach resorts. We decided to go to all ten (we have been to Little Dix Bay, Caneel Bay, Ritz in St. Thomas, which were also on the list) but once we got to Maroma we stopped and now we just go back there. The swine flu thing really has caused a stress in Mexican Riviera but we had no trouble at all. Took lots of hand sanitizer. Some people at the airport were wearing masks and they made you sign a document saying you hadn't sneezed in the past few days and they even took our temperature once. Maroma's occupancy was extremely low when we got there (we were told that 25 hotels in the Hotel Zone in Cancun were shut down completely and the Italian resort next to Maroma was shut down too), like10%. So you basically had this entire resort to yourself (even when it's busy it is very quiet). The airport was no problem. Just be sure you keep walking all the way outside to get to your Maroma driver, who will pick you up and give you water and take you to the resort. We stopped in Puerto Moreles and got a styrofoam ice chest, ice and beer, and some liquor, to take to our room. When you arrive at Maroma they will give you a margarita and a tour (we didn't take the tour because we've been there before). They upgraded us from a garden room to an ocean view room and it was just beautiful. The beach is to die for. The blue beach beds are fabulous. The beach service was incredible. In fact the service is incredible across the board. While the scenary is idyllic, the service is what really puts this place over the top. Take them up on their offer to make special food requests. We had homemade tamales, molletes for breakfast, empanadas, enchiladas, all off the menu stuff that they will prepare happily for you. Even had a BLT for breakfast one day with fries. Be sure and try the various sauces that are available. Ixni pec is very good. Cilantro was closed but the menu was still available. We had fish, shrimp, lobster, chicken, just everything. Expect to pay $14.00 for a lunch of shrimp and chicken k-bobs. I am not a ceviche fan but people who are say it's great too. Most of the dishes at lunch will set you back more than $20.00 per entree. A bottle of chardonnay (which would retail here for about $13.00) will cost $50.00. Since we are wine heads this cost us. Dinner at El Sol is expensive. The entire resort is expensive. I agree with what another reviewer said: if you can't afford it, just come for fewer days, because you just have to see this place. We had four spa treatments with Toni and Carmen who were both just great. We had snorkel trips with Cinthya and Sandro and they were just fabulous. We even have an underwater video that Cinthya took while we were snorkeling. We left the resort only one time to look around with Cinthya and Ernesto in Puerto Moreles. Lots of property for sale down there. They were both so friendly. I need to e-mail them our recipe for pasta and meatballs. At night the resort is just enchanting, with candlelight everywhere. The breeze blew most days so it was not so hot. It only rained one day and only for a short time. Finally, I come back to the service. While we were there they were switching out staff weekly, so from the first Sunday to Friday I think we had the same people helping us. They were all just fantastic.

We have stayed in other similarly priced hotels and resorts in the past and while we have sometimes liked the food better than we did at Maroma or stayed in nicer, larger rooms than we did at Maroma, this is place that we most likely would return to. The first reason for this is the beautiful beach (nicer than anything we have so far experienced in Mexico, the Maldives, Mauritius, Bali etc etc). The beach is wide and clean, the sand is white and powdery, the sea is clear and turquoise with a little surf. The second reason is the size and \"special feel\" of the resort: with about 60 rooms it is quite small and to us felt more like a spa-hotel than a Mexican resort. Some further comments (partly in response to other reviews here): 1.) Food and Drinks Quality of food and drinks is very good (we liked the lunch-menu best). Definitely try the \"Tuna+Grapefruit\" Ceviche (at the beach-bar) and the Guacamole and chips (brought to your day bed on the beach). For variety, go to Playa del Carmen (see 6.). 2.) Rooms We had a very nice room with direct ocean-view in the main-building. While there definitely are resorts with more spacious and luxurious rooms at similar rates, we did not mind at all because we spent most of the day at the beautiful beach anyway and slept very well at night. There was no TV in the room which we actually found very nice (full relaxation and time for books). 3.) Cost Food and drinks ARE expensive but NOT at rip-off-level. Since you are not required to sign anything when you leave a restaurant or a bar, the place has an \"all-inclusive\" feeling to it (an illusion that is destroyed rather harshly upon checkout when you get your bill). Only go if you can afford it. (If you can't afford it: go anyway but stay less days.) 4.) Service Service was very good and quick, everyone is trying to adress you with your first name which we thought has a nice touch. 5.) Specials For a special evening, do the rooftop-dinner on the \"Mirador\" (great view, beautiful stars). Make sure to tip the poor waiter who has to schlepp your food the 80 steps upward to the roof. 6.) Nightlife There was virtually no nightlife at Maroma. Mariachis play almost daily at dinnertime but there was no music at the bars and they closed at around 10pm. If you want to go out at night, you can take a taxi to Playa del Carmen though (20 Minutes, US$20) where there are heaps of restaurants/bars/clubs. As I have already written above, Maroma was a beautiful, relaxing and entertaining holiday.

We had spent 1 week in Merida and transferred by coach to Cancun where we had arranged for the hotel to pick us up for transfer to the hotel. From the first welcome by the staff to our drop off at the airport we had a wonderful week in Maroma. The staff are excellent, the food is fabulous, a couple of restaurants with different characters, rooms are full of charm and we were made to feel very welcome. The main downside for me was a recurring fee of 'nickle and diming' over every extra. If you wanted water you were offered VOS at highly inflated prices, with only 2 small bottles of complimentary water in the room each evening. Even the transfer to the hotel we had to pay an additional $50 because they were picking us up from the coach station and not the airport. There are no tours or activities out of the hotel, even organising a taxi into Playa Del Carmen was a fortune. The second small downside, was that the hotel was beautiful and quiet every evening until the weekend. On Friday a large number of loud Americans descended on paradise, obviously because its an easy weekend trip from US.

My husband and I booked Maroma for our destination wedding and from the moment we stepped foot on their grounds it was pure perfection. It's an intimate boutique resort with understand elegance. The resort is magnificent and you feel like you're part of real architecture and home...definitely not a typical chain hotel. The staff was great (sweet, funny, hospitable) BUT not annoying. In addition, our guests were blown away and commented that this was the best vacation and wedding of their life. I need to stress that the guests in AWE were also the guests who originally complained that we were getting married in 1) Mexico 2) at VERY expensive resort. I need to stress that EVERYONE was high on life once they arrived! They LOVED it, no one wanted to leave and they all mentioned going back one day! As for the food, it was pretty good...better then expected! After a week its definitly gets tiresome but you can drive to 5th Ave and dine out! I have to be honest...the negative reviews about the hotel made me extremely nervous. I read so many complaints but if you do your due diligence there is no reason to be disappointed. This is a romantic, relaxing, stunning location! As for our room, we stayed in an upper level Sian Nah Suite. I couldn't imagine staying in another room since for our wedding. It was absolutely amazing...I think everything about Maroma is better in person and their website and pictures don't do it justice. Since we had about 20 guests I was able to see lots of rooms types specifically (ocean, garden, villa and sian nah) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. If you want to plan a special dinner I highly recommend doing a private dinner on top of Maroma (the miranda). Yes its pricey but it is super romantic...a MUST for an engagement or anniversary dinner. The banquet manager, Carena, is an absolute doll.

Have visited many fantastic hotels from the Four Seasons in Maui, Ritz Grand Cayman to One and Only in Bahamas. My wife and I just returned from Maroma on Feb 24, which was our second visit in the last 12 months to Maroma and just as special. After reading the positive reviews and few negative ones, I will say if you do your research, you won't make the mistakes the negative reviewers had. This is an incredibly special and romantic place, but you need to understand it is not trying to be an ultra modern boutique hotel.....This is what makes Maroma different from the other choices in the Riviera Maya. Rooms: My wife and I stayed in Garden Rooms 14 last May and Garden Room 15 this February. These are 2 of the larger and better garden rooms, and I highly recommend both. We did not miss an ocean view as these offer more privacy than many of the ocean view rooms and the Hammock on the oversized patio overlooking the jungle trees is fantastic....I almost didn't mind the day it rained. If you are looking for an ultra modern room which is 1200 sf with plasma tv's and high speed internet connections, then Maroma is not right for you. Those that complained about these things should have simply done more research. Our room was well sized at about 350 sf including the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, but beds are always very personal. The bathroom was great. Loved the huge tub with no shower curtain, great water pressure and double sinks with plenty of room for both you and your significant other. One night they filled the tub while we were at dinner and put rose petals in the tub for us. Just one of the many personal touches that many other hotels neglect to do. Service: Those that question Maroma's 5 star status cannot question Maroma's top notch service. As I mentioned, we were in Maroma last May and the entire staff was still there and most of them remembered us by face or name, which we found incredible. Gabrielle, Jorge, Alvaro, Cesar, Tachi (at the bar) were all fabulous with great personalities and a sense of humor, which often times is lacking at other more stuffy resorts. Each morning, coffee was on our patio at exactly 8 am or earlier, on the beach they are extremely attentive but not overbearing, and the waiters are all on their game. Beach: Let the other reviews speak for themself. The negative reviewers do make a good point about the trash that you will see past the resort, but I recommend walking to right on the beach, which is much cleaner. They keep the beach spotless at Maroma and the beds are fantastic. The only time you may have a problem getting a bed is if you get to the beach later on in the AM, but we were always there by 9 am and could choose any one we wanted usually. A beautiful beach whether it be Ritz Grand Cayman, a nice beach in Nantucket or Four Seasons Maui, I feel Maroma's beach rivals any of them and the water is great. Pool: The garden pool is your best bet.....While many people state it is not heated, I found that one was plenty warm. I guess if you are older or are used to 85 degree pools, then Maroma may dissapoint, but the pool by the garden was about 75 degrees, which was refreshing for us. Food: If you want a resort with 5 restaurants with sushi and Italian and other choices, then don't stay at Maroma. If you like high end Mexican cuisine, we found the food to be very good. By top US standards, it is always hard to compete, but the chef definitely knows what he is doing. Try the ceviche at the beach bar for lunch. The breakfast was fabulous....amazing fruit plate, bread basket and everything from eggs, to fresh granola to pancakes. I would recommend if you are staying for an extended period to try a restaurant in Playa Del Carmen and maybe one at another high end hotel (Tides or Mandarin Oriental). We enjoyed our meal at Mandarin but were SO happy to be staying at Maroma. Mandarin beautiful but was way too spread out with so many golf carts driving around like rush hour in Chicago. Note: I asked on my first stay if they ever did sushi, and later that day the concierge informed me that the chef would be happy to put together some sushi for us. I declined, but that was another touch that amazed me. Spa: Is gorgeous and we loved our couples massage. Was very peaceful and for 80 minutes was $150 for each, which is really very reasonable for a high end resort. We took a great jacuzzi after in the same room which was a wonderful touch. In summary: My wife and I truly believe Maroma is one of those amazing places. Once you visit the other resorts in the Riviera, you will quickly see how amazing the beach is at Maroma. The staff is phenomenal and you will be sad to leave the friends you have made while you stay there. Vacations are very personal and we all have our own opinion of what makes a resort 5 star. For us, the service, beach, personal touches, grounds and food all make Maroma an amazingly relaxing vacation, which is hard to find these days. As far as children go, supposedly they do allow 12 and over at all times except for Cmas time where they allow younger children. We had no issues with young children. I cannot imagine ever seeing more than a couple of younger teens. We saw 2 the whole week. Finally, the hundreds of lit candles every night is the icing on the cake.

My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in February. We have traveled quite a bit and tend to stay at higher-end properties that are boutique-y or unique, rather than chains. This was one of the greatest resort experiences we've ever had. This place is magical. The arrival sets the stage. After finally finding the enterance and struggling with spanish at the security checkpoint we were let in and directed to drive down a road through the jungle that must have been a mile long. It ends in front of something that looks like your rich uncle's Mexican mansion. We were greated at the car where our keys were gently snatched from our hands and were replaced with a margarita. We were the wisked inside while two men took away our car and luggage, We were then given a truly personalized tour of the grounds which was like a finely orchestrated dance among the staff, What an enterance. Then we hopped into a golf cart to be taken to our room which was gorgeous and had our luggage already delivered. The room was one of their least expensive garden rooms, which had no view but was nevertheless spacious and well-appointed. Then Roxanna, our guide, offered us their complimentary coffee service each morning at the time of our choosing. We'd like one decaf and one hot cocoa with the NYTimes at 7:30 am please -- pinch me I'm in heaven. The breakfasts were outstanding, complete with an adorable older woman making fresh tortillas on the patio; if we could have put her in our suitcase, we would have taken her home. We ate lunch at the bar most days, which was excellent (ceviches, sandwiches and tequilas - need I say more). The formal dinners were just ok, the food was a bit ambitious at times. But the Friday night BBQ is a must, and you're on vacation so splurge on the outrageously overpriced lobster, it was delicious. Now for the real crowning glory - the beach. It's perfect. Cool, soft sand that gently slopes into the water for what seemed like a 1/8 mile and you could still stand up. The beach is very wide and so peaceful. Never once did I feel like someone was too close to me. They have beach beds set up and we never had a problem getting one. It was pure beach bliss. In fact, the resort was fully booked (all 66 rooms) and we felt like there were only a handful of people around. The place is designed that way, which is why it is TOTALLY AWESOME! OOOH, and they light the walkways each night with individual votive candles, There must have been hundreds of them, It was spectacular. Only downside is that the pools aren't heated. Please MAroma, heat your pools! Oh and there were kids there - several of them. It didn't bother me much, but others I spoke to were irratated because they thought it was adults only. One last nitpick: The food, drink and room is priced in US dollars, so at the end you will get a bill in US dollars, but then they charge your credit card in pesos. I found this a bit annoying because they are essentially tying themselves to the dollar, and therefore, you get no benefit from a weakend peso, which I could live with if they actually charged your card in dollars.

We travel the world and always stay at very fine hotels(Four Seasons, Ritz...) The Maroma is a very special place that deserves every award it has won. We stayed in 3 different rooms during our stay-a garden, and two different ocean front rooms. Each room was unique and gorgeous- the beds are draped in netting, the bathrooms are beautiful with lovely tiled, open showers(ours had a window overlooking the ocean). The service is incredible- the turndown especially as they dim the lights and illuminate the room with candlelight for the evening. The entire resort is illuminated with what must amount to several hundred tea lights every evening-every walkway and even the winding stairwells leading you to your room. The breakfeast is wonderful with fresh juices, tropical fruit and an interesting selection of entrees...we especially loved the older mexican woman who cooks fresh tortillas on the veranda and comes to your table to offer them directly out of her clay urn. All our meals were excellent- they use lots of fresh herbs with unique combinations...we always dined outside right near the ocean under the stars by candlelight. Now to the beach- my husband and I are huge beach people and walked many times a day in both directions. Yes, there is trash up away from the shore in some areas away from the resort. You can walk the beach without going near it, but it is disturbing to imagine how we pollute our waters. With that said, the ENORMOUS area in front of the Maroma is kept immaculately! They comb it throughout the day and it is stunning. The sand is the softest white powder you will ever step foot on. The Maroma cannot be expected to clean this entire stretch of the Carribbean....on many occassions I saw them go way beyond their borders and that is grueling work in the hot sun. Please just go and enyoy the natural beauty of this stunning stretch of beach and think twice before you litter yourself as you can see firsthand where it ultimately turns up. The people of the Maroma are extremely warm and welcoming. They work exceptionally hard and are very proud of their magnificant resort-as they should be. Everything is spotless-the pools are beautiful and my husband and I enjoyed them after our long walks on the beach as they are cooler than the ocean. We felt like we were staying in a private estate as we were typically the only people in the pool, at the workout facility etc.. If you wander about the property you will find different stairways which as you ascend lead to private sitting areas which overlook the Carribbean as far as the eye can see. Take a glass of wine up and enjoy!..I promise you will be the only one there. We rented a car and went to the charming village of Playa Del Carmen for dinner a few times. We had a delicious meal at John Grey's restaurant which is tucked back in a little enclave in the pedestrian zone. The hotel will make a reservation for you-we also tried John Greys other location and prefered the atmosphere in Playa. We can't imagine how anyone can stay at the Maroma and leave with complaints. We stayed the year before at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, paid more money and can't even compare the experience. We also prefer Maroma to The Four Season's, Maui, The Ritz Carlton, Grand Cayman and The Fairmont Mayacoba, Playa where we had stayed two years before. We usually don't go to the same place twice as we enjoy trying new locations, however we make an exception with the Maroma.

Normally, we mostly go to Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, Maldives...) at the same period, but this year, we thought that we were ready for a change. We always stay in hotels like Small Luxury Hotels of the World or Leading Hotels of the world. Airport pick up was no problem, like I read in other reviews. We arrived at night, the arrival at the hotel is great with all the candle lights spread out through the hotel. Check in was also no problem. Since we are very sensitive to noise, we had requested a really quiet room. We had booked a garden view room but were upgraded to a room with partial sea view close to the gym. The room was spacious although nothing real luxurious, the bath is really simple with only one washing basin. The king size bed was very comfortable. There are no curtains in the room, and it is difficult to get real dark at night. We found out that the room was really noisy, since it was close to Cilantro restaurant. They start to set the restaurant at 6.30, so this is how you get woken up unless you use some earplugs. Furthermore, there was an annoying generator noise, linked to the air conditionning. We had the impression to sleep on a boat, so finally, we used earplugs during all the stay. We asked to change room and the \"hospitality\" has tried to find another room. The best we got offered was after 8 nights, so we finally decided to keep the room and use earplugs. - Weather : coming from Europe (Paris) we were very surprised to find chilly weather when we got there. Temperature dropped to 16C in the evening, there was this cold wind, and it was difficult to eat outside for dinner. There was always a cold wind. The night comes very early, so after 4.30 on the beach, you just start to thing about going bacjk to the room. I guess it was not the right season to go to Mexico. There were 3 swimming pools in the hotel, but none was heated, so we could not swim in the pool and never saw anyone during the stay, this is not acceptable for such a hotel. - Beach : the beach in ront of the hotel was really beautifull and clean. The great thing about Maroma is definitely the beachbeds, very comfortable and well maintained. Service at the beach is good. Most of the guests reserved those beds early in the morning just putting some personnal belongings. This was the only way to get a beachbed. We dislike this method and would expect enough beds for the guests. Since it was the only possibility to get those beds, we just did the same. In order to get the most of the day, and although we like to get up late, we decided to get up at 7.00 and have an early day. We like to walk on the beach, and it was one of the reasons of our choice of Maroma. The beach in front of the hotel was clean, but as soon as you leave it, whether going north or south, the beach is littered with all kinds of garbage, plastic bottles of all kinds, shoes, ropes, all kind of junk. This is really a shame and very disappointing to us, it looks like the Mexican people and also the tourists do not really care about their environment. Most of the garbage comes from the sea throught the storms, and there is nothing done about it, really disappointing. Each hotel only cleans in front of the hotel, but no further. - Food : breakfast was good with a wonderfull scenery in front of the sea with sunrise. It was always the same a la carte menu, which was quite boring after a few days, nothing new or special. Since it was not a buffet (which we would have prefered), service was sometimes really slow since you have to ask for everything. Lunch on the beach was OK for small dishes, but also there always the same menu. - Dinner : this was the main problem and our disappointment for that kind of exclusive hotel. Food was very simple, no real difference between El restaurante and El Sol. We like fish, and there was no variety (mostly grouper), which was always overcooked and oily. Food was simply not our taste and was we expected, no variety, nothing special. Worse of all is the price you pay. Since you add 25% service + tax, for us it was like paying in EUR. So you pay around EUR 20 for a starter, EUR 30 - 35 for main dish (EUR 88 for a 500g Lobster !!!) and Around EUR 10 for dessert, portions were not big. This is simply overpriced for the quality and choice and really not good. The wines and drinks were overpriced too, EUR 100 for a bottle of Mexican wine. At the end of the trip, we were really glad to go back home and not spend our money ther anymore. Only good thing was the impeccable service, with really nice and kind people. - Spa : great spa area, but also here overpriced, EUR 130 for a 50 mn massage. All in all, and eventhough I recognize that this hotel has charm, we were really disappointed by our stay at the Maroma, and we would not go back.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation at Maroma\u201d", "Author": "BuellerNyc", "ReviewID": "UR24204010", "Content": "Had a wonderful time at this beautiful place.

As a resort it is beautiful, well appointed, gracious staff, on a beautiful piece of beach with a well appointed spa as part of the resort. My husband and I had wanted to go there for years but it was extremely expensive so we passed it by for other wonderful Carribean resorts. More recently we discovered \"best deal days\" and booked a Master Suite for the week which included breakfast, airport transfers and snorkel trip for two. Still pricey with 22% added to the room rate for service fees and taxes, but worth a try given what we had read about the place. It is romantic, highly personalized as its small and intimate and everything is first class. By day two, all the staff know your name and you do not need to sign for anything. Beachfront there are wonderful lounging beds - altho you need to get there early to put your book on one to \"reserve\". We had a second floor ocean view suite. Those on the first floor may have little privacy if you like to sit on your outside terrace. We live in NYC where prices are high. However, prices at Maroma are even higher . A car rental for a day runs $100. Taxis to Playa del Carmen which is 35 minutes away are $40. A bottle of water on the beach runs $8. Most wines for diner are over $50. Barbeque nite featured a 12 oz. lobster tail for $88. Add service and tax and these prices are over the top. Yoga and pilates classes run $33. You can bring the bottle of water from your room to the beach and ask for ice. As far as activities, these are limited. There are no TV, radio or clocks in the rooms. There are two communal TV rooms on the property , one with FREE! interernt access. You can ask to watch a DVD in these rooms. Our last day we found out there are board games also available. Day trips are also offered to more local sites but not very advertised. Night life includes some music at dinner - maybe. Barbeque nite has a fire dance at 7 which is not advertised.

So when we decided to go the Playa Del Carmen for our honeymoon we wanted to stay at the tides but they don't have any beach front rooms so we started to look elsewhere. After doing extensive research on internet and with my travel agent we decided to stay at Maroma. We paid over $10,000 for the week so in my opinion not a cheap vacation. My husband and I usally stay at 5 star hotels and thought we would be very happy with our Maroma decision. To begin Maroma is about a 30 minute drive into town for some people this is great but if you want to eat elsewhere or just go out you will spend anywhere from $20 to $30 one way so at least $50 just to get into town and back. My husband also has a bad back and the dirt road to get there didn't help. The cobblestone pathways didn't help his back either. The weather in December was horrible super windy, cloudy, and rained some too. So because of the bad weather we wanted to watch some television or a move but there are NO TV's in the rooms. After complaining they gave us one on the house but other wise you have to pay for it as a rental. Okay so the tech. gets worse no wireless internet they have a cord that is 5 feet long and you have to sit there to get on line. We got on line about 50% of the time we tried and when you try sometimes you get on and sometimes you don't. I am a vegan/vegetarian and had heard great reviews about the food. The first night we got there they offered me a salad. Being that town is a half hour away I thought I was going to be screwed. When we tried to get out and move to another hotel they denied us. I told the manager I was in tears and not happy she said sorry let us try and they offered us a tv to watch movies on because there is no satellite in the rooms and we had to call numberous times to get it delivered and when it did it didn't work and then they brought another one and the screen was ripped. The food is crazy expensive and no other options cause everything is so far away. The food is not that great. We thought the Tides was 10 times better for food. Also the one day we got some nice weather it took them forever to bring us a drink or food. They were quick to lay our towells out but that is it! We had a plunge pool on our deck which was cold We had to call to see if they could warm the tub. Took a while for them to get it heated. The spa is ranked in Travel and Liesure but was nothing special they didn't even have a hot tub. You have to sign up for a couple's massage to use the one hot tub. Also when they take you around for the grand tour they mention the yoga/pilates classes and the sweat lodge so we were going to attend yoga and the sweet lodge and then realized for an additional charge. The yoga classes are $33 and the sweet is $150 a person. I am a yoga instructor and have never had to pay for yoga classes ie. the tides, Miraval, or anywhere we have stayed this should be included. Also most sweats are by donations. Total rip off esp. since we were paying over $800 per night for our room. On the flip side the beach was beautiful a little boring and the 3 pools they have were all freezing. I saw one lady one day in one of the pools the pools should be heated. No infinity pools and no pools by the beach. We had a private scuba dive which was amazing and I was not certified so the guy certified me there at the hotel in the pool and the pool was so cold that the guide had me in a full wet suit. may i remind you we are in mexico. the pool temp was much colder than the ocean. we needed to buy some dental floss and it was $9 . Anyways I think I have made my point Maroma may be for some people like older people or someone who wants no contact with the outside world and that may be for you but we 36 and 34 and so for mid 30's I would say go elsewhere. We were highly disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone we know.

However after e-mailing manager and travel agent contacting them i was assured that it would be ok. They were open and honest about the closure of one of the restaurants and we could hear some construction noise on one side of resort However this did not disrupt our trip. The resort staff was so attentive and concerned that we had a great time. The're modo was \"handmade hospitality\". This means handmade soaps in the bathroom, eco-friendly options on the whole resort, limited use of lights (candle light instead) so romantic. The food was mexican gourmet food. We also enjoyed a BBQ on the beach. This resort is immaculately clean. These people take pride in what they do. The spa is not to be missed. Ask what you wish and they try to get it for you.. This was not a inexpensive vacation but it is easy enough to see where your money was spent ! Breakfast on the balcony is the best, it arrives quick and always hot ! I will make this one of my top picks to return to. I was in a premium room on the second floor with a part ocean view and pool view. This room was on the lower end of price range.

Maroma was by far our favorite. Located on a beautiful stretch of beach, this hotel offers a very romantic, and intimate setting for those looking to escape it all. Totally hidden away from the road, it's a 5-10 drive through the \"jungle\" down to the hotel which is located right on the beach (no high rise hotel here!). The rooms in the original section of the hotel are in several small buildings offering garden and ocean view rooms. The rooms are simply but elegantly decorated in a rustic mayan theme (think white stucco walls, mahogany furniture, creamy linens and mexican tiled floors). We had an ocean view room with a private patio complete with a breakfast table and hammock to retreat to when we'd had enough sun. The restaurant here offers the ultimate in gourmet cuisine and it really is an experience with the way they set up the dinner service. Lots of candles, soft music and a breeze coming in off the Caribbean sea. The Kinan Spa is large and offers a wide range of spa treatments. They also have yoga and other special classes for those looking to have a total wellness experience. While we found this resort to be very romantic, I could also see getting the girls together for a spa weekend here for total pampering. Especially in the newer section of the hotel that has more mainstream hotel accommodations. Being a travel agent for 12+ years I've had the opportunity to experience hundreds of hotels around the the world. Maroma easily ranks in my top 10.

It was a very special trip that we've talked about often with our friends and family. I used the TripAdvisor site to get other people's reviews and found it helpful when planning my own trip, I hope I can do the same for someone else We were met at the airport by a nice man who greeted us with water and a towel, when he knew our name we just assumed it was because he was sent to greet us. We arrived before our room was ready so the hotel offered us a clean room to use to change and freshen up. We sat at Freddy's bar for our first taste of delicious ceviche and some drinks. When Freddy called us by our names (they use first names with everyone) we didn't understand after being there for only an hour how he knew us. What we didn't realize was that everyone already knew our names and our room number. This was all before checking in to the room. It was amazing how they didn't overlook any details, we were impressed. The service the entire stay was wonderful. Many waiters were available during the day to bring us drinks or food and set up chairs. The beach lounge chairs were as large as a queen bed built for two and were fantastic. Your feet never have to touch the sand. But I implore you to take a walk on the beach, the quality of which is amazing. We live in Los Angeles, have been to other beaches in Mexico, the Carribbean and the Hampton's, to us nothing compared to this sand. It's soft fine quality was beautiful, the water was a gorgeous blue and calm. It was easy to sit in the shallow part of the water or jump in for swimming. The only negative experience I had at the beach was often these wonderful beach beds were \"saved\" by greedy guests. Often we came down in the morning to find just a magazine out on a bed and no guest arriving until hours later. It became a bit of a game, perhaps based on the time of year that we went. However, we always had a chair and an umbrella and once they even carried a beach bed down from the pool for us to use at the beach. At night they entire resort is lit by candle light creating gorgeous and romantic lighting for the walkways leading to the different parts of the hotel and to your room. The restaurants were great, for variety we went into the town of Playa del Carmen one evening. We enjoyed having the chance to people watch and check out a new place, but the food was fair and I wouldn't recommend it if you have a limited number of nights. There are two restauarants at the hotel, we never felt like this was a problem. Also on specific nights there are special buffet dinners in the sand. We enjoyed that we saw the same small group of people during the day and night. The spa style restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch, they were able to make anything we wanted which was great for a lighter bite. We enjoyed egg white omelettes in the morning and fresh salads for lunch. My boyfriend also treated us to a very romantic dinner on the beach. The scene looked out of movie or TV show. It was gorgeous and decadant and wonderful. The menu was created specifically for us with wine pairings, we had a five course meal under the moonlight. The path to our place in the sand was lit by candles and torches and in the middle of this circle was our beautiful table. It was amazing to eat five feet from the ocean sitting at this gorgeous table. They even provided blankets for us when the weather dropped and I was a bit cold. It was a magical night that I will never forget. If you want more of a nightlife, this is not the hotel for you. It's a small boutique hotel and very much feels that way in the evenings. They do offer a room with computers and a television, however we never went into it other then to check on our flight home. I feel that the purpose of this resort is to relax, unwind and float away. We enjoyed a couple's massage at the spa which was great. I thought the amenities were great and even used the small hotel gym a few mornings. We also did a full day tour to explore ancient ruins of Coba (set up through the hotel). The day trip was a bit pricey but we did a lot of things - we went repelling into a cenote, climbed Nohoch Mul Pyramid, was witness to a Mayan ritual ceremony, zip linned, and took a canoe. It was fun to explore and I would highly recommend it for those visitors who want to break up the beach routine. We did a ton of research when looking into this trip and felt thrilled with our decision. It is a magical place. In full discloure however I feel that it is necessary to make one further comment. We traveled in high season during Christmas. The day we were leaving a large family was arriving, and my boyfriend and I were both thankful that we would not overlap. It's not the kind of place to bring kids, even sophisticated and well behaved kids. We were happy that the hotel had a policy of no one under the age of 16. However during holiday season they are a bit more lapse about this rule. We saw kids who were 12 and 13. We were surprised parents would take their children here given its quiet, secluded beach and tranquil setting. However, I would make sure when booking to inquire about the policy if you are looking for a romantic trip.

I had read many Trip Advisor reviews of the property and had high expectations, and all I can say is that Maroma exceeded all of them! As others have written, Maroma stands apart because of its wonderful and kind staff. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted with several smiles and \"Holas!,\" two margaritas and a tour of the grounds. By the second day everyone there knew our names. It means a lot to them that you learn theirs and attempt to speak in Spanish. The entire staff really go out of their way to make you feel like you are at home and are happy to help you with anything. On that note, the staff is constantly adding personal touches to make you feel special. We got upgraded to an ocean-facing suite, which had a spacious living room, bedroom and large bathroom. The room was decorated with red rose petals upon our arrival and they had also given us a complimentary bottle of champagne. On another night my husband and I came back from dinner and one of the staff was drawing a bubble bath in our plunge bath and adding rose petals and candles all around the bathroom. These are not things we requested...they just seemed to happen by magic! Every night the woman who did the turn-down service would also leave some kind of treat like chocolate-covered strawberries or a tequila cocktail. These are just some of the small touches that make you want to stay there and never go home...when it finally was time to go home we learned that Maroma has its own VIP lounge at the Cancun Airport for exclusive use by guests of Maroma and the Ritz-Carlton. Even upon leaving, we were once again surprised by the level of detail and thoughtfulness that they have put into making their guests comfortable. We spent most of our time at the beach, which is absolutely pristine, as it is raked several times a day and is therefore free of seaweed and debris. We never had a problem getting a beach bed and we easily spent all day out there just relaxing and swimming in the beautiful water. Definitely order lunch from Freddy's Bar and have it brought over to your beach bed/lounge chair. The shrimp quesadillas, ceviche and guacamole are so good and I keep wishing I had some here at home! Freddy's is also the perfect spot to have a pre or post-dinner cocktail. The pina coladas were some of the best we've tasted, but I don't think you could have a bad experience there! We had fun talking to Freddy himself, who is very funny and outgoing, and has lots of stories to share. We ate dinner most nights outside at El Restaurante and one night inside at El Sol. El Restaurante has a very nice selection and we particularly liked the fresh fish selections of the red snapper and shellfish. Sitting right on the beach at sunset is wonderful and we never tired of it. El Sol is really special and worth going to for more nouvelle cuisine. We thought of leaving Maroma one night for dinner but were enjoying the food and atmosphere so much that we were glad we stayed in. I recommend trying to get a room facing the water as you will get a nice breeze. We walked through the inner-facing courtyard areas in the evenings and it was always significantly hotter and muggier than the rooms facing the water. Also, the mosquitoes can be a problem on nights with little or no breeze, so bring repellent or plan to eat inside on those nights. Because Maroma is small, you will never feel like just another guest at a mega-resort. The staff really want to know who you are and how to make your stay the best that it can be!

From start to finish, it was a wonderful experience. I had researched many other places before deciding on the Maroma (Parrot Cay; One & Only Palmilla (was undergoing construction during this period); las Ventanas; Four Seasons Punta Mita, etc., as well as the other hotels in this area:the Mandarin Oriental; Rosewood Mayakoba; and Tides) and finally decided on Maroma partly as a result of Tripadvisor reviews... and I was not disappointed. (as for price btw, it is expensive but for the kind of room and setting, in my view it was a better value than most of the others). The staff here are all super-friendly, making an effort to learn everyone's name, and service is with a smile. The Sian-nah suite was brand new, with a huge bathroom (with indoor and outdoor shower and jacuzzi), a gym room with an elliptical machine and weights; a terrace with a little plunge pool (which we did not use) and hammock (which we did) and another terrace facing the ocean, along with a rooftop outdoor massage area where masseuses from the spa (which is gorgeous btw) came and gave us massages... was super relaxing because we felt the breeze and could hear the sea... The beach set up is wonderful--tons of room btw, we never had a problem finding beach mattresses... the staff would sweep the algae off the beach every morning; they would open up umbrellas and serve drinks or food beachside. There are a few dining options and we were happy with all of them; we had lunch at Freddy's bar every day (excellent ceviche and tons of tequila to choose from); and also, since we were celebrating a special occasion, we had a special beachside romantic dinner set up one night, complete with flame-lit path to our table and again wonderful setting and custom-made food. On Friday night there was a fire show and mariachi band, all of which were very tasteful (on the one night we went to Playa del Carmen to the Mayan restaurant Yaxche--which we totally disliked-- we experienced a tacky version of a mariachi band). I would totally skip Playa del Carmen by the way. We did go to Tulum one day, which was a good cultural experience, but frankly I was content to just stay at the resort. It is a peaceful and quiet resort, not very kid friendly probably; for us without kids, it was a perfect quiet relaxing escape. There were special romantic touches at various points throughout our stay which made us love the Maroma and we would go back in a heart beat. By the way, upon arrival from Cancun airport, we were greeted by someone (make sure you go outside and avoid all the people who approach you indoors) and met the Maroma's driver in a swanky SUV (maybe an Escalade? but in any event, brand new with refreshing towels and bottled water); the trip to the hotel was less than 1/2 hour. The weather during our stay was hot, but less so than we had expected; I think it made a big difference to have an ocean-front room, as there is always a breeze. For noise sensitive people, note that you DO hear the waves at night, so take ear plugs if you are in one of those rooms...

We drove ourselves to the resort as we hired a car for the previous part of our trip to Playa Del Carmen and Chichzen Itza. However, we could have returned the vehicle as we had no desire to leave the resort during our stay. Upon our arrival we were greeted by name, handed a Maroma signature margarita, given a tour of the resort and shown to our beautiful ground floor suite with a fantastic ocean view. IMO the layout was beautiful, comfortable and the bathroom completely private if you forgot and left the curtains open. Due to having a room almost directly on the beach, some might find privacy a concern. But to be honest we had no problems with this as it was really not that easy to see into the living area unless you were very close to the window inside and out. And quite difficult to see into the bedroom. Between the living area and the bedroom are two large doors you could close for extra privacy. I loved lying in bed in the morning with the curtains just opened for that wonderful view of the sea. A coffee machine was provided ,as well as the coffee service brought to you each morning. We like very strong coffee and used the machine daily for espressos. Free internet service was very handy for us, as we had some work commitments to follow up and having provided this in room made it very easy. We found the bed and pillows comfortable. Plenty of room for our clothes and luggage. Molton Brown toiletries. Candles provided by the bath for that romantic evening and enough room for two although the little step in the tub as a bit odd to us. The double headed showers inside and out were a nice touch as well. Turndown service was beautiful with candles lighted in both the living and bed room areas. We were surprised with some beautiful petal arrangements on the bed twice during our stay. We found the private pool useful for having a fresh water cooling dip as it was quite hot during our summer visit. Some previous reviews claim of the pool being too cold. But we really found it quite refreshing. The beach is beautiful, with soft white sand and looks just like the photos. It was everything I could have hoped for. With plenty of large sun beds and chairs for sunning. We never had a problem getting a bed almost directly in front of our suite The beach beds were comfortable and we had good beach service. Although we did have to ask twice for an ice bucket to keep the beers cold, when it seemed no problem for some of the folks around us to get one. One comment, I was surprised to not find any way of washing the sand from your feet coming from the beach and getting to your room. I would have also liked a shower close to the beach lounging area. But, lucky for us we just used the shower in the private massage area very close to the beach. For my husbands birthday we splashed out and paid for the private beach front dinner. The set up was beautiful and our waiter couldn't have been better. . We dined in all the restaurants and had room service once for dinner and breakfast. The food was very enjoyable, but I must admit we had some meals just as good in Playa Del Carmen. But the view more than made up for it. The spa with lovely. But, in the steam/changing room there was only one seat, so once while waiting to be called for my appt. I had no where to sit, as the only chair was occupied. My husband enjoyed his first massage so much, he booked another for the last day. We also had the lovers chocolate massage and can highly recommend this treatment. Our therapists were first rate, We have enjoyed many treatments from top resorts and the therapists treating us truly made the experience. I would like to thank all the previous TA reports concerning the billing as this helped to know you would be paying for everything and budgeting accordingly.

I don't think words could ever describe the true essence of Maroma. It is out of this world breathtaking. When we turned onto the long dirt road off the highway we had no idea what to expect! But we truly pulled up to paradise. We were kindly greeted by the general manager, and a woman named Gabriella, who was part of the hospitality staff, offered us Maroma margaritas (very potent!) and led us on a tour of the property. What I loved most about Maroma....lush landscaping, gorgeous flowers, refreshing, hidden pools, the iguanas/peacocks/& parrots, the hundreds of candles lit each night throughout the grounds, and of course the fact that it is all set on one of the top beaches in the world. We were in a garden-view room (#15, Las Rosas). When I entered the room I thought, \"If this is the garden-view room then what could possibly be better in the higher room categories?!\" We had a spacious porch with a sofa, hammock, and table/chairs. I loved the fact that had a door to the porch, which we could close for privacy. Each morning room service delivered coffee to a ledge outside our room, and we also enjoyed room service breakfast on the porch. It was very relaxing to sit outside each morning and listen to all of the birds. Our room looked like it had been recently renovated. The bed was very comfortable and had mosquito netting, which we pulled back (not needed for bugs, just romantic effect). Every night housekeeping lit candles in our room and turned on the Maroma CD. We commented on how much we enjoyed the music, and on our last day there Gabriella brought us a CD that she had made for us to take home! The staff were the friendliest and most genuine people I've ever met. They learned our names within 30 minutes of arrival and continued to call us by name the whole time we were there. For example, at dinner each night they would say, \"Hi, Jennifer! How was your day? What would you like for dinner this evening?\" When we were at Maroma we felt like we were staying at a friend's hacienda. The atmosphere was warm and intimate. One day we hopped on the motorboat that takes you out to the reef for snorkeling (only a 5-min. ride). We saw a variety of fish and would definitely recommend going (two trips a day--11am and 2pm). We also enjoyed a couples massage (ancient healing) at Kinan Spa. It was amazing! Other than that we just relaxed on the over-sized beach beds, where we could have stayed for days and days! Maroma has two entertainment rooms where you can watch TV and check your email. We prefer not having TV in our room on vacation, but it was nice to be able to check our email after we had checked out of our room and were waiting on airport transportation. I could go on and on about this magical place, but I think my pictures will do it more justice than my description :) All in all, Maroma is the ultimate luxury hideaway.

The one thing that still needs to change is the lack of privacy in most of the units. They do have a couple of very upscale suites that are private.

The staff is lovely, I felt like a pregnant princess and there were two other pregnant couples there as well. We had a large, amazing junior suite with veranda overlooking beach. The food is amazing with three great restaurants. We went to the lighter fare spa restaurant for breakfast and lunch sometimes to fight off vacation pounds. We used the health club, had the beach butlers bring us drinks, napped, swam, snorked off the coast of the resort and the reef was incredible. My husband did the sweat ritual and liked it. Pools too were amazing...we left kicking and screaming. It was heavenly... My only teeny criticism is that EVERYTHING will cost something. Once we were asked if we wanted a tour of the jungle and the foliage, history, ecosystem. We said, sure, great! We found out after it was something ridiculous like $35 US a person.

There are plenty of options for food but it was nice to get out one day for something different. We set up a guide through the hotel to go to the Dos Ojos Cenotes... it was a magical experience. Concierge recommended getting our own car since we wanted to go see the ruins in Tulum as well. It could not have been easier. The agency dropped the car off in the morning (we had rented it for one day) and when we returned i gave the keys to the parking attendant and it was picked up the next morning. Our FAVORITE meal in Tulum was the Pollo Bronco on the main strip. They only serve roasted chicken, rice and tortillas. (a whole chicken is about 10 bucks). AWESOME.

We arrived at Maroma and were greeted by name at the entrance. We were given a \"Margarita\" and they showed us to our room - a very comfortable oceanview room with beautiful local handcrafted furniture. It was just above Freddy's bar and had a spectacular view of the caribbean sea. We wasted no time and went right to the main attraction (for us, at least) - the beach. We were blown away by the beach beds and the fantastic service by Daniel and Johnny. It was my husband's birthday that day, and Daniel brought us a birthday cake and two complimentary drinks. The beach is one of the best we have ever been to. Stunning blue sea with powdery white sand. The restaurants are both very good (Luis, the restaurant manager, was always around and is happy to customize any entree to your likings). I specially recommend staying there on a Friday night (we were there for two) and dining at \"El restaurante\". It is their barbecue night and the food is superb. We were not there on lobster season - but had plenty of other wonderful seafood options to choose from. We loved the spa - we booked a lomi lomi massage in a couples massage room. The staff was truly exceptional. The \"hospitalidad\" staff is also fantastic. They helped us plan our evenings outside of the resort, plan our day trip to Chichen Itza and even provided us with the resort maps so we wouldn't get lost on our way back \"home\" (we rented a car in Playa del Carmen for 2 days, so we could drive on our own to Chichen Itza and visit the towns around Maroma). They are all exceptional, but specially the afternoon/evening hosts - Carla and Priscilla. The staff is what makes this resort so special. We were very well impressed with the attentiveness of the service - they all know you by name by the second day and treat you like a part of the \"family\". We were also well impressed with the person taking care of the resident birds. He was this sweet Mayan man that took care of the parrots and other birds that live at Maroma as if they were his own. Everyone seems to truly enjoy their job. This is really an immersion experience into the Mexican/Mayan culture. They always speak to you in Spanish (and English, fear not) and some, if you're so interested, will even teach you some Mayan words.

It was everything I hoped it would be. We were celebrating our 16th anniversary and had been looking for a great place to go. A family member had highly recommended it to us so we looked it up online and I read all of the tripadvisor reviews before going. I was a bit worried that I perhaps I had built up my expectations too much given the large number of great reviews but I was not disappointed at all. My high expectations were met and often exceeded. Some reasons we liked Maroma: --The Mexican traditional style lends a sense of being in another land. We didn't want to be in a hotel that felt like any other 5-star hotel in the states. We spent an afternoon/evening at the Rosewood at Mayakoba with family who were vacationing there and, although the hotel is beautiful and their room was bigger and had the designer touch, it didn't feel like Mexico. The rooms (and the hotel) are more rustic but comfortable. Our room was big enough with Spanish tile flooring and a big tub that was more like a jacuzzi. --It is extremely quiet and peaceful. We were amazed at how uncrowded it seemed even though they were fully booked. I had worried that we wouldn't be able to get beach beds but we never had a problem getting one. Some mornings we put our things out by 7 or 8, others by 9 and there were still beds available. The restaurant almost always seemed to have just enough people to appear desirable but not so many that it was noisy or we couldn't pick the table we wanted. There were a couple of rainy nights when everyone had to eat inside rather than out on the patio and on those nights it was more full but still with available tables. --It never feels crowded. I mentioned the restaurants but the beach also feels relatively free of people. There is enough distance between beach beds and chairs to give privacy and there are not very many other people on the beach. We saw some walkers each day from the hotel south of Maroma but it never bothered us. I took a yoga class one morning and there were only four of us in the class. When I used the exercise room one morning, there was only one other woman in there for the first few minutes and then it was empty but for me. The times we used the spa (and it was almost fully booked), it seemed so quiet. I had the relaxation/waiting room to myself before a treatment and the his and hers after-massage rooms we had to ourselves after a couples massage. --The service was among the best I've experienced so far--attentive without being stuffy. I attribute part of it to the friendly nature of the people who work there. I never felt that they were hovering but the second I needed something there would almost always be someone right there, sometimes two or three. One morning at breakfast my husband dropped his camera lens under the table and immediately two or three waiters were there getting it for us. We never had to wait very long at all for food or our glasses to be refilled. The employees there often would say, \"It is a pleasure to serve you\" or \"It is a blessing to serve you!\" Johnny, the man in charge of helping people on the beach with their beds, umbrellas, and chairs works so hard to make sure people have the right amount of shade or sun, enough towels, the right position facing the sun,etc. We made friends with several of our servers. --It is very romantic. We had an ocean view room and loved waking up to the sounds and sight of the palm trees, beach, and ocean each morning. At night we would leave our shutters open to feel the perfect-temperature breezes. The peace and quiet and uncrowdedness all lend themselves to creating a place in which you can savor being with a loved one. One night we had a private dinner in \"El Miradaor,\" a nook at the highest point of the hotel. The food was from \"El Sol,\" the more formal restaurant and it was very good. I thought the portions were perfect and my husband did as well. Every night the candles that light up the place make it seem magical. On Friday night, after the traditional barbeque, we sat in the semi-circle of chairs (by ourselves) around the warm embers of a dying bonfire next to the ocean. Just north of the hotel there is just jungle along the beach rather than a string of hotels. There was a lit lantern next to each beach bed so even the beach was romantically lit (they didn't do this every night as some nights were rainy). --The beach and water are perfect. The vivid turquoise and jade colors in the ocean took my breath away. The sand is soft and powdery and the hotel keeps it so clean. There are even pretty shells to be found. The swimming is perfect because the ocean floor very gradually descends and the waves are not too big. The floor is not rocky and I couldn't see any coral. Some have mentioned it can get pretty windy which I worried about. I found that on the days it was windier, I was still comfortable being outside on the beach. --The clientele of the hotel seem to be mostly in their 40s and older. We found that the people that are there are there to relax, bond, and unwind. It seemed rare to find loud guests. Overall, this was a gem of a find and we will definitely go back. The only cons were: a couple of mornings the hot drink they delivered to our private patio was not hot and my husband found the bed to be not as comfortable as our own at home (Heirloom) although I thought it was fine.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cMy First Choice in Mexico\u201d", "Author": "httraveler", "ReviewID": "UR12962236", "Content": "The combination of locaton, beach, ambience, service and food ranks right with the best in Mexico as far as I am concerned. That in combination with the clear blue Carribean waters make this my first choice in Mexco. I recently stayed at Palmilla in Cabo so I have some basis for comparison. The location is remote and beautiful. The grounds are well kept and manicured. Not on the same scale as Palmilla, but every bit as pretty. The beach at Maroma is as fine a beach as you will find anywhere. Very clean, with plenty of two person lounges (mattresses) on the beach. We rarely left the beach and ate most of our lunches right there. Plenty of servers ready to bring you whatever you need. Palmilla has the edge on pools, but I will take the beach any day. Not only is the beach large and clean but the water is clear and beautiful. Perfect to get in and relax. Coral reefs are available for snorkeling less than five minutes by boat away. The beach and water are far superior to what you will find at Palmilla, but that is to be expected since Palmilla is on the Pacific. The ambience is quite romantic. (as is the ambience at Palmilla!) Unlike some resorts in Mexico, Maroma is \"Mexican traditional.\" If you are looking for lots of glitz, then it is not for you. The resort is understated and laid back and at night lighting is provided by candles lit all over the property. Likewise service at Maroma was exceptional and the food was very good. Most of the staff seemd to know our names after the first day. I booked Maroma for my 20th wedding anniversary and for a few of our dinners made special arrangements in advance. We had one meal up in the tower and another on the beach. Although expensive, both were exceptional. I found the service at Maroma and Palmilla to be pretty equal, although Palmilla has a few touches (butler service etc) that might give it a slight edge. I also found the spas at both places to be very good. I will call it a tie. Finally the rooms. The rooms are very roomy and very nice, but they are older. Extremetly comfortable. But they don't compare to the suites at Palmilla. ( I am not sure anything does.) Perhaps a better comparison to the Palmilla would be the Sinh Suites but I don't know. This is the one area where Palmilla has a definite edge. Despite that edge, the overall luxury and ambience at Maroma, in combination with the superior beach and water make it every bit as desireable a getaway spot. More so for me because of the water and beach. My guess is others would pick Palmilla because of the luxrious rooms and surroundings but I would highly recommend Maroma if you are looking for a luxurious beach getaway. .", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larchmont, NY", "Title": "\u201cone of the best, hands down\u201d", "Author": "bbggolden", "ReviewID": "UR12875065", "Content": "To celebrate my husbands birthday, I was looking for a warm weather destination that would offer a relaxing and elegant getaway for us and our friends.

This is a great hotel and I would be extremely happy to go back. We previously stayed at Esencia down the coast early in 2007 so I will make some comparisons. I have some specific comments below, but keep in mind that they are a bit nit-picky since our overall experience was wonderful. Room: We had the room called La Luna, which was a Premium room with partial ocean view. It was quite small and the toilet seat was broken, but the bed was very comfortable and I loved being so close to the beach and main house/restaurant. I much preferred our room at Esencia, which was much bigger and brighter and had a plunge pool as well (although it was a bit more expensive and had a jungle view). Since we got a great deal on the room at Maroma we didn't really care that it was small. Food: We ate at the fancier El Sol the first night but from then on ate at the more casual El Restaurante for all of our meals. While the food was excellent at both places we liked the variety of El Restaurante more and the fact that it was less formal. They had an excellent guitar player playing classical music at El Sol and a great Mariachi band at El Restaurante. The food and drinks were very expensive at Maroma, but we ate a lot (the portions were quite big). They had the best corn soup I ever had and the Tres Leches cake was also really good. We ate every meal at the hotel all week long. At the Esencia, the food choices were more limited so we felt we had to leave the hotel once in a while to eat. Service: The service was fantastic in all respects. Everyone was incredibly friendly (as they were at Esencia). Beach: It is annoying how people get up at the crack of dawn, go out and put a book on a beach bed to reserve it, and don't come back for hours. They should implement a policy like at some other hotels where you can't leave stuff on the bed for more than an hour or so to reserve it. I had to get out there by 7:30am to get the last beach bed (and at least I stayed there to enjoy it, even if I was nearly alone!). The beach is beautiful, although I slightly preferred the beach at Esencia, which felt a little more deserted. The free snorkeling trip included with the room was really fun, but a bit too quick (less than an hour). Other facilities: We used the gym and spa as well as the tennis courts. All were quite nice (they have tennis equipment they will loan to you for free). The multimedia rooms were very comfortable and often empty, and they had a decent selection of books and DVDs. The wifi service rarely worked, however, and neither did the Ethernet in my room. We enjoyed sitting by the pools in the garden area and near the gym, and they were rarely crowded. We also liked playing pool in the billards room after dinner. In many ways, Maroma and Esencia have a similar vibe - exclusive, quiet, beautiful beaches, excellent service, etc. Maroma is a bit bigger and there were more things to do like tennis, a bigger spa and gym, etc. WHile I preferred the room at Esencia I know they have larger beautiful rooms at Maroma as well. In both places the staff learns your name and you don't need to deal with getting checks for meals or paying cash for anything the whole time, which was great. For me I would very happily stay at either place again and the decision of which place to stay would probably depend on what kind of promotions they were running at the time.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIncomparable service\u201d", "Author": "pursuit", "ReviewID": "UR12020770", "Content": "So my boyfriend and I agree on the rating--excellent. Our beach background--Cap Juluca, Ritz in St Thomas, Pacifica in Cabo, Grace Bay Club in Turks and Caicos, Biras Creek in Virgin Gorda. Returned to NYC from paradise last week....So interesting to read other reviews....not much more to add (agreed with most, disagreed with some--feel free to contact me if you would like specifics) so here's what we thought would be some helpful info if you decide to go (at least they would have been for me): -Hospitality was overwhelming. Nothing but smiles and willingness on everyone's part to make your stay memorable (someone raking seaweed on the beach came over and made our beachbed for us just because he saw me put my bag down; our waiter from El Sol put down our wine he had brought over to our private bonfire-see below-to help rearrange our chairs and then went to the laundry to bring us fresh towels from the dryer). -The concierge desk can arrange almost anything for you (granted, at a cost). My boyfriend was craving an ice cream sundae; with a little explanation and instructions on ingredients, we had a delicious 3 scoop gourmet ice cream sundae at exactly the time I had requested it. They also put together a private bonfire for us on the beach on our last night, where we sat under a cloudless sky with our port after dinner. It was fabulous. Shooting stars and all. -El Sol, the more formal restaurant, has air-conditioning indoors; El Restaurante does not. Only 7 outdoor tables at El Sol which are lovely (maybe 8?) but they filll up quickly and cannot be requested in advance. -I was stunned about the comment on small portions for the price; we both thought they were enormous. Food is excellent everywhere. I tended to stick to seafood but my boyfriend's venison and lamb were great. They can make whatever you request (I had a fish taco craving and requested a freshly caught Grouper \u2018burrito\u201d and was in foodie heaven). -the bottled Maroma water is purified still water, replaced every day in your room and free of charge. Fiji is $11/liter bottle. I don\u2019t even want to know what our liter bottles of Evian cost. Steep. -They provide mosquito repellent in each room and have some at each restaurant if needed. -free ethernet access in each guest room (?correct techno term) but very spotty. Laptops for public use in the main entertainment room. For those who need it: great blackberry and AT&T wireless reception everywhere (sigh). -no satellite TV hook up in the guestrooms but you can request a TV and DVD player for $30/day ---caveat: their DVD collection is more classic than contemporary. -if you do not speak Spanish well, there will be some misunderstandings. Although many of the staff speak English well, no one is fluent. I had asked which Pinot Noirs they had by the glass and ended up with a bottle of Coppola (maybe $18 at the most in NYC--don't even want to know what the mark up was at El Sol. But we enjoyed it.) -Marina is at the east end of the resort (near the newer rooms which are immediately next to a neighboring resort), an easy walk from anywhere. I enjoyed the included snorkeliing which is a 30 second boat ride to the bordering reef (even saw a turtle), but it is certainly nothing compared to Turks (there is another farther reef snorkeling excursion which you can arrange at cost). I found it annoying that you had to pay $90 a day for hobie cat use, which has always been included at other resorts. They do have jetskis but no license to operate them. -I agree that beach is not as private as other places (Cap Juluca), and you will hear people talking around you. Don't believe them when they tell you that there are enough beach beds for every guest--there are about 60 rooms and maybe 15 beach beds...hmmmmm. Reserve early (i.e. put down a bag or a book). -One couple was irate when they found out (at checkout time on their bill) that the tequila they were \"talked into\" ordering was so expensive. You will never know the prices of the beverages you order (unless you ask; hence my shock about the cost of the Fiji---oh well). Cocktails seem to be generally NYC prices ($14-18 on average, coronas about 6). So if you don\u2019t want to be surprised, ask before you order. -do NOT count on getting a good cup of coffee or espresso (I do not think this is unique to this resort, but par for the course in Mexico; wonder what the lattes at Starbucks in PDC taste like?). By the 3rd day and multiple requests/instructions/pleas, we resorted to tea service (although they never gave enough hot water and I finally asked for 2 carafes every day). If you must have coffee, bring instant. -taxi to Playa del Carmen can be called by concierge and is $20 each way; hotel car service is $28 each way (would arrange this in advance as it was unavailable our first trip out). The driver will pick you up for the return whenever and from wherever you ask.

I've searched and read tons of reviews, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to leave one of my own. Maroma is truly in a class of its own. The resort is absolutely gorgeous and spacious. We stayed in an ocean view room, which wasn't huge but completely adequate, especially since the resort offers plenty of space to lounge around. It's so private and intimate that you can easily find plenty of opportunity to be alone. The fact that the resort has 3 pristine, heated pools on top of a world class beach is amazing. In addition to single lounge chairs with ultra comfortable cushions, the beach has king size beds for two with plush pillows - the first time I've ever stayed at a resort with such a luxury. The food is truly gourmet, and for health-minded guests, one of the three restaurants, Cilantro, serves nutritious spa cuisine for breakfast and lunch. If you like to exercise and stay fit while you're away, there's a very modern fitness center, and daily classes, including spinning, yoga and pilates, as well as two lighted tennis courts. Through its special touches, Maroma feels authentic Mexican, from the varied selections at the Ceviche bar, to the 120 different types of tequila offered, to the classy Mexican serenaders singing outdoors at dinner time, to the woman who brings hot fresh made tortillas directly to your breakfast table (her hands still covered in dough). At night, Maroma is lit with 1,200 candles throughout the property to give it an elegant, romantic feel. Best of all, Maroma has better service than anywhere I've ever stayed (even better than Parrot Cay, which is renowned for treating its guests like royalty). Everyone is extremely friendly and ready to go out of their way to ensure you have the best stay possible. I have been to places that are accommodating with food substitutions, but Maroma will make make you virtually whatever you want, as long as they have it in the kitchen. My wife and I arrived at Maroma one day late due to a snowstorm in the Northeast, and the reservations manager was super friendly and flexible in changing the dates, offering to help in any way he could. To provide some context on how it stacks up against other similar resorts, in addition to Parrot Cay, my wife and I have been to Horned Dorset Primavera (a spectacular property in Puerto Rico), Royal Hideaway, the Ritz in St. Thomas, Caneel Bay, and Maroma is hands-down the winner.

We had a garden room overlooking the pool and it was very nice. Loved the Molten Brown products and special made bath salts and soaps they use. I think Maroma would be a fantastic place for a honeymoon b/c it is so romatic and lovely. Candles are set out at night to light the paths and you can dine right on the beach patio. The turndown service includes decadent sweet treats, candles and incense lit in your room. And your morning beverage of choice is delivered to your room daily. The spa was very nice - the temezcal spa treatment is the Mayan sweatlodge experience and we highly recommend it as well. We LOVED the wait staff and all the folks at Freddy's bar there. They make the best mojitos and the Maroma Margaritas made with the special Yucatan honey/anise liquer called xtabentun are heavenly!

I had a hot rock massage and felt like I was transformed. Pools: 3 pools that are not heated. Overall, I would recommend Maroma.

My wife and I spent 6 nights at Maroma and it was everything we expected and more. I read a lot of reviews on here and one thing I look for is where the reviewers have traveled before. Having an idea of what people's perspective of nice is really helps. That being said, my wife and I like to stay at the best properties we can find, which unfortunately means the most expensive (in our experience). Our beach vacations include such places as Point Grace (Turks and Caicos), Bitter End Yacht Club and Biras Creek (BVI), Morningstar Beach Resort (St Thomas), Ritz (Grand Cayman), etc.. ACCOMADATIONS: Now back to Maroma, we stayed in their newly (at the time) built Sian Nah Suite. There are about 12 units, I believe, that are stand alone and directly on the beach - one level. The suites are very spacious, clean, and have a plunge pool, workout room, and huge bathroom! We got a deal on this at the time, because they were rolling them out for the first time. I definitely reccommend getting one of these if your budget allows. Accomadations/rooms are a big thing to me (even though we are rarely in the room) and this was \"cream of the crop\" by far in my travels to date. BEACH: The beach is gorgeous and water is great. Nothing can compare to Turks and Caicos, but Maroma's beach and water are top notch. Oh yeah, they have the BEST beach lounging furniture you will ever lay on in your life. Huge beds, with pillows sitting on the beach - scattered out far enough away from others to give you plenty of privacy. SERVICE: This is why people come to Maroma, the service was again second to none. The people are friendly, attentive, and most importantly there when you need them. If you know Spanish, you may never leave the place. FOOD: We stayed on property every night and the food was great. Breakfast was the best, in my opinion. Tequila tastings are a plus.

It is a beautiful property with average to mediocre management and service. And at the prices they charge, it should be a beautifuly property with incredible service. I honestly cannot understand the rave reviews this hotel gets on this site, normally I find the reviews to be spot on, but on this one, I have to say, I was shocked at the service once we arrived. First, we arrived in the middle of July at about 2 pm. We were a party with 2 rooms - the Sian Nah Suite and a regular, standard room. The Sian Nah suite is gorgeous!! Simply beautiful. The moment we walked into the room it was sweltering - we soon discovered the problem with the gorgous suite -- the Air conditioner DID NOT work for 2 full days - we were only planning to stay for 4 days, and with the AC out for 2 days the stay was basically ruined, as we sweated it out (literally) with mantience people trampling in and out for 2 days. What kind of 5 star hotel allows people to check into a room with a non-functioning A/C???? Now, to be fair, we did not pay for the room, obviously, and we left the resort on the 3rd day because we could not risk another day of our precious vacation ruined. But that was just it - our stay was ruined, as we were not provided a room with functioning A/C in the middle of the steamy jungle in July. We would have gladly paid for a room with functioning A/C, so that we could enjoy our vacation, but that did not happen. Notwithstanding the Sian Nah suite's problems - the standrad room was tiny, I mean SMALL - much smaller than the size of a regular hotel room. There is no sitting area, and not place to put your leggage. If you stay at this hotel DO NOT book the standard room. There is a huge difference in the rooms at this place, and there is a reason you do not see a picture of the standard room on the website. The service - not what people have raved about on this site - I don't know if we were there during an off time, but here are some examples - on the beach, we had to drag our own chairs around to where we wanted them, we were never assisted by anyone, I had to flag down a waiter to get food/drink service every single time. I was shocked at the poor nature of the beach service, in comparison to other Mayan Riviera resorts I have been to - go to the Azul Beach Resort if you truly want superior beach butler service for less than half the price of Maroma. Another example - I needed to call the front desk (to check on the status of the A/C), and didn't have the number - I asked 2 separate beach watiers for the number - neither returned, ever!! And I speak Spanish fluently, so it wasn't a language problem. Getting ice delievered to my room required 2-3 phone calls each time and was at least a 45 minute wait each time. I generally found the same level of inattentativeness with the restaraunts - nothing horrible, but nothing fantastic either, and at the prices they are charging, their service should be fantastic. Trust me, its not. On more big negative - there is no A/C in the restaurants during the day time. Probably not a big deal if you are there in December, but think twice about going here in the summer, when there is no breeze it is miserable. On to the positives - it is a beautiful resort.

We called in advance and they assured us that if our room wasnt ready we would be able to change and sit by the pool when waiting for the room. My wife had flown to Miami the day before from Eastern Europe and we didnt sleep much the night before, so we were exhausted on arrival. They informed us that our room wouldnt be ready till 2 and told us we could have lunch or change and sit by a pool. Thinking it would be ready at 2 we opted for lunch. It was exceptionally hot and by the time lunch finished we were dieing. At 2 the room wasnt ready. Because of the heat and being so tired we started to get sick. At 230 we finally asked to get changed and the walked us across the entire property in the heat to a room to get changed in. We were sweating and thought we would throw up by the time we got there. Finally at 325 as I was walking to the lobby to tell them we would like to go to another hotel, I ran into a worker with the key. The room was nice and had pleasant views. Lots of little annoying things gave the impression that the management was gone and a bunch of teenagers were running the place. We'd sit at the table for 10 minutes waiting on a menu. And they would return in 30 seconds asking for our order. They would attempt to call us by our first names. I never use mine and my wifes was unpronounceable to the help so we never knew what they were saying. There were never towels by the pools. They would light all the candles in our room everynight. Some night we didnt get in till late and arrived to find a room with lots of burnt out candles. We had a snorkeling trip included in our package. every day we went they told us the harbor was closed by the state and we could try the next day.

It was a nice property though not in the league of places like Las Ventanas in Cabo or the 4Seasons Jinbaran Bay. The landscaping looked kind of like a mid 80's Miami landscape architect. The desk help were mostly young teens and 20's who were very sweet, but didnt have customer service down. There were 2 parrots at the entrance that had pulled most of their feathers out, so this is not a place for the PETA inclined.

The den accessed both patios and had great music cds for the Bose player. The way they lighted and candlelit the suite each evening for our return from dinner was tasteful and romantic. The candlelit stone walkways each evening made our five minute walk to and from dinner romantic, and that theme was carried out in the dining room/patio that overlooked the candlelit beach. I wonder who figured out the perfect volume and mix of music to have the band play at dinner, or the piano on the other nights. The attention to detail is something.

The beach \u201cbeds\u201d were fantastic, and the umbrella was moved right on time to keep me and my book out of the sun while my wife worked on her tan right next to me. You couldn\u2019t think you wanted something without it being instantly available. When we went into the water for a brief swim, our beach setup was refreshed for our return. I suggest ordering the guacamole and the gazpacho for a light lunch on the beach. If you really want to shoot the moon, have dinner on the beach (in the sand). They candle-light a manicured sand path to your beautifully set table, surrounded by torches and the surf, and serve a delicious meal prepared especially by the chef\u2014who was happy to meet with me earlier in the day to plan a few personal surprise touches for my wife. The lamb was outstanding and the molten chocolate dessert almost sent me into a happy diabetic coma. Funny story: One night when I called and asked for two extra pillows, the doorbell rang less than 30 seconds later, literally. My wife and I just looked at each other and laughed because we just knew it was impossible for them to be there that fast. Apparently, they communicated by radio to housekeeping, who was right outside my door. We did our best to enjoy all of the amenities\u2014massages, snorkeling, dinner on the beach, viewing the resort and surrounding area from the rooftop lookout, incredible beach service, the swimming pools\u2014but we just could not get enough in 4 days, so we will have to go back.

Maroma did not disapoint in this regard. Things we loved: The beach did not disappoint-- the water was a beautifully clear and calm and the Maroma service makes the beach experience wonderful (as you can read about in other reviews). The service is impeccable. The staff is very warm and makes you feel very welcome and pampered. The grounds are lovely. The dining and bar settings can't be beat-- wind, sea, sun, or moon and stars-- lovely. Things to keep in mind: The rooms vary a lot in quality among room class. I would suggest asking for one in the older part of the hotel as the grounds and nearby amentites are much nicer. We were in an ocean view room on the 3rd floor with a private terrace with a great view. The private outdoor space is definitely the best part of the rooms as they are somewhat small and unspectacular, but comfortable (not sure about the suites though as we did not see them). Bathtubs in garden and ocean view rooms are uncomfortable and almost unuseable as such. Food was mediocre and overpriced. The only great meal we had there was on \"grill night.\" All off-site retaurants are at least a $20, 20 minute cab ride away in playa del carmen. Overall, Maroma is a great choice if you want to lounge on a breath-taking beach and feel quite pampered. If you are the type of person who needs more stimulation then that, it may not be the best choice for you. (They do offer some expensive day trips-- we just didn't try them.)

I just wish it had been a bit cooler, but we knew that since we were going in the middle of the summer, it was going to be hot, so we were not surprised. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order. Hope this is helpful to others! THE BEACH: The beach is beautiful with soft, fine, white sand and aquamarine water with small breakers. There may be a little tiny bit of seaweed floating in the ocean from time to time, but the stretch of beach in front of Maroma is beautiful -- it looks just like the website pictures. No rocks at all. They do have a crew that goes along the beach each morning and removes some of the piles of seaweed that have washed up over night, but there is really not much to clean up. To the right or south of Maroma's beach (if you are facing the sea) there is another resort called the Venta Club, however, it is not very obtrusive -- no notable noise. It is bigger, but the buildings are pretty low-profile and mostly back off the beach. And while you see people on their stretch of the beach, it is not a huge crowd. To the left or north, but quite a ways down the beach is the Iberostar -- a complex of four hotels with more than 1,200 rooms. It looks huge, but it is so far down the beach that you can't hear anything and can't really see any activity. We thought about walking down there one day, but it was such a looong walk that we never did it. Other than being able to see both resorts from the beach, neither intruded on the Maroma experience. Speaking of walking, you do see people walking down Maroma's beach -- presumably from Venta Club or Iberostar (the few who would walk that far) -- but the foot traffic is minimal and unobtrusive. You never feel like your private Maroma beach is being invaded by others. We did take a walk down the beach one day past Venta Club. While it was nice, a bit further down the beach where there is no development (yet) the beach is strewn with trash that has washed ashore \u2013 really unsightly and unfortunate. And it makes you wonder how there is no trash on the beaches in front of the resorts and why the government doesn\u2019t clean it up \u2026 As for the Maroma beach experience -- it is great! The have a series of fabulous \"beach beds\" -- literally king size mattresses on wooden platforms covered in royal blue canvas with about six pillows of various sizes, a side table, a basket of the biggest beach towels I've ever seen and a huge canvas umbrella shading each beach bed. There are beach attendants who will move your umbrella at any time to shade you or expose you to the sun as you choose. In addition, these attendants will bring you drinks and snacks whenever you want. And late morning they bring you a complimentary tray laden with scented, cold towels, a delicious fruit beverage and a fruit skewer. The beach beds rock. One word of caution -- there are more guests than beach beds. After the beach beds, the next option are very nice adjustable wooden chaise lounges with big cushions. They are also shaded by umbrellas and offer the same service, but they aren't nearly as wonderful as the beach beds. There is also a row of adirondack chairs under permanent, non-adjustable thatched palapa umbrellas \u2013 your last resort if there are no chaises or beds. Our daily routine to ensure we got a beach bed was to walk down the beach from our room on the way to breakfast and put our beach bag, etc. on a beach bed. Once we finished breakfast we'd head to our \"reserved\" beach bed and hang out there most of the day. When we went in the ocean or pool, or for a walk, or even snorkeling, we'd leave our stuff behind to \"reserve\" the beach bed. This seemed to be pretty standard operating procedure for the guests, so no one got miffed. Of course, I wouldn't suggest leaving the beach bed for hours -- that's not fair -- but to be gone 45 minutes or an hour seemed totally acceptable. THE FOOD: I would say overall the food is good, but not exceptional, and definitely too expensive. Almost every lunch or dinner entree seemed to be overpriced by $4-8. And the service could drag a bit at times, but we were in no hurry, so it was actually kind of relaxing. Breakfast was included, and it was very good -- take full advantage of it! And they also bring morning coffee to your room and leave it outside your door. Breakfast -- which we ate each morning at the \"casual\" restaurant (El Restuarante) outside under an umbrella -- included two bread baskets, fruit and one breakfast entree. Very tasty. The spa restaurant also has breakfast but since it was not included in our package, we didn\u2019t try it. Lunch can be taken at El Restaurante, the spa restaurant, or on the beach. We had lunch at El Restaurant -- again outside under an umbrella or at our beach bed. The restaurant menu and beach menu are different. Both are good, but I have to say, being able to order lunch from your beach bed and have the attendant bring it to you on a lovely tray is pretty awesome! We did not try the spa lunch but the menu looked good. Dinner is offered at El Restaurante and at the \"fancier\" restaurant \"El Sol.\" Dinner was good -- a mix of seafood, meats, chicken and a few Mexican and Mayan choices. We ate dinner outside, too, but no umbrella necessary at night! LEAVING THE RESORT: We rented a car for a couple of days and did some adventuring. We rented the car through the hotel. It was more expensive than taking a cab to Playa to rent the car, but the convenience of having Budget bring the car to Maroma and the rental process taking three minutes, was worth the extra cost. You can also take cabs anywhere, or take advantage of Maroma\u2019s seemingly pricey \u201cexcursions,\u201d but we thought it would be more fun to do our own thing. We visited the Tulum ruins \u2013 they were okay. Heard Chichen Itza is MUCH better, but with only four days, we didn't want to go that far. We also went to Playa del Carmen -- Fifth Avenue, the main drag, reminded me a bit of main street in St. Thomas. We ate lunch one afternoon in Playa at a beach bar restaurant called Mamitas. Cool scene, crowded beach, okay food and bad service. We also at dinner in Playa at Palapa Hemingway's. Decent food, better prices than Maroma. I wanted to try the Mayan place in town called Yaxhe (sp?) but my boyfriend was hesitant \u2013 their menu looked GREAT. It was also interesting to see the massive amount of development underway along the Yucatan Peninsula. There is so much construction along the beach and in Playa Del Carmen. Fortunately everything that is being built is low-rise (unlike Cancun) but it astounding how MUCH is being built. And even though construction is low-rise, much of it is sprawling complexes, so rather than going up, they go out and out and out. I can image that eventually every piece of beach will be fronted by a resort \u2013 when operations like Rosewood, Mandarin Oriental, Banyan Tree and Kor Hotels put a stake in the ground, that\u2019s big time. THE ROOMS: We had a Sian Nah suite and it was, indeed, fabulous. Our only complaint were the really shoddy shower heads in the shower. For a room that expensive and nice, the shower heads were of the quality you\u2019d find in a Motel 6. Typically, high end rooms in five-star hotels have really nice shower heads. It was a bit surprising. Otherwise the room was great. We loved the plunge pool and the massage palapa and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The turn down service was also really wonderful. One piece of advice, if you book a Sian Nah suite, I would strongly advise you request one on the second level for two reasons \u2013 the plunge pool, although it\u2019s a little bit smaller, it has waaay more privacy than the first floor plunge pool. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush \u2013 part of the fun of a plunge pool is being able to enjoy it \u2026 au natural. Because of the lack of privacy for the first floor plunge pool, you really couldn\u2019t do that without \u201cputting on a show\u201d for other guests. And the massage palapa for the second floor suites are located on the roof of your suite. They are covered by a thatch roof but are open-sided so you have a great 360 degree view and great breezes. The massage palapas on the main floor are much more enclosed and offer little view and breeze access. The second floor suites have bit smaller seating area and the balcony is a bit smaller than the first floor terrace, but the other attributes far outweigh these small minuses. As for the other rooms, we arrived very early \u2013 around 12:30, so our Sian Nah suite was not ready. They gave us a \u201chospitality room\u201d until our room was ready. It was a garden view room, and while it was nicely decorated, it was quite small for the price and was set way back from the beach. I would highly recommend spending a bit more money to get a premium or ocean view room. I did not see the interior of those rooms, but they seemed to be bigger and much better positioned. I think anyone booking a garden view room would probably be disappointed with their accommodations. THE POOLS: The pools are very nice, but the one closest to the restaurants and the main area was heated too much. Its setting is beautiful \u2013 surrounded by lush foliage, but it felt like a hot tub. The spa pool was the best. The farthest away, but the largest and it has a bit of a beach view and the temp was just right. THE BREEZE: Thank goodness for it! We were there at the warmest time of the year and without the constant (literally breeze) we might have been miserable. It\u2019s just plain HOT this time of year. But, during the middle of the day, if you are on the beach, but under an umbrella, or overlooking the beach from a covered restaurant terrace, there is a constant breeze that keeps you quite comfortable. Remove the cover and sit in the sun, you'll definitely be sweating, but the breeze, and a quick dip in the pool or ocean will cool you down. I was amazed that even during the heat of the day, if you were under cover, the breeze made a huge difference -- so lunch or breakfast next to beach, under an umbrella was fine. By dinnertime, when the sun had gone down, it was quite pleasant. When you get away from the beach and the BREEZE it can be quite uncomfortable -- even in the evening. For example, walking through Playa on Fifth Avenue in the late afternoon / early evening, we were positively drenched -- and the same goes for the ruins at Tulum, until we got to the edge of the bluff overlooking the sea and found the breeze again. Overall, we weren't miserable -- except for a few occasions when we were too far inland, but it was hot. If you check the weather for the area on the Weather Channel website, there is a reason it says 88 degrees / feels like 97 degrees.\u201d THE STAFF: Finally, regarding the many raves about the staff on this website \u2013 they were all quite nice, and many did indeed know our names, but it wasn\u2019t really as much of the be-all-end-all for us as it was for others. It was a nice bonus to have such an incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Perhaps if we had been at the resort longer, it may have been more impactful for us.

This was heaven and nirvana on earth. I'm a TripAdvisor freak -- I religiously read the reviews for every single property I'm considering going to -- but have never felt compelled to write before. I read all 148 reviews of Maroma before going, trying to understand how this property got 101 \"5\"s from this admittedly very tough crowd. Could it really be \"all that\"? Now I understand. We stayed 10 days in one of the Sian Nah suites, you can see the photos of the room attached to this review. Overall, I'd say Maroma is one of those places where photos can not possibly capture the sensibility of the place. This experience absolutely redefined luxury for me, and it was magic, magic, magic. I guess I was a little worried, given the price tag -- would this *really* be such an amazing experience for the price? Well, at my first lunch, they brought out 4 different typesof crackers, artfully arranged in a folding napkin extravaganza. I guess that made me feel like they really paid attention to every last little detail, and sure enough, they absolutely do. The staff is unbelievably friendly. Almost, just *almost* on the edge of too friendly, but they never go over that edge. They seem to pick up on when you want to be left alone. And they are just good, really warm people. The beds on the beach were just so great for crashing on all day, every day. The sand was perfect. The water phenomenal. We loved the snorkel trip and did a 1-hour sailing lesson with Sebastian -- wonderful! I found the main restaurant a little bit plain, me personally, so we ended up eating off the beach menu every day for breakfast and lunch, and then at \"El Sol\", their fancier restaurant, each night. Variety and presentation were New York City \"foodie\" quality. Wine list was not enough for a true oenophile, but for a dilettante like me, the mix of Puligny-Montrachet, Russian River Valley Pinot Noirs, and some fun South Africans and New Zealand whites was just perfect. The room, as you can see from the attached photos, is out of this world. Loved the plunge pool, especially. Their website makes it a little confusing, but both ground floor and 2nd floor suites have plunge pools. Having spent 10 days there, and having seen all the property at very close hand, I'd strongly recommend the 2nd floor suite -- more privacy, and you get a 3rd floor private massage palapa! One of the phenomenal things was the turn-down service -- little white candles all throughout the room every night. Gave the suite a magical, very romantic feeling. Let's see... what else was amazing? On on next-to-last day, we woke up a little sick (from sun, running around, and probably just being in a foreign country). Maroma's response? A doctor in our suite within 60 minutes along with the property manager!! He prescribed a few antiobiotics and we both felt well enough the rest of the day and even OK on the flight home. Ummm... try getting that experience anywhere else on the planet. And, oh, yes, the entire staff memorizes your first name within your fist day of being there. Gives it such a welcome, homey, feeling. I know, if you're a Manhattanite it probably sounds creepy, but trust me, it really isn't and it makes your experience warm and friendly. Actually, I'm remembering a whole bunch of stuff now, but I'd really rather you just go and experience Maroma for yourself.

The Maroma, at least as experienced from the \"older side\", isn\u2019t what I would call a five-star resort like Las Ventanas al Paraiso, but it does have a charm all of its own nevertheless. So here are the details - good and bad: Location: Located in a jungle facing a pristine white beach, this secluded \u201cboutique\u201d hotel offers access to much more than just beach and sun. It is close to the entertainment action of the closest town of Playa Del Carmen, or the larger Cancun. You are also close to the archeological sites of Tulum and Coba (where you can see Nohoch Mul \u2013 the tallest pyramid in the Maya World), the grandiose parks of Xel-Ha and Xcaret, the Sian Ka\u2019an Biosphere Reserve and the thirty cenotes (sink holes filled with underground fresh water). You can also visit the new luxury communities of Puerto Aventura, known for its marina, Mayakoba, for its luxury resorts located among gold courses and fresh water canals, or the community of Akumal. Even on a cold rainy day, there is plenty to do around here. Accommodations: The small room we stayed in was facing the beach and had a decent balcony. It was located in the oldest section of the complex on the third floor above the restaurant. The rustic looking room offered no TV (unlike the newer luxurious casitas), but had a small stereo system. There isn't any Wi-Fi connection in the room, but you can access the Internet from their community room located near the entrance. The older building tends to suffer from some plumbing problems such as clogged drains, and the bathroom decor could use a remodeling. The tile bathtubs might look quaint, but aren\u2019t comfortable and are hard to clean. I wonder how many times the staff really scrub those tubs. Service: The staff is very pleasant and courteous. They are always ready to help. The rooms could be cleaned better. The hotel employs a staff of beach cleaners in charge of always combing the sand to keep it pristine from seaweed and other debris that might wash up from the sea. Another team spends the sunset lighting up hundred of candles to illuminate the complex, transforming the resort into a magical place. They do have electricity, but the candles offer so much romantic ambiance... Beach: Great white beach with brilliant turquoise water. You will notice that the beach isn\u2019t as clean when you leave the boundary of the resort, (that is because the public beaches don\u2019t have the Maroma\u2019s cleaning crews). Food: Great. We liked the local cuisine at both restaurants. The food isn\u2019t cheap though. If you want more variety, you can drive to nearby Playa Del Carmen or at any other luxury resorts close by.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort on a beautiful beach\u201d", "Author": "B&TLondon", "ReviewID": "UR7570957", "Content": "The hotel is very secluded and intimate in comparison to most on Riviera Maya/Cancun.

My friends and I spent the first half of our vacation at Paraiso de la Bonita and the second half at Maroma, and I would definitely recommend Maroma over Paraiso for several reasons, that I will describe below. Accomodation: We stayed in the large bedroom in the main house, directly over the bar. Our balcony looked out over the restaurant to the beach. I think the rooms in the main house are the most romantic. There was a mosquito netting over the bed and a hammock on the balcony. As there were 3 of us we got an extra twin bed for the room which worked fine. I loved staying at the main house, it was so easy to get down to the beach, bar, and restaurant, and we had an unbelievable view of the beach. I really liked the morning coffee and juice delivered to our door, as well as the candles on every step leading up to our room at night. The only downsides were that our balcony was not very private, as everyone at the restaurant could see us. Also, the bathroom and shower were not quite as nice as I would expect for over $800 a night. All in all, though, it was a beautiful and romantic room and I'm glad we got it. Beach: Truly one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, and I've travelled all over the US, Bermuda, Carribean, and Mexico. The sand is powdery white and the sea is turquoise, with gorgeous surf crashing all day long. How it can be so different from the lagoon-like no-wave seaweedy conditions at Paraiso, less than an hour away, is puzzling to me. On the beach there are the most comfortable beds that you can lounge on all day. The staff are so helpful and would immediately arrange the beds for us, provide as much shade and towels as we needed. Beach service of drinks was wonderful. Grounds: Immaculately kept, tropical, with all sorts of little winding paths to explore. Paths were lit up at night from lights set into the paving, giving a very romantic effect. The two resident parrots were also fun, although one tried to eat my ponytail holder when he sat on my shoulder! There are a couple of pools, one shady and the other sunny, both nice for a quick dip. Pools were stocked with towels and very comfortable lounge chairs. Spa: Fantastic. My friends and I all did several treatments, manicures, and pedicures. They really cater to the ladies as the male spa staff all look like 20 year old models. This was slightly embarrassing when I did the \"water massage\" and had this ridiculously hot, buff guy moving me around the water for 30 minutes...but I got over it ;) Food/Drinks/Entertainment: We enjoyed the breakfast out on the patio every day. Fresh fruit was delicious, and the menu had all of the standard offerings. Lunch and dinner were uniformly delicious. We ate one night at the more expensive restaurant which was a real treat. Really enjoyed the wine and cocktails as well! The bar had great low-key live music often...usually one or more guys with a guitar singing traditional folk songs. It was a perfect end to the day to unwind in the bar after dinner listening to live music. Activities: The resort can arrange a variety of activities and private transportation, although at a high cost. We took a trip to see Tulum and got a private tour for the three of us, which was nice given that there were hundreds of people there. Our guide made sure we had cool drinks and towels afterwards, which was a treat after walking around all morning in the sun. I also took a trip to swim with the dolphins and manatees at the nearby marine center, which was great. The only downsides to my trip were that it was quite expensive, and I think the resort is more suited to couples than singles (I kept wishing I was there with a boyfriend or husband instead of with the girls) but overall I found it amazing. It would make a really wonderful honeymoon destination.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cEat your heart out, Peter Island!\u201d", "Author": "eastsiders", "ReviewID": "UR7254731", "Content": "This is the best beach resort we've ever stayed at, including Peter Island, Little Palm and Caneel Bay. The others are lovely, and Caneel Bay and Peter Island have beaches just as nice (maybe a little nicer for their smaller size and isolation), but what distinguishes Maroma is the exceptional level of service -- they really lived up to the \"mi casa, su casa\" cliche we were given during our arrival tour. There's a warmth and friendliness about the place and the entire staff that is surprisingly calming. There's not that much to do besides lying on a beach mattress, swimming in the sea or pool, snorkeling, taking out a cat, or taking a yoga class or massage. Some might find the low key quietude a little soporific, but if you're looking for a place to simply unwind and relax, Maroma is for you. They are extremely responsive to special requests, such as very early morning room service (5:30 am) so we could get an early start on our drive to Chichen Itza and beat the crowds (which we did -- we were finished by around 11:30, shortly after the tour buses arrived by the dozens). All this is not to short-change the rooms, which are absolutely perfect without the splashy condo-glitz of most big resorts. And it's a pleasure to stroll around the lush grounds -- the walk to the restaurant is a pleasure, especially as you pass the macaws or the peacock strolls by. And the spa is wonderful and well-run -- try the couples lomi-lomi massage. On one point, however, I have to disagree with one of the previous reviewers: don't bother with Playa del Carmen. We went there one night for dinner, and it's a nightmare -- a mile-long pedestrian mall lined with touristy restaurants and souvenir shops. We've gone to a lot of high-end places over the past 10 years, from the Caribbean to the Gritti, and we've always resisted re-visiting any of them because there's always a different great place we want to see.

It surpassed all expectations of what I imagined the Mayan Riviera could be and definitely caters to those \"in the know\" as there are no big signs on the highway, etc. Our room wasn't ready on arrival, but we wandered over to the spa in the meantime, which made us feel as though we'd stepped into an ancient healing temple of peace and tranquility.

We were a large family group (11) of 3 generations from both sides of the Atlantic, all very seasoned travelers. Every one of us adored the Maroma. The staff were totally adorable and unbelievably helpful. My mother had a fall and sprained her ankle. Immediately several staff carried her to her room,called an English speaking doctor,ordered a wheelchair, and were always available to help up the stairs. My brother organised a birthday dinner on the beach. The hotel made a candle lit runway to the table and organised a mariachi band. It was magical. The beach is just amazing,huge with white sand.There are proper loungers,huge double beds with bolsters and thatched umbrellas.The service was immaculate: food and drinks arrived almost before you realised you wanted them. We even had our breakfast on the beach-complete with flowers and table cloth.Breakfast is utterly amazing-enormous,delicious and made individually.Freddy's Bar is great and laid back-yummy cocktails.

The hotel and grounds are absolutely divine. From the beach you can see how harmonious the design is,with whitewashed buildings and thatched roofs.Also the spa is stunning and very Zen. Playa del Carmen is lots of fun at night,with some seriously cool and lively restaurants and bars.

When we arrived at Cancun airport nobody was there to take us to the hotel (which I had arranged beforehand). I had to phone the hotel to get them them to send a driver who did not arrive for 20 minutes. When he finally did arrive there was no apology. The room did not have a TV, DVD player or an extra bed, all of which had been requested and confirmed both at time of booking and a few days prior to arrival. Housekeeping delivered a TV and DVD player to the room but the TV did not have a remote (which made it almost impossible to operate). House keeping could not find a remote so in the end had to change the TV. The extra bed did not arrive for a few hours and when it did housekeeping brought in two mattresses on top of one another (because they had a problem finding a bed). The top mattress was dressed in just a single sheet. It was unusually cold for Riviera Maya in November. I requested a duvet and was delivered a blanket. Eventually we got a duvet. There was no key to the minibar which was unfortunate as my son judges hotels by the standard of the mini bar. We had to get the key delivered as well. I think most of the first night was spent trying to get the room sorted. During that first night a foul smell of sewage wafted in from the bathroom. The intensity of the smell increased to such an extent that we both got into the double bed, sprayed the sheets with after shave and hid under the duvet. The next morning the hotel assured me that the problem could be resolved by clearing a pipe in the bathroom but it would mean some disruption and a little time. We went to get some lunch. On our return there were a number of maintenance men in the bathroom pumping sewage out of the toilet, and both of the showers. There was a fair amount of what I can only describe as well, er.... poo all over the bathroom floor. The smell was pretty bad - on par with the worst public toilet in Scotland I would say. At one one stage the workmen locked us out of the bathroom for about an hour for fear of what we might have to endure. At that stage the hotel became affectionately known to us as \"Aroma\" We were moved to room 65 only after I insisted. This room was of the same category as the \"poo\" room but on the ground floor (which we preffered because of the beach access). Superb room with a gym, massage palapa, private pool, amazing beach view etc. They are expensive but worth it. You really can get comfortable in them. For the last 2 nights we downgraded to a standard sea view room because room 65 was booked. This was entireley my fault as I had only comitted to 3 nights. The standard room was awful. Dark, noisy (you could hear the staff a lot of the time), no seperate shower and it looked like it should have been decorated 20 years ago. There was no privacy there and the terrace was almost in the bar area. I was not happy there at all. I cannot believe the rack rate on that room is $790 plus taxes and other charges - that is serious money. (we paid less than that but it would would not be fair to the hotel to disclose the price). On the last night the remote control to our TV mysteriously disappeared after housekeeping had made up the room. Other observations are as follows; All the staff were very friendly, tried to help and meant well at all times. After I made a fuss about being charged for the poo night the hotel gave me another bill with the charge deleted. The weather was not good fot the first few days so I accept that may have clouded (pun intended) my view. Maroma has a beautiful beach. I recommend the hotel invests in some remote controls. The food was good but I dont like french fries which taste like cardboard. Aesthetically the whole place looks like it was built on the cheap. The finishings are nasty. It feels cold and empty and there needs to be more flowers/ plants.

Since this was a \"just because\" trip, we didn't splurge for an ocean view room. However, our garden view room, Maroma's lowest category, could have easily been a top-tier room if the resort wasn't located oceanfront. The view of the pool area was great and the grounds are very lush. I think our room was located near the housekeeping department. Hense, our only complaint was the noice from the housekeeping carts that seemed to opperate very early to very late. The resort is top-notch. The beach (and especially the beach beds) is one of the best we've experienced. Manuel took great care of us on the beach and knew our names by the second day we were there. Maroma also has a great library. I forgot a book to read, but had no trouble finding a book in their lirbray. They also have two TV rooms (great for catching sports highlights), and a public use computer with Internet...great touches we didn't expect. The Kinan Spa is also very nice. We has messages there and were one of the best. However, check you bill. We were double charged and they also charged us for a $10 price increase that was not posted anywhere. The extra charges were prompty taken off--no problems. At Maroma, you don't sign for anything (drinks, food, etc.). They just ask for your room number. Therefore, it's a little difficult to keep tabs on your spending and make sure it's correct at checkout. However, the final bill was in the ballpark, so I had to guess it was correct. Maroma's food and drinks are outstanding. Be carefull....the Maroma Margarita can be addictive! The service at Maroma is excellent. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. Upon our return, I e-mailed the resort to see if I could get the recipe for their Maroma Margarita. Within a day, I have a very nice e-mail with their \"secret recipe.\" However, the letter stated that their margaritas are never as good without the white sand beach and the sound of the ocean. Even though I've jsut about mastered their margarita, they are right....never as good without the Maroma setting. You can't go wrong with Maroma. We are well traveled in the Caribbean and Mexico. We're very picky and it's hard to earn 5-stars with us. But Maroma is one of the best if not the best.

To our pleasant surprise, the hospitality girls welcomed us with delicious margaritas and a wonderful room upgrade to a fabulous oceanfront master suite. The view from our suite was heavenly and to call it a paradise would be an understatement. It was more than what we could have asked for. I was certainly looking forward to the real Mexican Cuisine and was very delighted to have tried the Chilaquiles and Shrimp Ceviche. Infact, I had both dishes almost everyday because they were both scrumptious. Most of the meals we ordered were not on their menu so we were not deterred that their fine dining was closed for renovation. They made sure our dinner was prepared the way we wanted it. To top it all, my husband was very impressed with his dinner selections despite being a finicky eater. The beach at Maroma was the best one we have ever seen \u2013 talcum white sand, turquoise water and almost still like a pool. We certainly enjoyed our morning strolls along the shore and were always fascinated by the powder soft sand and magnificent scenery of the jungle, other neighboring resorts and people basking under the sun. The reason why our experience at Maroma Resort was superb in many ways is because the staff was very accommodating and the friendliest people on earth. Their hospitality is parallel to none.

We spent the first few days at a condo in Playa Del Carmen, and weren't sure that Maroma would be worth the money...but it was! The beach and property as others have mentioned, are beautiful and secluded. The water is warm (of course) and calm.It did seem that there was some construction going on at one end of the resort, just south of the restaurant, but we didn't hear any construction noises and barely noticed anything going on there. One of the restaurants was closed due to renoavations still being made after last year's hurricane, but we did not actually see any work being done while we were there. They did mention the restaurant closure in the letters they left on our bed every night during the turn-down service. We thought the service was amazing! While we sat on the beach, lazy and hot, servers checked on us frequently to see if we needed drinks, food, or simply ice for our water. As soon as someone saw me getting towels from the large basket at the entrance to the beach, they rushed to stop me and carried them to our beach \"bed\" for me. And my husband and I were always greeted by name, and given a complimentary Spanish lesson during our meals! We ate breakfast and two dinners at the main restaurant. Breakfast was included, and was delicous and filling. Fresh fruit and amazing pastries were followed by either Mexican or American-style breakfasts. The dinners were amazing, much to my surprise. I didn't expect much, and was happy to learn that the food was as good as any top-notch restaurant where we live in San Francisco, a city noted for it's food-snobbery! We didn't try the other on-site restaurant, Cilantro, which featured a healthier, \"Spa\" menu. And the prices weren't outrageous, which I think surprised me even more. We had room service a couple of times are were very happy with it. The first time we ordered, it did take a little while. It was, however, Friday night, and I imagine it was very busy. The second time, it arrived very quickly. Coffee was always waiting outside of our door when we woke up, around 7:00 am. The turndown service was especially nice. The bathrooms were cleaned up a bit, and candles were lit. My husband especially enjoyed the chocolate left on the bed, and took to rationing them out so he could enjoy some when we got home. There was always a letter waiting for us on the bed with suggestions on what we might like to do or confirming any activities that we had arranged. We loved our room! We had an oceanview room, right above the bar, and had a large balcony with an amazing view. The bed was delicious and comfortable, and I slept deeply every night. I loved the plush rugs on either side of the bed, too. The bathrooms were nothing special, and the shower drain was slow to drain. The Mouton Brown bath products, however, more than made up for this. There weren't a lot of activities to do at Maroma, as others have mentioned, which was fine with us, as we mostly wanted to relax. My husband did go on a snorkeling trip, which he enjoyed very much, and we took a sail on the Hobie catamaran, which was included in our package. One guest we talked to had arranged to be taken on diving trips, and he seemed to enjoy it very much. I did have a great massge there. They have a beautiful facility, with a lovely relaxation room, and two \"wet rooms\" (one each for men and women), with a large shower, sauna and steam rooms, and a small plunge pool. I had a mud massage, which was very relaxing. The massage room was huge, with it's own very large shower. We also did the Temezcal treatment (part of our package), which is basically spending 40 minutes in a dark sweat lodge. After an initial period of claustrophobia-induced panic, it was actually very nice! And the evening ocean swim that followed it was wonderful. Check-out was pretty painless. We weren't too surprised by our charges. Gratuity or service charges are applied each time you order anything (yes, this applies to things like bottled water), so you are never actually tipping at the time of service. Given this, our check-out bill was pretty much what we expected.

We wanted something special and decide to visit Maroma after it was chosen 'most romantic' by The Travel Channel. Simply put, we had a wonderful time. We have never felt more welcome at a resort hotel. We were welcomed by the hospitality staff with cool, moist towels and margaritas. We were first taken on a brief tour of the resort. The grounds are splendid and if there was any hurricane (Wilma) damage, we could not tell. We originally booked a gardenview room. To our pleasant surprise we were shown to an oceanfront room with a balcony and a beautiful view of the sea ( #24). We were told we had been given the room simply because it was available. What service! The room has cool tile floors and a beautiful, comfortable bed. The tiled tub has plenty of room for two! The balcony has a terrific view of the beach and ocean. We are early risers and found fresh coffee outside our door each morning. After our early morning 'power walk' along the beach, we had breakfast on the elegant stone patio right on the beach. We were usually alone and enjoyed the fresh juices, sweet rolls and omelettes. We spent most of the day on Maroma's great beach, reading, relaxing. The staff is attentive and friendly. I tried to speak what little Spanish I know, and the staff helped coax me along. Almost every staff member remembered our names. Maroma is secluded and quiet, with not a lot of activities on site. However, I see this as an advantage. Many activities can be arranged through hospitality or pursued on your own. For example, we enjoyed jet skiing at the Maroma Marina , a 5 minute drive away. You can then return to the quiet seclusion of Maroma. If you desire lots of people, packed beaches, and noise, hit the Venta Club down the beach. The activity packages are expensive. We drove ourselves to the ruins of Coba and Tulum one day saving money. After a hard day on the uncrowded beach, we spent the early evening with chips, salsa and drinks again on the stone beach patio . We met some other nice couples and had some lively conversations. Most evenings we drove to Playa del Carmen (15 min.) for dinner and a stroll down the pedestrian avenue. We had an excellent dinner one evening at Maroma and enjoyed it very much while being serenaded. Evenings at Maroma feel special as you stroll the grounds and hotel along the candle lit paths and stairways. We ended our evenings enjoying the quiet darkness of our balcony with only the sounds of the ocean and the feel of the sea breeze. Yes, Maroma is expensive, but worth it. You pay for the seclusion, and an outstanding staff that will make you feel very special. We would definitely visit Maroma again. One big word of caution about the Cancun airport.

Breakfasts were amazing and the staff would make anything you wanted, but the menu included just about anything you could possibly want including chocolate croissants which were made on the premises by the pastry chef. We ate lunch on the beach and in the two other restaurants-- even the spa menu is delicious. Dinners were also great and started with drinks and different hors d'oeures made by the chef each night. All this was topped off by the most delicious handmade chocolate wrapped in tissue left on your bed at night. The Spa is also beautiful and there are three beautiful pools for swimming that are never crowded. The work out room is only temporary, but it is very nice and in a good location. But you will spend most of your time on the king size beds on the beach which are so comfortable and accompanied by an umbrella and all the towels you need as well as constant beach service which becomes addictive.

Like others, I was a bit concerned about some of the negative comments on the site (about the rooms, the service and the construction) but ultimately found that none of the criticisms (some of which were valid) detracted from our stay. Grounds and rooms: The hotel and grounds were beautiful and romantic, especially at night. The resort felt very isolated and removed from the real world. It was apparently fully booked, yet it felt completely uncrowded (always plenty of room in restaurants, on the beach, at the spa, etc). We felt relaxed immediately after arriving and left the resort only once during our stay. We had a junior suite, with an indoor/outdoor living room (really indoor, despite how it was advertised, but with large windows that could be opened to make it feel open to the outdoors) and a private sundeck that looked out onto the deserted beach on the northern end of the property (only downside to this view, which faces away from the rest of the resort, is the large-scale construction going on at a different property a few miles down the beach, but it is far enough away that it never bothered us). The room was large, comfortable and relatively simple, but with a number of beautiful touches (cozy throw rugs with slippers on each side of the bed, a variety of candles lit during each turndown, etc.). I probably wouldn't pick a junior suite again, only because it was an expensive option and we ultimately didn't spend a ton of time in the room. After seeing some of the less expensive rooms, we would have been equally content in any of them (we did not see the rooms in the newer section, however). As for the ongoing on-site construction, it was limited to the newer section of the hotel (near the spa and the neighboring Venta Club), and we could not hear any of it from our room or the common areas of the older part of the hotel (though my wife did hear some construction noise during her one outdoor massage in the spa). The beach: The beach is unbelievably beautiful, one of the nicest I've been to, with clear blue-green water and those incredibly decadent beach beds. We spent the majority of our stay camped out on the beach beds and that alone made the trip worthwhile. The beach attendants were very good about moving our umbrella to shade us, bringing us new towels, etc. Also really loved the way they'd bring around complimentary dishes of ice cream or sorbet in late morning, just when the sun was starting to get strong. The spa: Also really enjoyed the spa. We've been lucky enough to visit some incredible spas in the past and can be somewhat critical of the quality of treatments in some more out-of-the-way resorts, but my wife and I were very happy with the range of treatments (mostly massages) we received here. One new twist for me: before each massage, the masseuse washes and dries your feet in a large basin (probably to remove sand from all the barefooted vacationers but a very relaxing way to start the treatment). The spa itself is beautiful and open-aired, and felt very in tune with the its surroundings. It is not 100% operational, though, a fact that was not clearly communicated to us until our last day. For example, the spa has sauna and steam rooms, with plunge pools, but they were not up and running (though the very friendly spa manager showed them to us) due to some electricity restrictions resulting from some nearby construction. Contrary to some earlier reviews, the spa does have his and her relaxation rooms as well, though we not told about this option until after we had finished our last treatments of the stay (I don't think the locker rooms were open yet either, though it hardly mattered when you're ambling from your room to the spa and back again). Bottom line is that the spa was very,very nice and will be outstanding once all facilities are open. Food: El Sol, the fine dining room, was not yet open, though they served its dinner menu at the spa restaurant (really just outdoor tables grouped around one of the pools). We ate most of our meals at the more casual beachfront restaurant or on our beach bed. The more casual food was generally very good (excellent Mexican staples like guacamole and quesadillas), pretty reasonably-priced, and there was a wide enough selection that we didn't feel restricted in our options after eating there several times. The included breakfasts were very good as well. The fine dining menu was a little underwhelming. It was fine, but a little overpriced for the quality of the food. The menu was ambitious and decidedly non-Mexican but the preparation couldn't quite keep up (for example, I ordered venison and was emphatically informed that the chef recommended it medium, but it arrived overcooked). All in all, the food was always adequate to very good, but I can't say the food is the reason to stay here. Service: Ah, the service, one of the most divisive issues on this site. I would describe the service as well-intentioned, generally good but inconsistent. The staff was incredibly friendly and very accomodating. They bent over backwards to try to please, but over our stay, we noticed that the quality of the service could be erratic. One day on the beach, we practically had to stand on our beach bed and wave down the one waitress to get her to come take a drink order; most other days, we were practically catered to, with a waitress stopping by every 15-20 minutes or so to check up on us. Similarly, in the restaurants, most meals were extremely smooth, while at some we had slow service, missed drink orders, etc. It didn't bother us, since we were too relaxed to care, but I could see where these occasional lapses in service would really irk people paying these types of prices for a resort. More problematic were some miscommunications in the Hospitality/Activity office. It was not uncommon to get two different answers to the same question. One person told us we needed reservations for the fine dining restaurant, but we were told no reservations were taken when we called the restaurant itself. My visibly pregnant wife booked our snorkel trip with the activity desk, but shortly before our trip, the dive shop took one look at her and said they couldn't take her out, for liability reasons. When we separately tried to get a better understanding of what the off-site excursion included in our package entailed (to see if my wife could handle the level of activity), we each had a different trip described to us (though, to be fair, they tracked us down on the beach to apologize for the confusion and to offer to tailor the excursion to accomodate what we wanted to see and what my pregnant wife could handle). If you pointed out any problem to them, they were extremely apologetic and tried to make it up to you, and it was clear that they wanted feedback on ways to improve the service. But at the end of the day, you will be disappointed if you expect the seamless service you get at some resorts, like Four Seasons properties. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and definitely plan to return one day. Sure, there is some room for improvement here and there, but the management appears aware of this and seems to be trying to address any issues that arise. It is a very romantic and relaxing property, and it will be even more incredible once the current construction is complete.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cOld world Mexican elegance\u201d", "Author": "FannyPeabody", "ReviewID": "UR5004795", "Content": "We had heard of the Maroma after travelling to La Casa Que Canta, the #1 small boutique hotel in \"Z wat\" and decided to go and see what everyone was so pleased about.

The beach front is impecable with beach beds for snoozing and great lunch service or cocktaill service. They are not out of control expensive for lunch and the assortment is wonderful from Lobster salad to great nachos. In general the food is well above average to very very good...I would not spend to much time there for dinner, venture out to Playa, or Morrellas up north. The spa is amazing, and very well worth the $$, there are a couple of tennis courts and the diving is great I heard. You never have to leave if you want or you can head out for day trips to Tulum beach (amazing) lots of rustic eco lodges, or north to Port Morrellas. Rent a car, it's inexpensive and the fun of exploring the coastal towns is real, we stumbled on Tulum beach and it was gorgeous (7-20 miles of desolate beach front) Drivng is easy and affords flexibility and avoids heavy taxi fares. Get an old beater rental car, it'll remind you of when you never had any money and how much fun it is to wing it again... We have travelled extensively at the higher end, and all over the map from Cortina,Rome, Santorini, Saint Tropez, etc, Maroma is a place to be spoiled yet in a mellow and discerning way. If you travel a lot, you know what I mean. if you want more rustic, more eco friendly and less expensive go to any number of great places on Tulum beach, They are cheap, very very mellow, and more on the hippy camping tour, but also very cool. I think the perfect package would be to go to Tulum for 3-5 days, melt away the stress, and then spend another 4 at Maroma being pampered. Wife/girlfriend/partner will love you!!! Oh yeah no kids and lots of fun couples, not too stuffy...", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago, Chile", "Title": "\u201cHonestly and truly...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4997999", "Content": "..a great resort.

The restaurants and food are excellent. The only thing I might say is that it's a bit pricey. For US$650/night (after tax and service charges), the room was quite small (we stayed in a premium room) and nothing special. Also US$10 for a 1l bottle of water is also pushing it a little.

When we were there, one of the people from Hospitality came over and had us fill our our paperwork -- I noticed on the paperwork they had the room type listed as \"GDN\". I immediately asked if that meant a Garden Room and was informed that it did. I provided the girl with a copy of our itinerary, clearly marked that we were honeymooners and had reserved an Oceanview room. She went to talk to the manager, came back and told us that there weren't any Oceanview rooms available. (We had already paid for the trip, as we made our reservations through a travel agency.) We asked her what alternative they were offering us, since they weren't providing us with the room we had paid for. She left and then sent the reservations manager, Julio, to speak with us. Julio told us that \"we are still recovering from a devestating hurricane and were going to call you and ask you if we could move you to another resort BUT WE DIDN'T\" (emphasis is mine). Umm....You didn't call, and now can't accomodate my room preference? Not exactly the service one expects from a $500+/night facility. We eventually ended up with a Garden room for two nights, then a Junior Suite for the last three nights. The Garden room had a lightbulb with exposed wiring hanging in the shower and the room was extremely small. The shower in the Jr. Suite smelled like sewage, as did several other locations on the property. There were loud parties outside the Jr. Suite each night that we stayed there. The Spa has no locker room, no sauna, no steam room, no hot tub....Pretty much only treatment rooms. Unfortunately, this hotel seems to have opened way before it was ready to and this sentiment was echoed to us by other employees and other guests. The one shining star was our \"romantic dinner\" which was included with the romance package -- because the hotel wasn't completely opened, and therefore wasn't full, the Chef and my new husband sat down and made a menu just for us -- four courses, with wine. It was absolutely fantastic! And, it was served in a private room, in the tower above the dining room -- perfect. Fortunately, that was our last night there, so at least we ended on a high note.

Plus, we met lots of entertaining couples, most of whom were on their honeymoon (we were not). The only possible criticism I could have is that the decor in the rooms was silly - bad Mexico terracotta and tile, unfitting to a place of this caliber (the lamps had badly-painted sunflowers on them).

Maroma started out as a private estate and the architectural details are stunning. Many years ago it opened to the public as a first rate small resort, with the owner stolling the property attending to details. Now it is part of a chain. The rooms are sufficiently nice, though our tub did not drain well, and the amenities are the same as a Best Western. The real problems are the wild prices being paid for mediocre services and food. Our expensive dinners were very average fare. The waitstaff was oblivious to people needing water, or people pooring their own $80 bottles of wine. The rolls were from the local Sam's club or some such place. My 5 piece shrimp beach lunch (nothing else!) was $18.00 with services. Every morning we had a standing request for coffee at 7:00 am, in room, and daily by 7:20 we had to call requesting our coffee and then it showed up. Is this a $600 night property? But perhaps the most offensive insult was the construction that was happening behind our room. When I booked the room through the parent company, Orient Express, they promised me the hotel was \"built out\" and there would be no construction. It's too bad they are so ill informed about their own properties. The drilling was so bad, we could not rest in our room during the day. What is great about this place is the surroundings, which nature bestowed upon this bay with generosity. The Italian club next door brings less privacy to Maromas area, but that's about it....more bodies, less exclusivity. The candle lit paths are enchanting, as is the turn down servivce. And in general, the Maya people are delightful.

It gave us proper perspective. I agree with all the comments about the service and meals. If you are looking to save a little money on dinner, I suggest room service (which is faster service than the dining room). We stayed in a beach front room in the new section and it was perfect. On that side, you have the spa, brand new gym, bar/lunch/breakfast area and new pool. Some of the past posts on this board spoke about the noisy Venta club near the new section. We did not hear any noise in the evening. We actually found the daytime view entertaining watching our native Italian friends truly enjoy the beach experience. The beach was perfect and the bed/chairs/loungers on the beach were first class. I will warn you that you will get sun even when sitting under the cloth umbrella. Best time to get sun is from 9-11:00 am and after 3:00 PM. Take small doses if you do not have a base. The snorkel trip was fun but not a lot to see. Make sure it is sunny when you go, as it will help see what fish are present. Most of the cool fish hide in the coral. The Catamaran trip was fun but expensive, we went around 5:00 PM. The Captain is very friendly and talkative. We wanted to take the Dolphin Discovery trip but my wife was pregnant and they said they would not allow her in the water because it somehow distracts the dolphins. The trip to/from the airport was great, traveling in a new Ford Expeditition. My wife was a little freaked out driving in to Maroma at night because it feels like they are taking you into the jungle to leave you there. We will return some day in the future and book an oceanfront or junior suite. The high-speed Internet connection worked just fine. Also, they have huge towels all over on the beach and pool and you just leave them when you are done. We had passports to travel but it was not required. However, I suggest you check out the gov web site because as of Dec 2005 there are some changes. Better safe than sorry, easier with a passport. When you get dropped off at the airport to leave, expect a long line at the check in. There is a chance they will check your bags for customs, depends on if a table is open when you approach the line. If you are looking for room rates better than rack rates on the Maroma web site, check travel web sites. I booked my trip through Andrew Harpers Q Club. It cost about 130 bucks to join but there is a significant room discount and free room upgrade based on availability.

We had a premium room (#10) which was in a wonderful location in the older part and a very short distance from the beach. The room was very clean and comfortable. With the netting and flowers, the bed was very romantic. That said, the bed wasn't all that comfortable by U.S. standards but was typical of my other experiences in Mexico...a good quality mattress that was set on a platform without box springs. The room had a lot of \"character\" and looked out onto a gorgeous garden. It did not have a television, which we knew up front....I'm at a loss for why anyone would need a tv on vacation in paradise anyway. The best part of the room was the terrace which had a wonderful breeze, comfortable hammock, and beautiful view. The restaurant was very good, and breakfast was fantastic! Food was a bit pricey but on-par for what you'd typically expect at a resort location whether in Cozumel or New York. It definitely did NOT give me sticker shock, but it was not cheap either. The staff was very friendly, and their English was very good overall. There were a lot of little quirks that we considered a bit endearing. I guess the more tightly-wound amongst us might consider it annoying, but we found it a bit amusing. For example, we ordered a wake-up call one day (for an excursion) and it got repeated a 2nd day. We had to call to ask them NOT to wake us up again at 6a.m. Or at a meal the server may forget a knife or fork, etc. One day one of our glasses disappeared from the room and wasn't replaced for 2 days...things like that. With the little quirks, we also had nice surprises...the cocktail reception for all guests to meet each other so that we met our neighbors, the cat that visited us on our terrace, the peacock showing off for it's mate, soft soft sand, and of course Tom Cruise vacationing there too. We also met our \"neighbors\" and were able to say hello on the beach, at meals, etc. and that made the resort seem that much more friendly. The one thing we wouldn't do again is book a package. We chose the Romance package, which was a bit over-rated. The champagne did not arrive, the sunset cruise wasn't really an option, and the Tezmacal is definitely NOT for everyone - particularly the claustraphobic!

If you want a perfectly paved road leading to a mega resort with 100's of rooms and 1000's of people, go to Cancun; if you want a unique experience in a beautiful place with an outstanding staff that knows who you are, I doubt that Maroma can be matched in the Yucatan. Our room had a great balcony complete with hammock, thatch roof, and an ocean view partially obscured by palms (which is exactly what was described at time of booking) great tile shower, mosquito netting, and great small details. Coffee waiting on the balcony each morning is great for tempting you out of the cozy bed to get your day going early. The lobby bar was near our front door; great for sticking our head out for dos cervezas o vino. Breakfast is fantastic, but then again, so is lunch and dinner. The soups alone are worth eating there (I think I tried them all). If you can, get the one table on the roof one night; that dinner just sent an already wonderful experience over the top. For active excursions; we'd definitely recommend the Nohoch tour by Alltournatives; which can be booked through Maroma's Hospitality staff. You are picked up early in a 1960's? Mercedes Unimog, which is like a small personnel carrier, and are brought on a long, packed day of kayaking, reef snorkeling, cenote snorkeling in different cenotes, roller-coaster like rides in the Unimog through the jungle, a visit to a Mayan family and a great authentic heavy Mayan lunch. All in one day for $130/person. You be tired and ready for the Maroma pool and bar when you get back, and realize again just how special Maroma is upon return. What can't be described is the feeling of Maroma and it's people---so I won't try. Go.

We have high expectations and many requirements: NO children, a large, white, quiet, beach, grass huts that easily accommodate two people no matter where the sun is, and a top-drawer, full-service spa. We also want a romantic restaurant. Enjoying our breakfast quietly outside, under palm trees to the sound of birds, yet close to our room, is another of our desires. Yet a property high-tech enough to have good internet access, a community room with large screen plasma satellite televison (there is that occasional sporting event), and the same-day New York Times Fax Service and Herald Tribune. We have limited ourselves to resorts that have less than 50 rooms if they are set on less than 5 acres and up to 75 rooms if they are on over 10 acres. We want a resort where you can\u2019t hear cars, buses, or motorcycles on the main highway or have hoards of people walking on the beach.

Every year we try and find a new resort to fulfill our requirements, but always there is something missing. Last summer, by happenstance, we were watching the Travel Channel and were introduced to \u201cMaroma\u201d in Playa Del Maroma, south of Cancun. We just returned and felt compelled to share with others what an absolutely wonderful experience it was. Every requirement and every wish was exceeded. The restaurant is excellent. Beyond the regular restaurant, they have a special room on top of the old hacienda for one couple each night where you can dine by candlelight under the stars while looking out over the lush gardens and the beach. The most romantic setting we have ever experienced anywhere in the world. (Guys beware, if you take her there for dinner, she will expect to be proposed to, and she will say yes.)

Overall, Maroma is a fantastic and unique resort but I agree with some of the other reviews that say that somehow the individual pieces fall short of making this and absolutely *amazing* resort. Billing seems to be an ongoing problem. I booked through Maroma directly and the original rate quote sent via email did not match the hardcopy mailed to my address. I was disappointed in the effort needed to straighten this out, but management did eventually agree to honor the original quote. I had saved the original email quote which was substantially less than the hard copy. We stayed at Maroma the second week in December just before high season and the resort was fairly quiet and empty. Would definitely recommend this \"shoulder\" season. We had our own car and the signs to Maroma could definitely use improvement. There is no sign for Maroma from the main highway, only for the Venta Club. The road into the resort at night is definitely an adventure..very dark and lots of potholes. We thought it was kind of fun, actually. The resort was working on road improvements the week that we were there in preparation for high season. We were met at the front and directed to reception where we immediately received a welcome margarita and were shown around the resort and to our room. My boyfriend is Lantono and speaks Spanish fluently which I believe made an impact on the positive reception we received. The girl that showed us around was very very nice but we did notice that some of the reception girls were a little rude and snotty to other guests. We had booked a garden room and were on the second floor in the Old Section with a tree blocking the view of the ocean. I am not sure if we were upgraded to a better class of room or not but we were very happy as we had expected no view whatsoever. If we climbed the stairs from our patio it went to the top of the resort with some beautiful lookout benches and some fantastic views. There was also a very nice enclosed reading room. Views from the top of the resort were fantastic. Our room was medium size with a queen bed with romantic netting and a gorgeous tile bathroom with a huge bath tub. Definitely more European and boutique hotel style than \"American resort\". People have different preferences which is why I am mentioning this. Very romantic, understated, and elegant. This is not Vegas. Emphasis is on quiet and relaxation. For some reason, I kept thinking of the hamlet at Versaille that Marie Antoinette built to play peasant. At night, candles were lit all over the resort which was absolutely beautiful. The pool in the old section was lovely but with the beach, why bother with the pool. We took advantage of the free included snorkel tour out to the Maroma reef. The coral is not in great shape and we didn't see too many fish but it was fun. I walked around the New Section and I prefer the Old Section. As other people have mentioned, the \"dreadful\" Venta Club is right next to the New Section. Very noisy and lots of people on that section of the beach. The beautiful white sand beach with turqoise water at Maroma was fairly empty and was the highlight of our stay. Breakfast was fantastic every morning. So relaxing to eat with such an amazing view. We had our own car so went into Playa del Carmen every night for dinner since reviews of the restuarant at Maroma were not so good. I think this contributed to our favorable impression over all. We at lunch at the hotel only one day and it was *VERY* expensive. No prices were listed which is always a bad sign so you never know how much you are spending and you never sign for anything. If you stay at Maroma I would definitely recommend having a car to avoid the feeling of being \"trapped\". We were able to arrange our own activities all around the area which was nice.

Among other places we have stayed during that period have been Singita (Boulders Lodge), the Ellerman House in Capetown, the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco, Inn on the Blue Horizon in Viequez, and Hotel Coste in Paris. We went to Maroma for a romantic, relaxing weekend. Our intent was to enter the property and not leave until it was time for our departure from Mexico. We were entirely content with our surroundings. We stayed in room 31 in the older part of the hotel. I cannot comment on the rooms in the newer section, but after having walked the property agree that I would insist on receiving a room in the original complex. Our room was spacious, with a wonderful bathroom that during our stay had no plumbing problems whatsoever. The grounds are gorgeous, and the beach is spectacular. While it is true that much debris washes up on either side of the hotel beach, the hotel has teams of grounds crew out raking the sand every morning to make certain that the beach in front of the hotel is pristine. Overall, the food was very good to sometimes excellent, especially the local specialities. Both the food and wine are pricy, but that is to be expected at any removed, high-end resort property. We received unfailingly gracious, relaxed service. In short, I think we enjoyed our stay so much because we were looking for a remote-feeling getaway. If we had wanted a full-service resort, or service in the style of a Ritz-Carlton, we might not have been as satisfied.

We are 31 years old. This resort has the makings of what could be a great vacation spot, but it just doesn't make it. The grounds were pretty, and lots of parrots, iguanas, and wildlife. If I were to rate only the grounds I would give it a great score, however, all of us know a vacation is made up of many things. BEACH- The beach directly in front of the hotel is beautiful, but Turks and Caicos is preferable, since the water is like pool water and not as rough. If you venture to the left of the hotel, there is a pollution problem and it was sad to see so much plastic washed up on the shore. To the right of the hotel is the DREADFUL Vento Club. The Maroma beach front rooms are located on this side. The Vento Club is a sea of lounge chairs packed so closely, that the topless europeans in their little thongs and speedos simply chose to walk our beach constantly. (I'm not against nudity but these were not supermodels, people) The music blasts for most of the day at the Vento Club and we could hear it from our room and on the beach, so we had to lay out at the other side of the hotel, instead of right in front of our room. The cool thing is that there are futons on the beach that are comfy and like sitting in bed all day. There is beach service, though sometimes extremely slow. ROOMS- Our room was #37, a beach front room. Great ocean view, a walk right onto the beach, but not so nice on the inside, not horrible, either. Our floor tiles had grout coming out, and the room was pretty small. The pillows were hard as rocks and quite lumpy, but we asked for better ones and they brought them. The shower was huge, but very dark. The air conditioner was a wall unit and so damn noisy. There were two main problems, though. The first was that there are only bamboo twigs on the windows, so the sun rose in my face EVERY morning at about 5:45am. I hated that. The second problem was that I could hear the people above me and also across from me, and there was a constant slamming door sound whenever a person came or went. I like to sleep, so I had major problems with this. FOOD- Hmmm. The food was OK. I am from Philadelphia, so I know good food. The people who wrote \"gourmet\" in their reviews really meant to say \"a valiant attempt at gourmet.\" The breakfast and lunch menu was the same each day. Great margaritas. The salsa really is good, but I got sick of it by day three. Dinner had the most fluctuating menu that fails to describe the entrees entirely. I ordered grilled scallops one night and they were wrapped in bacon, which was not mentioned. If you find a bottle of COLD bottled water anywhere on the resort, you are in the know. SERVICE- Here is where I had the most problems. Don't be surprised if three people give you three different answers to the same question. We had to ask for so many things that we shoudn't have needed to ask for. The strangest thing was that we would meet other people at the hotel that had the absolute worst opinions of the hotel, and then there were those that just adored it. I say, don't risk it. SPA- Aesthetically, damn nice. The problem is that if you are used to spas, then it will bother you that there are no hooks to hang your stuff up at the steam or sauna or shower, no lockers, and when I got out of the steam room, the shower had a yucky, universal bar of soap in it and that was all!!

Whilst Maroma benefits from a stunning location and a boutique type environment, a lot of things let it down. When you a paying Aman type prices ($500+ a night) you expect the same service and rooms.

In particular, the plumbing is unreliable, we had a lot of problems with hot water during our stay (as did a number of other guests). In addition, I was very surprised not to find slippers in the rooms, apparently they had \"run out\". As this was peak season, this is not acceptable. THe food, with the exception of breakfast (good and included), is average and expensive. I would say a rental car is essential to go to either Playa del Carmen or Cancun for better food. Service, though excellent by Mexican standards, was still not up to Four Seasons standards, where every member of staff does their utmost to help. The spa, I thought, was rather good. The treatments can be taken on the beach which is blissful and the staff is well trained and efficient. My \"God\" tratment was superb. The weather on our stay was not the best, which ruled out scuba diving during our stay. I had to make some enquiries outside the hotel and finally went diving close to Playa del Carmen for 25% of the cost they were offering!

At the time of booking I was deciding between Ikal Del Mar and Maroma and unfortunately chose Maroma. I wish I would have paid more attention to this review site before booking...Let me first start by saying we are used to travelling around the world in luxury style so I have somtehing to compare this place to. If this is your first time at a supposedly 5 star resort - which Maroma is NOT...! - then you may have a different experience. As a reference point we have been to various hotels in the last year that included Four Seasons in Maui and Le Sireneuse. I have never written a review before but I felt so strongly that in this case I hope people get some use out of this before booking this hotel. First of all, the rooms are absolutely below even a 4 star hotel. The interior looks more like a cheap garage sale which their marketing literature addresses with \"rustic\". There is a big difference in my mind between rustic chic and Maroma which has cheap rooms. The bed while big was hard with rough linens. It was not very comfortable. Our terrace door was broken and our bathtub did not drain (this seems to be a familiar problem from the reviews on this site). The towels were rough, NOT soft at all, and the bathroom mat was a cheap old grayish mat that looked dirty. Oh and our safe was broken and despite multiple complaints remained unfixed. Our room also had a musty smell to it. In case people are wondering what room type it was, it was in the new part - a garden view room with a nice view of the pool and a little terrace. Second, the service was awful. Not at all what you would expect from a supposedly 5 star hotel. The woman who greeted us at the entrance was useless in explaning the property or show us around. She barely knew her way around. Our safe and bathtub remained unfixed despite numerous complaints. The waitress dropped my camera and seemed unconcerned. I asked for 2 beach towels and was met by a condescending answer - I was given 2 but felt it was a favor. The whirlpool is in the middle of the restaurant and was always dirty. We had booked a massage in a palapa and on the day it rained and the weather was cold. We wanted to reschedule but were told this was not possible so we had our massages while we were freezing. No one on the staff even bothered to help us reschedule or seemed they cared. And the hospitality suite was a joke. I could not understand why there were so many people there but no one around to actually offer any type of decent service. Third, the spa. I am not sure if I was the only one fooled but why do they call themselves a Spa if they have not yet opened their actual Spa facilities?? It is under construction and in fact none of the treatment rooms were even open yet. So your only choice is having the treatments in the palapa or in your room which in our case was not great since it was cold outside and our room smelled. I took their yoga class ($25 for an hour of mediocre yoga) and we were outside practicing yoga with hammers and construction noise all around us. That brings me to my last point, the grounds are not completed and there is construction and people everywhere - not to mention a dog that I think belonged to one of the many workers wandering the grounds. We did not feel we were in \"lush tropical grounds\" because of all the cement, trucks and unfinished buildings. I am curious if Maroma is actually advertising itself as having a fully renovated Spa and hotel with fully completed guest rooms because that is far from the truth. For the amount we paid, we wanted more privacy, peace, better service and quiet time... To be fair, there are positive points about the hotel. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the setting is very unique. The breakfast is great, really the best part of the day. We found the restaurant prices to be a little on the high side but not anything that was too far out of norm. Overall, we enjoyed the food. We also made it a point to rent a car and go to Playa Del Carmen (great!) and Tulum (beautiful). My only point of advice is that if you are looking for a true luxury hotel experience, don't go to Maroma. We checked out Ikal Del Mar and we wished we would have booked there instead, it was beautiful and much more romantic. I plan on writing this same letter to our travel agent and to Maroma. I am even thinking of writing to Conde Nast because I genuinely feel Maroma has a lot of people fooled into booking who come away feeling disappointed and ripped off and it is a shame because the hotel setting is so beautiful that they should address some of these concerns.

I agree, these conditions were merely the back drop to incredibly beautiful buildings, inviting palapas, casual hammocks, strong margaritas, candle lit dinners, delightful staff and great food.

If we wanted hip-hop hurray, we could have stayed in New York. Maroma is certainly not service oriented. We would leave the room early in the morning, only to return after dusk with the room still the way we left it- it should not take an entire day for someone to come in and make the bed, at least, not in a hotel with such high rates. Like other guests, we ended up enjoying ourselves most while away from the hotel. And another note- the food was not so great- mediocre. Breakfast was the best, but that was all.

We had a wonderful experience. I had read the reviews and they seemed very mixed. While we stayed I couldn't help but think about everything I had read. So I write this review with total honesty. I am not someone who has stayed in the finest places in the world but I do appriciate nice things and that is why we chose Maroma. First off our service was endlessly amazing the managemen and staff treated us like family, but thats the kind of service we prefer. They even went to far as to find pants for my husband after he complimented the manager on his. Not to say bad service doesn't happen but some want to be treated like royalty. I liked our room, it wasn't luxurious like you would get in a european style hotel, but I liked the style, I felt like I was in Mexico, crazy I know. And yes there is no tv, We knew that before we got there, in all the beauty that surrounded us we forgot TV ever happened. I have read a lot about the food some of it is true. Breakfast is great and included in the price, we really thought breakfast was the best thing going on the menu. I also thought the lunch menu was pretty incredible. Dinner does fall short, the food is expensive, but that should not come as a surprise when a standard room starts at $500 a night. I like to eat out, but three meals a day for seven days starts to make me sick. So we tried to simplify a bit we had some lovely lunches while sitting on the beach, those prices are far more reasonable and the food is very good. We ordered food in our room and shared grilled lobster once in the restaurant. It would be nice If Maroma would add another place to eat in the evening that has more casual fare, gourmet food every night is hard to eat. I saw someone who was offended by the no children policy, there are lots of nice places that allow children, but not so many that don't. Maroma is not great for children, it is a place for total peace and relaxation, we couldn't help but notice how quiet it was. We were often the only people in the pool. Kids need a place to be free to get crazy, this is not that place. As for the children spotting, there is another hotel down the beach and even further down we saw a dog sleeping on the beach and a place were it looked like local people were living, so maybe they are coming from someplace else. The beach is private but there is an Italian resort next door to the new side of Maroma, if it wasn't there your room at Maroma would probably be triple the price. Try and get a room on the opposite side. I believe luxury comes in different forms. Maroma offers luxury in a unpretentious way with its beautiful private beaches, lush landscape, quiet breezes and personable service.

I was in one of the new rooms, but there was no place to sit in the room to read, except the hard cement bench with pillows, not very condusive to comfort. There was a TV cabinet, but no television????? The food was very, very average. The decor was that of perhaps the Guadalajara area, certainly not of the Mayan Riviera. There were children and dogs at the resort. While sitting on my patio, I observed one of the dogs lift his leg on one of the chaise lounges at the pool.

There were about 7 or 8 employees \"milling\" around with unbrellas and none came to help us into the lobby with an umbrella, none. When we advised the night manager, he told us that we had an umbrella in our room, but we were not in our room, we had just come back from dinner and were there in the lobby.

Our driver for the day was a true gentleman and allowed us to enjoy a wonderful tour of Coba, Tulum and some cenotes - we even briefly stopped off to look at crocodiles! We also enjoyed the food on the other days as well. We could make do with just one portion, as they were always very generous. The friendly waiters always gave us an aperitif (we never knew what to expect, but it was great fun trying to guess what they eventually served up) and also offered delicious salsa with freshly baked tortilla chips before our meals (both lunch and dinner!).

I traveled to Maroma for a quick 4 day escape, and wish that I would have been able to stay forever. As a single female traveller, I needed to find a place that met my needs for safety as well as my needs for relaxation....Maroma did just that. The staff was attentive to every need. They are friendly, generous and willing to please. I am a vegetarian and NEVER had problems finding anything on the menu. Breakfast (which is included in your room price) is prefaced with an entire plate of fresh fruit, choice of 3 fresh squeezed juices, homemade mexican rolls (3 -4 kinds) and regular wheat/white toast...and that's before you order. Lunch and dinner offer a LARGE VARIETY of choices....and yes, they are a little high on price, but the quality is worth every penny. One thing to remember as well is that tip is included and tacked onto the bill....so there is no need to tip the staff extra (even though you will want to every time you visit any one of the three restaurants). The spa is wonderful. Staff again is top notch. Hospitality service answers all of your questions and is eager to book any excursion out of Maroma if you so choose. Personally, I never left the resort. It was too wonderful to leave. The beach is beyond words and pictures. The website doesn't do this resort justice.....when I arrived I couldn't believe how magical this place is.

We celebrated our first anniversary. Last year we celebrated our honeymoon in the fallowing hotels\u2026 El Murmullo de la Casa que Canta (Ixtapa, M\u00e9xico), Le Sirenuse (Positano Italy), Bauer (Venice, Italy), Hotel Splendido (Portofino, Italy) and Villa D\u00b4este (Lake Como , Italy). I mention these hotels because they represent part of the point of reference in this review. After saying all of the above our conclusion was that Maroma was close to a deception. Let me elaborate. Food and service at restaurants. The quality of the food is well below the standard of a hotel that charges you between $400 and $1,500 per night. Most of the food is close to flavorless, choices are few, and the service is really slow no matter how many people are in the restaurant at the same time. Plus, the food is expensive in terms of what they offer you. Since, Maroma is the only hotel in the beach and there is nothing around for at least 20 minutes driving, you don\u00b4t have any other choice but to eat there. Nevertheless, I need to mention that breakfasts (included in most packages) are fine and most choices delicious even though you need to wait some times at least 15 minutes in order for your order to really be taken. The best summary of our review of the food and the service is the following phrase of my Wife: \u201cPlease, I don\u00b4t want to eat here anymore. Let\u00b4s go somewhere else, even if we need to pay for a taxi\u201d. We went several times to Playa del Carmen (20 minutes from Maroma) to have dinner and lunch. You need to pay $50 round trip in taxis. Everywhere we went in Playa del Carmen, was notoriously more delicious than Maroma, cheaper and good served. Rooms and facilities. Rooms are below average for the price they charge you. They were ok, but just that. The bathroom often smelled bad. And I always had the sensation that we were in an old hotel. Facilities aside from the lobby, are also below average. The pool in the old section of the hotel was always almost empty because I don\u00b4t know why it always appeared to be dirty. The pool in the newer section was much better. That\u00b4s were we spend all the time we wanted to be in a pool. The new section facility has some sections (such as the one in the beach) that make you feel you are in a third wolrd-third class hotel. Nevertheless, the gym was above my expectations. All the equipment is new and the gym room enjoyable. At night, staff at Maroma lite many candles, this makes the hotel look much better and more romantic. Beach and activities. Excellent. The beach is beautiful. It is the best beach we have ever visited. The water is transparent, waves are moderate, temperature of the water is not cold, and the shore is free of trash and weeds. Activities such as snorkeling, temascal and catamaran (included in most packages) are above average. In fact, the best we have had. Scuba diving is also a wonderful experience even though they charge you almost double the price you will pay in another place. Staff. Excellent attitude and service, except for the manager (I forgot her name, I do remember she was from Argentina). When I mentioned to her our critical point of view she showed few attention and almost no disposition to really make things better. It has been one of the less professional managers I have dealt with. But the hospitality team, was excellent and maybe the best part of Maroma. The bill. This was a bad experience. They charged us food and drinks we didn\u00b4t had and double the package we had. We needed to closely analyze the bill. After three revisions, and more than $2,500 less, we came to the final bill. We felt they wanted to rob us. We know it was not there intention, but at the end it was not a good experience. If you want to rest, with a beautifull view, eat real excellent food, have a nice room and a romantic atmosphere, and are not too much interested in scuba diving and snorkeling\u2026.go to El Murmullo de la Casa que Canta in Ixtapa, it is much better and truly a paradise\u2026and by the way, much cheaper.", "Date": "July 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, illionis", "Title": "\u201cA Big Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "kimberly90210", "ReviewID": "UR2284437", "Content": "Just got back from Maroma over the 4th of July weekend.

It was called a Bellini. and 4 drinks were over $80. Each day our food bill for the beach was around $60 including 1 drink> We did not like the food choices and the fish appeared frozen instead of fresh. We rented a car and drove into Playa a couple of nights to eat at the Blue Lobster which was great. We also went by cab once and at 20 plus tip each way got to expensive. I would suggest if you want to see the ruins, Playa Del Carmen rent a car at the airport and drive. The roads are great and if you rent in advance you will not have to pay the 80 per day the hotel arranged. We chose to go to Tulum which was about one hour south and easy drive. Our room was number 10. Beach direct view with a hammock I wish I had at home. The service at this hotel is spectacular but the internet did not work th entire time, but heck that is ok because I did not go to work. The drinks are weak but who cared. All you need is the beach and the atmosphere and that we got. The gift shop prices are lower than anywhere we shopped. I am always hesitant but this time they proved lower. some have commented on the bath room. The huge tub and shower accommodated 2 people. The bed at night makes you fall in love all over again. The staff again is excellent. then we went to secrets capri and nearly died. If I had not paid in advance I would have checked out and fled back to Maroma. If you want a romantic place, a perfect beach, great spa, and seclusion this is thehotel for you. We have never stayed at a place we really wanted to return to, but Maroma will be our yearly retreat from now on. Watch for the travel channels best of week and see Maroma then you will know what we mean.", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool.

Everything around is a joy, the staff are the most friendly and helpful,nothing is too much trouble. the gardens are just amazing,the only one i have seen to compare is the Villa Cimbrone Ravello, in Italy, The older part of the hotel is the place to be. Orient Express have done an amazing job to extend Maroma but it will take a while to gain the lushness of the original building and surroundings. Things that are must dos- Massage on the beach,the Temazecal, a trip with Victor on his boat..Go to Coba (early!) and climb the pyramid.eat dinner on the candlelit beach.and take factor 400 sun oil! I read the reviews on this site before i went and reading them now,im astonished any body could dream of critisizing! Idid see at first hand the kind of people who do complain, and would suggest maybe a cruise next time! The only thing to be wary of is to check the bill at the end of your time,the accounting can be as laidback as the place,but is easily resolved by the great staff in Hospitality.

It was only a few steps to our palapa so you could go back and forth from the beach if you needed to. We took a snorkeling trip and a \"jungle walk\" with a guide to explain the plants, animals and local ecosystem. The dinners are expensive in the restaurant but you can also order something from the room service menu and eat on your own lovely patio. Staff was very friendly, room and furnishings are locally constructed and very beautiful. We stayed in the \"old\" part in Room 3.

Beautiful beach, property and excellent service. After staying there we raved about this place to all our friends saying you must go there. Last May while celebrating my 50th Birthday, although we could not get a reservation for a room at the Maroma for the dates we were in Mexico, my wife wanted to suprise me and have my birthday dinner at the Maroma restaurant. Well, first of all as we entered the grounds I noticed it was a bit more shabby than I had remembered. But I looked past that figuring it was the time and elements of being near the ocean. When we were greeted by the hostess, she said that shorts were not allowed at dinner. NO problem my mistake, so I went to the boutique and purchased some $80 pants (which I will probably never wear again, they looked fine for the Caribbean, not San Francisco Ca). When we sat down for dinner we mentioned to the hostess that it was my 50th Birthday dinner, and we have stayed here before and loved it. but we have about 2hours30 minutes for dinner since we had to pick up my sister in law at the Airport at 830PM. As we were sitting at the table, toasting my birthday, I noticed a couple being seated and the gentleman was wearing SHORTS! I did not want to make a big deal out of it , but I asked the hostess why I was not allowed to wear shorts and he was allowed. Her response was that he was ordering from the lunch menu. I looked at my watch and said it is 6PM, and it looks like he has the same menu we had. So I then asked \"why were we not offered the \"lunch menu\", and why I had to buy $80 pants to have dinner and not him ??\" She did not give me any answer. Well after dinner, which was expensive and not very special as it was 5 years ago, we asked for the check knowing we had a few more minutes before we had to go to the airport. It took a long time to get the check, so I left to bring the car around to the restaurant while my wife paid. I was still waiting. My wife finally got to the car and I asked her what took so long. She said they overcharged her by about $200.00 and she had to straighten it out. I felt so bad for my poor wife who really wanted to make it a special dinner for me, but we were treated so poorly it was one of the most insulting dinners we ever had. We were lied to, and as I figure it overcharged about $280.00 We have been to many to restaurants and hotels in Europe, Caribbean, Hawaii, and other places in the US. Not to mention we live in the SF Bay area, which we have our share of top restaurants and hotels. And we have also been to simple hamburger joints and \"mom & pop\" taquerias, but we have never been treated so poorly. And to top it off, I wrote a letter to the Maroma to tell them of my experience. They have never even responed!!!! I know this place sometimes gets mentioned in the \"Best Beaches /Best Resorts\" lists in travel magazines and on the Travel Channel. BUT unfortunately if they continue their slide in service I think their days are numbered for any \"Best\" list. For the prices they charge, especially for Mexico, you would think they could hire or train for better service. We will continue to tell our friends about this place, but now we will tell them you must NOT go!!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Resort, Beach Overrated\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1848589", "Content": "My wife and I were recent guests of the Maroma family and have nothing but positive things to say about our time in Mexico. The resort itself was absolutely fantastic! I only ventured to the new additions once, but it essentially mirrors the original property. Having said that, I would suggest staying either in the main \"El Sol\" building, or in the older section surrounding the Main pool as it is undoubtedly more tranquil than the new buildings which nestle against the louder Venta Club. The staff was phenomenal. Service was the best I have ever experienced (regardless of locale). Rooms were unique and \"authentic\", the deck and private hammocks perfect for late afternoon napping. The main restaurant hosts a wonderful breakfast each morning, and the lunch menu was equally satisfying. If you stay on premises for more than 5 days or so, I suggest venturing out for dinner at least once as the dinner menu is somewhat limited. The menu itself rotates from day to day, and is reasonably priced. The wine cellar is fairly extensive, and blends from all over the world. Food quality was good, but some of the non-Snapper seafood (fish only) dishes were not as fresh as they perhaps could have been. The beach was beautiful, the water warm and clear. On a down note, there was a good bit of debris both in the water and along the shore. You would never know this walking the beaches behind Maroma, but a walk to either point would prove otherwise. I suspect this was an anomaly due to recent storms and tradewinds, but it does make for an interesting swim. All in all a wonderful resort. The staff is exemplary and the beaches inviting. We definitely plan on returning in the future and will highly recommend to friends and family.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMaroma = Paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1772303", "Content": "Maroma Resort & Spa My husband and I came back tonight from our honeymoon. We had intended to stay there for 4 nights and then move to the nearby Royal Hideaway resort. We arrived at the other resort and immediately got on the phone with your travel agent to return to Maroma. We were there for 10 days. Staff is wonderful and they greet you with the words ?Welcome Home? and a frosty (and strong) margarita.Our room during the first 4 days was overlooking the main pool. Very quiet and beautiful. Our bed (white with flowing white fabric from the ceiling) had the word felicidades (happy honeymoon) spelled out in flowers and a bottle of champagne chilling on ice. When we returned to the resort, we had 2 different rooms to fit into their availability. Our last room #30 walked directly to the beach and had an amazing tile bath. Both were on the \"main\" side of the resort which we preferred.Small details that make Maroma worth it: Plenty of free bottled water in the rooms, free coffee or tea outside your door every morning, you never see a bill (which might make you nuts), they call you by name, breakfast is included in your room rate and it is a 4 course occasion, they bring free sorbet and fresh fruit to the beach during the day, there is room for everyone on the beach and it isn?t the kind of place where people are chair hogs, gym is brand new and well equipped, homemade chocolates on the bed each night and turn down that includes candles being lit around your room, great water pressure and massages available on the beach. The chef is wonderful and the menu is eclectic. He is very personable and has cooking demonstrations on certain days. I would recommend that people who share a room at this resort be very comfortable with each other. There are no shower curtains and the bathroom door is more befitting of a department store fitting room. You can see where they are building new things but we never heard any construction noises.If you are there for a special occassion tell them and they can set up a candlelit dinner on the beach or on their roof patio overlooking the pristine, beautiful beach.

I have just read some of the comments from visitors over the last year. Some of the negative reviews seem mostly accurate. However, my wife and I had a great time. I must reiterate that the beach is fabulous. The Ventaclub next door does not pose much of a problem if one stays closer to the main beach area near the restaraunt. I must agree that drinks, food and excursions are extremely overpriced. A one tank dive cost $90 if you are certified-this does not include scuba gear. The dive boat looks like a very small fishing boat made for a creek and you have to swim to the boat. I did not dive there. I went to Tank-ha downtown. We drank the water for 8 days and did not get ill. We must have iron stomachs. I would not pay for an ocean view room. The garden view rooms are fine a much less expensive and I don't think most of the \"ocean front\" rooms give any advantages in location or scenery. It would be nice to be a little closer to Playa del carmen. We rented a car from Hertz downtown and seemed to work for us. I will be looking forward to returning to the area but I might look closer to town like Ikal del mar.
