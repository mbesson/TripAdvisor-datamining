{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wouldn't return but very nice for the price My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights. The service was great and they let us know all the great spots to eat at and visit in Beijing. The staff was very personable and friendly and spoke very good english. The beds were nice and comfortable. The free western breakfast was extremely fresh and very good. The only negatives we experienced were the room was very humid but cool at times and our internet access didn't work in our room. We had to take our laptop to the lounge so the wireless would be close enough. Also there was a sick child a couple rooms down. My husband and I felt so sorry for her because she didn't get much sleep one night and neither did we because we could hear her crying very well. We closed our bathroom door and it was a little better because I think it may have been coming from the shower drain or the shower wall. All that being said, this was probably the cheapest hotel we've ever stayed at with the 5 star service we received. I'm not sure if I'd go back but I'm glad we stayed there and were able to save money. Also, the architecture was gorgeous and the attention to design was superb.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR226656749", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EmilyTeresia"}, {"Content": "Little Gem in Beijing!

This hotel exceeded our high expectations and we loved every minute of our five-night stay.We had a standard room which well designed, clean and comfortable. The pictures on the hotel\u9225\u6a9a web site will give you a good sense of the guest rooms and public spaces.What really sets Cote Cour apart is the service. Jerry, Michelle and the rest of the team do an outstanding job making guest feel welcome and helping them to get the most out of their time in Beijing. Among other things, they helped us with some emergency laundry, offered excellent restaurant suggestions and arranged for a comfortable car and safe driver to visit the Great Wall.Cote Cour does not have a restaurant but serves continental breakfast (including a yummy yoghurt and granola combination) in the attractive guest lounge. The outdoor courtyard is a wonderful place to relax with a beer or a glass of wine at the end of the day. We enjoyed chatting in the evening with other guests\u9225\u6501ll interesting and well traveled.The location was great for us but it isn\u9225\u6a9b for everyone and it is the most important consideration in deciding whether this is the right hotel for you. The hotel is situated in the center of the city along a quiet hutong\u9225\u6510ne of Beijing\u9225\u6a9a fast disappearing residential lanes. The hotel will give you a card with instructions in Chinese for taxi drivers, but several taxi drivers struggled to find the hutong and others found it but refused to drive in to it\u9225\u6504ropping us off at one end (a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel). One taxi driver took a look at the hotel\u9225\u6a9a driving instructions and just said \u9225\u6e18o\u9225?and drove off. None of this bothered us (in fact it added to the sense of adventure) but I could imagine that it might upset some people (including some of our friends). If you think this will bother you, Cote Cour might not be the right hotel for you.Cote Cour is a truly outstanding place and provides a memorable experience in the center of Beijing.

What a wonderful surprise. Staff were so welcoming (many spoke English) and the boutique hotel is a beautifully restored walled house, with well appointed rooms and bathrooms. We wanted to see and experience old Beijing and this small hotel in the hutong area provided a glimpse back into the past. It was the perfect place to stay.I stayed in several hotels, of varying types and sizes during my 5 weeks in China and this one was my favourite. As a boutique hotel, its surroundings, warmth in atmosphere, excellence in service and personal touches far surpassed some of the facilities other large hotels offered.Location is very central and public transport was easy to find and use. Many of the laneways in the Hutong area are closed to motor vehicles after 10pm however, Beijing was very safe and we made the most of taking a couple of walks late at night to walk off the wonderful food. Breakfasts at the hotel were great and not too heavy and the chef prepared an unforgettable dinner for our small group one evening in the dining room.Special thanks to Jerry who made everything easy, providing directions in Chinese for taxi drivers, hand drawn maps when required, restaurant recommendations and generally interesting conversation in the courtyard. We also met some great people and enjoyed their conversation over drinks in the courtyard.Will definitely be going back.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217051846", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Cunninghams2"}, {"Content": "Welcome home happy family! This is the place if you want to really feel like you're in China, but still enjoy Western comforts. Our family of 5, including 3 teenagers, loved every bit of our 5-day stay. The staff is fabulous -- we were greeted by name and with Welcome home happy family! each time we returned. One day our son stayed in the hotel with an upset stomach and various staff members checked on him 5 or 6 times and offered to bring him whatever he needed. Jerry Seinfeld (name appropriated by our favorite staffer) never failed to provide excellent restaurant recommendations, procure show tickets, etc. I have many, many other examples of great, very personal service. I agree with other reviewers that it's difficult to find, but its location is a big part of the charm. To avoid the horrible Beijing traffic, we took the subway (3 block walk) and walked a lot. Although you do walk down a narrow, winding alley that has public bathrooms (many of the buildings lack private plumbing) and some pretty rundown looking rooms, we never felt unsafe. However, the hutong (neighborhood) is being completely rebuilt so it may look very different by now. Surprisingly, we never heard any of the construction noise when we were in the hotel. Regular rooms and bathrooms are nice, but a bit small (hotel can't or won't allow for more than two per room). Deluxe suite was fabulous. Plenty of English language TV stations (with some censorship by the Chinese government). Nice, fairly basic breakfast. Fellow guests were very interesting and atmosphere lends itself to interaction (although still feels more like a hotel than a BB).

In many ways, it was the perfect antidote; the bedrooms are individually and beautifully decorated and very spacious. The bathrooms are also fab with a wonderful deep bathtub and a separate walk in rain shower which made getting up in the morning a pleasant experience! The lounge area where the yummy breakfasts are served is also a stylish and relaxing room. I would also echo other comments on here about the great service - Jerry on the front desk in particular was knowledgeable and incredibly helpful throughout my stay.On the negative side - one of the things I did miss from the larger hotels was room service. Dinner is available if pre-arranged, but arriving back unexpectedly late from a long day of meetings at 9pm and not wanting to go out on my own, I was rather stuck. On day 1, fortunately the chef was still on site and prepared me a fantastic bowl of noodle soup but on day 2, I was out of luck and left tired and hungry - and wishing I was at the Shangri-La...The hotel location also caused a few problems - despite having a card from the hotel with a map and the address written in Chinese, quite a few taxi drivers had problems finding it and one outright refused to drive down the narrow alley leading to the hotel....not fun as this was late on Friday night after a lovely meal at Made in China (absolutely worth a visit).

It took me some days to recognise this was in a really great area and central to shopping and attractions in this huge sprawling city. This wonderful courtyard converted house is located in an historically protected hutong and has kept the ambience of old Beijing and yet still has the modern amendities. Covered in snow on day two was a memorable sight.!My room was well heated and my cosy bed with feather doona and soft bedlinen was welcoming. The bathroom however was not well heated and and despite the funky decor the shower was not efficient but apart from that I loved the decor in the main living area and the main lounge where breakfast ,drinks at night and dinner on request was served. Enter through huge shiny red doors to a room-filled with modern art work, antique furniture, funky cushions and large bowls of fresh fruit . The owner who was overseas during my stay, was so apologetic for her absence that she kindly left us a note and enclosed tickets to a concert in the Forbidden City...(very thoughtful). The breakfast, that is included in the tariff, was wonderfully presented and a surprise each day.It was only when I returned to Beijing a week later and stayed in a western-style hotel that I remembered how peaceful the hotel was. I cant remember any traffic noise and felt I was in a secret oasis. Despite the difficutlies getting a taxi driver through the narrow pathways to find the hotel, it is certainly worth the effort.I am hotel addict and was wary at first of my son's recommendation (I knew there was the security of a 5 star hotel located around the corner,) but it was perfect and would highly recommend this hotel for the atmoshphere, the locality, the comfort and service and the experience of being in the old area of Beijing.", "Date": "Dec 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR482925740", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gillio"}, {"Content": "Fantastic introduction to China Hotel Cote Cour's location is central and within walking distance to great sights, restaurants and shopping.

As a case in point, I would refer you to my appropriately-scathing TripAdvisor review of the widly-overrated Lizard Island Resort in Australia:http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255082-d258042-r4014062-Lizard_Island_Resort-Lizard_Island_Great_Barrier_Reef_Queensland.html)As part of a nine-month around-the-world trip, my wife and I spent three days in Beijing in late April 2007. In one exceptional stroke of luck, I happened to do a Google search of Beijing Boutique Hotel in the hopes of finding a truly intimate luxury lodging experience at a reasonable price. The search yielded one interesting link (listed below), from which I made our reservation:[--]After a 40-minute taxi ride into Beijing from the airport, my wife and I started having doubts about the decision when our cabdriver pulled into a cramped alleyway bordered on both sides by gray stone walls. We would later come to learn that this particular setting was a hutong -- a historical district of traditional Beijing stone houses surrounding interior courtyards -- that happened to be smack dab in the center of Beijing's high rent district, no more than a 5-minute cab ride from the Peninsula or Grand Hyatt or a 10-minute cab ride from the Forbidden City or Tiananmen Square. At first blush, you would never guess that the CEO of China's largest company just so happens to live on the same block. Stepping in through two large, bright-red Chinese doors, we were greeted by the Cote Cour SL's exceptionally-kind and thoughtful front desk manager, Michael. As we stepped into the hotel, we breathed a huge sigh of relief as the aesthetic was exactly what we were looking for -- a chic, luxurious and beautifully-appointed boutique hotel created from a restored historical area. My wife, the design and fashion buff of the family, became ecstatic at the sight of the contemporary design with antique Chinese touches. We were shown to our room on the right side of the colorful and cheerful courtyard (the boutique has 12 rooms total) and I, the technology and creature comfort buff of the family, became ecstatic. In terms of technology, our room had a large flat-screen plasma television with more U.S. and English satellite channels than any other hotel we've seen in China (including the Shangri-Las and the Sofitels) and wireless Internet access. As far as creature comforts, our room featured a king bed with plush pillows, soft cotton sheets, terry-cloth bathrobes, an electronic safe and a bathroom with a raised porcelain bowl sink and a walk-in rainshower. This was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the experience. After seeing the room, we were shown to the very cool and stylish guest lounge featuring some of the owner's private artwork, amazing music and very comfortable seating. The lounge was also where we breakfasted each morning on fresh-baked French pastries, fresh fruit and the most delicious Swiss mueslix we've ever tasted.So, it goes without saying that the hotel facilities were tremendous. But the facilities were dwarfed by the service and attention to detail. We truly felt as if we were staying with close personal friends as opposed to in a hotel. Michael, the front desk manager we alluded to earlier, repeatedly bent over backwards for us in every imaginable respect: arranging for restaurant reservations (and confirming that they accepted credit cards and served vegetarian dishes), obtaining quotes for private car service, hailing taxis, researching Great Wall tours, calling our airline to amend our reservation on our behalf, transcribing restaurant names, addresses and directions into Mandarin and fielding calls from us and our cabdrivers when we lost our way in Beijing.As if that wasn't enough, the hotel's owner, Shauna, was among the most amazing, talented and friendly people we have ever met, anywhere in the world. In our three days at her hotel, she obtained for us last-second reservations at the renowned Made In China and People 8 restaurants (and went so far as to preorder Made In China's famed Peking Duck for my wife), escorted us to see galleries in Beijing's up-and-coming 798 arts district, took my wife shopping and helped her negotiate some hip clothing purchases and took us to dinner with some of her friends. We literally looked into changing our plane tickets to extend our time in Beijing solely because of Shauna and Michael and our amazing stay at Cote Cour SL. Unfortunately, we weren't able to this time around, but we will definitely come back (and hope that she's not so wildly-successful that she doesn't have room for us).", "Date": "Apr 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR899917849", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ponch73"}, {"Content": "Supersch\u679anes Hotel in Peking!   showReview(8126587, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR920410366", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tankisa"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d653600-r21314685-Hotel_Cote_Cour_S_L-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "653600", "Price": "$255"}}
