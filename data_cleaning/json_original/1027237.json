They have a very popular nightspot at this hotel and clients that go there during their stay. So they have to guard the elevators on saturday night because there is a lot of people wanting to cut the line outside and use the inside hotel elevators. And i think that the hotel's clients can go back to their room from inside...so there was noise all night in our corridor, culminating at 3:30 am ( we went to bed at 1am) when a group of people arrived and spent 10 minutes in the corridor shouting and laughing. At some point i went to open and close my door with a bang to make them realize they were in a hotel. They shouted insanities at us through our door and continued their noise for 15 minutes then came back to knock violently at our door. Earlier in the day another client complained to us in the elevator that the night before two men came out of the elevator at the same time he did and followed him to his room..cautioning us to be careful. I am sorry to think and say that this hotel management's want to make money and be hip with a trendy nightspot at the expense of the comfort and security of their hotel customers.

The Gym comes with some fancy machines - but we missed simple (and effective) things like pilates mats or therabands. With almost no more money left, there was no way for us to check out the SPA (guess what, its not a bargain). Parking is about 40 bucks a night (outdoors, right next to the hotel).

Many of them have been quite good, but for the past couple of years, I've opted for the Dana. Location-wise, it's just off the Magnificent Mile in the midst of everything that particular stretch has to offer. Room-wise, it's got everything I need -- they're relatively spacious, have floor to ceiling windows/Juliet balconies that afford you a great view or if it's a balcony, just some fresh air (a great alternative to air conditioning), to-die-for bathrooms situated in the middle of the room (with glass-enclosed showers that let you see out while you shower if you desire, or shades if it's privacy you want), wonderful bath amenities, and -- something I've never had at any other hotel -- hand-made chocolates/candies in their honor bar in lieu of the usual M&Ms etc. Plush bathrobes and slippers too. Room service is good (in terms of offerings and timeliness) and the food is fine. The gym is just OK, unfortunately. Rather small & cramped, there is only 1 workout bench and only a couple of machines. Earlier this week I was there with 4 other (unrelated) guests and we were falling over each other and jealously watching as soon as someone finished his/her reps or workout so we could grab the equipment before anyone else. Dana management -- this is an easy fix -- please expand. The restaurant (Aja, pronounced like the continent) is pretty good too. I've only eaten there once (there are so many choices in this neck of the woods), but when I did, the menu was varied and unusual, and the service good -- even a bit over the top (I lost count of the number of people who checked in with us to make sure everything was OK); I almost expected the chef to be next!

The hotel was very nice. There lounge/bar on the 43rd floor (Vertigo) is very popular. Constant lines form outside the hotel for this place. One of the more popular clubs in town. The room was half wood floor, half commercial carpet. The bathroom had a rain showerhead and was very modern. There's an Ipod docking station with speakers next to the flat screen TV. Ice was on the 5th floor. They have a spa and weightroom on the 4th floor. I love the steam room in the men's locker room. Nice way to relax and relieve stress. We brought booze and mix...as we always do...and inevitably spilled some on the floor. I was pleased to see that that maid actually moppoed the wood portion of the floor. They really did a good job with the cleaning. I'd recommend to anybody staying in the River North/Mag. Mile area of Chicago. I saw one review on here and the lady didn't have anything nice to say. She obviously didn't stay there. If I were a business owner, I'm guessing this is precisely the type of patron whose business I would NOT want - just seems like this is someone who can't be pleased no matter what.

My sister Caryn, had her thirtieth birthday here. I thought wow, a bit extravagant...but really it's a HUGE birthday marker for her and she really deserves to be pampered. So I though, why not? They'll make sure she's taken care of...BOY WAS I WRONG, read her testimonial since I wasn't there with her bad experience...SO, MY bad experience she didn't mention. A week prior my sister asked me if I wanted to get a treatment and have a girls day for her birthday. Very EXCITED I said yes, and asked her to book me a facial. The night before (less than 12 hours notice) they contacted her and stated they were cancelling my appointment and gave no reason. Caryn doesn't like to complain and asked me if that was ok...I was disappointed but, didn't want to cause a problem and just let it go. Later that night we were supposed to have dinner at AJA, Dana hotel's restaurant. When we walked in the restaurant's hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we had a reservation with Caryn. We had to call Caryn for the hostess to acknowledge we had a reservation. The hostess told us that we HAD to wait for the rest of the party in the bar area WHICH IS NOT HEATED and it was the same temperature as the outside. My Father, who is elderly, could not sit in this cold room and we insisted to be seated. After having an argument with the manager they obliged. We sat down and the bus boy proceeded to pour water in our glasses and our laps. YES OUR LAPS. For some bizarre reason he poured the water into the glass spilling it and then proceeded to continue to pour outside the glass on the table and into our laps. And he did that to all 15 settings of the table. Caryn had not arrived and we didn't want to spoil her evening so politely mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized. We ordered our drinks and they gave us a canter (of sake) that leaked. SO half the sake went into the glass and half went onto the table. The waiter apologized and was super embarrassed. He was kind enough to give us extra napkins to clean up the mess the buss boy and the faulty canter created. We ordered our food...Which was a complete disaster and completely disorganized. One by one when our food eventually came out. SERIOUSLY EVENTUALLY, from the time we ordered the food to the first course to arrive at our table was an HOUR. By this time we were all RAVENOUS but, relieved at the sight of the first plate coming out. We were all staring at the first plate of food, like starving wolves just coming out of winter and finding a dead carcass, and thinking in relief, \"OH GREAT, my food won't be very far off behind.\" YEAH, we were wrong. Not wanting to be rude the ONE person who got their food waited until someone else got their food...Which was 10 minutes later...I KID YOU NOT! I have never had service like this. Literally only one person every 10 MINUTES got their food. The food was cold by the time the next plate came out. By this time we encouraged everyone just to eat when they got their food. The delivery of the food was to ridiculous we actually asked the staff to cancel the rest of the orders. 10 Minutes later the REST of the food arrived! Miraculously.It only took TWO HOURS TO GET EVERYONE ONE FED. I use the word FED loosely. This whole dinner was supposed to be $1000...for a $1000 dinner one would think they would have their stuff together and at the very lease feed the customers properly. After dinner here we had to have dinner again somewhere else. The portions were substandard, wasn't all that good, and the service lacked. Our waiter did what he could with what he had so, I can't say he was a bad waiter...Just everything else. After that pathetic dinner My family went upstairs to Caryn's room when we arrived at the floor there was BOOMING music coming from all directions. I asked Caryn if she was taking us to the night club, she laughed and said \"No, Apparently this is the party floor.\" The room was nice and spacious and the view was nice. The wait staff arrived to set up the room for her party (which is why I am surprised that they gave her such a hard time after we left) Overall, I am very disappointed in this whole experience and I am even more so upset that our family PLUNKED down all that money for a special occasion that was ruined by Dana Hotel.

Families with young children would fare better elsewhere. + Corner suite spacious with separate living and sleeping areas. Perfect for entertaining. + Aja restaurant and lobby bar open all day.

Focus is on bottle service with few liquor options (lobby bar is far superior for cocktails) Club bouncers take over elevators making it very difficult to get up to your room between the hours of 9PM-1AM. Hotel should allocate one of the three elevators for hotel guest use only. - City noises can be heard even on high floors. Not a deal breaker but worth noting. - Like most of Chicago the service is indifferent and quiet. Everything is available to you if you ask for it but very little is offered. Don't think this to be rude, there is a respectful distance and patience practiced in Chicago that can appear rude to those visiting from areas with more aggressive service cultures like NY or LA. Bell services, car services, concierge services and other amenities can be arranged so do not hesitate to ask.

Keurig coffee maker. LOVED the shower setup. Floor to ceiling windows with nice views. Booking with the hotel allowed a $10 pp voucher for breakfast, making breakfast almost free each morning, a plus. Must take the elevator/stairs from ground level to lobby on 2nd floor. Then two elevators are available from 2nd level to your room. Inconvenient. (This set up is thanks to the rooftop bar that uses the 1st floor to load guests. Thus hotel guests are stuck waiting for a elevator as they are bypassed for the rooftop bar. Hotel guests have to use their room keys to stop on guest floors but still security is a concern with people other than hotel guests using the elevators.) Spa was average. Maybe it's me but I can't enjoy a massage with the sound of horns honking like they are right in my room. Move the spa up from the 3rd level or the massage rooms away from exterior walls!", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amarillo", "Title": "\u201c3 days in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "johnmcd2", "ReviewID": "UR123985359", "Content": "We booked our hotel and flight stay at the Dana thru Bookit.com.

Other reviewers noted that they thought it was inconvenient to have to take one elevator from the ground floor to the 1st and then switch to another elevator to get to the rooms.

Never having before been to Chicago, and not knowing my State St. from my LaSalle Ave... Without a clue as to the relative distances between things in the downtown area... This tale isn't starting out so good, is it? So I took a gamble on a highly-rated, glowingly-reviewed, but perfectly-priced downtown Chicago almost-boutique property, the Dana (pronounced \"day-nah\"), and let the Fates have their way with me. This time they were most kind. Too kind, in fact. In a word? The Dana is CRUSHING!!! That's what the experience was like. Everything began from the moment I arrived... Seeing as I'd booked so late after my local contact dropped the ball on my hotel reservations, the order hadn't even cleared Expedia.ca's queue (I ordered off the Canadian site, seeing as I'm based in Toronto) when Frederick came through in the clutch -- one call to Admin, he had me sorted out lickety-split. And I thought I'd be waiting for at least 20 mins. No vacancies given the Halloween weekend? Nope...rather than shunt me off to some out-of-the-way silly room facing a brick wall or nestled in a noisy alleyway (read my review of my last hotel stay in Cascais, Portugal)...I was treated like arriving royalty. I was given a top-floor room with a majestic Chicago-style skyscraper view facing north in a sumptuously-appointed suite with all the fixings, the majority of which I regrettably didn't use, but were available to me if needed. All manner of drinks and snacks were *already* available for the taking as I stepped in (no phone call to room service), so for those of you who don't like venturing out into the urban wilderness to fetch victuals or groceries...it's a snap. Only thing I feel terrible about is the fact that I came alone, and had business to attend to in town. Definitely the next time I have occasion to be in Chicago, I'll be bringing company and enjoying all of the Dana's cute little charms. Seeing as it was a birthday trip, Romeo on concierge duty was uber-helpful in suggesting jazz venues for my birthday evening jaunt -- even offering me a drink on-the-house -- and his cab directions were spot-on. Romeo has a knack for remembering everyone's name and as you pass through the lobby, the Dana Front Office guys and gals are always quick to share a laugh or a kind word with you as they address you by name, which makes all the difference when staying at some of the medium-priced hotels. You don't want to ever be treated like a number and that was never the case during my stay. Bonus! Checking out? Breeze! I had an insanely early checkout time (five-ish in the a.m.), and Lindsay realized that I was in a rush to get to O'Hare/ORD for my morning cross-border flight back north. He noticed that I was getting a bit jittery and antsy, seeing as he was serving an arriving guest just as I was about to dance on out of Dodge, within two keystrokes he had my invoice printed and my cash deposit back to me. #FTW!!! Bottom line: while I didn't get a chance to use all the facilities to their maximum -- pity, I know, given the high quality of this place and the fact that the Dana seems like a place tailor-made for fun -- it's an all-star hotel. I even made a short video of the bathroom area to show my friends that such a thing actually exists, and that I wasn't making it all up. Added feature: there's even a nightclub on the top floor -- with some pretty stylish attractive guests (yes!) who were streaming through the patron-only exclusive elevator that spirits them skyward -- though I didn't have time to party there but makes me want to get back to Chicago ASAP just to sample it. That shower is heavenly -- I won't describe it and ruin your surprise (nor will I forget it), but it's worth every dollar you'll spend and newlyweds, couples, or businessmen enjoying a little extra-curricular fun away from home will appreciate the look, and, er...feel of it. And that king-sized bed? I didn't even realize what hit me as I woke up most mornings, and those were the nights I wasn't enjoying a few beers! Unless you've got family in Chicago and they'd be insulted that you're not staying with them during your visit, stay at the Dana and be happy. Very happy.

Also, there is a 7Eleven across the street for snacks, sodas, wine, munchies. The food: Tasted great, and fairly affordable.

The decor: Modern but warm. Chic!! The rooftop: I didn't go...but know that it's a hot spot for visitors and locals. The Spa: Again, a favorite to locals, but I skipped it.. The parking: $38/night, fairly affordable. I think $30-$60 is the city average. Our Audi was well taken care of, and they are very quick to bring your vehicle. The value: Definitely worth the money, but a little pricey for Friday and Saturday stays (it's Chicago). We paid $400 total for Saturday and Sunday nights. $250 Sat and $150 Sun.

House keeping was done each day and well done. Nothing ever went 'missing'. The hotel wifi worked well and was fast.

Breakfast was again fast and nice. Location is fantastic. Easy to get to everywhere. There is noise from the outside streets, but you get used to it very quickly especially if you stay in city hotels. However; my second stay had me staying on a Friday night.

This place is relatively small, but it is really a great hotel. We had heard good things, so our expectations were already high. But, I must say that even my high expectations were met by the corner room with windows on two sides! It really was one of my favorite hotel rooms ever. The bed was very comfortable - really soft, but not in a way that hurt my back. The rooms are a little on the small side, but they make up for it in hipness and comfort. The Pros: Really good food in the hotel restaurant (Aja). Much better than typical hotel food. They did not have hot chocolate on the menu, but they made it for me by steaming milk and dark chocolate together and addingt some sugar. It was really delicious. The room - can't say enough about the bed, the shower, and the views! The location - this is in a nice area of Chicago - close to shopping, restaurants, etc. Just a few blocks from the red line stop. We liked it a lot! The cons: The price - I considered some of the Kimpton properties, and they were significantly less expensive than the Dana. Ultimately, the price is probably about 10-15% higher than it should be. Plus, the price for food was really high as well. A bit misleading check-in person. On check-in, we were told that our rate included breakfast each morning and were given vouchers. But the vouchers were only for $10 each, which usually would not cover all of the cost of breakfast. This is a nice benefit, so don't spoil it by painting it as more than it is - it is not for a \"free breakfast,\" but only for \"$10 toward your breakfast.\" Say what it is. The lobby is on floor 2, and the main elevator stops there and does not go all the way to the ground floor. So, whenever you leave the hotel, you take an elevator down to the lobby floor, and then you have to either get on another elevator, or take stairs down to the ground level to leave the hotel. It would be nice if you could just get on one elevator to leave the hotel. The television in the room takes forever to change channels.

The positives:The room itself was modern and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The mini bar was very reasonably priced (i.e. $2 for a can of pop, $3 for a bottle of Voss water). We were on the 8th floor which had small balcony and a nice view. Pretty good location - within a couple of blocks to shopping, restaurants and attractions of State Street and the Magnificent Mile.

We visitied Vertigo one night and had great service and really enjoyed the view out on the patio; we went up early to get a table (around 8:30) and left just as it was getting super busy (around 11 pm). Reasonably priced (and strong!) drinks and decent service at the lobby bar as well. Heard from other guests that Aja had really good food (never tried it ourselves though). The negatives: As stated, rooms are \"cozy\". We weren't able to get ready at the same time just due to lack of space, particularly in the bathroom. The air conditioning is very loud and woke me up quite a few times during our stay when it'd turn off and on. Card keys are required to use the elevators and ours never worked to get to the ground floor - always to the lobby and then we had to take the stairs down (not a huge deal just annoying). We couldn't get the door to our balcony open - it appeared to be broken. The bathroom is not very private - it has a sliding door and the shower has a floor to ceiling window on one side that can be covered with a curtain but still isn't that private - wasn't a concern to us but could be to others.

I was supposed to have a King bed, but it seemed more like a queen, as my feet were hanging off the edge. That aside, the bed was extremely comfortable with high thread count sheets.

It was a couple days of vacation, followed by a couple days of business in Chicago. First I would like to say the Dana is a beautiful hotel and for the most part I really enjoyed my stay. Other reviews mention it being a party hotel and very loud and I'd say that on the weekend that is true. But most people don't stay at hotels in downtown Chicago for the weekend for quiet and rest. There is a club on the top of the hotel so obviously there will be people coming and going from there. On the weekend part of my hotel it was pretty much full, and quite loud. The rooms have awesome sound systems that you can plug your mp3 player into that sound amazing... only problem with that is people like to crank up the volume so you are likely to hear it in the next room. Even though it was not an issue during my stay, I did have neighbors who liked to turn up the music at times. During the week portion of my stay it was MUCH quieter and I was able to get rest as needed. The rooms at the Dana are pretty much exactly what you see in the pictures. They are very asthetically pleasing, and the bathrooms are amazing. However, as others have noted they really need some type of door on the shower as the water does get all over the floor. The shower is truely amazing though, I didn't want to go back to my shower at home after using it! So overall I'd recommend the Dana Hotel, just know that on the weekends there will be a lot of people coming and going, and there will be noise. I did have an issue with the housekeeping one day... I was there for 4 days and one day came back to my room to find an an unacceptable level of cleaning. The towels in the bathroom were dirty, but rolled up as though they were clean, and my coffee was not replenished for the in room coffee maker. It made me wonder what else had not been properly attended to. I must admit this was a BIG issue for me as I tipped housekeeping every day, they least they could do is make sure they do a thorough job of cleaning/stocking. Oh one more thing... the room key cards are TERRIBLE. They are constantly being erased and you need to have them re-programmed. I've never had that happen at any other hotel. I suggest they really look into getting that fixed as it's pretty inconvenient to have to stop at the desk (and wait if there is a line) all the time to have them re-programmed.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "amjur613", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorite hotels except for hassles with key cards not working\u201d", "Author": "amjur613", "ReviewID": "UR116952713", "Content": "Great hotel overall with interesting rooms and bathrooms, good service and a great restaurant.

The staff, ALL IN BLACK and ALL YOUNG, are under the delusion that they are doing hotel guests a favor, thus their demeanor is uppity, disengaged and impersonal to the point where they look at their computer screens more than the guests. The rooms were amply furnished but given the refurbished nature of the hotel, they have left the ceilings in raw concrete (to add to the \"rustic\" character?), the wall plugs do not work and lighting is totally inadequate to the point of not being able to even read a newspaper! I had to threaten Room Service in order to have drinking water bottles in the room fridge and coffee packets to be replenished (maybe the Room Service people decided to celebrate the 4th of July at home?!). What was incredulous, however, was when we got on the elevator and were joined by a young lady with a huge bowl of salad destined for the wedding reception at the top floor bar of the hotel; the bowl was uncovered, the young lady was joyfully using the guest elevator -instead of the service one- and any of the other ten passengers could have spat on the salad in the bowl with potentially disastrous infectious results! What took the cake, of course, was that I did not pay any attention until I got home but I was charged for parking at the hotel for two nights instead of only one at an additional charge of $40 which I am still owed!

It was the hotel suggested by our friends, whose wedding we were in town for. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. The main problems were the service, the noise, and the impractical nature of the setup of the rooms. Some of the service problems we had included: having to ask twice (once by phone to the front desk, once in person at the front desk after turndown service ignored our request) for new towels and toilet paper when our room was cleaned but not restocked. Had to wait until the next day when we left a note for housekeeping on the sink. Finally these items were restocked. The snacks in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honor bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the room were all expired (with May and June expiration dates.) Most offensively, the alarm clock went off the first morning at 6am on the highest volume. We had only gotten a few patchy hours of sleep anyway, what with the screaming guests congregating in the hallway all night. The walls are paper thin, and every time someone on your floor opens or closes their door, your door will shudder closed as well. The street noise is terribly loud. I guess this is a matter of taste, but we did not enjoy the bathroom setup. There is no wall separating the bathroom and the bedroom. There is only a clear glass with a flimsy curtain, that is on the bedroom side of the glass. SO, if you are in the bathroom, you cannot close the curtain. There is also no door on the bathroom. You have to open the closet, and use the closet door as the bathroom door. Neither the closet door nor the curtain closes completely. Some people cooler than I am might think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot and romantic to watch your partner in the bathroom, but my husband and I prefer not to watch each other on the toilet. The hotel definitely caters to the nightclub guests more than the hotel guests. Hotel guests are forced to use the elevator on the lobby floor (first floor up) rather than from the ground floor (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same set of elevators.) Nightclub guests wait in line at the ground floor, so as they are making their way up to the nightclub, there is no room on the elevator for actual hotel guests. The music is so loud that we could hear it in the hallway even though we were a good 10 floors below it. Thankfully we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it in our room. There were a few positives. I had a great massage with Tim, which I booked a few minutes before I wanted to start, and the spa was totally accommodating. However, going along with the service problems, the otherwise nice receptionist at the spa gave me the wrong bill, charging me more for someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment. When I checked the bill, she immediately fixed the problem, but again, if I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed the error, she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have. Not the kind of thing you want to deal with after a relaxing massage. The location is great, but not a reason to stay here. There are MANY other hotels in a few blocks that have the same location advantage. Also, this is not a boutique hotel although it advertises as one. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a HUGE hotel with around 25 floors of rooms. A boutique hotel is small, quiet and caters to guests.

It sits on a tiny footprint, with only about 10-12 rooms per floor. While the hotel has all the trappings of a trendy, too-cool-for-even-itself property, it has NONE of that vible (except, perhaps, in the dark, rooftop bar that was filled with twenty-somethings when we popped up for a look one evening). Bell, check-in and concierge staff are casual, super friendly and always helpful with multiple requests. The room was warm contemporary in decor, spacious, equipped with all of today's gadgets and featured a wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling window (no special view...but good city perspective; black-out shades were great). Seriously comfortable beds with crisp, white linens and down or synthetic-down comforters. An abundance of pillows. Flat-screen TV. Keurig coffee maker and all the fixings. Wine and other beverages in the fridge (relatively reasonably priced, surprisingly). Lots of plugs for charging devices. Bath is good size (only one sink...but enough counter space for two to share). Shower is huge and has a rain-head and hand spray. Beware...the back shower wall is all glass and faces into the bedroom. You have to pull the curtain in the bedroom before you go into the bathroom if you don't want to shower on display to your roommate and/or those who live in the apartments across the street (we heard funny stories).. Must confess that we sorely missed having an in-room bathtub or, even better, a hotel Jacuzzi on the cold afternoons/evenings when we returned from our excursions (would have used it every day). With a full-service spa in the building, you might think they'd at least have a Jacuzzi guests could use. But no. A magnifying make-up mirror hung face height on the wall would be a nice addition, too. The dressing/closet area lighting is dim. And with the shower \"window\" opening into the bedroom, any lights turned on in the bath at night spill out into the bedroom. Also, when the bathroom's sliding door (which does not lock) is open, the closet is inaccessible. Easy-to-use, huge, in-room safe for laptop+ while out and about. Only ate one meal in the restaurant. Breakfast. A bit big-city pricey and the Eggs Benedict was just o.k. (too much regular ham rather than Canadian bacon; not enough Hollandaise), but the capuccino was fabulous. Plenty of alternate places for breakfast nearby. All in all, a great stay at a fun, well-located property.

We had some issues with a few minor things, nothing that would make us never stay here again. The biggest issue was no microwave available to guests. We had leftover food and all we wanted to warm up on a cold, rainy day and they were not willing to help us out at all. They only give a few creamer and sugar for the coffee (which the only choices are dark or decaf) and it wasn't enough for two people. We called guest services for more and it took them more then two hours to bring it to us. The rooms are decent size and I love the wood flooring and floor to ceiling windows. What I don't care for is the fact that the wall between the shower and the room is glass with just a curtain over it. I get it and it would be cool if you were staying in a room with one bed...but for people traveling on business, or in our case, with friends it's a little creepy. I don't need to see shadows of my friends showering. I don't know why they would have that in a room with two beds. If you have trouble sleeping because of noise, bring your Ambien. On weekends the hotel gets a little loud ( a cab driver told us it's a known party hotel) and the street below is very busy and noisy.

We regularly visit Chicago for business and pleasure, and this time around were traveling with my husband's business colleagues. Someone had phoned the hotel in advance to let them know we would be arriving late, but in spite of this the hotel had let our room go. While this may be a common occurrence, the handling of it was abysmal. The guy on reception started off by saying that he had some really bad news for us, but it wasn't his fault! This was before we had even had a chance to comment. He then told us that we could walk the three blocks to another hotel...with heavy suitcases at one in the morning on a Saturday night. He continually told us it wasn't his fault, and our general impression was that we should just go away and shut up. I had to ask for the money for a taxi to the other hotel, and he then told me I needed to get receipts as he couldn't be seen to be just giving out money. It was only when I asked if he was actually sure the other hotel had a room that he bothered to ring them and explain the situation. Otherwise I think it highly likely that we would have arrived at reception and had to do all the explaining ourselves. He didn't even offer to get someone to help us outside with our luggage to find a cab...I had to ask, but according to him it definitely wasn't his fault! After a very restless night sleep we returned to the Dana prepared to do battle with the manager. To be fair he did upgrade us to a corner room and was pleasant to deal with. The actual hotel was very nice and the room was clean and comfortable and the desk made working a pleasure. All the other staff were unfailingly friendly, and the doormen were particularly good, however the waiting staff at breakfast seemed very disorganized as we had to wait ages for a very simple order of toast and coffee. While this hotel has a lot of potential to be very good, and the location is convenient, the staff could really use some extra training, and I would not feel comfortable booking this hotel for our next trip in September.

We always get an upgrade to a corner room which is the way to go always as the views are spectacular, rooms fully stocked with nice amenities( ipod/iphone docks, stocked wine cooler, excellent toiletries) and the beds are so comfortable. This hotel used to be relatively affordable by Chicago standards until a write up in a travel magazine as one of the top new boutique hotels in the world and then the prices shot up, but around Christmas and during the winter season it is easy to get a rate of $89-100 per night. This is a modern hotel and if you are shy about possibly being seen in your room by the apartment right across the street then maybe this is not the place for you as the windows do afford views into your room all the way into the bathroom via the oversized shower. The only complaint i would have about this place is the restaurant in which breakfast is served in the morning is very expensive for what you get, but there are plenty of places around the area to get a cheap standard breakfast without paying couture prices. If you can wait until 10am you can always go right across the street to Bijans which is a great place for eats anytime and they serve until late at night. My last visit i did go up to the rooftop club, Sky Bar, and although it was during the day it seemed very musky and nothing special honestly although it is a reputed \"hot spot\" on the weekends.

While attending the Midwest Clinic in Chicago, I found a hidden gem, The Dana Hotel and Spa. From the very start, I was greeted by Ceasar at the door, with a large smile and a handshake I was welcomed to the hotel. Throughout my week stay, he never lost that smile, even in 10 degree weather. The other Doormen and Bellmen, all had the same manner about them, and always remembered me by name, this included Chris, T.J., Preston, and especially Stephen, who I now consider a good friend. After a long day at the convention and fighting the cold, we always made it a point to stop for a drink and something little to eat at the Aja restaurant and bar, where Todd the bartender would have our cocktail waiting upon our arrival daily. Drew the other bartender was also very professional and another good conversationalist. The manager Grant always approached to see how our day went, and to make sure we were enjoying ourselves during our stay there. We did have a fantastic breakfast each morning, and dinner a few times, ordering a steak that was out of this world, and sushi, which came in larger portions than I am used to. Also ask for the homemade SPICY sauce, a flavor you will never forget. The service was excellent provided by Andy, Asleigh, Natalya, and Angel. The Vertigo bar was a great nightclub, with dancing throughout the evening with every song having a great beat. The servers Kristie and Tara were fun, and Megge the manager does a fantastic job, hats off to her. The only problem I had the whole week was remedied immediately by Dan the building engineer when my key would not work for my room, due to the fact I erased the code by carrying next to my cell phone. The supervisors Jeff and Sherman did a super job of making sure everything was perfect from the chic rooms, to overseeing the staff, which gave us a wonderful reception every time we walked through the lobby. It was a pleasure meeting the entire Front desk staff, including Lindsey, Romeo, Eve, Jill and Joe. I would highly recommend this hotel when you stay in Chicago.

Valet was prompt and friendly. Free and reliable Wi-fi. Room service was 24-hours and food was very good and promptly delivered. Room was well-appointed, lovely honor bar selection and had great design finishes -- \"hardwood\" floors and bathroom fixtures in particular were great. However, this leads me to . . . Not so great: requested a high floor room (we had a corner) and got one on the 6th floor; it was occasionally noisy and the view was pretty bleh of the parking lot, 7-Eleven and a Container Store billboard. A/C was incredibly noisy and clattery when it came on ever 20 minutes. The safe drove us crazy -- we had to key in our code about 20 times before it would open; we wound up just shutting it unlocked. Bathroom vanity was coming apart a little at the seams, and the bathtub faucet (while v. cool looking) was not properly affixed to the wall. Shower curtain was one of those snap half-curtain things and the snap buttons had become loose, tearing the curtain in half every time you so much as brushed by it. Bathroom a touch small. The two hotel gift cards we got as part of the package erroneously had 1 cent each on them and we had to spend 15 minutes with the (nicest ever) hotel barista trying to figure out what the deal was before he comped our coffees and got the front desk to replace them -- again, service was mostly wonderful and warm. Only exception was breakfast on the last day: waitstaff were inexperienced and literally running around the dining room trying to cover everything, making the whole breakfast a little unsettling. But they were still very nice and kept apologizing about the wait times, and the food was very solid. Finally, we saw two in-room movies, and while we had no problems with the first one, the second one in HD (Iron Man 2) skipped and stuttered like a youtube video with a bad connection throughout until the last half-hour. Incredibly annoying. To your taste: the hotel entrance is small and shares space with the entrance to its rooftop bar (Vertigo) and a restaurant, so it has a little bit of a clubby/hip/chaotic feel, and the lobby is one story up (stairs or cool glass elevator); the elevators require key access for security reasons but is a little finicky. Closet is half-size. Overall, I really liked the staff and the design of the hotel, the entrance notwithstanding.

I wouldn't stay here if you wanted or expected lots of personal attention. Once we got into the room, it was excellent. Make sure to reserve a corner-king if you want those awesome views with floor-celing windows on 2 sides of the room. Shower and bathroom were very nice; yes, there is a clear window in the shower(with a curtin), and the bathroom door slides shut without a lock - so not a ton of privacy. Again, the hotel is extremely popular with the 25-35 crowd, if you are bit older/quieter, you might be put off. With the crowd, the hotel guests like to party. I could hear people above us and in the halls around 2am - but it wasn't horribly loud. But I found the room excellent, very comfortable and stylish without being overly modern. I highly recommend it for that $150-250 price-point room, for the same money I would never stay at a {Hyatt etc...} if i could stay here..but if you want that luxury/special feeling and you can afford $100-200 more a night, you'd probably like the Peninusla, Trump or Elysian more.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "mrelsted", "ReviewID": "UR76318573", "Content": "Location, location, location!

I literally spent weeks researching all of the possibilities with my wife being the one to decide since this was her birthday gift. It was a good call. The location is great but then any hotel in that area is well located. Easy walk to the lake, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, restaurants, etc.. If you're not in the mood to walk then places like Millenium Park are a cheap cab ride away. We stayed in a Corner King on the 17th floor. We arrived late morning and were pleased to find that our room was ready. It was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows around the whole perimeter of the room. The decor was very comtemporary and nicely appointed...it was exactly as advertised. Our one fear was that since we are fifty-something that the place would be too loud and cater to a younger alternative crowd. We are happy to announce that the atmosphere was calm, casual and sophisticated. The Vertigo lounge on the top floor was the only part that catered to the younger set. And that's fine. The hotel is a business and the twenty-somethings have money to spend so more power to the Dana. Plenty of piano bars in the area for us mature folk who have \"been there and done that\". The only criticisms I have are this. I am an early riser and my wife is a late sleeper. There is no common area in which to leave the room to sit and read the morning paper and sip a coffee. They give you coupons worth $10 towards breakfast each morning which is a great deal and the food is great. During our five day stay the service was a little sluggish but they were under staffed and those on duty poured their hearts out. The one really curious shortcoming of this property is its lack of ice. The hotel is not huge by Chicago standards but it is 25 floors. There is one ice machine in the whole place...on the 5th floor. Where ever we stay we enjoy having a cocktail in the room as we prepare for going to dinner. The first night we stayed a party in the banquet room depleted all of the ice. I had to take my ice bucket to the first floor and ask the bartender for ice. Not good. For the record the mini-bar with wine and beer was nice and very reasonably priced. Also, don't rely too heavily on the concierge service for restaurant recommendations. Our first lunch for Chicago style pizza was at one of their local favorites (Gino's) in which I paid $22 for a small pizza. It was good but not that good. Walk around, you'll figure it out. The Dana is a great upscale, boutique hotel. The people were nice and the property is warm and comfortable. Having taken note of the huge chain places like the Westin, Marriot, Sheraton, etc and their impersonal assembly line service I have absolutely no regrets about our stay at the Dana. Chicago is a fun place to visit and when we go back (and we will) we will stay at the Dana", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good deals available\u201d", "Author": "SixtyDays", "ReviewID": "UR73368147", "Content": "Got a very good weekend deal on quikbook.com for $110+tax per night.

We booked a corner king and it was a refreshing change from the norm. It had floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides with a good view (mostly of condos nearby). I have acrophobia but was able to enjoy it (we were on the 24th floor). I appreciated the inside non-glass elevators. The shower was interesting as it had glass on one side, which can be covered by an outside curtain for privacy (I guess newlyweds would enjoy watching each other shower). It had an overhead shower nozzle so you just stand under it. There is also a wand, if you wish to use it. The room was well-kept and very clean. It had a long desk of sorts that had the TV and lots of work space. The floor near the windows was nice hard wood. There were two curtains that can (and should) be drawn down for shading out the sun and for total privacy. The only problem we encountered was loud music Saturday night and I assume it was from Vertigo the rooftop lounge, which was two floors above us. This said, it also could have resulted from a wedding reception that took place there that night. Although the entire hotel is smoke-free, people are permitted to smoke at Vertigo, tending to ruin the fresh air policy. Some of this smoke finds its way down to some rooms, unfortunately. The location is great as it is two blocks West of Michigan Avenue and its mega-shopping opportunities. Check in and out were seamless and the lobby is on the second floor. This permits them to screen people coming and going. You have to scan your room key card in the elevator to get to your floor and occasionally this was a problem getting it read.

My first visit was for three nights, second stay for five. Depending on your specific needs, budget, and taste, The Dana can range from very good to fantastic. The location is a few blocks off the main drag but it's a very easy, safe, and quick walk to reach North Michigan Avenue or River North. Cabs are easily accessible at the front door and the \"El\" train and bus stops are within a 5 minute-or-so walk. The Dana was a newly built property buily a few years ago. It is modern, with a lot of exposed concrete and glass but still maintains a warm, Chicago-style loft feel with wood floors and touches of earthy colors throughout the hotel. There is an excellent spa, good restaurant (although too many better options out the front door), and a slightly-above-average continental breakfast included with all rooms. It would be great for younger or young-at-heart singles and couples. Not recommended for families or children due to privacy issues in all rooms and nightlife vibe when the sun goes down. The rooms: Very good, modern, Chicago-style design with partial wood floors, excellent desk/work space, sliding loft-style bathroom door, excellent spa-style bathroom with spacious rainfall shower, (One wall of the shower is glass exposed to the main bedroom area, which is really fun for some guests but maybe not-so-much if you are traveling with friends or family.) The rooms have excellent in-room amenities for this level/price of hotel. High quality music/TV systems, very good bed/linens, robes/slippers, toiletries, wine bar, and shockingly reasonably priced mini-bar/snacks. There is at least one floor-to-ceiling window offering standard to impressive city views. Excellent natural light in all rooms, although when needed there are blackout shades, if you want to sleep in or have privacy from the nearby buildings. I preferred the upgraded corner room during my second stay since it offered a little more space, two walls of floor-to-ceiling windows, better views, and a small private balcony. Be aware, no rooms other than the penthouse suites have bathtubs, the large spa rain-showers were the trade-off, I guess. There is also a fitness center and small computer area, although there is no pool and had to pay for wifi. Parking here as with all hotels in Chicago equals highway robbery. One area of the hotel that really disappointed this reviewer, was the super cheesy Vegas wanna-be roof top bar. I thought the staff, design, music, and skanky little cocktail waitress outfits were far too cheap and vulgar for this hotel. You can have a hip and swanky nightclub and still be sophisticated/classy. (Rooftop at The Wit hotel got this concept right and is worth the trip over this place.) Other than the free breakfast and spa worth consideration, skip the hotel outlets. In general I have found the service sufficient- never awful or rude but never particularly memorable. Overall, I find the Dana a very comfortable and stylish hotel with some great amenities and unique touches. If you can find a competetive rate, it's a good value and a more interesting experience compared with many of the standard corporate hotels in Chicago. Other comporable/stylish hotels in the area to consider and compare rates include The Wit, The Sofitel, The James, and The Polomar.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel I've booked at in a while!\u201d", "Author": "avemana1", "ReviewID": "UR66164337", "Content": "From the moment we walked in we had a great experience at the Dana.

They really do remember returning guests and responsive would be an understatement. The head concierge Tim made a dinner reservation for me at one of my favorite haunts, the Kinzie Chop House and teamed up with our server to send a special dessert. In all of my stays, I finally spent some real time at their Vertigo lounge. They've implemented a new VIP system that I was told I was among the first to try. Hot spots, especially in this town rise and fall quickly but over the years staying here, the lines for Vertigo has consistently been long. I got to bypass the line wrapping around the block. You can't access the lounge from the hotel floors but I suspect that all guests who stay will have this special access. The club itself is dark, ambient lighting, a great mix of music and seems to cater to urban professionals. I was just at Excaliber (what a dive) around the corner right before Vertigo and it was definitely more my speed. A good mix of twenty to forty something gelling well at Vertigo. A re-cap of the hotel. Sweeping city views, great technology in the rooms, an awesome shower and perhaps the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Ritz Carlton beds have nothing on this place.

The hotel is concrete construction which means almost no noise between the floors, but does create somewhat of university residence feel to the rooms. The ceilings are exposed concrete, which could be nice, except they seem a little low and it creates a cave-like feel to the space. The decor is eclectic and a bit busy with lots of textures. The rooftop bar, Vertigo, seems to be THE hotspot for the city at night. Line ups form from 11 pm onwards. If you want to see the view, go during the day when it's less overwhelmed. Overall, a nice place to stay and good value.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME\u201d", "Author": "CHKRaleigh", "ReviewID": "UR62806849", "Content": "You can try, but you will not find another hotel in Chicago that is better for the price.

The rooms aren't huge, but you have floor to ceiling windows, hardwood floors, nice desk center, great bathrooms (I'll address the shower in a bit). Our room even had a balcony. And the beds are SO comfy. Now, as far as the showers go- really neat! So, it's all glass and you can see into the room, but there is a curtain you can use if you would prefer more privacy. Rain shower head is nice too, but there is also a hand held kind in case that's not your thing. There also is a happening rooftop bar/club which we didn't go to, but as far as any potential noise factor- there wasn't one. All the rooms are quiet and very peaceful. Breakfast: the quality of the breakfast they serve is awesome. With that said, you'd better get there on the earlier side if you want to get in. Overall, we were pretty impressed.

I had found a great deal on Kayak for their Cozy King room. However when I arrived they let me see the Cozy King and the Corner King. You MUST go for the Corner King!!! I paid a little more to upgrade but WOW was it worth it. I would actually say my only negative to Dana is that the Cozy King, although it does have a balcony, is DARK and very small! If I had stayed in the Cozy King I would not be leaving such high reviews. I honestly couldn't stay in the Cozy King. 1 window which leads onto a standing balcony, BOOO! Now the Corner King was something entirely different...wrap around floor to ceiling windows, gorgeous bathroom with the most amazing rain shower!!! Seriously I was in Chicago Thursday Afternoon -Sat Afternoon, I must have taken 7-8 showers!! IT WAS THAT GOOD!!!! and very sexy with glass divider separating the shower from the bedroom and a curtain which could be drawn for private and pulled back for... well... uh... anyway. All the modern fixtures really made the room very stylish. Fancy sound system for your Ipod, LCD screen against the window so you're always looking at your magnificent view, great for checking out all the fancy condos across the way. The Roof Top Bar Vertigo was great too. part out doors and part indoors with a modern fire pit outside and robes to keep you warm. A lot of fun to people watch. Tim the Concierge is GREAT!

I quickly called the Spa, thinking that either a.) they would accept the coupon in good faith since I had made a genuine mistake, or b.) allow me to reschedule. Not only did they refuse to accept the coupon, but they called me back after I cancelled the appointment to inform me that I was being charged $100 in late fees! I nearly cried - I have now spent $90 on a coupon that I never want to use because the hotel was so rude to me, but I have also wasted $100 in late fees. I do understand it was my fault that I overlooked the small print, but in my experience, the hotel industry is much more accommodating. If the Dana is not supportive of We Give to Get, then it seems the underlying reason to work with We Give to Get, e.g. exposure/advertising and the appearance of a commitment to charity endeavors, has been defeated.

So we headed down to the bar on the ground floor, where we were charged $11 per glass of Bailey's which we thought was a bit steep.

(For those who don't know anything about Tablet, it's a program that allows you to get complimentary upgrades, late 4 p.m. checkout, etc. on hotels that are independent, more boutique/modern properties.) The Dana is labeled as a budget hotel on the Tablet site, but it's clearly not, except that you get a lotta bang for the buck. I was upgraded to some ridiculous corner suite that had floor-to-ceiling windows all around. The suite was probably 900 to 1000 sq .ft. and had a modern shower with a large rainforest head as well as a removable Waterpik-style one. All the bathroom products were top-notch (same ones that are used in the Borgata in Atlantic City, if that makes any difference), and the room was furnished in a very hip and modern decor. For couples, the shower and bathroom were visible from the bedroom, but you can pull a curtain for privacy. Unfortunately, the curtain is on the bedroom side, so if your partner is playful, you might find yourself being spied upon while sitting on the toilet. Cheeky, I guess... A nicely stocked wine refrigerator replaced the typically mundane mini-fridge, as well. Service at the hotel was good and unobtrusive, with check-in being one floor above street level. One hassle was that you had to use your room key to access the elevators, so you have to meet all guests downstairs in the lobby. The only other niggle is that the walls are thin, so it might be noisy if you're in a regular room. A suite is no issue...just close the bedroom door, and it's really quiet. I'd stay here again, but only if in a suite.

The staff is mostly young and very nice, helpful, going out of their way to help with whatever a guest needs. The attention to detail is amazing; so many little things are sure to put a smile on your face during your stay. This ranges from fortune cookies on your pillows to extremely fast and absolutely delicious room service to a great menu in the restaurant. The Dana has very original and unique decorations for different occasions. During my stay, Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day and Chinese New Year were the cause for a special menu and very tempting special offers (one of them being a bottle of Dom Perignon for $99!!). The rooms are very modern, perfectly clean, and my Cosy King room came with a breathtaking view of the buildings around the Dana. Checking in, I was asked about room preference and I inquired about a room as high up as possible; I was accommodated on the 22nd floor. In addition to the incredible staff and the wonderful architecture of the building, the Dana also offers a fantastic Asian restaurant as well as a very fancy rooftop bar, including a terrace. When I asked for ideas for a date with a very special lady, the staff went far beyond my wildest expectations, setting up the perfect night: - For starters, a table in their fancy rooftop bar, including champagne by the fire on the terrace (in February...they gave us furry blankets to keep warm) - A fantastic dinner in the restaurant with a bottle of bubbly sake (delicious!!) and plates of Asian food we could share - The best staff in the world who all knew our story and could not have been nicer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my special lady felt like she was a celebrity.

Wi-fi also included free. Service quite good - the service staff are a dash snooty, but helpful. Conceirge very helpful, too and available longer hours than normal. Christmas service was not lacking - they had full staff working and the restaurant offered snacks instead of fully closing. The rooftop bar wasn't bad, with some limited cocktails and drinks but a great outdoor area - shame we can't enjoy it in winter! It would be very cool in summer. The hotel had a nightly turndown service which we didn't request - they just did it. They would also lay fortune cookies on the pillow, and come past with ice. This kind of housekeeping you never see, which was great. The door staff were also nice and welcoming. The location is North State st - a walk to Michigan Ave and everything downtown Chicago has to offer. Only major minus - housekeeping knock every day at precisely 8am - very early!

The entire hotel is very contemporary and very pleasing to the eye. Very well designed and it added to our whole experience in Chicago. And that brings us to the staff. They couldn't have been more helpful. Jeff, Romeo and Lindsey offered us some of the best suggestions on places to eat and visit.

The food and service was incredible and it didn't take a huge chuck out of my wallet. All the other helpful suggestions from the Dana staff were right on.

To my surprise, one of my favorite jazz artists was performing that night. We went to see Patricia Barber and had the table right in front of her piano.

That's been said. And yes, there is some street noise, although I didn't get much hallway noise. But I haven't been to a hotel yet, in a big city, that didn't have some noise. That said; check-in was efficient and easy. The bags were taken to our room while we went into the bar to pay for a very overpriced drink. I mean, we ordered an Irish coffee and got charged $5.00 for the cup of coffee and then $6.00 for the shot...anyway...it is a hotel bar. Up to the room, nicely appointed. The bathroom is large with a beautiful shower (we were in a double queen room - our shower had only one head, our friends were in a Comfort King room - they had like water coming from every direction) - nice comfy robes to wear too. The hair-dryer was feeble...but eventually did the job. The biggest problem with the hotel is the inconsistency. The first night the maid turned down the beds and pulled the shades, but neglected to pull the blackout shades; an important feature when you are in an east facing room...and we didn't know to do it ourselves. The second night, they were pulled, but the maid threw the pillows on the chair next to them so there was a nice crack for that sun to peek through, right into my friends eyes. A nice touch is that they give you coupons for a made to order breakfast in their downstairs restaurant - valued at $15.00. So in the morning we went downstairs for breakfast...it was busy...we waited...once we sat...we waited...and waited...can someone PLEASE bring us some coffee???? Oh, sure...we waited...and waited...can we say, the service was slow? Yes, yes we can. The food was mostly good; again a couple of missteps and inconstancies; I assume the kitchen makes their poached eggs in advance, using the method of putting the egg into an ice bath to hold it until service and then putting it into hot water to warm and finish cooking; it's an important step, that putting it back into hot water; when it's not done, the egg is a cold as ice. As was the eggs on my friend's Eggs Benedict. However, the poached eggs on my other friends plate were hot. The second morning was no better than the first on service...it was slow, and worse, it's like they are ignoring you. They don't even make eye contact. That morning I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy...let me say this...clearly...DON'T...it's not Biscuits and Gravy, it's a biscuit in some white stuff with some slices of sausage and mushrooms...that's just not right.

I know this sounds ridiculous, but they are the single worst thing about this hotel. The elevators shot past our floor on a regular basis, as we weren't fast enough on the trigger with our key cards. What's the point of every guest having to insert their card to select their floor when, if they were really intent on causing mayhem on a floor where they don't belong, they could just walk up or down the stair shaft to another floor anyway?! Hotel management seriously need to ditch the card system - it's infuriating. We met a disabled guest with a walking aid, riding up and down the elevator for ages, trying in vain to reach his floor. Finding a way to enter the rooftop bar was rather a quest, as you cannot go there directly from the guest elevators. You have to go via security, even to be allowed in to the special elevator up to the bar. In any other hotel with a rooftop bar, I'd have been up there several times, maybe even in the daytime, checking out the view. Not a chance with this one. When we did finally make it up there, all the areas near the windows were sectioned off for private parties anyway.

Location - Close to the subway/transit but easy enough to walk pretty much anywhere if you have the time and energy to do it. We purchased 72 hour transit passes for $14 and they were well worth it. Rooms - We had a Comfy King, so it was a bit small, but this did not in any way negatively impact our stay. We had a small balcony overlooking State Street , which was great and the entire balcony consisted of huge windows. The decor was ultra-modern, which is very much our style. If you don't like modern you won't like this room. The room had a large flat screen TV, a great sound system and a single serve coffee maker which made great coffee. There was a well stocked honour bar which I thought was quite reasonably priced. Bedding and linens were top-notch. The glass walled shower (which can be visible to the sleeping area if you want - we always had the curtain drawn) and vanity area were beautiful.

All the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Dining - We only ate breakfast at the hotel. $15 vouchers are provided for each morning of your stay, for each person. I found the prices to be very reasonable and between the 2 of us, we never exceeded the $30. Free coffee was available at the lobby bar so that helped lessen the breakfast bill. I usually had a coffee (or 2) in my room as soon as I woke up. As one other poster mentioned, the pancakes are too large, but they made for a great picture. I had the grilled PB&J, which was very nice, and a fresh fruit smoothie and toast. I always found it to be more than enough food. My friend usually had some type of egg dish and was always happy with her meal. Facilities - We didn't use the spa, but checked out the gym.

There were a few issues - when we booked our hotel it said it included a free continental breakfast. The first morning we asked about breakfast and were directed to the Aja restaurant. We were given a regular menu and paid for our breakfast. The next morning we asked again about the continental breakfast and were told that they had \"discontinued\" the continental breakfast but should have been given vouchers at the front desk for those who had booked with the free breakfast option. She gave us a voucher for breakfast that morning and compted us for the breakfast we had paid for the day before. All in all, huge points for excellent customer service. The breakfast at the hotel was okay. I found it quite heavy and greasy- and don't order the pancakes - they are the size of the table - as we noticed some other hotel guests had ordered and could barely eat half of it. The rooms were small but well appointed. there were robes and slippers - nice touch. And they have a real hairdryer that is not attached to the wall - huge bonus! Our room did not have a window but rather a small balcony. Cute. The noise from the hallway can be heard into the bedroom so we ended up stuffing a towel under the door every night.

We foresake our typical choice of staying at the Stellar Burnham Hotel, for Dana. We found our stay disappointing. Perhaps it's the economy or the staff was too tired from the weekend revellers and didn't give much attention to those staying there on a Sunday night. We're not fussy travellers and don't need much apart from courteous, competent service. We didn't have that experience at the Dana. I'll highlight some of the good and bad points we experienced. -- Positives: Awesome bed. Comfortable room: we have an asian inspired, cotemporary waterfront condo and were pleased with the decor. --Negatives: Check-in staff seemed like they were trying to replicate a cool, youthful, aloof urban energy. It came off as apathetic. One got the feeling that they were doing this job until they went to their \"real jobs\" later on. Does this place really have a spa? Every time I have ever checked into a hotel that has a spa ... they at least tell you a little about it. This is true whether I have stayed at destination spa locations, or hotels where the spa is an amenity for a predominantly business clientele. -- Aja Steak: was pleased with the subbtle Hawaiian flair in the menu. Fish was good quality. I think we got left-over rice on our maki, because it was terrible. Service was lower than average. Perhaps we got the Sunday, C level staff. They were poorly trained ....and I almost felt like piping up \" ummmm ...are there any adults running this place?\" We have travelled internationally and stayed at numerous hotels. My basic rule is that if a place has an expensive, diverse selection of sakis and wines with limited descriptors; they should have someone on staff to discuss the selections. They didn't that night. Worse still, we had a flaky waitress who did not even seem to understand the qualitative distinctions between the food & drink selections on the menu. In an effort to be friendly/knowledgeable she tried to pipe in how did not know much about sakes ... but she loved the junmai daiginjo sakes. Her comment would have been acceptable if she knew what she was talking about (we are avid sake drinkers); but it's like someone who knows nothing about the varied construction & mechanisms in watches saying how they love the quality and mastery of how Cartier watches are built. Next time, we'll stick to the Burnham Hotel. Kimpton just gets how to do boutique hotels, and they have shown that prowess nationally and internationally.

What I liked: Detail, details, details. They definitely get kudos for keeping the needs of a traveler in mind. The bed, bedding, pillows and sheets were very soft and relaxing. I loved the hardwood floor. The bathroom shower has a glass wall that looks out to the room and has a rainfall showerhead. They have a real hair dryer in the bathroom, not the cheap ones attached to the wall of many hotels. (Ladies, you know what I mean.) Very nice spa quality toiletries, cotton balls, Q-tips, bath robes, slippers and extra towels. Mini bar is stocked very nicely along with a good selection of condiments: dried fruits, snacks, etc. My room also had an MP3 connection so I listened to my ipod in the room. Flat screen TV, coffee maker and a large desk allowing me much needed work space. I had dinner at the hotel restaurant ajasteak and was very pleased with the quality of food and service. Their prime beef carpaccio is one of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had and the maki roll portions are very generous. After dinner, when I went back to my room, they had provided a turn-down service and left a couple of their chocolate dipped fortune cookies on the bed. Yum. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to check out vertigo sky lounge, but heard it was great . Areas needing improvements: For all the right they did, there were two things that I found very frustrating. First is the temperature of the room. I had the thermostat set to 60 in hopes of keeping the room cool! (I generally like the room temp in the low 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.) Despite lowering it, the room still got very warm at times. It almost felt like the AC had a mind of its own and worked great at times then stop working all together. Second, I was very excited to see the self check-in machines by the front desk thinking I can check-in with my airline and print the boarding pass early. Well, it recognized my flight itineraries but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t print the boarding pass. Oh well. Overall, a great hotel with friendly staff.

I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews. I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests. 1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway. 2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend. 3. If possible, an upper level room with a view. Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re booked, too bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, their response was again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with a refrigerator, too bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend. Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again. POSITIVES 1. Location. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 You are right in the middle of all of it. 2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place. 3. Shower. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about as nice of a hotel bathroom as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to find. 4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good. 5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine. NEGATIVES 1. Front desk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting. 2. Elevator. This might sound like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being picky, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done because every single person on the elevator has to do it in order to select your floor. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly annoying and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off. 3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hotel for you. 4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not young by any means and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter. 5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be impressed.

It's location is perfect for travel from the airport via the subway/El, and we walked to shopping, restaurants, bars, and tourist spots from there. The rooms are very modern and stylish, with a few design issues that might make some people uncomfortable. Our room had great ceiling to floor windows with sun shade panels and blackout panels behind those. Because each shade is a panel, you do have some space between each one, which allowed light to come through. If you need a completely dark room to sleep, you might have an issue. We heard some noise on Saturday night, and our room was right in front of the elevators, so we sometimes heard people getting on and off, but nothing was too disturbing. As far as the \"famous\" glass shower window, there is plenty of privacy with the curtain drawn. However, if someone uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light illuminates the rest of the bedroom. Perhaps a blackout shade there would be more appropriate. The shower enclosure only has small a glass wall, and the bathroom floor can get a bit wet as a result. The bed was very comfy. We really enjoyed the mini-bar selections and wine selections, and all had reasonable prices. We went up to the Vertigo Lounge for a little bit, and while we aren't clubby people, it had a good vibe and was very busy. The view is awesome, and there is a nice outdoor area.

On the other side of the spectrum, the hotel also has a Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Whole Foods and Walgreens within one block of the hotel which is great for snacks, meals on the go and anything else you may have left behind. My room was extremely spacious and had a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was huge with great amenities (larger than usual shampoo, conditioner etc.). Big fluffy towels too. It took me a couple of days to realize that my room was handicapped accessible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which explained why there was no dividing ledge between the bathroom and shower, and a pull down bar next to the toilet. It also explained why the closet armoire was very low to the ground. However the room still appeared cozy and chic which is different from many handicap accessible rooms where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in the past. The hotel offered nightly turndown service with chocolate covered fortune cookies. The service included pulling down the shades and room darkeners which is key because there is a apartment building directly across with a direct view into your room. Be careful getting dressed because I could see everything that the apartment dwellers were doing, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing that they could see me as well. My only complaint with the hotel is that the walls were extremely thin. I had a toddler and baby in the room next to me for my entire stay and believe me when I say that I heard every cry.

I travel to Chicago several times a year and been trying to find a place this is not a huge faceless chain but not so small to miss good amenities in the area I need to be. In short, the Dana is the place. The staff is very attentive and pleasant and the modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor is nice to look at without sacrificing the needs of the business traveler. I had great views from the 18th floor with the balcony. A previous reviewer mentioned the small size of the balcony but I thought it was great place to just step outside, get some fresh air, enjoy the view and listen to the sounds of the church bells/song a few blocks away. The wine chiller/mini bar is great! The selection was good and the rates were reasonable for a full bottle of wine in your room. It was nice to be able to open and drink half and save the other half for the next night. As for the shower with the full glass into the bed area, it was a bit unnerving at first but I got over it when I realized there was both a hand-held shower head AND a rain shower above. The effective use of space and dual use of the bathroom/closet door was a great design element. Not to mention the great B&W stereo with the iPod/Phone dock. I did not realize until the second day you can get the television to play through the cool stereo for better sound. I was out of the hotel too early most days to enjoy the breakfast but my travel mate said it was very good and a bit above the usual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast fare. The only issue I had was rude and inconsiderate neighbors across the hall. The doors are solid but with a big gap at the bottom of the door that allowed the screaming/laughing/crying of the women across the hall to filter into the room. Understand, they felt the need to shout at each other when one was standing in their doorway on several occasions. I ended up stuffing the big fluffy bath mat into the gap and all was well. Not sure what their deal was but thankfully they left after a day or so and the rest of my stay was quiet. In the area there are plenty of big chain boring assembly line hotels to stay at greater cost than the Dana. If you want to be one of a thousand, by all means stay there. If you want a personal experience that is about more than just your big chain hotel points, then check out the Dana! All in all, the Dana was a great place to stay with d\u00c3\u00a9cor, staff and amenities I would expect at much pricier places without half the style of this great find. I will definitely be making the Dana my new place to stay in Chicago! HINT: The doors to rooms ending in \"-08\" and \"-10\" are directly across from the elevators.

We found the dana hotel. I thought it was a bit pricey, but my sister thought that to stay in a great downtown location we might have to pay to play. So she booked two rooms online, one for her and her hubby and one for my hubby and I. Our stay was on a Friday through Sunday. We also, booked a couples massage. After making the reservation, my sister called the next day to make sure the hotel got the resevation and to see about the spa accomadations. Well, to our surprise, the spa did not have any openings for our stay. Although the computer excepted our reservations for spa services. We asked the staff to try to fix that situation. We told the concierge that we were all celebrating our anniversary and we would like to know if the hotel did anything special for special occasions. The hotel assured us that they would do something special. Well, to make a long story short. The hotel did nothing special. We had to remind the front desk on Saturday evening that whatever the hotel was planning, that our check out was the next day. My sister told the front desk clerk that she did not drink champange and if the hotel was going to give that out, do not send that. An hour later, my sister called me in my room and told me that room service just sent them champagne and strawberries and wanted to know if we got any. Well, we did not. I called the concierge desk, and no one answered. I left a message. In the morning there was a letter along with our bill. In short the hotel appolgized that they forgot about our anniversary and gave us free breakfast in bed. They also comp one nights stay. Wow, was my reaction. I was pretty happy about that. Well, the story is not over. The next day, while I was at work my husband called me and asked what was going on with our money. He wanted me to check our bank account. I checked it and to my surprise, not only was the monies taken out for our stay but an additional $600.00 dollars was taken out. Because of that, it caused my account to be overdrawn. I of course was in shock. I called the hotel and asked to explain the charges. They could not. They said they do not have charges taken out for the $600. Over and over the Dana claimed that there could not be any such charges. I made a copy of my account and faxed it to the hotel. I had to call my bank on Monday and had them to cancel the charges. My bank did, fortunately. However,the Dana still did not own the costly mistake. When I called to talk to managment, no one was hardly ever available to talk to me about what had happened.

We waited on average of 3 minutes for an elevator and at one point had a 10 minute wait before deciding to take the stairs. And to use the elevator (even going down to the lobby from your room) you had to swipe your key card before pressing the button. I'm all about hotel security, but this is just overkill. At night when the hotel restaurant is in full force there is an unpleasant fish odor throughout the hotel lobby and ground level areas. As for the rooms, they are small even for Chicago standards. The bathrooms offer little in the way of privacy. I will admit having glass walls in the showers provides opportunities for \"fun\" times, but the sliding door (that never stays closed) and exterior shower curtain don't provide the proper privacy for actually USING the bathroom.

We traveled to Chicago for a long weekend get away, and were looking forward to relaxation. We'll start by saying that we enjoyed many aspects of the hotel, though had a few minor issues. We checked in on Friday and requested an upper level room, hoping for nice views. We were placed on the 24th (of 26) floor, in a nicely appointed room. The bed was quite comfortable, had a plush down comforter and down pillows. The i-pod speaker system was very convenient, and definitely was a nice addition. The shower was big enough for two adults, and the bathroom as a whole was very nice. Friday night, both my husband and I were quite tired after a long work week, and wanted to rest and go to bed early. At approximately 9 pm, we began hearing rather loud, thumping bass music. We waited several hours, attempting to determine where the sound was coming from?! At 11 pm, the bass continued to be quite loud and slightly disrupting when attempting to fall asleep. My husband called down to the front desk reporting the noise and was advised they would further investigate. At 11:30, the same music continued, and we called down to the front desk again. Finally, at 12:15, my husband went in search of where the sound was coming from. At that point, he realized there was a night club on the 26th (top) floor, with music that could be heard several floors down. He requested a room transfer, and we moved (at 1 am) to the 12th floor, where it was thankfully quiet. The hotel did give us a complimentary bottle of wine, which was a nice compensation. Saturday night, many night club patrons were also in the hotel elevators, and the music was again noted to be loud on the upper floors. So, a suggestion may be to avoid the upper level rooms if you are a light sleeper, or want a quiet room atmosphere.

We loved our time in Chicago and most of the things about our stay at the Dana. The location is AWESOME. You are 3 blocks from the Mag Mile, 3 blocks from the North River gallery district, 20 minute walk to Milennium Park and the Art Institute, 10 minutes from the Merchandise Mart, 1 minute from Whole Foods, lots of public transit options. The rooms are modern and nicely furnished, though on the small side. The beds are fantastic - large and comfortable with great linens. The shower is also amazing with great showerheads (i want to get one for my house!) but it is also VERY close to the bed, with a glass wall and a curtain controlled by the person outside of the bathroom. I found this strange, particulary since you can see the whole bathroom through that wall. (I dont know about you, but I like to do my business in private) The staff is very friendly, and if we needed anything they were very accomodating. However, I like to go in and out kinda quietly and I found their inquires a tad much - I think we got asked how our stay was going at least 7 times the first day. Which isnt a bad thing necessarily, just depends on your preference. One last complaint - the hotel was noisy. I dont mind the city noise or the traffic, but the noise inside the hotel was grating. Perhaps it was poor luck that we stayed next to a couple of yahoos who loved to play their loud bass music at 1am and go in and out of their rooms 18 times an hour, but something about the hotel doesnt seem to cushion the noise well. You can hear a door closing from down the hall (those doors are [--] loud!). I dont want to end on a bad note because I really did have a good time. They leave you cookies each night. The bathrobes and slippers are very nice. The coffee (Green Mountain) is free and good quality and is ready in about 3 minutes. It's a good place to stay, but I wouldnt spend $300 a night to stay there. (Here is a tip: I found a good rate on travelocity but then called the hotel and they gave me their best rate guarantee discount of 10%, so we ended up staying for $170 a night which was well worth it).", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201c5 stars for the Dana Hotel & Spa!\u201d", "Author": "efrieds", "ReviewID": "UR18243703", "Content": "I spent last weekend at the Dana Hotel & Spa with my mom and sisters for a glorious birthday weekend. The rooms were immaculate and the staff was impeccable. Being that it was a new hotel, I wasn't sure if they would have everything in tip top shape but I have to say, I was incredibly impressed. We used many amenities at the hotel including the work out room, spa and restaurant. The spa was a last minute decision because it was raining out and we opted to stay in. We had facials and massages and all were absolutely luxurious. We felt like we were staying at a five star hotel. If you stay there, make sure to try the Mr. Kites candy that they keep in the room in case you are hungry. MMMMM delicious and NOT overpriced for minibar food! Oh and the pillows were so soft and fluffy!! Look out, you may not want to leave your bed!!

My wife found this hotel while searching online. I walked over at lunch and received a full tour of the rooms and spa from the Sales Manager. This is a brand new hotel that opened a month ago, and is still in the midst of being finished. It is very modern and has some neat amenities in the room. It is a great location for the out of towners who are looking to shop and do the touristy activities. From the moment we arrived through the time we left, we were treated like king and queen. Patrick the bellhop took care of us the second we walked out of the car. We needed to leave the car downstairs as we checked in (no problem). We were give a corner room, number 812 that had a balcony facing north and ceiling to floor windows. The rooms have a modern feel and from what I understand our built form recycled material, including wood floors etc... There is a shower that get this, actually has great water pressure and a window that allows you to watch TV :). The bed was super comfy and the blackout shades allowed us to sleep in! We did not have a chance to visit the bar or restaurant as we had other plans, but it was hopping when we came back at midnight. My guess is that the locals are going to start making this a hot spot. We also did not go to the spa, although it looked pretty nice when I toured it (a lot of tile and things made form recycled materials). For $250, the value was supreme and the service was impeccable.

Cons: Some of the exciting design details tried too hard and didn't work that well in practice; poor sound-proofing both to hallway and street. Biggest problem at the time of our visit was that the hotel is so spanking new (about 1 month old) that the chemical fumes from paint, carpets, furniture etc. were overwhelming and caused us to check out prematurely after just the first night. Expect the fumes problem will be solved in time, although with A/C as only source of air circulation, it may take a while.
