Truth be said I was not expecting much, as there are many 4 star hotels in Dubai which turn out to be run-down dumps. On my arival, all staff seemed friendly and welcoming, the lobby area did not impress me much it looked like a large corridor. The check in process (prepaid with booking.com) was fast, and we where informed that our rooms where upgraded, which was something I heard before from other hotels and turns out usually that it would just have a bigger bed, an extra chair or something insignificant. In this case however it meant I was moved to a 1 bedroom apartment which ad 2 full bathroom a large sitting area with an LCD and a decent size bedroom (I didn't mind it at all). However!! I painfully discovered when I returned from my meetings around 10pm that my room is directly over the night club... this I did mind. I went to the reception and I explained I did ask for the free music (Indian music) all night, he informed that the hotel was full but he will try to get me a room. I waited some 20 mins and a bell boy came to escort me to my new room which turned out to be another 1 br apt directly over the last one. And although I could still hear the music just not as loud I surrendered to the fact as I was too tired to argue.

Since I had seen a 'mixed' opinions on this website and was traveling with a family of five adults [including an old lady of 78], was a bit apprehensive. But what a pleasant experience it turned out to be. Very comfortable rooms - we were given the rooms on the third floor with a view towards the New Gold Souk. What impressed most was the house keeping [Phillipino room boy?], every day the towels and sheets were changed - probably a luxury even in European and American hotels. Our hotel booking was on bed and breakfast basis. The breakfast [from 7 to 10 am ] on offer for all the four days we spent, was excellent and whole some. A wide variety of choices with plenty of fruits and friendly staff. Uttappams, Masala dosas, puries and somosas if you care for Indian food. Though, not very close to any major shopping malls, [Dubai Mall is 18.50 dhms from the hotel] taxis are available all the time at the hotel entrance. By the way, most of the taxi drivers are either Pakistanis or Indians and very friendly. Could not help imagining that if India and Pakistanis can co exist and help the tourism and other industries in Dubai to such great heights, we can achieve a lot if the same is applied in these countries [politicians - are you listening?] With a helpful Melisa at the reception desk and ever smiling bellboy Kirk, it was a sheer pleasure staying in Country Club Hotel. What we missed by default, probably is the spa and Kerala ayurvedic massages being offered at 50% concession to hotel room guests. By the way, book on line for better rates and take a cab from outside. If you believe in morning walks, take the route towards Al Karama.

The hotel is located on the Port Rashid Road that can be easily accessed from the Al Mina Road as well. If you want to walk to an attraction or a shopping area then this is not the hotel for you. However, many areas in Bur Dubai, Karama, Deira can be easily accessed with a short taxi ride. The entrance to the hotel from the main road itself looked bit confused with couple of slip roads and then an untreated passage to the hotel car park. The car park itself is an open land which was sandy and dusty. Other vehicles and taxis travel through this to reach construction sites and other hotels I think. But you will always find a place to park which is a good thing. The double room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was also good size and neat. There were one king size double bed, two sofa chairs, a small table, another chair, kettle and tea making facility, safe, mini bar, plenty of storage and wardrobe space, bathroom slippers, etc as one would expect from such a hotel. Bedding and pillows were comfortable. Extra pillows and sheet were also available. Beds done and towels changed every day. BUT, the main issue we had was that the room smelled of cigarette smoke. So make sure you specifically ask for a \u2018non-smoking\u2019 room. We didn\u2019t opt for the breakfast option so can\u2019t comment on that. Had dinner at the Qureshis kebab & kurry restaurant. There was an Indian band singing kind of old Hindi songs. The food, though over priced, was good if not the best. Service was a bit slow but otherwise ok. There is a left luggage facility but the storage space allocated for a hotel of this size was very very small. Just few bags will fit in there. So they may even keep your bags near the travel desk next to the hotel entrance as they did in our case. Hotel staff were helpful when approached but don\u2019t expect all the staff to throw smile at you or say hello. The walk to the elevator area is not so nice in my opinion. There is a restaurant and couple of bars near the elevator area and also the space in front of the lift is used for special buffet lunch occasions. Wifi access is available but there is a cost for that. We had other means so didn\u2019t use the hotel\u2019s. The reservation desk may provide some deals on this along with the room booking. So if you are thinking of using the hotel internet option then please email and deal with the reservation desk beforehand. Though the stay was ok, compared to hotels with similar facilities and standard in Europe, I don\u2019t think it is worth of the 4 star status. Will I stay here again?

Considering it's Ramadan at the moment and the hotel is dead - the staff still get irritated by the smallest request or question because they just don't want to do anything to make your stay pleasant. They almost snarl at you everytime you ask them something! * The food is outrageously expensive and mostly inedible - we went into the Radisson Blu at Deira Creek and the food and alcohol was cheaper and fantastic! * If you can get onto the internet it's intermittant. * If you request a non-smoking room they will always try to put you into a smoking room (so just jump up and down a little and they will give in - they try it every single time!! However, on this occasion they also put us into standard twin rooms when we booked delux doubles just for their own amusement) * The noise from the extremely smokey bar downstairs will keep you awake all night - so don't forget the earplugs! * The reception staff and duty managers have to be the most obnoxious people I have ever come across in the hospitality industry (the waiting staff and cleaners are actually quite nice) * Management don't seem to give a toss if you're having a nice stay (they don't believe in the \"customer is always right\" theory) * We asked for a recommendation for a hotel close by that was serving food and alcohol (as it's ramadan there weren't many), they put us in a taxi and told the driver where to take us. It was only when we realised that he seemed to be driving for an extremely long time we asked where he was taking us and turns out we were heading for an expensive resort (Jumeirah Meridan) that was half an hour away!! We later worked out that they get a kick back from that resort as they also send guests there to use their beach (we only found that out when we went to use the pool and it was closed!). * The mini bar snacks are all out of date and overpriced - if you can even get the staff to top it up (mine was only done 2 out of 5 mornings on this trip) * There is NOTHING close to this hotel. If you want to do anything at all you need to get a taxi - yes, I know that the taxis are cheap but there are other areas you can stay where you can walk to other facilities that are close by.

Each of them never failed to say 'morning, sir', 'afternoon, sir' or similar whenever encountered. Similarly, in the very nice health club they were falling over themselves to offer me a towel, point me in the direction of the showers or even wipe my sweat off the treadmill when I finished my workout! The pool on the roof is also very nice - long enough to do lengths plus space for sunbathers too. I was lucky enough to get a room upgrade owing to my field of employment (travel industry) so I can't comment on the value for money of a basic room. Needless to say, my room was very large and pleasant. Overall, I would recommend this hotel as a safe bet although it is only a mid-range hotel so not likely to blow your socks off in a 5-star sense.
