We thought of a 5 star hotel, but it was a little less than a 4 star! We had 4 rooms and room service showed one magic of terrible service for each day after day! First day there was no tooth brush in 2 rooms, the other day the face towels were omitted in my room, another day we left our room in the morning by the need for cleaning sign at the door, but when we came back in the evening the sign was still hanged outside and no sign of cleaning could be seen inside!! But on the other hand, they had good-tempered personnel, nice pool, fair beakfast place with not so much different options in dishes, just acceptable. The best part was the short distance from Taqsim square, but the worst part was Dolapdere street where the hotel is located and all around you were full of car repair shops!

We felt safe as there was plenty of professional english speaking staff, including security, and two great concierges, a lady whose name I forget and Anil. They helped us with our travel arrangements to Cappadocia and showed us the authentic restaurants and local bars worth visiting. It was a fairly new hotel but yet didn't show any signs of disorganization. The beds were so comfortable and the rain shower head was so nice! The room was big with a beautiful distant view of the city, will the necessary amenities such as coffee, tea, hair dryer, etc. Just one small thing, the wifi connection in our room was not strong enough for my android phone whereas my friend's worked fine. I had to go into the sitting area in our hallway or down to the lobby to use the internet. It was a short walk to the main square and, although at night the area seemed a bit sketchy, it was perfectly safe.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNever stay here - terrible location\u201d", "Author": "AndrewJ167", "ReviewID": "UR110401235", "Content": "Of course, the offering is entirely consistent and what you would expect of Crowne Plaza. The bedrooms are comfortable - though mostly inward facing and dark. The beds and pilows are extremely comfortable. Service is fine, with some staff having english. But this hotel is in a terrible area - on a road - a very steep hill - which is entirely motor repair shops. You can only get anywhere by taxi. The taxis mostly don't know how to get to the hotel. One taxi driver refused us a ride 'very bad area, very bad people'. Clearly the hotel has very low occupancy. What joker in IHG management put together the deal which took this hotel into the IHG portoflio? It's a bad mark against the brand and against IHG.

Everything clean and new. Location - the street it is in is not a tourist street. So 10-15 min walk to Taksim sqr but it is a steep walk of 150m to the main road. Good location with taxi (5 to 10 turkish lira) no problem, to main places . No facilitating shops outside the hotel. want something then need to walk the steep road to the main road or take taxi. Service and facilities - hotel staff is very nice and mostly speak good English. Don't get advise from the concierge, he only thinks about is commission. free wifi throughout the hotel although some locations week signal. nice swim pool and gym, restaurant and seating areas. Overall very nice hotel. Room - we where upgraded, I don't know from what to the Club floor. the room is with 2 double beds. It is everything you expect from a good room of 4 or 5 star hotel. Only things was in the TV system, speciality built for hotels, there were no movies loaded and no music loaded into the special channels. tv channels are in turkish and you also get the main news channels in English. Maybe with time it will be sorted. 2 of us came for an exhibition at the expo cnr next to the airport. 30-40 min drive and about 50 lira. hotel cost 200 euro a night with breaky. not cheap but then the other hotels are not cheap too. If you come on business great.
