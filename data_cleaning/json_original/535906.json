{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quaint Beijing courtyard hotel at a good price I was attracted to the Zhongtang Hotel by the combination of location and price. I chose the least expensive room in the hotel and got a pretty good deal for the price.Con: Hard for taxi driviers to find. The cheapest rooms are very small (although certainly manageable), shower is in the middle of the bathroom, Japanese style (but no problem with having hot water). My room was just off the lobby so noisy at nght. but only two singles off the lobby. I think that the higher priced rooms are MUCH quieter since they are away from the street and around traditional courtyards.Pro: PRICE (less than US$100 per night), free internet in the lobby, full breakfast, pleasant staff with good English, clean linen, convenient location (and will become more convenient when a new subway line runs down Xisi Beidajie).If I stay here again I will rent a more expensive room", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR704125293", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Feistygal"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d535906-r15827087-Zhong_Xie-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "535906", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
