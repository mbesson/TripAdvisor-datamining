{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel The Best Western President lies just outside the city walls of the old town of Prato. I had business in Prato but my wife went sightseeing in Firenze easily (20 minutes on the train, train every 15 minutes and 3.40 euros return!) Prato was a lovely town. Not being on the tourist circuit it was friendly and has quite an ethnically mixed population. We had some great food there so do think about it as an alternative to staying in Firenze.The hotel has very large rooms which are comfortable and clean. Breakfast was well above average for Italy and served by the most cheerful waitress I have ever come across. Reception staff were informative and helpful. There is a supermarket handy.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR764696471", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Brunlea"}, {"Content": "I'd go back The rooms were massive!!! We had both suitcases open and on the floor, and we still had space to move around. The room had a fridge, and a safe, and big windows!! The bathroom had a bidet in it. . . and the shower was clean with minimal mould. Weird shower design, not gross weird, just different. All in all, it wasn't bad. The breakfast was good, and it was right across the street from a supermarket. Wasn't bad!!", "Date": "Sep 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR553796732", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travelingdiva22"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d203021-r8712332-Best_Western_Hotel_President-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "203021", "Price": "$127"}}
