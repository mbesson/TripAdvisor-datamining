{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Looking old now Our fifth visit to the Rama and sadly our last. We first stayed at the RG in 1999 and nothings really changed since that time. The hotel is in badly need of a refurbishment. The staff, many of whom have been there a lot of years are like the hotel.The once excellent restaurant has sadly been transformed into a 'sports bar' with two massive screens, catering for the hordes of Aussies who seem to have emigrated from Kuta to Legian.The price of $55 was just not worth it. Look elsewhere for better deals.", "Date": "Feb 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR949994083", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sloppychops"}, {"Content": "Friendly staff, worthy budget hotel.

Staff were friendly in this small streetside hotel however I feel that much great value for money can be found in Legian.The room decor is late 80's with minor updates, the air conditioner unit was very old and very loud during the night. I would look at some of the three star resorts along the beach before booking here, for a few dollars more we found beachside resorts such as Puri Raja and the Melasti which were right on the beach this hotel is a 5 minute walk.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR553380105", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "howheavyizthat"}, {"Content": "In need of upgrading We booked this hotel via its website and the pictures were attractive. Although the location is good but the overall look of the hotel is a bit dated. The pool is small and the facilites were limited. We would have been better of at its sister hotel the ramayana at kuta. The rooms were ok but the sink was in the room and not in the bathroom which we did not like. Well, we didnt spend a whole lot of time in the bathroom tho'. One thing i appreciate was the staff. They were nice and freindly. We paid 58USD for the room and i dont think it was worth it. If it was 45USD, maybe it would have been suitable. My advice is - it time for a renovation!!!", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR368145208", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Syedfadzil"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel Great Staff. We stay at Rama Garden Hotel everytime we go to Bali this trip being our 7th or 8th time and we quite often meet up with people there that we have met previously that like us, return to this hotel. Its great to go back and see the same staff after all these years. We are treated like family from the moment we arrive nothing is too much trouble for them. It is a small hotel, very homely atmosphere, its no 5 star hotel but is very clean and comfortable and close to beach, shopping and restaurants. Their food is fantastic and so are their staff. They have good security and you feel very safe there. You have to go past front desk and security to gain access to your room and if anyone comes who is not a resident they are not allowed through with out being accompanied by a staff member. We have looked at many other hotels in Bali over the years but always come back to Rama Garden and always will.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR362441320", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "krayzee1"}, {"Content": "great hotel and the best location A great budget hotel we have stayed at many times.
