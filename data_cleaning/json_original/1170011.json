{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great service, hip decor, fantastic in-room amenities for the price at Adagio I booked Hotel Adagio through the Joie de Vivre membership program (which is free and gets you a better deal, I find). It was a deal at $130 per night for a King Executive room (especially on New Year's Eve). Service was fantastic, from the doorman to the concierge to the bellhop. We arrived in our room before the bellhop came up with our bags and received a call from the front desk asking if we'd like an upgrade to a bigger room because the concierge noticed I had a lot of bags with me. So, we got a free upgrade to a suite on the highest floor and had a great view of the area. The neighborhood is not bad... it's across the street from The Clift hotel (which is extremely posh and famous for its lounge), so really, how ghetto do you think it could be? Yes, this neighborhood used to be a little sketchy, but the street is actually pretty nice and it's two blocks away from Union Square and all the shopping that's over there. It's a prime location. The staff is very helpful and will offer you maps and map out where you want to go. The in-room amenities are great too... a lot more than I expected. They even provide you with an umbrella since the weather can be gloomy in SF. The minibar offerings are also plentiful and very reasonable.This place is perfect for younger people or travelers on business. Good for vacations, romantic getaways. I love more modern and hip places, and this fits the bill. Reminded me of The Standard Hotel, except less minimalist.I would stay there again and would definitely recommend it to friends. Parking was a little price (at $22 per night), but that's still cheap compared to a lot of places in San Francisco.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR213891763", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sonictonic53"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel in Filthy San Francisco The Hotel was fine. The neighborhood: It was close to Union Square but also too close to the many pan handlers and bums on the streets. The streets were filthy and turned us off on San Francisco. It is the filthiest big city we have been to recently. Trips to Chicago and New York were cleaner and much more pleasant. The San Francisco mayor has created a real [-], that is unfortunately right outside the doors of the Adagio.Terrible reading lights at the bed. Not bright enough or direct enough. No direct lighting (spot lights) for reading.Staff was kind. We left a day early because San francisco is such a dump, and we were tired of all the beggers sticking their cups in our faces asking for money. My three young daughters did not feel safe and could not get out of town fast enough. We would have liked to have tried Cortez, but we left a day early.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR998242071", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "inravaj"}, {"Content": "modern  our first time to San Francisco - the Adagio was the perfect central location.
