The breakfast is simple but enough to begin your day(2 pastries, one bread roll. ham and cheese, ham and butter, orange juice and hot drink all served at the table.

The hotel is situated just of la Rambla in a quiet little street with a restaurant directly opposite and bar and eating facilities in the hotel. Being on the 4th floor was no problem, the lift being very efficient. Rooms were immaculate and the bathroom just as equally impressive. Rooms have stocked fridge (pretty expensive) and free safe. Hairdryer in bathroom which has two wall to wall mirrors. Towels replaced every day. Supermarket is 20 feet from the hotel and the smallest pub you have ever been in is at the side of the hotel. Prices are 2 euros a ber, where in the other local establishments you are paying on average 4.80 to 5.80 euros a beer. Among othe attractions, a must visit is the massive fruit market on the left hand side of La Rambla as you are looking from the harbour about 800yards in. Another must visit is Flahertys Irish pub (if you can find it) which sells the best steak and Guinness pie ever. If you are thinking of taking in a game at the Nou camp do not buy you tickets online or off any the vendors selling them. Go straight to the ticket office at the ground (55 to 67 euros) early morning to avoid the queues and you will get tickets at half the price of the other outlets(135 to 200 euros). In the La Rambla area beware the pickpockets. The plan is for an elderly lady to stumble in front of you. You go to help her. A girl comes over and says its her mother then the others come to help and your money is gone and believe me theses guys are exceptional. Also beware the prostitutes who will touch you all over to locate your money. They will not take no for an answer unless you show some aggression towards them. Try not to let this worry you as its a great place to visit.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cLocated a Dentist\u201d", "Author": "Mollie D", "ReviewID": "UR122245086", "Content": "The location was wonderful, easy to find, and last stop on airport bus - no guessing about where to get off.

After reading a few reviews I was slightly anxious about what we may be sleeping in, but it was fine. Location was great. We took the Aerobus from the airport and it stopped in Plaza Catlunya. From there it was a five minute walk to the hotel. My map reading skills aren't great! It should have been two minutes!! The hotel is on Carrer Santa Anna which is a narrow street lined with shops, a couple of restaurants and bars. It leads directly on to La Ramblas at the far end. Check in was easy. There were two women on the reception -both spoke excellent English - although I do use basic Spanish, I didn't need to. We had paid in advance anyway, were given the keycard and the breakfast procedure was explained. So we went up to our room to unpack. There is a lift - we didn't use it on the first trip up to floor 3, but the stairs were quite steep so we became lazy and used the lift afterwards. We were on the third floor - room 307, overlooked Carrer Santa Anna, which was at times quite noisy, but hey - we were in the city centre. the room was quite small, but big enough for us. The sheets and towels were spotless. The bathroom was small but fine - a few toiletries were provided, lots of toilet roll. The cleaners came in on the second day and changed the towels and made the bed. Breakfast was at the bar/restaurant straight across the street. It was a pastry or two, bread roll and cheese/ham/meat, jam, butter etc. A glass of orange juice and coffee. Adequate as a start to the day. I would happily recommend this to a friend as a good value, centrally located hotel. If you are looking for a luxurious break then maybe think of somewhere more expensive, but if you are prepared to live for a couple of days in a clean, basic hotel then try this hotel. When I return to Barcelona I will probably consider staying at Hotel Catalunya again as the location is fantastic.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cAvoid avoid avoid!!!\u201d", "Author": "puddle1988", "ReviewID": "UR60826998", "Content": "This hotel was a huge rip off. We paid the equivalent of 100 pounds a night for a very uncomfortable room with no carpet (or any kind of decent flooring), beds with mattresses which seemed to be designed with the sole purpose of PREVENTING sleep with a really wierd hard lump which was supposed to be a pillow. We had no sleep for the four nights we were there. The hotel is very, very noisy- not only due to various things going on outside the hotel late at night and at the crack of dawn but also because there is absolutely ZERO sound proofing and you will hear EVERYTHING through the flimsy walls. At around 7 in the morning you will be woken up with the sound of the wheely beds screetching across the tiled floors in the rooms above you. The staff are generally hostile towards non- spanish travellers and tend to welcome you with glares when you come in through the entrance door. The breakfast and internet were free but both services left a lot to be desired. At this price you could really do better!!! Me and my mum actually ended up leaving this horrible place on our fourth night (we had intended to stay a week) and moved to a different hotel. This cost us another 200 pounds, but we were that desperate we decided we had to. Hotel Cataluna offers no refunds so we lost out on about 300 pounds. We moved to a four star hotel (not our usual practice) which was less than 100 a night for a beautiful room, no noise and comfortable beds!! Staying here ruined our trip. I don't think this is a place suitable for families visiting Spain from other countries. Please consider it carefully, because we didn't!

It got worse, within 20 minutes of arrival the wardrobe door fell of and almost badly hurt one of us, this was not the only thing to break. When in the bath, the shower curtain repeatedly fell down, the same thing happened in my daughters room. The walls were paper thin and i could hear everything that was said in the next room.
