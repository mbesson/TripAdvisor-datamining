It was about one of five different hotels in the immediate area, so I wasn't expecting anything fancy. It was close to the 10 freeway, which was incredibly convenient when navigating to all the different ballparks in Phoenix and Glendale. The fitness center was bare bones (1 treadmills, 1 elliptical, and 1 bike) and the pool was very small.

After a long day getting there, I arrived late in the evening only to be told there was not a room available for me. The lady behind the counter was very apologetic (which I appreciated) and stated a large group of people had not checked out that day as scheduled and consequently they did not have a room available for me. She noted that I was a Choice Priviledge member and said they made arrangements to put me up next door for the night. She said they would comp my room for that night and that the rest of my 6 night stay would indeed be back here where I originally booked. I was exhausted and not knowing the condition of the establishment next door, I agreed. Without writing more of a novel than I already am, let me just say the place next door was unacceptable. It was a complete dump, filthy and disgusting. I was NOT happy. If I had wanted to stay in a dump, I would have booked a room there. They could have at least put me in a comparable quality establishment, of which there were several in the area. The next day I was indeed given a room here for the remainder of my stay. Upon entering my assigned room, it initially appeared fine and of the quality I had expected. However after setting my laptop up on the desk and was preparing to sit down and do some work, I discovered there was no desk chair. I called down to inquire and was tld someone would bring me a chair. A short time later, a young man did indeed show up with a brand new chair he stated he just assembled for me. Ok, that was impressive. Problem solved. The next morning, when I opened the closet to get the iron, I discovered the ironing board was missing. Once again, I called down and was promptly delivered an ironing board. Ok so kudos for problem solving. I also discovered there were no hand towels or wash cloths in the bathroom. Ok so now I'm wondering if this had been a room they were just using to rob Peter to pay Paul with items they needed for other guests. I might also just mention, in case they are reading this review, please invest the additional $0.15 a roll for something other than bargain brand toilet paper. The shower pressure was anemic and the temperature was very hard to control. Other than these complaints, the room was fine, very clean and the beds were moderately comfortable. Oh speaking of clean, upon arrival back to my room on the second night at 5:15pm, I discovered my room had not been cleaned yet. \"Really\"? After calling housekeeping, I was advised the cleaning staff was still working on my floor and would be there momentarily. Apparantly not an expeditious crew. Fortunately, I was leaving again to go out for dinner, so it worked out. This happenned once again on the last night of my stay and finally at 5pm I stepped out into the hallway and advised the cleaning staff (who coincidentally was just standing in the hallway chatting) that I would not need my room cleaned tonight at this late in the day as I was not going to leave while they did their work. The breakfast selections were plentiful however the eggs were unedible, rubbery and with a slight chemical taste. The ice machines on 2 of the 3 floors were out of order. One vending machine ate my money. The cigarette receptacles outside had not been emptied during my entire stay and wer overflowing. The coffee pot in my room was not used for two of the days during my stay as no cream/sugar packets had been left during the cleaning process. I could easily rate this hotel much lower based on my experiences during my stay, however my gut tells me there is potential here for an above average establishment. The staff was always very friendly and most of my problems were dealt with swiftly. I will chalk off my issues to the exception and hopefully not the rule with this place.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, California", "Title": "\u201cService needs A LOT of work!!\u201d", "Author": "Chee26", "ReviewID": "UR126424594", "Content": "Me and my family recently stayed at this hotel for about 3-4 days. Not the best of stays. Maybe it was due to the fact that the entire place was full during our entire stay. After the first night, our room keys had been deactivated because the front desk had us down for one night, although our reservation (which was made months in advance) clearly said 5 nights. This was corrected quickly. However, my room was never cleaned other than towels being changed out. The one time the room was \"cleaned\", housekeeping only made up one bed in our two queen bedroom. The trash was never emptied, and the tables/desk stayed dirty with empty water bottles and napkins because the trash cans were overflowing. They do have free breakfast in the morning. This stayed busy from the time it opened until after it was closed. This wouldn't have been so bad unless you were lucky enough to be stuck in a line of people trying to check-out, check-in, or complain about THEIR rooms not being cleaned to the ONE person at the front desk who had to handle all of this on top of answering phones. My dad was basically accused of lying about staying in a room that he had been in for two days when his room key did not work for the SECOND time during his stay. The front desk clerk actually told my dad he wasn't in that room, and that it was \"Mr. Johnson's\" room. The clerk then proceeded to walk my dad to his room to prove him wrong. After knocking on my parents door while my parents stood in the hall and watched, he quickly saw that he was wrong and well... how would YOU feel in that situation. Long story short, maybe we came on a busy week, but that doesn't mean a business should cut corners on service. If anything they should be stepping it up or letting their guests know whats going on so that we're not wondering why such a nice place is handing out crappy service. Decent rates, but get it together at the front desk and train your housekeeping staff to actually clean the rooms.

Yes it is convenient, right off I-10 at 51st., in an area known as Phoenix West. This several block area is dominated by trucker traffic due to the large facility very near for fueling, etc. 18-wheelers are everywhere; not just for diesel fuel, but there are plenty of warehouses nearby as well. However, the only truck noise I heard was in the morning when the overnight truckers started up in the morning at the Phoenix West Inn. I don't know how long ago the hotel was remodeled, but it must have been very recent., inside and out. The grounds are well maintained, but step off their property onto Lasham St. and it looks like a junkyard. Local [walkable] dining is equally dismal, with a few fast food places, and an IHOP. If you want 'real' food, plan on driving a few miles to 75th. Ave. The only full service hotel in the area is the Holiday Inn across I-10. I went there for a few minutes, but it is located in a similar scary area. The large, spotless room itself was great! When I booked it online I had my choice of an easy chair [see photo] or a sleeper sofa. WiFi was fast and easy to connect. The desk area had plenty of available AC sockets. In fact, there was a socket IN the base of the desk lamp. Nice touch! Embarassing selection of TV channels, as in not many. The pool area looked inviting, but it was unlit and the water was too warm to be refreshing after a warm day. Breakfast was a definite highlite, with an excellent fresh selection of everything you would expect from a Hampton lately. It seemed that there was always somebody there checking food supply and refilling if needed. The eating area was large with many tables, and plenty of room. The hotel seems very security consious. The only way to enter the hotel without a room key is through the lobby. At the other entrances, a room key IS required, and this is 24-hours a day. If you need a place to stay in this area, the Hampton does the job nicely, IF you have a car. Now that I think about it though, I cant imagine how you would get there anyway, without transportation. Stay there, but don't venture into the night.
