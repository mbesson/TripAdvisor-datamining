The decor is interesting and very refreshing compared to the huge super hotels. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I had an early morning flight, and when I came downstairs at 4:30 they had my hotel receipt printed and laid out for me to pick up and the cab was already waiting, although it was 10-15 min before I had asked to have a cab. Cafe 222 is just in the next block, and a diagonal cut through the public parking lot next to it takes you right to the Marriott end of the convention center. It was only a few blocks from the 5th st bridge over the tracks. The only downsides are that the internet was not the fastest (but it was included in the convention hotel rate, and the convention center internet was not much faster). There is no fitness center or pool, but with the waterfront so close for long walks and runs, that was not an issue. The hot shower was fully adequate, but not the strong massaging jets you might get elsewhere. There is an elevator past the open air courtyard in the middle.

Certainly the location is fabulous for conventioneers, a couple of blocks from the convention center and right on the edge of the Gaslamp District for easy access to restaurants. And despite numerous complaints from other visitors about the uncaring staff, I thought they were just fine, friendly, chatty and helpful, just not particularly 'corporate'. They didnt seem like career hoteliers, just nice folks. The lobby was a study in floral upholstered wicker and freezing cold during my visit. The in- house restaurant was fine for breakfast, although we found the Cafe 222 down the street to be much better. It was the rooms that made it so difficult, as they weren't just old fashioned, they were run down and positively reeked of mold. It's the first time I have ever felt that I had to go out and buy a scented candle, which didn't help all that much. When I asked the maintenance guy who came to show me how to adjust the temperamental room thermostat if all the rooms were so stinky, he told me that it was from new carpeting and curtains. But we all know what new smells like, and this wasn't it. The oddly shaped bathrooms had pedestal sinks without adequate room for toiletries, and the shower head was installed at such a low height it was barely manageable even for me, 5 foot 0 inches. The much touted in-room fireplaces have a single candlesized gas flame burning in a corner without even the benefit of some fake logs. The bed was comfortable. Had the owners tossed the synthetic gold colored 1960s Howard Johnson's looking bedspreads and gone with patchwork quilts or Victorian lace, the whole atmosphere would have been upgraded while staying in theme. And felt a great deal cleaner. For a hotel that caters so frequently to conventioneers, greater effort should be put into providing free or affordable wifi and adequate smartphone charging stations. Still, the atmosphere was so homey, so much like staying in an old house, that I adjusted quickly and focused on the coziness rather than the annoyances. I don't think it would necessarily be my first choice for a return visit, but at the $130 convention rate, neither would I object.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto,Canada", "Title": "\u201cRoom away from the Nightclub\u201d", "Author": "cosmodog", "ReviewID": "UR123058284", "Content": "The Hotel itself is lovely with a beautiful lobby.

The entire hotel was scheduled to be demolished in the 1970's and was sold for $1 by the City of San Diego to investors who took it apart brick by brick, labeled each piece and then reconstructed it on a different site (were it is now). It is a nice hybrid of the past and the present. Room: November 11, 2011. We stayed in a room on the 4th floor overlooking the quaint courtyard + it had a nice view of the city rooftops. We sat on the balcony which was big enough for 2 people just above the top of the trees in the courtyard, and could hear the hustle and bustle of the gaslamp quarters in San Diego. There are two widows walks one on the right and one on the left, so it really is a trip back in time. Beware on a Friday night there are lots of sirens anywhere in the gas lamp area till the bars close. The room had a bay window, an old fashion TV, which we didn't watch anyway, since we sat on the balcony. The King size bed was nice and I slept good. The water pressure was good, and my only complaint was the shower head was installed by a 5 foot tall plumber and hit me in my belly. If the Horton people are reading this, please note you can purchase a nice shiny chrome curved show head extension that will raise the shower head by 18 inches for $25. Also, one other thing to fix, the handles on the sink don't have stops, so you have to fiddle with the handles to get the water to shut off. Maybe this is the way the faucets used to work way back in the 1800's and that is why they have those still? Restaurants: There are 75 restaurants within easy walking distance and many storefronts are open till 9. Kiddy corner to the Horton is a nice but pricey store with beautiful handmade glass art pieces. We strolled blocks and blocks from the Horton around the gas lamp area and felt safe the entire time. After inspecting many restaurant menu's we decided to eat dinner at the Blue Point restaurant and sat outside under a very nice heater. The Blue Point is a little expensive, but I think most of the restaurants in the area are about the same price. If you go to the Blue Point at 565 Fifth Avenue ask if Abby is working and sit in her area outside under the heater. Haunting: While we were our room on the 4th floor, I learned that room 309 is supposedly haunted, as well as the hallway outside of room 309. I found the room, which was just around the corner and down some nice antique stairs. I stood outside room 309 for a bit, but to my disappointment nothing happened. Although if something had happened I would have fallen down the next staircase. Self guided tour: If you do stay at the Horton Grand, make sure you ride up the elevator to the left, it has a nice surprise on the 3rd and 4th floor. Also, note the fine craftsmanship inside the elevator. It must weigh a ton as it is 100% wood. Walk all around the hotel and find the grand staircase which was shipped to Europe and reconstructed for a cost of $200,000 when the hotel was reconstructed. I loved that the hotel had two exterior walkways to another old building on the 2nd and 4th floor. The Hotel is actually 2 buildings combined into one via the walkways. Also, visit the courtyard, and see the fountain, and the lighted trees. There is no pool and no hot tub, so don't bring your swimming suit. There are lots and lots of historical photos hanging on the walls near the lobby, take a look at them. Parking: We paid $25 for parking for 1 day, then to park a few more hours past noon was another $14. They have valet parking. Amtrak: We almost took Amtrak from L.A. area to San Diego. It would have been $23 one way from Fullerton, CA about 100 miles, and would have only taken 30 minutes more than driving. Amtrak is just over a half mile from the Horton, and if we had taken a taxi from Amtrak it would have cost less than the parking. You could also walk from Amtrak to the Horton in about 10 minutes. Next time we are going to take the train. Actually on the way back we hit a huge traffic jam that took over 1 hour to go 10 miles, so the train would have been faster on the way back, and less stressful. Summary: I want to stay here again someday. The new modern Hilton is 3 blocks away next to the convention center, and the cost is about the same, but why would you want something so futuristic when you can have something so nicely old and quaint.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cSimply Lovely\u201d", "Author": "ReleaseT", "ReviewID": "UR120372814", "Content": "If you have a love for eclectic and value charm, you will like this hotel. First off and most importantly in my opinion - the hotel staff is very kind and attentive. Second, the location is absolutely perfect - especially if you are attending a conference at the convention center - it is only a couple blocks away, and it's very close to great restaurants, bars, and convenience stores. The decor is extremely interesting - think antique, elegant, possibly haunted (at least that seems to be what they're going for, though I never felt the presence of spirits or anything spooky during my stay). The elevator is old hydrolic style - slow and it smells like an old Grandma's perfume. The elevator slowly passes by windows into little rooms done up with really old items and dolls - interesting. The hotel room was comfortable and on the small side. My TV unfortunately had a small crack in it that was slightly annoying. The walls were dreadfully thin and you can hear every conversation of the people in the room next to you - but nothing the TV or earplugs won't drown out (so it didn't bother me). The bathroom was unique - it had an old style toilet with the water chamber up high and a pull chain to flush. The tub seemed newer and was nice and clean. In fact, the whole room was pretty clean. Overall I was very pleased with my stay. The only thing that frustrated me, may deter you from staying, and was the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was the fact that the wireless internet was terrible - they had an outside company handling it, so forget customer service and even though I paid a lot to have it for the week, it kept dropping out shortly after connecting. Don't expect to be able to work much on your laptop while you are here. It may be a common thing among all the hotels in the area, I just don't know.

Do take earplugs for a Saturday night stay because the nightclub is loud and is open until 4am. I didn't have a problem with it because I read reviews prior to my stay and was prepared. The hotel gave me a bit of the vibe from \"The Shining\" movie, especially if you take a wrong turn or go to the wrong wing of the hotel, but it is such an interesting place to stay. It is not filled with the newest and best furnishings, but it embraces its history. The toilet really has a pull chain to flush it, the tv is hidden behind a gilded mirror above the fireplace. I absolutely loved the balcony, though never figured out how to turn on the fireplace (it wasn't really cold, I just wanted to try it). The room was clean and the one time I went back to my room for a nap and put up the \"do not disturb\" sign, I was later called to see if I would have liked my room cleaned. Do not count on the restaurant being open, but you don't have to with so many fabulous places nearby. There is a World Market store a block and a half away if you would like a bottle of wine, it would be cheaper than buying a glass anyhow.

First of all, its location is very good. While securely in the Gaslamp area, it is toward the west of the area, and so is an easy walk to the convention center - about 5 minutes. The rooms are nicely decorated, and we found the bed to be acceptable, neither hard as rock nor soft. Most rooms have a small balcony with two chairs and a working gas fireplace, although they really need to repaint the chairs. I would not sit on them. The bathrooms are more than adequate and are attractive. We never had an issue with hot water - there was plenty. The toiletries provided were above average. It is an old hotel, so you get a lot of charm. Like all things in life, there is the other side of the coin. Because the hotel is antique, there are some expectations you must suspend. Soundproof rooms are among those. We could hear every sound, other than voice, from the room above us (consider requesting the fourth floor). There are no mini-bars or coffee machines in the hotel. They will have room service soon but they do not now. Having room service and a seven-days-a-week, regularly open restaurant will help tremendously. Our understanding is that this is in the works and will be a reality soon. Internet is not free but it is not badly priced either at $29.95 for 4 days; there is a 7 day package also. There is a Starbucks right around the corner, so you can access the Internet there if you don't want to pay. The staff were very friendly to chat with, and we enjoyed talking with them. Customer service could be improved in these ways. First, we were not given much information when we arrived. We didn't even know until the morning we left that there was coffee in the lobby. There were no suggestions for restaurants, etc. We arrived way early, and they kindly checked our bags for us. They were very accommodating, and had our room ready two hours early. We can hardly complain about our treatment in that regard. However, when I tried to inquire as to suggestions for where we could have lunch or otherwise pass a few hours until we could check in, I was pretty much ignored. We left, wandered around, and ate at an ok but really expensive place that we found. Second, and I know this will seem nit-picking but it was pretty important to us at the time, they had no change for metered parking outside. We had to rent a car for a couple days for some dress-up events, and, right after we picked up the car, had to park the car for an hour while we changed into our fancy clothes. When I asked for change for the meters, I was fairly well dismissed, and told, no, we don't have any change. I expect more, I admit it. The Poogs and I were able to scrounge together enough change for 20 minutes, so we ran upstairs and changed pronto. In case you don't know, there is no non-metered parking in the Gaslamp area. That experience really stuck with me, I think because they weren't very nice about it and seemed put out that I would even ask. There wasn't really a place around there where we could get change without making it a hike. And, honestly, I really didn't need to rush when I had to be dressed up, made up, and have twinkles in my eyes. If you are young, and have not stayed in old hotels like the Horton, you should do so, at least once. There is an elevator, which is more than I can say for many of the old hotels I have stayed in over the years. As old farts, I think our boutique-y, antique hotel days might be over.

Though I've stayed at some of the higher level \"resort\" hotels on the bay (e.g. Marriott), I've been lately staying at smaller, more intimate hotels in order to reduce costs (the govt. rate hasn't really kept up with reality in areas like San Diego) as well as to blend in more with the local culture. If you've been to San Diego, and done their \"bus\" tour, you'll know the Horton as the one with all the innate, ironwork composing the facade of the building, and also that it is probably one of the older \"classy\" hotels in this area having been built by Mr. Horton, who made his fortune developing this area back when San Diego was a lot of mud. Obviously, now it's a land of million-dollar condos, glitz, sun, and really nice weather, not to mention a serious marina-like enviornment with great seafood. I liked my stay here. On the plus side,..this is one really old and authentic hotel. You can almost feel the ghosts in this building, and I'm sure if they exist, they've been very hospitable. It seems most of the architecture is original from the fireplaces and bathroom fixtures, to the chairs and furniture scattered throughout. The main stairway is something out of the Stephen King \"Shining\" movie. If you walk around here at night, you're feeling like you might run into a ghost, or at least, that you're being watched. Like some other reviews, I did notice that the staff is just a bit under pressure during the 10AM - 2PM time slot, but otherwise, I found them very pleasant and helpful. I did not have a car. Early morning and evenings, the staff was very friendly. I had a good conversation with a couple of them this week about how our IRAs and 401Ks had dropped about 20% during the last week. They didn't seem to mind that I actually worked for the government either. Really, just down-to-earth, real people with no pretences. Staff at some of the \"resort\" hotels around here can seem a bit too plastic for me. The restaurant was \"down\" during my 3 night stay. A bummer since I DO like a good breakfast to start my working day out, but Starbucks was 1 block away. The rooms are comfortable. Big bathrooms (just like in the good old days) with a separate door. The bed was very comfortable. Rooms have good airconditioning as well as a ceiling fan, making for a very good nights sleep. No coffee makers in the room, but there's a fresh pot in the lobby. The location is superb. Since it's really on 4th and thus, 1 block off 5th which is where the action focuses, I found it very quiet and peaceful. It's only about 4-5 stories high also, which shelters it completely from the tram lines. The latter by the way, are pretty bad if you stay at the big resorts (like the Marriott). Walking distance to the marina and anything else you'd want to do in this part of town. There is no gym. There are drink and ice machines to cool off with. Too bad about the restaurant. It looks really cool with all the authentic, victorian-like furniture, original artwork and scultures, and millwork. If the restaurant was working, then I'd have had a perfect time. From what I understand, the restaurant usually serves breakfast/lunch, but I seem to recall that dinner is not served (which is okay,..there are great restaurants located nearby (try the Thai at Rama's, about 1 block away). The maid service was superb. Rooms were super clean. I had no problems with anything of this sort. In summary, if you're into history and like old hotels, stary here. You'll have hours of exploring to do. The courtyard is something I've not seen before. Very authentic again, and quite charming. I would recommend though calling ahead to find out about the restaurant. Having even a coffee maker in the room would have been nice. Very quiet. I had some hours to kill, and enjoyed myself, just laying in bed and finishing a novel I'd brought with. Wireless was reasonably good. It was about 9.95 per day,..or 40 bucks for a week I think. This is a typical fee around here. The elevator works well. On one side, you can look out into little museum-like displays as you're riding it up and down. Overall, a very pleasant stay.

The hotel is in an excellent location - just on the border of the Gaslamp Quarter District - home to hundreds of restaurants, bars and shops. Another couple that joined us was participating in a conference at the Convention Center and it was a perfect location for that as well. The hotel was decorated in a Victorian Theme -- and was very tastefully done - a lot of beautiful antiques! The rooms were a decent size and very clean. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was cool - pull chain to flush the toilet! Our room also had a fireplace. Staff was very accommodating. Our room was located on the right side of hotel (Room #307) - it was very quiet. The friends who were traveling with us were on the left side of the hotel (Room #427) and they said the nightlife out their window to the early morning hours was a little tough to get used to (there's a very big club right across the street on the corner of 4th St and Island Ave) so if noise bothers you I would suggest you ask to be on the right side of the hotel. As tourist we did the typical tourist attractions - one being the Olde Towne Trolley Tour....it couldn't have been more perfect as the trolley stop was right out our front door.

I have stayed in over 10+ different san diego hotels over the years and i have to say i have always wanted to stay here.... it was nice but i won't book again. Of course i knew it was going to be like staying in an antique among the titans of other hotels here. The location is in the heart of the gaslamp district of downtown san diego. There is no public parking and only valet is an option at $25.00 a day. Taxi from the airport will run you about $15.00. BE AWARE there is a 48 hour cancellation policy for every reservation. There is a restaurant on site but never opened due to the high vacancy rate. You are within walking distance to many restaurants & bars. BE AWARE internet doesn't work in all the rooms (i'm writing from the hallway right now). The A/C doesn't work in all the rooms turn it to the fan setting. There are ceiling fans in the rooms. Some rooms are noisier than others based on their locations to the nightclubs. There is no pool. No fitness center. No coffee maker in the room. No vending machines for snacks. No gift shop. No mini bar. There is soap shampoo and lotion and blow dryer on the wall in the bathroom. There is an ice machine but no bag for the bucket (old school) DO NOT STAY HERE AS A SINGLE WOMAN ON BUSINESS. The front desk gives out room numbers to the taxi companies and who knows what other vendors. The staff is stuffy and not very friendly but it fits the decor of this old landmark rebuilt in 1986. BE AWARE: if you book more than one night and cancel your reservation (ie switch hotels because you are not happy there is a significant penalty. $$$$) i love antiques and was blown away by the decor but you can always walk over from another property and check out the decor. i'm glad i got the opportunity to stay here this one time but three nights was 2 too many. I would think if you want one night with the honey here, then go for it. It is a romantic antique like setting.... get a balcony room. But don't stay for more than one night, its just not worth it with nothing to offer for the price but a cute armoire and headboard.

The location is great and the rooms are not too bad for the age of the hotel but the service is horrible. We thought the hotel was pretty empty given its location but after experiencing the service there it made complete sense. We received bad service on 3 different occasions. 1st incident. At check in the lady was short and brief with us. We were told there was no restaurant or room service. Saturday morning we walked down and sure enough the hotel restaurant was open. The employee at the restaurant there was complaining that it was extremely slow and had no customers. We told her its due to the fact that the restaurant is not really promoted there and and sometimes told that there is no restaurant. Maybe its easier to say there isn't a restaurant then to give out their hours? The restaurant does not open on Mondays. 2nd incident was Saturday morning. I left the valet ticket in the mail box since i had to leave really early and my wife was still in the room. Wife came down and the lady at the front desk was busy on a personal call. Wife had to clear her throat a few times if you know what i mean. Then she was short and brief with my wife and told her she couldn't find the valet ticket. Once she looked in the mailbox where the valet guy said he was going to put it she found it. 3rd incident. Our friends checked out early on Saturday and were waiting for their vehicle at the valet area at the same time we were. The valet guy brought the car around and loaded the luggages with our friends help. The valet guy quickly left to get our vehicle since my wife and I had also been waiting. All good up to that point. As the valet guy went to get our vehicle our friends realized that they didn't tip him so they waited for him to come back. My friend tried to tip him and the valet guy rejected his tip. Apparently he was hurt because he didn't tip him right away? I thought that was hilarious but what he did was extremely rude.

When we arrived, we were offered an upgrade to a balcony room by the nice lady with long hair at the front desk. She warned us there would be a lot of noise from a neighboring nightclub. We accepted (being no strangers to noise!) and loved the room on the top floor. It was clean, charming, the bed was comfortable and, having brought along a little \"white noise\" gadget, the nightclub music and \" whooping\" did not disturb us. If you are sensitive to noise, there are plenty of rooms away from the nightclub and you are given plenty of warning. The next day, we went out early. I came back to drop off some purchases, and was asked by one of the housekeepers if we were checking out or staying. We'd had the \"please make up this room\" sign on the doorknob when we left in the morning. I told her we were staying, and then ran out to go to an early dinner. When we got in, later afternoon, the room still wasn't made up and there were no housekeepers to be seen. We had to start getting ready for an evening event and didn't want to have to vacate the room. I saw an abandoned housekeeping garbage/dirty linen cart in one of the halls when I was doing my \"search\", so we made the bed, I emptied the garbage into the large plastic bag, and threw the towels into the laundry cart . Couldn't find the clean towel cart, so my husband called down to the desk to say that the room had never been made up, and could we please have some clean towels. The desk person said yes, and in about forty-five minutes, a housekeeper came to the door with towels. She asked if we needed anything else, and I told her I had already taken out the trash, etc. She said, \"Oh, thank you...\" and went on to chat a bit. I have to say, even with nobody worried that our room was never cleaned, they were all very friendly and nice. The valets were great--really fast and asked if we needed directions when we were heading out. We consider including the valet parking charge as one of the costs of staying there. It's a busy downtown location and you don't want to spend valuable holiday time searching for parking. The restaurant in the hotel is closed Friday through Sunday, so we went a block away to Starbucks and brought back some breakfast to have on our balcony. A hotel bar is advertised, but we never saw anyone there. We saw people waiting for the valet with drinks, so I'd imagine if you asked at the desk, someone would make you a drink. Actually, we saw empty glasses on a small table near the elevators, and they were still there the next day, so there might be drinks somewhere, or people brought something back to their rooms. It would have be nice to have tea or coffee in the hotel without having to make the Starbucks run. There were some interesting displays around the hotel, and a sign offering tours followed by another sign saying \"No more tours\"! The hotel kind of had the feeling of being only partially staffed, there didn't seem to be many guests around, and it felt a little-- sad. It's such a lovely hotel, resonably priced, and I'd love to be able to recommend it, but to be honest, I'd have to say that I wouldn't be very tempted to return. The housekeeping thing may have been a fluke, and I'm sure if I'd have insisted, the room would have been cleaned after we left for the evening.

I used to roam the other, bigger hotels during my 13 years of going to con, but once I found this one about five or six years ago, I never looked back. First, the staff: They are all super nice and efficient. A couple of them are also hilarious. Any questions they've got answers pronto, checking in/out is a breeze, and if for some reason you need a cab, it's there in moments. The staff is there if you need them, and leave you alone if you clearly want to be left alone. Second, the rooms: They are comfortable and cute. I very much appreciate the option to do a small part for the environment by not having your sheets laundered every day. (I wash my sheets once weekly at home. This is the same thing.) For me, a person who can't stand air conditioning, it's fabulous that if you turn off the air when you leave, it's still off when you get back! It's also very quiet and peaceful in the rooms and the hotel in general. This is not a party hotel, which I very much appreciate. When I get off the giant, sensory overload exhibit floor that is Comic-Con, I want peace & quiet and no random loud parties popping up in the next room. When I get to my hotel, I know I can fully relax and actually sleep. Third, the building: I love being in an historic space and wandering around early morning or late at night looking at all the details. After several years staying there, 2010 was the first time I noticed the beautiful 17th-century carriage under the staircase on the second floor! The restoration job on the place is excellent, and the displays all throughout the place are wonderful. Fourth, the location: For me, it's a perfect location. Step out the door and to my left is Cafe 222, my fave breakfast spot. To my right is a bank with two working ATMs and rarely any line, a critical need for the convention. I'm steps away from Sushi Nippon, The Field and The Cheese Shop (which also delivers to the Horton Grand if you're too lazy to walk 1.5 blocks). There is also an independent mini-grocery half a block away for when you discover you forgot to pack your toothpaste or lost another lighter. And of course it's within easy striking distance of the convention center, especially if you cut through the parking lot on Second Ave. Simply put, the Horton Grand Hotel has absolutely everything I need in a hotel for Comic-Con. Because I haven't quite kicked the habit yet, I do wish there was an ashtray somewhere out front. The Horton Grand, like most hotels these days, is a non-smoking facility.

The room was spacious with fireplace and cool molding, old bed and bathroom fixtures that added to the history. The room was clean and tidy. The price was great, especially for last minute booking. $178/night for New Year's Eve. The down side is the valet line was about 11 cars long. Thankfully my hubby and I parked across the street in the parking garage, which was great after we heard the wait was 1 hour for the valet and there was only one person. You'd think they'd get more people for a holiday. Similarly, the line to check in was long because there was only 1 woman at front and she wasn't overly friendly or apologetic for the wait. And the hotel did not have any extras. Even though the website shows a restaurant, there is none, even though the phones show room service, there is none, no book in the room to explain anything and no soaps or toiletries, and the fixed shampoo container was empty.

Upon check in, once the elevator arrived at the third floor we were greeted by a glass enclosed scene of old-fashioned stuffed dummies that reminded me of Chucky of movie fame. It was scary. I hated to take that particular elevator again. Once we got to our tiny, tiny, tiny room we found it to be about 80+ degrees. But after turning on the air conditioning, a mere 24 hours later the room reached a comfortable temperature. The bathroom was the smallest I've ever experienced but it was clean. The only other negative about the bathroom was the toilet. It's been a while since I encountered a toilet with a wooden tank that sits high on the wall... but that's what they had. Over the days I even got used to the loud whooshing noise it made each time it was flushed. In fact it was so loud you dare not flush it at night because you'll surely wake your spouse... and maybe even the people in adjoining rooms. But the real negative was the way the water in the uncovered tank splashed in your face when it was flushed. I guess in retrospect the toilet splash had more pressure than the shower. But the real nightmare was the desk clerk at 4:00 AM on September 2, 2009. We had to catch an early flight and each day as we met a new desk clerk we asked if getting our valet parked car at 4:00 AM was going to be a problem since the valet is only there once in a while. They assured us it wasn't going to be a problem. Well they were all wrong. When we got to the front desk there was nobody there. There was a roughly scribbled sign that said will be back in 5 minutes or call [--]. After 5 minutes I called the number and got a lady who said she was in the parking garage down the street but she would be there in 2 minutes. After 10 minutes she finally showed up and was the meanest nastiest desk clerk I've ever encountered. She berated me for being concerned about making my flight. I told her I'd tell the Western Foodservice Expo staff of my experience and she threateneds to call the police for threatening her. She seemed to be crazy but maybe it was just a drug induced rage or something of that nature. In any case she eventually brought us our car which she parked down the street next to a tree so as to make it difficult to get in the front door.

In addition, its location is by all means excellent given its proximity to the Gaslamp Quarter and access to public transit for excursions outside the immediate area.

Quite frankly, because there were no lounge chairs in the room it became quite tiresome sitting on the bed as a comfortable alternative to the straight back wooden chairs that were in the room.

Thank You to the entire staff for making our San Diego experience one to remember!", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cNice Location, Clean, Attached Pictures\u201d", "Author": "JessNRaleigh", "ReviewID": "UR4579820", "Content": "I just visited San Diego for a conference at the San Diego Conference Center. The Horton Grand was the only hotel I could afford within walking distance from the conference center. The other hotels were considerably higher in price. I would say the best thing about this hotel is it's location in the Gaslamp District. The room was clean and charming. I felt like I was staying in an old victorian home. This hotel was built in the late 1800's, so I wasn't surprised that I could hear noise from the outside. Although, I thought it was neat being in the middle of the Gaslamp District. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay. Although, I am sure there are nicer hotels in the area for a higher price.

We were impressed by the quaintness and charm of The Horton Grand. Our room was very nice. We would have liked to have seen a larger bathroom mirror; it was also placed rather high - I had to stand on the phone book and I am 5' 4\" tall! Also, some of the remarks left by guests in the room's guestbook were rather profane. I was surprised they were left there for others to see. It does get noisy on weekend nights, but that is the chance one takes when staying in the heart of the Gaslamp District. We were surprised, however, to hear so much noise early on a Sunday morning (construction traffic - on a Sunday, no less). Other than those minor things, the stay was very nice.", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Horton Grand Hotel and Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80582-Reviews-The_Horton_Grand_Hotel_and_Suites-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$147 - $358*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">311 Island Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515542", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5c/3e/5c3e17cfcf26d55e43e8ac54599fc8171large.jpg"}}
