The room is sweltering, the sink spews water all over the floor from a leak around the waste pipe. The shower room is wet wall to wall because the door to the shower can't be shut and the floot covered in black dirt. It stinks of cigarets in the hall and there are people shouting drunkenly all night. The slab that you sleep on sort of looks like a bed. The location is excellent. Basically, stay here if you just can't find anywhere else but otherwise, you can probably do a lot better.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cTerrible staff, bad accodomdations..but good location\u201d", "Author": "amy l", "ReviewID": "UR117501249", "Content": "I honestly would have been better off staying at a hostel like my friend and I initially wanted to. When we checked in the room was not what we reserved, but the location was great so we over looked it. On and off through our stay the toilet stopped working, the shower was broken and our fan broke. When we asked if they would fix it..they blamed the broken fan on us and said it was fine, it's cold out side and you are leaving tomorrow so you don't need a fan.

I booked a room with a shared bathroom and got stuck in a room converted from a hallway that wasn't even marked on the fire escape. I could touch both walls with my hands and the rooms had a \"moldy\" smell every time I entered. The shower head was broken and sprayed all over when I was holding it, so the walls, ceiling and floor of the bathroom were soaked every time I was in there. The shower hook was broken the entire time I was there, so you had to hold it in your hands. To be fair, the pension was safe and was very close to La Ramble. But if you're looking, don't forget that the area is full of hostals, so look around for a better option.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cBasic, clean, central and safe\u201d", "Author": "yvonnewarren", "ReviewID": "UR26004873", "Content": "Basic, clean,safe, central.

It is a great property that is fairly centrally located in the old town very close to the ferry terminal. The entire place was immaculate and provided towels/sheets/etc. It was in a very safe neighborhood and about 5-10 mins from the Drassanes metro stop and the Ramblas. It is only about a 15 min walk from Barceloneta beach, and about 10 mins from the cathedral. There is good shopping for boutique-type stores as well. The location is definitely its best quality! Additionally, the rooms were fairly spacious. However, at night the rooms got fairly hot, and the windows were small. Overall, the management was good and present 24hrs/day to let you in, it was clean, great location, and they had free cookies!
