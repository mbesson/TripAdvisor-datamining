Upon arrival we found that the hotel was on the fourth floor and the only way to get there was by steps or a very old lift, which requires passengers to close the three doors before it can move. This can be an issue as people who leave the doors open on the fifth floor stopping others access unless you are willing to climb the five flights of stairs and then close the doors. My partner had mobility issues after longs walks and we were caught on a couple of occasions. I had to fetch the lift and bring it to my partner to access the hotel. The hotel lift is not wheelchair accessible (to small). We arrived to a very small but well-kept room, the day was hot and we asked the staff where the control was to the air conditioning, we had to ask another three times before staff told us they normally don\u2019t give out the controls until June the 1st! We eventually got the control and a rude response. The internet password was the next battle then we needed a fridge for medication. All seemed a little hard! The internet connection was the best we had on this trip. Downloading English speaking shows on YouTube without any problems or buffering. The bed was comfortable the street noise below well insulated by double glazing. One night we hear plumbing noises and told the staff, after investigation the staff old us it was the Americans next door who leave the taps and heaters on. He was quite derogatory towards Americans. This was our last stay in Europe and we unloaded our Euros before going to the airport, only leaving ourselves with enough for a couple of drinks at the airport, but on departure from the hotel we were informed that we had to pay Rome tax In cash. We didn\u2019t have enough, only on travel cards, again we got a rude response from staff as he threw his hands up in the air.

The triple bedroom was nice, spacius, with a clean bathroom with a shower, but one of the beds were more like and extra bed. The windows were big, with a view to the road. The double bedroom was smaller and had troubles with the hot water. It was too hot and no cold, and there were 40\u00ba celsius outside! It took them at least 2 days to solve the problem and my friends had to shower at my room. During our 4 days stay we saw 5 different recepcionists!

The breakfast was monotonous, but, for me, as long as they have coffee and milk, bread and butter, i'm ok with it, and their expresso was very good.

I will start with the positives- central location and close to Metro and Termini, quiet room even though it's on a busy street, nice bathroom. Now the deal busters- the beds are uncomfortable, the mosquitoses (at least we were hoping the bites were from mosquitoes) we each had no fewer than 20 each, the staff was barely pleasant and sometimes rude. One staff member accused me of not closing the elevator door. It's a quaint old elevator with a metal gate on the outside and two doors on the inside that you have to shut in order for it to move. Not hard to get especially since I once lived in a building with a similar elevator. He didn't believe me when I said I had shut it, he made me go check! The coffee was terrible. The breakfast highlights were canned fruit cocktail, individual cheese food wrapped in plastic (aka Kraft singles), pastries and yogurt. All of this I could take for a few days especially with the fabulous espresso downstairs at the Irish Pub. All hell broke loose when we went to check out. The price was suddenly higher. We had brought the email with our reservation confirmation and price but Elenora wouldn't look at it. She kept insisting we had used a web site in which the price was higher. She had one of my travel partners credit card number and passport number on it. We had never even heard of that web site. She was actually yelling at us. This went on for about 20 minutes meanwhile our taxi is waiting impatiently downstairs. Did I say she was yelling at us? I'm sure the entire hotel could hear. We finally told her she could take 800euro or nothing and we were leaving. This was all we had and it was a compromise between the two prices. We had to ask for a receipt with \"paid in full\" on it. She continued to yell at us as we walked out the door. We were then greeted by an upset taxi driver whom wanted to charge us more.

The shower door had to be held on by hand while you had a shower or risk being clouted on the head with it. We didn't realise upon check in that the 2nd room we were taken to was facing the very noisy street - even 4 floors up the traffic noise was terrible. Traffic noise was the least of our problems as it turned out - the Irish bar directly below the hotel stays open until 3am and has tables on the street. Noise from this establishment made it almost impossible to sleep. The breakfast provided is extremely light on, somewhat stale and basically unpleasant.

Firstly, the positives, and there were, admittedly, a number of them with the Hotel Martini, - Decent location - Charming building - Basic but well maintained room Now for the negative and what a great stinking negative it was; Upon arrival the old lady at reception hiked up the cost of our stay for four nights from EUR480 to EUR880 - even though I had received confirmation of the original price by e-mail and had the reservation voucher number to hand! Apparently there had been a 'big mistake with the computer'. The lady's argument was that the Hotel Martini would 'never agree to EUR480 for four nights at this time of year' - it was a New Year's break. Apparently an email was sent to me explaining all of this and because I didn't reply to it - hard to reply to an email that you never received - my booking was cancelled. Despite this, there was - 'luckily' said the lady at reception - one very last room available in the hotel for four nights, to the very same spec that we'd been looking for! After a three hour flight from Dublin and all the accompanying hassles of such a trip myself and my partner were in no position to argue. There and then our trip became a budget break with much of our spending money now gone. Hopefully we'll get back to Rome some day but we certainly won't go anywhere near this place.
