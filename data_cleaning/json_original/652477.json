The food is cheap and the Mustafa Center area had everything I needed for souvenirs, food, Internet cafe, etc. This time I did a search on Google Maps for hotels close to the Mustafa Center that were cheap. I found Penta Hotel but didn't realize how close it was. It is only 1 minute from the Mustafa Center and big street that has many Indian/Middle Eastern restaurants. The room is basic but has free Wi-fi and cable tv with good movie channels. There is a convenient store next door for late night drinks or munchies. This hotel is on Birch Street which most drivers did not know so the best thing may be to have them drop you off in front of the mosque. It is next door to the hotel and they know it. The hotel is also a stones throw from Ferrer Park Subway Station if you want to save cash, I paid 100 Singapore Dollars for my double room with a window. 90 if you are ok to have no window. The desk staff was nice. Walls are thin though and a lot of people just hanging out in front of the hotel or near the elevators which may be a turn off for some, Overall though, for those that just need a place to crash for a night or 2 and convenient, this is your place.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolkata", "Title": "\u201cLow rent\u201d", "Author": "iamanumenorean", "ReviewID": "UR118107324", "Content": "Just opposite Serangoon Plaza (main entrance of Mustafas) behind a mosque.

However rest of the things relating to the Hotel are simply pathetic to say the least. The balding male receptionist and the older female receptionist are both rude to the core. Rather than assissting the guest they make sure that the guests are bullied. For every question asked, be prepared to get a rude curt reply, which most of the time is nonsensical. The Manager should take notice of this and immediately remove these two people. The rooms are ok but the amenities are basic. The fridge in our room was not working and our children's medicine were spoiled because of that.

It has (on either side) the Farrer Park MRT (train) station and the highly popular Mustafa Centre just a dozen meters away. I chose this hotel on recommendation of a friend living in Singapore. I heard from him that the hotel was refurbished a few weeks or so before my date of arrival in Singapore. I checked in to a double room and it cost S$100-a-day (~US$80). I didn't expect a lot of pleasantness because i knew the owners were Chinese, but by their standards, the reception wasn't cold and more towards pleasant. It's just accommodation that is offered at Penta and not even bed tea; although they do sell tea/coffee powder sachets for 30c at the reception. A hot/cold water dispenser is available in the corridor and a flask is provided with the room. The room was clean and so was the washroom. The A/C was good but i did not use the TV enough to comment on it. I did find a few other hotels in the area (e.g. GrandMax Hotel) that offered accommodation for S$75 (~US$60) but the state and cleanliness of those hotels gave me enough reason to remain at Penta. Overall, it's a good hotel if you are looking for comfortable yet affordable and reasonable accommodation in Singapore.
