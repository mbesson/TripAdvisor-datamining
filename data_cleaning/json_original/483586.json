{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice but out of the way The DoubleTree at Farmers Branch is located right next to my corporate headquarters. The rooms are small, but fine. My room had a nice queen bed, a desk with good chair. The bathroom was again big enough, but not large. It has a standard bath/shower combination. The bedding seems comfortable, but for whatever reason I could not get comfortable.The hotel has a Au Bon Pain, which serves sandwiches for breakfast,lunch, and dinner. It has soup, some overpriced drinks, and chips,yoguart etc.. Its not up to the standard of a standard Au Bon Pain, but I think that is primaryly due to the lack of customers. There is a bar that is open in the evening, but it has no food. So, food choices are limited on-site and it requires you to drive to somewhere near by. The hotel does have a shuttle service and has in the past taken us to restaurants and other places.The room was extremely clean including bathroom, and other common areas. The one negative was that a co-worker had his luggage removed without his permission, nothing of value, just the bag. The hotel did provide him a piece of luggage to get home, located missing bag and is sending it to him.Front desk/bell folks were efficient and pleasant.", "Date": "Mar 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR482236211", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "jonbier"}, {"Content": "Nice for business travelers I stayed a single night in this hotel while participating in a training class nearby. I found this hotel to be very, very nice and comfortable. The lake view rooms come with a sofa which makes the room very comfortable. The area is a little bit under developed which is both good and bad. The location is not very crowded and has easy access to the LBJ Freeway, but there are no restaurants nearby. It is a 2-3 mile drive to the Galleria area where you can find tons of good restaurants. The deli in the hotel served a very overpriced breakfast and did not offer much for dinner. If you are staying in the area and don't mind driving somewhere to eat, this would be an excellent place to stay. Complimentary wilreless makes this a got place for business travelers.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR654357834", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rogerm001"}, {"Content": "Good Value! Stayed at the Doubletree in Farmers Branch for a week on business. If you need to stay in the area, this is an excellent value. The Omni down the street was nearly double the price through our corporate travel agency. The hotel appears to have been recently updated (last year or so?) and the lobby is attractive as are the rooms. Beds have been updated to Hilton standards with pillow-top mattresses. Room was quiet and very clean.Whereas some Doubletrees have refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms, this one had neither. Also, on-site dining is limited to a cafe. No full-service restaurant, although there is an attractive bar. Restaurants are not too far away however.The staff is extraordinarily friendly. One of the best in any Hilton chain I've stayed. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR347253506", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Misha22"}, {"Content": "Perfectly Suitable Low-Price Hotel This place is fine. Clean lobby and rooms. Decent bedding. No bells  whistles, but you don't pay for them either. Several suburban chain restaurants about 2 miles west @ McCarthur exit.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR519113692", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cliff_rock"}, {"Content": "Not as bad as the other guy I wound up here out of desperation. I had such a bad customer expereince at the HGI in Market Center, that this hotel was a relief. No bugs. The DoubleTree Club is the low end if the DT line, but they do a poor job of communicating that to their customers. By Club they mean it is not a full service hotel. There's a small bar, a small deli with limited selection and hours. The hotel is in an industrial park but a short drive to two restaurant areas and not a bad hop to DFW. I found the rooms to be clean, if uninspired. Showers worked ok as did Internet.", "Date": "May 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR409421491", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mlasser"}, {"Content": "Boy was I UnHAPPY!!! I booked a meeting at this hotel. I guess I did not ask the right questions! Do you have a restaurant? Oh is it open for breakfast, lunch or dinner on the weekends! I asked do you have a bar? I should have asked Do you have a bar that is open on Saturday Night? We had people in our group that had bugs crawling on their bed. They told the front desk and nothing was done. The hotel was more that half empty. They did not even offer to move this person. After I wrote a nasty note to Corporate the hotel offered them a free stay at the same hotel. Would you want to come back to the same hotel that has bugs crawling in your bed. I will not come back to that hotel ever again.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR531844612", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d483586-r13963840-Doubletree_Club_Dallas_Farmer_s_Branch-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "483586", "Price": "$134"}}
