I have been asked to contact them myself. The hotel do deserves a three stars and not four. The reason that the hotel is having 4 stars is only because they propose an outdoor swimming pool and and indoor swimming both very small.

Lots of alternatives around.\u201d", "Author": "Mario_MZG", "ReviewID": "UR116183059", "Content": "We booked 5 nights in Orka Royal for the end of July 2011. It was our 3rd visit to Istanbul and we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The reservation was made 6 weeks in advance and prepaid by our Agency (we carried a voucher). Upon arriving at the hotel, on 27th July, we were given the keycard and guided to room #128. In dismay, we saw that it was an *interior* room, the only available window was a 50x50 cm glass opening to the corridor (which, of course, had to be permanently shut with curtains). Besides, the floor space was so small that even our 60-cm luggage had to be opened on the bed and then closed and kept against the wall. The WC was so tiny that if one person was inside it was phisically impossible for the other to get in. Of course, we immediately went to the reception and asked for a change. The taciturn (but kind) receptionist told us that they were booked up for the day but he could arrange for a room change next day. Having been around the world for 40 years and experienced hundreds of hotels (good and bad) this was undoubtly the only time that this had happened to us. How is it possible that the hotel management receives a 5-night firm reservation with 6 weeks anticipation, and assigns the guest to one of their worst rooms ? Are they expecting the guest to endure the inferior conditions for the whole stay, while they keep the best rooms for the latest newcomers ? Unbelievable !!! With no other choice (it was prepaid), we had to agree. We stayed one night in the tiny, interior room #128, with noisy AC and an even noisier engine clanking all through the night (elevator engines ? main AC engines ?). The next morning we left all our things packed inside room #128 and went to discover the city. When we returned at 5pm our things were in the new room, #512. Needless to say, our clothes, pressed in our small luggage for 2 whole days, acquired permanent creases that lasted for the whole stay. Our new room was just OK. To our standards and experience, the room and the rest of the hotel are more to a 3- (or 2-) star classification than a 4-star. Nevertheless, we now had enough floor space, a WC with a tub (and even a working jacuzzi), and addequate conditions to stay. The pipe smell that many guests have referred here was also present (only late in the night, when nobody was flushing). This must come from deep down below the building and is possibly without remedy. Covering all the drains *and* the grille in the WC floor, somehow minimized the problem. Be advised: the room that is shown in the main photo of TripAdvisor is what they call the \"Royal Suite\", priced at 600 euro per day Now, about the breakfast quality. To say the least, it is erratic. Most probably, there is someone in the kitchen stuffing his/her pockets. The \"orange juice\" is artificial, as previously stated by others. But throughout our 5-day stay it went worse every day. Starting with a reasonable taste and concentration on the first day, it ended as an orangish water on our last day. Surely someone is using the same jug of concentrate for the whole week, adding water as needed. The publicized \"turkish specialties\" range from a full basin with boiled spinach to a \"soup\" of milk and scrambled eggs. Green olives (at breakfast !) and hard-boiled eggs are also present. The cakes are dry and uninspired. To make a long story short: the Orka Royal is an hotel in a very good place (near to lots of touristic places and to the main transportation lines, and with dozens of nice restaurants nearby) with nice art-deco fittings and reasonable amenities. But it is literally murdered by incompetent and dishonest management. With lots and lots of alternatives around (you get 10-12 hotels in the same street) you don't need to choose this one.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cFairly basic, good location\u201d", "Author": "Scintilla85", "ReviewID": "UR116063561", "Content": "We arrived in the hotel and the staff quickly led us off to our room.

There is a huge banner on the homepage of the hotel which says that there is 15 % discount for students, people over 65, teachers, etc. There is no notice that you get this discount if you book via email, however I wrote an email for the hotel if this discount exist and they confirmed it. They recommended me to book on their homepage as in that case I can get a free airport shuttle from Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport and in this case I can also get the discount. So I booked our room on their homepage with the comment that I would like to use the discount. However, when we wanted to pay the receptionist told me that the discount is not valid and is not confirmed in their system. He claimed that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do booking on their own homepage, but on another site (fastbooking.com), although I have never used fastbooking.com in my life. Although I proved him in several ways, that we got the information from his colleague that the discount exists, he told me that we cannot get the discount, he and he had us to pay the whole sum. He told me that I should be happy with this price as it is very good for a \u00e2\u20ac\u01534 star hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In fact, Orka Royal is only in name a 4 star hotel, but it does not provide the services and level of it. It seems that there is a chaos around the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own online booking system, as two days before the departure to Istanbul I wrote an email to the hotel for reconfirmation our airport pickup at Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport (just for sure), and they gave the answer to me that we are not in their record system. If I hadn asked it, maybe we would still waiting at the airport without accommodation in Istanbul. Although its location is good, near to the main tramline, the neighbourhood of the hotel is very dirty and gloomy. I think the streets in the neighbourhood are not really safe at night. Although it is trough that from the pool on the terrace you can see the Bosporus, if you look down or out from the window in your room, you will see only dirty houses, a big construction work or the railway station. The breakfast was very poor, far from the pictures on the website. Cakes were dry and there was no Turkish specialities at all. The only thing that was eatable was bread, butter, cheese and cold cuts. Not really special, is it? Instead juices there was some artificial liquid, undrinkable. The hotel tries to make extra money from services that should be included in the price of a four star hotel. Usage of the wellness section is not in the price, you have to pay even for the entrance to the pools and sauna. Even if you decide to pay the entrance fee, be ready that there is cold water in the pools and jacuzzi has been broken for months. The staff told me that they have never told that there is warm water in the pools. Funny. I had to dispute with the man in the wellness department approx. 20 minutes when he finally gave back our money. Heating was not working in our room at all. The receptionist told me that the heating system is centralised in the hotel and as most of the people told that they have hot (it was end of November), they cannot switch it on.

Its postion in Istanbul is ideal for sightseeing within shouting distance (literally as the call to prayer is easily heard throughout the day from your room) from the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya, as well as within walking distance of the Bazaars (15 minutes either way to the Spice or Grand Bazaars), and there is no shortage of amazing street cafes and restaurants to try. I have two issues with this hotel but neither will prevent me from returning. Number one: the room gets very warm and the air conditioning isn't very effective. Sleeping was a little warmer than comfortable but I have had worse nights sleep in hotels. Number two: we settled our minibar bill the night before we were due to depart to save time. We used the water and the juice on most days because there are no tea/coffee making facilities and the tap water isn't safe to drink if you are from Western Europe (something to do with enzymes... or so they tell me). On the morning we were to leave, we checked out at 4am and waited in the lobby for our pick-up. The night manager berated us for having settled our minibar bill the night before as we could have taken something from the minibar since then. I assured him (sleepily), that we had not taken anything else and if we had we would have declared it. He kept going on and on at us, basically calling us liars and acting very stroppy. I didn't lose my temper but I firmly told him that if he did not believe us then he was very welcome to go upstairs and prove us wrong. That shut him up. Horrible man. Anyway. The rooms are clean, compact and comfortable. No view to speak of but that doesn't bother us as we weren't in the hotel except to sleep, really. Nice double bed, good bedding, a small desk and television with BBC Worldwide. The minibar is quite good value compared to some but for water to take around during the day there are plenty of little shops en route ot the sites to buy a bottle of drinking water for less than 1TL. The bathrooms were nice. Very clean, average toiletries, nice towels and water jets in the bathtub. The shower was powerful too, which is always good. Like I said before, the air con was a bit rubbish and the room was quite warm but it wasn't enough of an issue to put me off this hotel. We didn't use any of the hotel's facilities (the two pools, gym or bar), but we did use the restaurant for the buffet breakfast. The breakfast was okay - certainly filling enough to keep you going until a nice plate of lamb kofte for lunch in a street cafe. It is quite Turkish in theme but there are all the usual European trappings. The hot buffet and the breads varied from day to day and the fruit juice alternated between cherry and orange. The tea is in fact Turkish tea which does not go well with milk, but you should remember that you are in Istanbul and should immerse yourself in the gastronomic experience as tea is a big deal here. The neighbourhood isn't very glamarous but it was far from unpleasant. It is undergoing some patchy construction at present (May 2010) but nothing that's going to interrupt your holiday. It's a bit dusty and off the main drag with the trams and bigger restaurants but fantastically close to all the major attractions including Topkapi Palace (so you can get up at a leisurely pace and still beat the crowds!). I would say eating your lunch or evening meal here would be a cop out because there are some great places nearby, we tried a few of them and everybody was really friendly and the food was good.

This is maybe a 3 star hotel. We stayed at a 3 star hotel in Sulchak when we did an excursion to Epphesus which was bigger and nicer than this place, and much cheaper. I am going to list our dislikes first because they are far greater. First - Do not book this hotel UNLESS you book through them - not an agent or discount website. Otherwise, the only amenity you can use without charge is the upstairs pool and breakfast. They will not assist you at all with airport transfer except for at an outrageous price compared to what other companies offer and you can not use the fitness facilities, spa, etc. I have never stayed in a four star hotel that tries to charge you for facilites if you book through anyone other than them. It was so absurd, and when we tried to discuss it with the consierge they just said you should have booked through us (at 100 euros a night! - no thanks!). Second - The rooms are horribly small. Do not be fooled by the pictures. Our first night we got put into the smallest room in the hotel. The bed could only fit into the room at a diagonal. Our suitcases were stack up against one side of the bed. There was a small square space to walk from the bed to the small closet sized bathroom. They did move us the next day to a slightly bigger room because we complained about the size and lack of hot water in this room. Definitely not 4 star hotel rooms. Third - service is poor. We had problems with our air conditioning. One they turn it off during the day when it is hot, only allowing it to be on after 5 and that is after we had to request it be turned on each day. We did not know to do this the first two days and had no airconditioning. We tried sleeping with the window open but construction went on late and started early so there was lack of sleep. When we complained we got the explanation that it was too cold outside at night for it to work (not true it was in the mid 70's or that guests had requested air conditioning to be turned off). Once the staff found out we booked through a discount website they had no interest in our stay there what so ever. Fourth - Breakfast is not great. Dry bread. Have to pay for juice. And overall just not great food. The wait staff is however friendly and keep the dining area clean. They promptly take it away at 10 am. Five - Smokey - we requested a non-smoking room, but they are interspersed next to smoking rooms so your room always smelled of smoke if you had a neighbor smoking. pretty gross in the middle of the night. Six - a little shady of an area. Okay during the day, but at night the side street is a bit sketchy and wouldn't feel safe as a woman by myself. The plus for this hotel is the location. It is so close to all of the sites in the old city and to the docks if you do the bosphorus cruise, etc. Not a long walk to the new city either. So that is the great part about it. If you want to say you stayed in a four star hotel at this price - book it. If you want to stay at a real four star hotel we would not stay here again. We would either pay a little more for an actual four star hotel, or pay a little less for a three star hotel, which is what this should really be, and it will probably be of equal or maybe even better quality.", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North London Finchley", "Title": "\u201cGreat Position to sightsee\u201d", "Author": "DavidLewis", "ReviewID": "UR8547756", "Content": "Just five minutes from the Topkapi and all the sights of the Old Town this not very expensive hotel provides an adequate breakfast and small rooms.

Although I walked in and then walked straight out, and sat in reception for over an hour they did nothing and the rep from Metek Holidays had no intention of coming to sort it out. They are only there to get commission on your trips anyway! After late night calls to the manager, we were promised an upgrade to a \"corner suite!\" for our final three nights. This was a passable room with an alcove for a sofa, which we used to put our bags on. However, though in a side stret which none of the taxi drivers know, this is great spot. You can walk to the main sights of the od town, no need to pay for guides. Also you can even walk down to the Bospherous to get your own boat. Lots of local places to eat cheaply and a bar just down the street at great prices. If you book it just make sure that you don't get one of the really bad rooms.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cPretty Good hotel in a pretty good location\u201d", "Author": "Leebee9", "ReviewID": "UR7545203", "Content": "We were booked into the Orsep Royal by a tour company and we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is pretty new which meant that the decor was all in good condition and was modern, however it meant that the people operating our airport transfer had no idea where the hotel was so we were a bit slow in actually getting there! Overal the street it is in isnt as bad as I was expecting from reading the other reviews. It wasnt well lit and had lots of places with roller doors that were closed at night but there were enough people around and it wasnt that far off the main road so we never felt unsafe. Our room was pretty small but we were expecting it. The bed was the best one we had during our 8 days in Turkey and the bathroom was lovely with a shower with great pressure. There were two disappointments to our stay. The first was the state of the rooftop terrace/pool. Maybe it was because we were staying in April and it wasnt summer, but the pool was filled with about two meters of sludge and that was it. The terrace, while having a lovely view of the Bosphorus was actually being used as a storage area and you couldnt enjoy it at all. The second was the bar staff. They were not friendly, couldnt speak much English and had no idea how to pour a vodka and orange juice! On the plus side the restaruant and reception staff were lovely and all the main attractions are just a short walk away. Overall I would recommend staying at this hotel.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cGood location, bad neighbors\u201d", "Author": "Ahmad_R", "ReviewID": "UR7276025", "Content": "It's a new hotel with normal facilities, near to tourist sights and public transportations ; BUT................. In the first night, they gave us(2 persons) a very very small room without any window .

Also Do not expect to see a good view from you room window and when walking around the hotel,in the street there are car spare part shops. Also won't be surperised when see unfriendly staffs there.
