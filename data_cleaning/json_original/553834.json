{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Adored the Millennium In addition to an ideal location (just beside the train station) , my room had a gorgeous fresco on the ceiling, a charming canopy bed, a giant bathroom and shower, and a terrace. I had friends also in Florence who were spending twice the money for dirty rooms in worse locations. The staff was more than helpful, and I was able to use internet on my own laptop, which is ideal for me to keep in touch with my work back home. Each morning, a sweet girl brought breakfast to the room, and the owner, who seemed to know everything about the city, directed me to the most delectable restaurants. Overall, it was a resplendent experience and I would heartily recommend it to anyone traveling to Florence.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR220673752", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jbeckham"}, {"Content": "Hated the owner and hotel!!! Never stay at this place!!!It started out looking nice, but as soon as we pre-paid our room the owner started acting really disgustingly. he didn't provide us with any essentials of a normal hotel room, like soap hangers in the closet, making the beds, cleaning the bathroom.There was damage to the room before we came in and he blamed us for it and made us pay to get it fixed. The owner was incredibly rude, deceiving and treated us awfully. we moved to a much nicer hotel and cheaper about two blocks away closer to the city center called the Old Florence Inn.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR469285015", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nkmtk"}, {"Content": "unforgettable       our room", "Date": "Jun 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR726096934", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "travelmorefun"}, {"Content": "The best experience The hotel is brand new, the bathroom in our room was immaculate, flat screen tv, air condition work perfectly!All of the people at the hotel were like a family.

Initially thought the place was nice with location and price, but those feelings changed when we had a very scary interaction with the owner. One night he got drunk and high and decided to go about opening guests doors with his master key. After waking us up with loud music, he took me to another traveler's room at 3:00am, openend it while they were sleeping, and proceeded to go on a rant about how no one is appreciative of him, like those travelers. He then proceeded to bang on other travelers' doors to demad cigarrettes, then scream at everyone that it was time to go to bed, turning off all the electricity and hot water to ensure no one was awake. For about an hour we heard him pace up and down the hallway outside our door ensuring that no one tried to leave thier rooms. We were honestly scared for our lives and thought about leaving in the middle of the night. I hope that no one ever has the same experience we did. It really tainted our trip.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR852174905", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "schwitty"}, {"Content": "Fabulous time in Florence! I don't understand these terrible reviews!The location is great - right by the main entry point to the city if by rail / bus (stazione s. maria novella). It is a stones throw from some of the most beautiful sights of the city (Duomo etc.) and the great shops!! The room I stayed in was the one you see in the pictures and it really is THAT pretty! You may have to share a bathroom but it was very clean and there was always hot water. I have stayed in a similar place in the city previously and it was amazing the amount of things that were 'Forbidden'. My stay at R.M was very chilled out by comparison and hugely enjoyable.The personal attacks on the owner are also confusing as I found him to be incredibly helpful and charming - he recommended some great bars and restaurants that I would never have discovered otherwise and that made my trip to the city that much more special...

I was referred to this hostel by another hostel that dropped my reservation and left me stranded. In desperation I booked tand paid for the room there until I could get out the next day and look around. Not only was the room dark, dank, the walls growing mold, and the carpet filthy, but it reaked of some sort of pesticide (probably for lice/fleas!). I was told there might be a better room the following day, (as not only did he charge me a full 70 Euros for the horrible room, but also said there was a 2 night minimum! so now I was out 140 E). I returned to the room after dinner (after leaving the room open to air) and our eyes were watering from the quemicals. I left immediately and searched and found another hotel for the night and called the owner to explain we couldn't sleep in there without choking on the fumes and requested a refund. Not only could I not get the refund for that night, but he also refused the second night. I returned to return the keys and there was noone there (so I don't know what staff the other reviewer is talking about, because other guests there confirmed they never saw anyone there either) so I checked the other open rooms and they were also dumps (I so wish I'd had the presence of mind to take pictures) and smelled. I was unable to reach the owner by the number he gave me to call 24 hours a day, in order to find out where the leave the keys. I had to go to a phone booth every 1/2 hour from 9 until 11:45 am as I was afraid he would charge me for a third day even though we hadn't slept there even one night if I didn't get the keys back by whatever morning checkout time he had. All in all, it is a sleazy place. We found others on the same street that were delightful and clean for a comparable price.
