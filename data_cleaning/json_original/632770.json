We arrived at the hotel and we where being expected. As there are only 4 rooms, it was really quiet, and never saw other guests. At check in we where asked at what time we would like breakfast to be served, as they cater different times for the rooms. We where then showed to our room 1 which i have read its the biggest, and deffinetly shows. Has a 4 post bed, a closet with drawers, a closet to hang stuff, an ironing machine, a full living room with ipod connections lcd tv, expresso machine,a desk with a computer and free wifi. Overall we loved the room as it had lots of space and light. The decorations is also lovely. The bathroom which is the only thing we could complain, is because the tub door doesnt close all the way. Another thing that would be great would be a heater for the bathroom. Thats the only thing we would change. The next morning we went for breakfast at 830 AM. Simply delicious, since we woke up we where smelling the crepes being cooked, at the breakfast there was fresh orange juice, yogurt, 3 choices of cereal, brie cheese, ham, bacon, a fresh fruit plate, coffe or tea, frsh cooked crepes, a basket of bread with croissants and other choices. We where also asked iif we wanted eggs but we passed as it was going to be a lot of food. As we had breakfast what we decided what we where doing from the many tour books thye have at the lobby, the hotel is located really centrally as its closed to the museums, squares, and other attractions, if youre not into walking, stop 7 of the hop on/off bus is 2 blocks away.

The bedroom /sitting room was large and well insulated from any traffic noise. It had a coffee maker, and the contents of the mini-bar, which included a bottle of wine (and if you stay long enough a bottle of champagne) were free. There was adequate storage and comfortable seating. The view was unremarkable (as we had expected). We were given a discount for our suite having been changed, but truth to tell we'd never have booked at all had we known our booking was not to be fully honoured. (With thick snow on the ground & limited taxi availability, we decided not to start looking for somewhere else to stay). The bathroom in the suite we were given was tiny with very little room for personal items, the bath itself cramped and the sound insulation between bathroom and living space inadequate. The decor of the suite was \"Goth meets dominatrix\" - great if you like lots of black and purple, but... The suite was cold - like the weather, but astonishingly the heating had been turned down and our first night was uncomfortable. This was not an oversight, because when we discovered and adjusted the heating controls the following day, we returned from sightseeing to find the heating turned down again! This was inexcusable - a cold room is not part of the deal, certainly not at 275 euros per night. Breakfast is served in the kitchen at a communal table - not necessarily a problem except that the table wasn't large enough. Consequently breakfast was cramped, as well as not a place for private conversation. The quality of the food and coffee was good, but the choice was limited - as is usual with a B & B.

I must admit that I feel indebted to write one, because my choice to visit 'Fusion Suites Amsterdam' was based entirely on the reviews I read on this very website. In fact, the reviews are all so very favourable, that I felt exceedingly confident my expectations would be met and exceeded. I'm sorry to say, they were not - I was extremely surprised. Make no mistake, Fusion Suites are in a fantastic and exclusive location: offering privacy and comfort, with sumptuous furnishings: the establishment truly is top class. Similarly, Alex and Sharmilla who run the place are a genuinely lovely couple, and did everything they could to make us feel welcome and to assist us where needed. They cannot be faulted on their service, which similarly, is first rate. My criticism is nothing to do with anything they did; only the price related to the amenities offered. The bottom line is for about \u00c2\u00a3220 a night, I expected more - and could not help but feel this price tag would have would have taken us a lot further at a nice hotel. (Amenities like a pool, spa facilities, a nice bar/restaurant etc.) What you're paying for in this instance is the exclusive private location, because as a B&B it lacks the true convenience of self-catering OR the service of a hotel, and for myself and my partner, this left us feeling a little disappointed. We're not the sort of people who can generally afford to spend at this level - it was a very special occasion for our 10 year anniversary, and I'd be lying if I didn't admit we were a little underwhelmed. On arrival, we were given a free upgrade on account that it was our anniversary (a very kind sentiment), but I would have been interested to see the others. Again, we did have a couple of gripes with the room itself for this price tag: 1) Very limited English channels available, BBC News plus one or two others. The Television itself was very small and unimpressive, and was only really watchable from the sofa directly in front of it. It was physically impossible to watch the TV in bed (as my partner and I like to), as the screen was obstructed by the enormous bed frame - which we found very frustrating, and pretty poorly arranged to be honest. 2) The minibar snacks and drinks ARE included, but what's supplied is very limited. One can of coke, one fruit juice, two cans of beer and a bag of nuts is not really what I had in mind when it said \"all-inclusive minibar\". Similarly, I would have appreciated bottled water more than the wine that was on offer. 3) A computer with Wifi internet access was provided, but the connection was very erratic and kept disconnecting itself after a few minutes. We had to reboot the system to get it working again, every time. 4) For this money, I seriously thought we'd either have a large jacuzzi bath, or at least a power shower cubicle. It was pretty much a standard sized bath with a shower attached by a hose, and not particularly powerful. The water also was extremely inconstant in flow, seeming to chug in and out and going cold (however briefly) and regular intervals. 5) Just like the minibar, we felt what was supplied in the bathroom was particularly ungenerous - and I'd go as far as to say quite miserly! I have ALWAYS been supplied with a dressing gown wherever I have stayed abroad before, and so have never brought one with me.... at this price, I would have definitely expected them. Nope. Even though there was a bath, no bath foam/oils etc were supplied (very surprising). Not only this, but thanks to British flight regulations on liquids carried, my partner I had to make do with the three tiny vials of shampoo, conditioner & shower gel supplied between two of us for two nights, and a measly selection of towels that we had to re-use. There were plenty of things like vanity kits, nail files, shaving mirrors...just not the basic fundamental things we actually needed! 6) For this price, when only breakfast is offered, I really would have expected to have been asked what WE wanted to eat. We were simply asked what time (and were given no such choice on the second morning). The food on offer was very nice, but consisted initially of a big bowl of fruit and yoghurt on both occasions - which we felt indebted to eat when it had been freshly prepared. There were pastries, cheese, eggs, cereal, pancakes... lots and lots... almost too much to choose from, however the irony is we found ourselves craving an English breakfast, and actually went looking for one for lunch! The truth is, IF we'd been at a hotel I probably would have complained - and felt little remorse about it... but there was absolutely no way I was going to make a fuss with two such lovely and kind people who have obviously made this their family business. I'm really sorry to have any thing negative to say... I really am, and I'm certainly not trying to stand out or \"go against the flow\" with what every one else has had to say. But at the age of 31 and being reasonably well travelled, I've never spent more than this per night at a B&B any where in the world, and was more than a bit disappointed. I genuinely feel the place needs to be brought up to scratch in line with that price, or that price needs to be reduced. The honest truth is I would recommend Fusion Suites to a very rich friend who had money to burn... but only as an exclusive hang-out away from the masses in Amsterdam. If you're a Tourist, you may find it's a little far away from any of the real atmosphere, and lacks the real creature comforts that we slovenly Brits are often accustomed to when going abroad. I will say this however: the mattress on our bed was INCREDIBLE. I've never slept a better night's sleep in my life!!!", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSimply wonderful\u201d", "Author": "Daitoni", "ReviewID": "UR84965878", "Content": "My wife and I were wanting a lovely place in Amsterdam, and boy did we find it!!

During three different stays in Amsterdam we spent a total of 9 nights at Fusion Suites. There is no doubt that this property is well-located. It is within easy walking to the Museum Square, and it touches the perimeter of Vondelpark. It is close to a trolley stop, so it is easy to get around Amsterdam or get to Amsterdam Central Station to catch trains. The rooms of Fusion Suites are lovely. The decor is charming, there are fresh flowers and a very helpful Internet-connected computer in each room. Such amenities are, after all, to be expected from a high-end boutique hotel. However, there are lots of properties in this area, and we had chosen Fusion Suites primarily because many Trip Advisor reviews suggested that we would find a very friendly atmosphere coupled with gracious attention. On this aspect, we were greatly disappointed. We had planned to make many day trips, using Amsterdam as a base of operations. So we arrived full of questions about how the transportation system works, where good places to eat were located, and the like. We both immediately felt as if we were \"too needy\" for their tastes. We could almost feel their eyes rolling whenever we asked for \"more details\". This attitude from our hosts persisted during each of our three separate stays. We came to feel much awkwardness in our interactions with them, as well as regret that we had chosen this hotel. There was one additional issue that impacted our visit. The manner in which breakfast is served was confining for us. We were required to choose, on the previous day, the specific time that we wanted breakfast to be ready the next morning (as opposed to a concept such as \"breakfast is served anytime between 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM\"). As a consequence, our personal schedule in the mornings had no flexibility.

The beer was restocked during our 4 night stay. Importantly for us, the building has a lift, since the stairs are quite steep going down. The double glazed windows and relatively quiet location made for good sleeping conditions. The bed is of the European style, a little firm for our tastes, but confortable enough. There is free wireless connectivity AND a PC in the room for guest use. We found on the last day that the longed-for robes would have been provided on request, so the motto here should be \"if you want something, ask!\" It is likely available for you, or can be made available readily.

I tried to cover the hotel and a little bit about Amsterdam. If you are debating visiting Amsterdam (no matter how old you are) just go and you won't be disappointed. This was my third trip to Amsterdam.. I've done the partying weekends there when I was in my 20s and this was more of a laid back trip. It is nice to remember everything this time :) Fusion Suites is ranked #1 in Amsterdam on TripAdvisor for good reason. The reviews on this site give an accurate picture of the property and service. Our room (#1) was huge, with a great bathroom and stocked minibar. The entire building is very well maintained, very clean.. the kitchen where you eat breakfast is awesome. The rooms have a very nostalgic feel that you just don't get in many hotels. Fusion Suites is a bed and breakfast and it is very quiet.. but this wasn't a bad thing for us. We never heard any other guests and to the best of my knowledge we never bothered anybody - and we were likely a bit loud when we returned from the cafes and bars at night. There is a small lift for bags and for older people who have problems walking up lots of stairs. You might not find a lift in all B&Bs.. so definitely ask for this when looking at other places. Those tall skinny Amsterdam houses usually have very many steep staircases. This was the first B&B we've stayed at in Europe (we typically prefer nice 4 or 5 star hotels with bars, room service, etc..) and I was definitely a little concerned about it being small and quiet, etc. My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights - we are in our early 30s and we do still go out and drink and have fun and stay out late when on holiday so I wasn't sure if this place was for us. However, it turned out better than I could have imagined. That being said, this place is definitely meant for couples, small families, or single business travelers - not for younger people or stag parties looking to tear it up for a weekend in Amsterdam. This would be a good place to stay if you are traveling with another couple, with each getting their own suite. With the wireless internet access, minibar, and excellent breakfast (bigger, better, and faster then you will ever get in a restaurant) all included in the price, the rates are actually very reasonable. The rates seem high at first, but consider how those room service, wireless internet (typically expensive in Europe), breakfast tabs, etc.. add up at a hotel - its nice knowing that the price quoted for the room is the price you pay when you checkout. There is also a computer in each room with internet access that is free to use, so if you didn't bring a laptop there is no need to go to an internet cafe.. this is a very good thing for those who don't like to travel with a laptop. Amsterdam is truly a great city to visit for people of all ages. It seems to me that it has a bad reputation across much of the US.. as many people think Amsterdam is dirty (its not at all) and all about hash bars and hookers. Well, both are indeed there but they are not thrown in your face and easily avoidable. You can't drink in 99% of the coffeeshops (hash bars) any more so people don't typically stay there very long and get wasted. Most people just stop in, buy a joint and a coffee or hot chocolate, smoke the joint and then leave happy and get lost walking around the canals - or go to a nearby cafe for a beer. Its generally normal people on holiday from across Europe and the US stopping in the coffeshops and not as many hippies or younger kids as you'd think. But if the coffeshops aren't your thing, they are easily avoided.. although you should at least stop by one to check it out. As for the prostitutes, they are not all over the city and its not advertised all over like it is in Vegas (where its not even legal). Its legal in Amsterdam and its very controlled and mostly centralized to one area. Admittedly it is pretty crazy walking around the red light district and seeing them all in the windows. Lots of sex shops and sex show theaters down there as well.. but its mostly tourists walking around just to see the area. Its not at all scary - and definitely something you won't see anywhere in the US. I wouldn't want a young female friend walking around down there at night by herself - but this can be said of most cities in the world. In general its not a threatening atmosphere. There always seems to be lots of British guys down there on stag parties having a blast.. pretty funny stuff. All in all its worth checking out in the early evening (or even in the day time if you are timid) just to see the spectacle. But again.. easily avoidable if you don't stay in a hotel in that area. To me Amsterdam is about the canals, flowers, walking around at night looking at all of the lit up bridges, really nice art and antique galleries, and the cafes. If you are a museum person (I am not) there are many and I hear they are some of the best in Europe. Of course there are lots and lots of bikes - you can't comprehend the amount of bikes until you visit - they are everywhere. Amsterdam in general is a very clean city. The people are laid back, most speak English, and most are tall and skinny! Amsterdam is pretty small (at least the parts you'll visit) so you can walk or bike around almost everywhere. The trams are easy to use, but watch out for them as they run on the streets - which is actually very convenient as opposed to the underground subways in London and other cities where it takes 10 minutes to get back to street level. Definitely take a boat ride through the canals, but try to get the smaller open top boats (if its nice out) instead of the large canal buses. The large canal boats might be a little cheaper but they are packed full of tourists and you really can't see out as well. The small open boats are great, you can bring drinks and the driver will tell you all about what you are seeing. Good way to get lots of pictures.. definitely worth the extra money. In fact, if you have lots of money, you can rent out a private canal boat that comes with a driver and drinks/food and cruise the canals - go in the late afternoon/ early evening as its getting dark and bring a sweater. Fusion Suites is very close to Vondel park, and I recommend walking over to the Film Museum in the park (you can see this place from the front of the hotel) and sitting in the cafe up on the large balcony. We never actually went into the museum, just had some nice drinks in the cafe - great view. Its really nice in the park during the day, and a good break from the nearby Leidseplein area which can be very crowded and a bit touristy (certainly not a bad area though). Definitely rent a bike for a day or longer (there is a place very close to the hotel) and ride through the whole park and the museum areas. Then if you feel brave enough ride through the canals.. but start in the park to get comfortable. Check out the Remplantplein area for the cafes and the Jordaan area for walking around the canals and seeing where people actually live. In my opinion the best parts of Amsterdam are the least touristy.. and consequently the least crowded. Taxis can be expensive, they are all very nice Mercedes, so try to negotiate the price upfront before you go anywhere. Sometimes they are worth the money (at night if the lady has on high heels and have a ways to go) other times its better to take a tram or just walk.

There is not much I can add to the detailed descriptions of the suites, amenities, and service already well described in other reviews. I picked Fusion Suites based on the TripAdvisor reviews, but was somewhat concerned, first, with whether the place could really be that good, second, with staying in a four suite facility, and third, with its location, which struck me as perhaps a bit \"far away\" from central Amsterdam. All of my concerns evaporated within a few hours of check in. The rave reviews are spot on, and, if anything, are probably unable to convey adequately what a wonderful place this is. If you just have to have a gym, bar, restaurant, business center (although you get a personal computer plus wi-fi), or walk out the door and be smack in the middle of the crowds in central Amsterdam, then maybe this four suite facility might not be your cup of tea. Otherwise it is perfect. The location turns out to be a plus. It is in a lovely, tranquil mostly residential area, yet close and convenient to everything. We love to walk and the center of town is a short walk away. Tram stops are even closer, if you do not want to walk, and there are a number of good restaurants and shops really close. It is close to the museum district, and the high end shopping street in that area. But best of all, as so many have noted, is the welcome and assistance provided by Sharmila and Alex. They are a delightful couple, she makes a great breakfast, they provide excellent restaurant and other recomendations, and a warm welcome and the feeling that your hosts are your friends. We were fortunate enough to have dinner with Alex our last night (Sharmila was visiting her monther), and being able just to sit and talk with him over dinner was a highlight of our stay. To conclude, the title of this review says it all. We quickly felt that our suite was our \"Home in Amsterdam,\" and not just a nice hotel.

This is by far one of the most incredible hotels we have ever stayed in.

It had ample space for storage and a bathroom about half the size of the room, with marble floors, a clawfoot tub and l'Occitane toiletries. The room was decorated beautifully with a very elegant wallpaper behind the bed, a little couch by the huge windows which look out onto a little private garden, and a very comfortable bed. Wireless and minibar access are free and a plasma TV is provided with international channels. Apart from the comfortable amenities, the real charm of this hotel lies with its owners. Alex and Sharmila are wonderful people and ideal hosts. Right after we checked in, we had a knock on our door and there was Alex with a bottle of Champagne! They also left a bottle of wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon in our room on another day, which was much appreciated. They provided us with very apt restaurant recommendations - we ate at De Kas and Marius during our stay, and both were incredible. Sharmila's excellent breakfasts are just the icing on the cake. Every morning we had tasty and healthy egg-white omelettes, organic yogurt, fresh-cut fruit, expertly pulled espressos and Sharmila's signature Grand Marnier mini-pancakes.

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try it out. Facilities in the room include wireless Internet, and my room actually had a PC in it. I think the other rooms do too. By the way, my room was huge for a European hotel. It was as large as a typical US King Size room. The windows have secondary double glazing, so even though my room overlooked a fairly busy side street, I didn't notice any noise. My bathroom was a separate room, which was also huge. All of the fittings were top quality. The shower pressure wasn't great, but to be honest it wasn't much worse than other European hotels. I've certainly had worse in Hiltons and Sheratons - especially in London! Individual coffee machine in the room. Not just a kettle and instant coffee, but a \"cartridge\" style espresso machine. Amazing! There was a safe in the wardrobe for your valuables, plus hair dryer, iron, and various other odds and ends. They also provided a pair of slippers!

I didn't check if there were plates and silverware, but there may well have been. I'm sure the owners would provide some anyway. Might be useful if you're staying for a long time and get fed up of restaurant food. Breakfast is around a single, large table (remember only 4 rooms), and you can make requests for specific meals (within reason) if you ask ahead. Endless coffee, and freshly squeezed orange juice. I suppose you might not feel completely comfortable if you're the shy, retiring type. But we actually stayed there as a group and took all 4 rooms anyway. Think of it as a great way to meet new people! By the way, I don't know if they provide any meal other than breakfast. You can always ask I suppose, but we found dozens of great restaurants were only 5-10 minutes walk away. Check out the \"Solo\" restaurant near the concert hall, for example. The location is reasonably central, I don't know Amsterdam that well, but it was an easy 10 minute walk to the concert hall square, for example. When you're there, check out the houses down the street that are each modelled after a particular country style (Spain, Russia, etc.) it's cute. The staff are very friendly and really can't do enough for you. Very attentive. Like most Dutch people they speak perfect English, and probably speak half a dozen other languages too. If you're fed up of faceless, chain hotels and want to try out something a bit more personal, this hotel is highly recommended. In fact, even if you're not fed up of chain hotels, stay there anyway because this is a true \"quality hotel\" experience! I will definitely be staying there again next time I go to Holland.

Our room (#1) - again absolutely spotless - was decorated in understated opulence and contained the worlds most comfortable bed. The L'Occitaine toiletries were a blissful treat for the senses and if that were not enough the fresh flowers in the room ( we had delphiniums and peonies) made it just perfect to 'come home to' at the end of a hard days sight seeing.

I am fortunate to discover the Fusion suites (formerly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153number 40\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). I just cannot say enough about the wonderful atmosphere, beautifully decorated rooms and the WARM hospitality of the owners Sharmila and Alex of the Fusion suites. It is a gem located close to the museum district, the Vondel Park and the most popular shopping street PC Hooftstrasse. It is a 5min walks from the Leidsaplane where there are many good restaurants and tram routes available. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and individually decorated. Every room has a huge bed with the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on, comfortable sitting area with a comfy sofa and chair, study desk with your own computer and the internet access/fax machine, TV, CD/DVD player and a coffee machine to make you feel at home. The breakfast is provided in the warm atmosphere of the beautifully decorated kitchen. Sharmila makes sure you have everything you need for the breakfast; baked goods, meats, cheeses, yogurts, eggs, cereals, fresh fruits and morning beverages. At Fusion suites I feel like home and with Sharmila and Alex, I truly feel like I am visiting friends. Fusion suites was the best kept secret in Amsterdam, but I guess not anymore :-).

From the moment we contacted the owners via email, we were made to feel very welcome and were already looking forward to our stay. The location is perfect, less than 5 mins from Museumplein and on the edge of Vondelpark. Our room was one of the Grand Suites on the top floor, very tastefully decorated and furnished, and had a new bathroom including a jacuzzi bath & huge rainshower. Sharmila & Alex welcomed us with a chilled bottle of champagne, just the way to start any holiday! Breakfast was perfect and as well as lovely pastries, meats & cheeses, there was something a little special on offer every morning. We would definitely recommend & urge any of our friends to stay here. As an example of the owner's thoughtfulness, when we checked out and left our luggage for safe keeping, we said to take care with a half bottle of wine we were saving for our long wait at the airport. When we arrived back later that day to to collect our luggage, we were given a couple of plastic wineglasses. That's the sort of personal touch that makes Fusion Suites unique. We had a great stay in Amsterdam (first visit for me) and walked and walked, the best way of seeing this beautiful city. Although the canal bus is pretty good too and very relaxing. [I would recommend buying a day pass which is valid until 12 midday the following day; also prebook your ticket for the Anne Frank museum if that's on your list as you can avoid the long queues - good places for both of these is at the information booth on Leidesplein only 5 mins from the hotel].
