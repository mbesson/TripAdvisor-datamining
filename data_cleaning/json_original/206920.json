Now my stay will forever be marred by my checkout experience. PROS: - Great location: 2 blocks from Arc de Triomf metro stop, less than 10 mins walk to Placa Cataluyna/La Rambla/Casa Battlo. Less than 10 euros to La Barcelonetta, but easy transfer via Metro. - Energy Efficient: need room key to turn on lights - Helpful staff: Most front desk staff spoke English, so it was easy to communicate and get directions. Provided wake up calls and held our luggage until our room was ready. CONS: - The walls are super thin. We could hear everything in the hallways from our room. - The shower: it's completely strange how it only covers half of the bath. A taller/bigger person will unavoidably get the bathroom floor wet. - Internet: it's almost 11 euros per 24 hour period but the service was spotty and sometimes slow. - Bill: this was the reason they didn't get 4 stars...at checkout, they charged me for a drink that I supposedly had at the bar. I explained that there had been a mistake, that I'd never been at the bar because I didn't even know there was a bar. The clerk kept insisting that it was my bill, even after I pointed out that someone had written a different room number on the top of the receipt. I ended up having to pull out my ID with my signature to prove that it wasn't me. All this for 3 euros! It was a bit offensive. GOOD TO KNOW FOR AMERICAN TRAVELERS - There is no converter in the room. You can charge your phone in the lobby for 1 euro for half hour or 2 euros for a full hour. We bought one at a hardware store for 1,35 that worked with our iPod, iPad, Blackberry and two different types of camera batteries. - There's no iron in the room. You have to send your items to the laundry. - The TV has only 3 English-speaking channels: BBC, CNBC, Russia Today. Last one isn't a big deal, but if it's rainy and you want to stay in, your TV viewing options are limited. -", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "Peter1Northampton", "ReviewID": "UR127911043", "Content": "This is a well located hotel for the Gothic quarter and the port.

There was a hair dryer which was very useful also. We often asked a lady behind reception for directions towards attractions and she was very helpful and spoke fluent English.

Bodily secretions from the previous day proved the telltale sign. Upon reporting this matter to the hotel staff, the intimated that they knew exactly which employee was responsible for the debacle, and that they would be duly reprimanded. I stopped getting mints on my pillows. - Whilst the pool enjoys a brilliant, secluded location atop a building in the city centre, we found to our surprise that someone had left, what I later found out, the locals termed a 'turdburger'.

The hotel is about 5 mins walk from the Arc de Triomf metro station, easy to get to from Barcelona airport - we caught the Aeroport RENFE train to Barcelona Sants and changed to another RENFE train on platform 8 that passed through Catalunya and then Arc de Triomf, took about half an hour. (Aeroport trains seem to run every half hour.) Behind the Arc de Triomf is a really lovely park, with access to the Zoo, and the Gothic Quarter is just next to the park so the hotel is quite close to some great places to wander. Didn't try the pool, or the hotel breakfast - instead we wandered out and found a lovely artisan bakery near the metro station & across from the Arc that did great pastries (can highly recommend the canya xocolata which is like a chocolate puff pastry roll).

Then through the door to the bathroom with medium-sized bath with shower above, toilet and bidet. Plenty of toiletries were provided in this suite. If you require a baby cot as we did, it might feel a little tight for space when the sofa bed is pulled out, however, you may not spend so much time in there to become a huge problem. For us, it was a proper family room, in that there was separate areas for adults and children when required - provided by a sliding partition door between bedroom and sofabed/sitiing room. A TV in each area also allowed the kids to be entertained by the children's programmes and not be bored with the news channels etc. Unfortunately, the signal was poor on several channels on both TVs. The availability of a kettle is also invaluable to a family with a baby or if you just want a hot drink without leaving the room. We ordered room service, which took a little too long to arrive, but the quality of the food was very high and tasted delicious. Breakfast as stated on other reviews is expensive, but again, high quality and tasty. Typical continental breakfast choices with scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages as a hot choice.

The positive features included its location within easy walking distance of attractive boutiques, department stores, and Catalonia Square--central Barcelona--as well as Las Ramblas; situated in a predominantly residential area thereby avoiding the more noisy main thoroughfares and intimidating traffic; and, general overall cleanliness. The two double beds were comfortable. The bathroom amenities were well presented and included the recurring European hotel offerings of a small bar of soap, shower gel, toothbrush with toothpaste, shower cap, disposable razor, shampoo, hair conditioner, and installed hair dryer with more than adequate generous guest towels--quite nice actually. The negatives: ?Inexperienced or at least inattentive front desk staff that practically ignored my standing there attempting to await acknowledgement of my presence despite having no other guests in queue. Tiny elevators that were slow to respond to their call. Split level rooms that required guests to step UP into the bathroom--which in the nighttime darkness, seeking not to awaken my wife by turning on a light, posed a definite safety hazard. Nonfunctional air-conditioning...upon leaving the room. Your room key card was required to be plugged into a central switch within the room to power on the electrical fixtures such as lights, television and air conditioning. Leaving the room necessitated your removal of the keycard, thus turning off all the electrical accessories. After a busy, tiring hot day of touring to return to essentially an unairconditioned hotel room toasting at 28-29 degrees Centigrade was most intolerable. The thermostat in my mother's room could not even be set lower than 24 degrees Centigrade--forcing her into bed essentially unclothed with her window open. It was well into the wee hours of the night before she actually became comfortable enough to actually sleep. The bell captain/bell hop lost a piece of our luggage--even though clearly marked with two labels as belonging to me. Eventually the suitcase was found in another guest's room later that night. That hotel guest was kind enough to deliver my luggage directly to our room, thereby avoiding the hotel staff, which was greatly appreciated. The breakfast provided with the room reservation was a continental style buffet, with toast being the only warmed food available other than coffee or hot water for tea. My mother requested cranberry juice which was unavailable. Some of the food selections were unfamiliar to us. It would have been thoughtful to have included signs identifying the food presented.

I never ate anything other then breakfast at the hotel though but it looked quite expensive.

The location of the hotel is really good, about 10minutes walking to the El Corte Ingles department store, the Ramblas and a short metro ride from the exhibition areas of Montjuic and also Gran Via. It was about a 3 minute walk to the metro station, and Barcelona really has a nice metro network. You're never far from anything. Its not a luxury hotel, but a good upscale one with all the amenities. The room was quite big with a nice view of the front side and looking on pretty old buildings. They had a small but adequate gym and a roof toop pool area, although the water was quite cold in the pool. But the warm sun compensated for that. The breakfast was good and not too expensive, but I wished they had more different kinds of cheeses and more vegetarian options, but then again spain is big on meat. The staff was really nice and helpful, and did their best to help me out and delivered as promised. My only complaint is that the soundproofing is not that great, and you can hear your neighbours TV going on. But I hear from a friend of mine who used to stay in Barcelona quite a lot that the soundproofing is not that good all over Barcelona. So I would stay here again on business or if travelling alone, but my wife is a light sleeper so maybe not with her. Overall I recommend this hotel for business people and tourists alike as the price level was not too bad even if I was staying there during a large exhibition. Then again I booked quite early. But if you are one of those who wakes up with the slightest sound, choose some place else. Personally I liked it and would recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel, great for business or tourists\u201d", "Author": "alissa024", "ReviewID": "UR7237866", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel at the expense of another NH hotel (Duc la Victoria) over booking.

The hotel is only a 10 min walk from Placa Catalunya and not even a 5 min walk to the closest metro (Uranquioa). We found taxis to be rather cheap so all in all location wasn't even an issue.
