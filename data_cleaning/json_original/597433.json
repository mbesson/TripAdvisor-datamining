{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Tiny room with no amenities I selected the Mexan for a one night stay between airflights due to its proximity to the airport. Neither the taxi driver or the taxi dispatcher at the airport knew where it was, even with a written address (albeit in English.) The dispatcher looked it up in a book and explained it to the driver. We arrived late at night, tired from much travel. This was the end of a 30 day trip. It was the ONLY hotel in all of China that did not provide drinking water. The room was tiny. Thought it would be fun to watch the harbour, but it was noisy and closing the shades was tricky. We requested a wake-up call that never came - maybe it is good that it was noisy! Breakfast was not included, and we were not offered any. Although the hotel is near the airport express train, it does require a taxi to get to the train, and the (English speaking) driver convinced us to take the cab the whole way, which ended up costing us an additional $10 US.", "Date": "May 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR691458089", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HappyTravelerSF"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel Its a very nice place to stay, facing the docks tho but from 7-9 am lift operated by hotel staff and the toilet got a feel of japan, maybe the sliding door.
