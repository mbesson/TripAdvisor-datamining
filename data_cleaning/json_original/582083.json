Breakfast is 11 Euros each(expensive and we never had it) so we walked round the corner where there are plenty of bars offering good deals for breakfast..we never paid more than 7 Euros for both of us.

This location was perfect for all of this. The nightlife is great, safe and the people are so friendly. SAFE location. I was out late with (local) friends most nights, and never felt unsafe returning to the hotel at any hour. I was also able to shop at local grocery stores - very convenient. Pros: 1) The location of this hotel is perfect! It is 2 blocks from the Hospital Clinic metro station (south of the hotel), which connects you to most anywhere you want to go. This is a mostly residential area, with a few schools nearby. (I chose this location because it was close to my friends' homes.) 2) There are many restaurants/cafes, grocery stores, and bars/clubs very close to the hotel. 3) Room and bathroom were clean. 4) Staff was friendly, accomodating, and helped me with my Catalan/Spanish. Cons: *) Room (#41) was a decent size, for being in the city. However, this room was next to the elevator, which is very noisy when doors open/close or when the elevator stops/starts. The room was also facing the street, which can be noisy at times, but no more than you would expect in a busy city. 1) A/C - Air works fine. However, after 4 days my air conditioning was turned off by the hotel - literally, the vent was blocked, preventing air from getting into the room. This caused me to not be able to sleep 1 night, as I had to wait until the morning (I thought) to have the maintenance team work on it. In the morning, I told the front desk, and they turned it back on immediately. This happened again 2 days later, and yet again 2 days after that (total of 3 times); each time, I told the front desk and they turned it back on immediately. This would not be an issue, if there was a fan to circulate air within the room. The window only opens slightly, so unless there is a southern breeze, it is useless. The room becomes stuffy and hot without the A/C on. 2) Elevator noise - was very loud. 3) Phone Calls/Messages - I received several phone calls from friends here in Barcelona. The front desk tried to get to me, but I was not available in my room. My friends left messages, but the hotel does not notify you that you have any messages. 4) TV/Cable: - Small (approx. 13\") TV. Since I was out most each day, this really did not bother me; however, if you want to spend a day watching the games, it's not the best TV. - Limited channels (about 14); most are News - late at night, several become \"contest\" (phone-in) shows. Overall, this is a great little hotel in a non-tourist part of town.

When we arrived on the first day, there was a mini fridge in our room that was operating but the a/c in our room was not working. It was about 33 degrees at the time. We went to reception to inform them that there was no a/c in our room and it seemed that they were well aware there was no a/c and offered us the use of a small table fan \"for now\" as there were no other rooms available at the moment. As we had no other alternative, we accepted the use of the small fan and opened our window and suffered through the heat and noise of the street for that night. The next day, we were moved to another room - with operational a/c and a mini fridge. When we arrived at this room, the a/c was working - but the mini fridge was not so we could not keep any water or anything cold - and boy was it warm. Again, we went back to the reception to report the fridge not working and a male receptionist told us very firmly that we were \"expecting too much from a hotel which is only rated as a 2-star hotel\". Now we were really ticked off and I demanded to speak to the hotel manager once again. Upon speaking to the hotel manager, I told him that if he could not provide us with the service that we have paid for, then please send us to an alternate hotel - where we will receive the services that we have paid for and we are expecting. He said he would \"see what he could do by tomorrow morning\". The next day, yet again we were given our third room - on the top floor of the hotel, the 5th floor - where everything was working o.k. until our last night's stay. When we arrived back at the hotel in the evening from sightseeing during the day, we were told by a female receptionist that \"we have had some problems with the elevator today and I am sorry but you will have to walk upstairs to your room and I am not sure if the elevator will even be working by tomorrow\". She continued on by saying that \"we even had to call the fire department\". Now we were wondering what really took place here while we were away from the hotel all day and walking up a total of approximately 102 steps was not our idea of fun after walking for many hours already. Once we went up to our room and turned on the faucet in the bathroom, we noticed that the water must have been shut off for a time as the water coming out of the faucet was flowing irregularly as if it had been shut off for a time. We went for dinner and came back to our room and now noticed that the mini fridge in our room was no longer working and through the night, the a/c also stopped working as well. The next morning, we walked down the several flights of stairs to the basement to have breakfast and we noticed that there were only a few people in the breakfast room. Of course, not many people would enjoy walking up and down over 100 steps. However, as it was our last day, we thought we would have breakfast and get our things ready and check out. There was now an OUT OF ORDER sign on the elevators and we asked the receptionist if there was someone that could help us with our luggage from the 5th floor. We were told that there was only 1 guy available \"as everyone else is in the basement cleaning up the mess as a water pipe had burst\". Now we knew why our water was running intermittent the previous day. The photos on the internet do not do this hotel justice and I would not recommend staying at this hotel for anymore that a day. You just never know what will happen next and living like this - on your vacation - is extremely unpleasant. It was no use taking your things out of the suitcase as every other day we changed rooms.

Room was big with smart bathroom and, as I requested, I had a bathroom with a tub rather than just a shower. I travelled to the hotel from the airport via train and metro which took over two hours but returned via the airport bus (from Placa d'Espagna) and taxi which was only 25 minutes in all and a few Euros more expensive (lots of stairs and few escalators in metro, so the bus is easier if you have lots of luggage and/or mobility problems). As a woman travelling alone, I felt the area where the hotel is situated was very safe and only about 20 minutes door to door to La Rambla area via metro. The Barcelona Card is a great way to get around the city and have discounts/free entry/travel to various attractions (check out the municipal swimming baths/leisure centre, Passeig Maritime, near the Olympic towers, 8 pools, sauna etc, entry was only 6 Euros open until midnight in the week). I bought my Barcelona Card at the airport but they are on sale at tourist offices etc. The only problem that I had with the hotel was the traffic noise but I invested \u00a31 in some earplugs which cut all sound.
