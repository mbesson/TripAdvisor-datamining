It is conceniently located 2-minutes from Passeig de Gracia metro station and a 10-minute walk from Placa de Catalunya. Around the corner from the hostel is Casa Batllo, a work by Antoni Gaudi and the 'hop-on, hop-off' tourist bus stops just outside this building. Although this is a lovely area, it is also filled withjexpensive designer shops; don't expect to pick up some locally-sourced gifts from nearby-you'll have to go further afield. The hostel itself is clean and tidy. The beds are generously large for a single, but they could benefit from fitting a bed-side light for each bed (during the night you have to risk waking up everyone sleeping in your room by turning on the main room light or risk fumbling around in the dark). The hostel would be able to accommodate people in wheelchairs but this would have to rely on someone opening the heavy external door and using two lifts to get to the first floor.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New york City", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hostel\u201d", "Author": "Dolbers", "ReviewID": "UR122472246", "Content": "I just wanted to express my gratitude for a wonderful group of individuals at the Sant Jordi Arago Hostel.

Reminded me of a dorm room/ frat house. Lots to do, everyone was really friendly. Besides all the fun that went on there, there was one minor setback.

Yet Great Location\u201d", "Author": "GQ_Trippin", "ReviewID": "UR30418579", "Content": "Hostel- This place is small and very rowdy at night. A lot of young traveler\u2019s stay here and it\u2019s a party zone. We had rough nights sleep here because it was so loud outside. Room- Small bunks and cramped. Staff- Not so accommodating. Shower- Out in hallway and shared. Location- Great location; right next to Gaudi\u2019s House Museum and walking distance to La Rambla. Underground metro is just a short block away. Attraction- We booked a bike tour with Fat Tire and it was completely worth it. A great way to see the city and learn a little bit of culture. Tip- The location is great and it\u2019s reasonably price. Perhaps that\u2019s enough to sacrifice a good nights sleep.

The location is perfect, you're a 5-10 min walk from La Rambla and the metro station is a 2 minute walk. The best part of this hostel was the 'home' feeling that you get - it is a small hostel but the living area has a TV with DVDs as well as free internet. There are evening plans almost every night to meet up with other Sant Jordi hostel travellers and there's \u20ac2 breakfast served by Linda, who is the hardest-working, most welcoming hostel staffer ever!! Definitely recommend this place to stay - just be prepared for a smaller than usual hostel.

My partner and I booked a 6-bed mixed dorm, but were disappointed to be sleeping in a shoebox room that had hardly any room to move, no cooling, no ventilation and no secure storage spaces. Also of concern was the fact that there are only 2 showers and 2 toilets to cater for ALL the guests in the hostel. I would guess that the capacity is around 30-40 people which really isn't good enough. To compound matters, 1 toilet was continually blocked and the other didn't have a seat which was not appreciated by my girlfriend! My other gripe is the noise. The common living space is rather close to the dorms and can get quite noisy at all hours. Positives of the hostel were the free internet and social life. All in all, we expected more from such a well-regarded hostel. There are plenty of happy customers it would seem, so I hope their experiences were better than ours!", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sant Jordi Arago Hostel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d626116-Reviews-Sant_Jordi_Arago_Hostel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$37 - $44*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Arago 268, Principal 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08009</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "626116", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/da/8d/da8dc1eff89baca47c004668c98c80271large.jpg"}}
