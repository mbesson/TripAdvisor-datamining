Considering the prices that were in the city center this hotel was a very good price quality deal. The room was very clean, the toiletries products good, the breakfast (which we had it included in the room price) was also rich so till now no downsides but it is important to mention that in the lobby we had free access to Wi-Fi only 1h/day. This was not a pleasant surprise as we knew from the beginning we will have free internet in the lobby, we didn't expected to be limited to 1h. And another minus was the temperature in the room. I have read other reviews mentioning that it was very hot in their room. I would like to mention that in our room was cold in the night. We had a button for adjusting the heat in the room but it didn't seem to work. Maybe it would be good if each room could adjust its own heat. The persons from the reception were kind and willing to help. Overall if it would be to go again to Madrid we would stay at this hotel.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Vendrell, Spain", "Title": "\u201cOnly a short bus ride away from the museums\u201d", "Author": "SandieBarcelona", "ReviewID": "UR124890581", "Content": "This hotel is located in a quiet part of Madrid, but only a short metro/bus ride away from the museums and the centre.

The carpet not in really good state. The lady receptionist was nice. She gave us map and directions. The male receptionist who replaced her was not so very helpful.

The staff were helpful - Racquel was particularly good, she recommended us where to go for chocolate and churros and how best to get to the various museums we wanted to visit. The location however, is not great. It's around a ten-fifteen minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Delicias) and then a ten minute ride into town. It's not ridiculously far, but if you're only in Madrid on a short city break, you do spend quite a bit of time just getting into the city centre. It's also not so close to Atocha station - that's around a fifteen-twenty minute walk along a busy main road. I didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as I found it rather overpriced - there are coffee shops nearby, but I ended up buying some ham, cheese and bread in a supermarket and eating this for breakfast each day. The rooms were pretty average. They were clean and the bathroom toiletries were fantastic - sponges, shoe polisher, a razor, toothbrushes and toothpaste, cologne - along with the usual shampoo, body wash and shower caps. The shower was powerful and the bathroom was spotless. My room was also clean - the bed was comfy enough, but the carpets and curtains were outdated and the view was...well, there was no view.

The room was fine, nothing to complain about there. The area was not. Firstly, it says on their website that they are next to Atocha station... they are nowhere near Atocha station! The closest underground station is 5 blocks away and it's not as far as Atocha station. There are very, very few restaurants in the area and we were told that the hotel restaurant was closed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, although it advertised in the hotel that it was open every night. This meant wandering around trying to find a decent place to eat. In the end we used taxis to get to and from Central Madrid to find some decent food. The night before we left we asked at reception if we could use the computer to check in online and the receptionist gave us a voucher with a password on, all well and good. When I asked if we could print out our boarding passes he said there was no printer although he was standing next to one. We tried to check in anyway but the website was in Spanish, obviously. Having very little Spanish we clicked the facility to translate the site to English, but hey, guess what, it didn't work. We checked in next morning at the airport! If we aver return to Madrid, which I doubt, we will certainly not be staying at the Atocha.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "DavidfromOz", "ReviewID": "UR113349261", "Content": "We stayed there twice on our way to / from Morocco.

Fantastic bathroooms complete with lots of free toiletries, and rooms were well insulated from any street noise. Location is a 20 minute hike straight up the road to the main railway station (also an historic icon) and the cultural precinct with all its parks and the Royal Botanic gardens, as well as the amazing Prada museum. If the walk is a bit much, it's easy to get a taxi. WiFi is available but you have to buy it, although you can get it for free in the foyer area. Breakfast isn't included and seemed very expensive, so we ate at cafes in the street. Staff are helpful and friendly and were very efficient organising a taxi to the airport - which is a looong way away.

Just buy the tourist metro ticket for 3 days and you never have to pay for buses or metros even to the airport. Because of this we found the location quite convenient and travelled easily all over the city. The room was a bit small and dark and looked out onto a central well, but it was comfortable and clean and the bathroom was very well equipped.

Despite of its name and description, the building is not really close to Atocha, especially if you are dragging your bags.

We booked the hotel through Expedia and the offer said \u201cwi-fi\u201d as one of the special features of the package we bought. However, when we arrived to the hotel, the receptionist just said (in those rude Spanish manners) that we had to pay for the internet, even in the computer located in the lobby (5 EUR for 45 mins\u2026 in the locutorios 5 mins walking is 35 cents for 45 minutes). To make things worse, when we checked out we were asked to pay again ignoring the booking already made and paid through Expedia. The receptionist didn\u2019t even know the existence of Expedia and refused to believe that you have to pay beforehand in a booking of this kind. This is particularly impressive for a hotel that seems to be part of a wide chain in Spain and other European countries. When we arrived at 1 a.m. to the hotel, the front entrance was closed and the receptionist came, with the guests\u2019 list printed to check our names before letting us in through a side door by the parking entrance. Very below average, isn\u2019t it? Re the room, it was good, clean and with many toiletries.

The only thing I would criticise is the restaurant. There are two restaurants, one inside the hotel, and the other just at the side of the hotel, which is also owned by the hotel.
