Great new hotel that opened in Nov 11 at Darling Harbour. Entrance via casino or Ultimo side. We were given a great welcome from Peter at reception who was professional and seamless. Peter ensured a very smooth check-in and that our needs were met. Very impressive. The room we had was modern and hip. Sony iphone player/charger, huge tv with a remote that opened the curtains, changed the air-con temp and so on. Bed,linen and pillows were divine. Slept like a baby. ( I am a bad sleeper ) Toiletries superb. Lots of dining options at The Star and a Coles across the road in Pyrmont Street. The Darling is a winner.

Upon check in, I was so impressed, the service was amazing. Once I had checked in, the lady at the front desk immediately escorted me to my room. I was surprised and I did not expect this extra service. The room looked amazing. The decor was very modern. The room had a nice big flat screen television and two comfortable beds. The bathroom was stocked with Molton Brown toiletries and accessories. The only thing I did not like about the bathroom, was there was not much privacy between the bedroom and the bathroom. There was only a wall in the middle of the bathroom, which separated the bedroom from the bathroom. This can be awkward if you need privacy. We were lucky enough to be offered a bottle of champagne and strawberries, because it was my friend's birthday. The beds in our room were very comfortable. The sheets were very soft. The room could be accessed via remote. For example if you wanted to close the blinds, turn on the television of turn off the lights, you can do so by remote. The hotel also offers robes and slippers too.

I chose this hotel as it was located near to an event I was attending, and for that it was a good choice. For me service can really make a hotel / restaurant special. Service here was excellent - from the concierge to housekeeping. There are lots of small touches that really enhanced the overall experience - from the design, music, scent (yes, the candles are gorgeous & in the spa they even pump a special blend through the air con system - great attention to detail). Room: jewel suite - separate living area with great curved sofa, lounging chairs, nespresso machine, huge tv (you could have quite a party in here!) then generously sized bedroom. Bathroom with bath & shower. Molton Brown products. Sokyo is the hotel restaurant which is great. Moodily lit, great cocktails & Japanese food. Negatives - there isn't a restaurant within the hotel open for breakfast, which is annoying. You can get room service breakfast & The Darling is also right next to (almost part of) The Star casino complex, and within that complex Bistro 80 serves breakfast. But who wants to walk past gaming floors & what feels like a slightly tacky mall to get to breakfast? Positives - the spa. Sensational. Beats The Observatory Spa. You feel absolutely cocooned here. It smells divine! You are greeted with fresh orange juice, then once changed have tea on supremely comfortable reclining loungers (artfully designed). The spa is moodily lit, & very calming. I had the hamam treatment, which was good - although I could have done with the temperature being warmer. Pool - great to have an outdoor pool & chairs to chill out at. Would I stay again? If I had an event nearby yes, if I had a night out at The Lyric Theatre or was dining at Balla or Black & wanted a night away. But just be aware that it's really part of The Star casino complex, and that's not everyone's idea of fun. But it would be great for a girls' weekend, or a night with significant other if you're foodies & are going to Balla or Momofuku or something..... Pool & spa are really worth enjoying too.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel in Sydney if you want to feel pampered ^^\u201d", "Author": "Eric H", "ReviewID": "UR125888496", "Content": "The best hotel in Sydney if you want to feel pampered ^^ you even have your own nesspresso machine I'm your room.

And the answer... well wait until the end of the review :-) First impressions were excellent - the atrium-style lobby area was impressive, spacious and beautiful. We stayed in a Jewel Spa Suite, and that too was beautiful - we particularly loved the large round spa bath set in an alcove of Bisazza (style?) tiles - delicious! Next stop we headed to the outdoor pool. Although close to the city, the feeling we got whilst we sipped our cocktails at the very attractive pool bar was that we had escaped to a resort for the weekend... we felt like we were on holiday, which is no mean feat for a city hotel. After spending the evening checking out a couple of the bars and restaurants in the Star complex we headed back to the room for some much needed relaxation. The only downside we could find is that there are no spa facilities available for hotel guests, unless you pay for a treatment.

Finding the carpark on arrival was easy enough, although be prepared to pay around $50 per day for parking unless you can earn free parking in the casino. Some sort of carparking deal when one is paying $300+ per night would be appreciated. From the carpark, The Darling was well signposted and we were soon greeted by a friendly team of staff. The staff of The Darling are a real asset, they were always willing to help and were very friendly. It is refreshing to see staff who are very genuine and helpful. The room was spacious enough for an entry level suite, and I personally liked the open plan style bathroom. The decor was very tasteful and the modern innovations took the room to the next level. The TV accepted all sorts of media including iPhone and iPad, and the room was easily controlled electronically using the TV or the buttons situated around the room. The shower with the rain-style head was enjoyable and so was the European wand, but it took a considerable amount of time to heat up to the desired temperature. The minibar was expensive ($18 for a small bag of cashews) and the automated pressure sensors which automatically bill your account upon removing items seemed over the top somewhat. The Nespresso machine in the room with complimentary pods was an outstanding feature as we could enjoy quality coffee at any time of day. We enjoyed breakfast at the Garden Buffet but it would be nice to see this included or discounted. We were above the pool and it sounded like an argument broke out during the night on the pool deck, but this is to be expected in a communal location. The promity to the gaming floor was great for those who like to see the action at any time of day, but some may not appreciate this. Under the fruit bowl we found some dirt and a black hair which indicates the cleanliness may be an issue, although the remainder of the room was spotless. Apart from a few minor things as above, I really enjoyed my stay here and hope to return in the future.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVegas night in Sydney\u201d", "Author": "Pangari", "ReviewID": "UR123386110", "Content": "Stayed mid week for a Las Vegas experience in Sydney.

They're obviously going for super-friendly Australian informal service, which we are quite happy with, as long as it remains efficient. Georgia on the front desk was certainly super-friendly, very chatty, but still remained quick and efficient. For some reason we were upgraded to a Jewel suite instead of the Darling room I originally booked, and what a pleasant surprise. On the 8th floor we had a great view of the pool which looks like it would be a real party venue if only the sun would shine. Absolutely loved the room - everything about it from the decor, the bathroom, the Molton Brown goodies, the Nespresso machine, the blackout blinds, the two teles, etc etc. I would highly recommend the hotel for parents who want to escape their children for the weekend (under 18's not allowed by the pool)... mind you none of the staff looked much over 18. As it was not busy (constant gloomy weather and rain), the staff had nothing to do but hang around and gossip and chat, and they are all so young and gorgeous it's like being in a nightclub. (note to management - tell them to keep their voices down when guests are trying to relax and read the paper - the odd very loud \"shhhhhhhhh\" from one of the older crew doesn't really do the trick!). Still, I don't want to complain too much as despite being very old and crusty (over 45), we really loved the cool and groovy atmosphere of the hotel - the interior decor is truly inspirational. Only thing that might concern some international guests is that there is no in house breakfast available other than room service, and their flagship restaurant is not open lunchtimes or Sunday nights. Bit unusual for a 5 star hotel. But being in Pyrmont there are lots of groovy eating options nearby, so not a huge problem. Stay here for the pool, proximity to Casino and Momofuku (although we were underwhelmed by our meal), and the up to the minute decor and great rooms.
