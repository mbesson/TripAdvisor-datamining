It is like a senior citizen Hotel. If you are going with your kids or are younger than 50, save yourself the trouble and do not come here. I had 5 rooms rented out, like I always do, and we always have a great time. The cops were called on us at 10:00 for being to loud, which the cops even said was ridiculous. They were told there was underage drinking. Everyone in our party was of age. I guess we just all dont look 80. Everything is dark at 8:00. No noise is allowed. The new person they have in the Lobby, Not Diane or Debbie, is the rudest women I have ever seen or talked to in my life. She was rude to the entire group we were with. The older people were allowed to have bottles of wine with wine glasses at the pool, however we were not. We were harrassed and harrassed constantly. This was the worst time ever and the older people were just rude. Save yourself the time and do not bother coming to this hotel unless you are older and dont like to have fun past 8:00 in the evening. Also the glass sliding door was broke, service was awful, didnt get any new towels for the next day. Was really upset to be treated so badly. If we were being to loud by the pool all they had to do was ask us to quiet down. That I can understand. But the treatment of the staff at this hotel was horrible. The older women in the lobby took upon herself to be rude to my children, and when told that I would speak to Debbie, she said go ahead it wont change anything and threw her arms up.

Many times when you walk into the lobby of most motels, \"off the street\", you are given the highest rate. Not so with the Magic Carpet. We rented a two bedroom (four beds) with full kitchen on a Monday for $80 for the night. We had two balconies...lots of room for the kids to play inside and on the grassy grounds. A beautiful HEATED outdoor pool, which was great because it ended up being a rainy, dreary day. They even had pool toys! The rooms were very clean with tiled floors, the beds were super comfortable. Two TV's, microwave, pans, dishes, silverware.... The Taiwanese lady who ran the place was very sweet and always had a smile on her face.
