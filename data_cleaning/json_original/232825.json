And that has to be taken in to consideration when booking here... It's cheap because it's not exactly a five star hotel, but the location is fantastic and as I went there with my brother and two friends on a \"lads weekend\" it was ideal. Yes the room was basic and quite old fashioned but it was clean and the en suite was a very good size and more modernised than the room. The reception was run down and quite tatty, as was the outside but that really didn't bother us as it didn't change the fact the room was perfect for what we needed it for...getting ready to hit the amazing nightlife and sleeping!!!", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201conly if you are not alone and want a great location hotel\u201d", "Author": "altafrahman", "ReviewID": "UR116036022", "Content": "It is very close to Puerta del Sol - the heart of Madrid, Callao metro station, Plaza Mayor and Grand Via. There are so many places to do shopping, eating and enjoying street activities. Hands down - the placement of the hotel is perfect. For a single person it cost me 50 per night (it would have been same if I checked in with another person). it was not worthy for me. But it is great price for 1+ people. But I was disappointed with everything else - the room had old furnitures, AC worked very slowly, the corridors were dark and gloomy, 14 inch tube-tv was probably 20 years old. And they said \"internet access is available\". But there is no way you can use internet from your room (not even if you are willing to pay). There should be new category saying \"internet access available from room\". Here you can use it only if you are on the lobby sofa just infront of the reception desk. They dont even have a single lounge room. It is so important to have internet access these days !!! No matter how cheap the hotel is, I am never going back there unless they improve the internet facility. And they have a notice inside the elevator saying \"renovation will start from next month\" - I wonder since when this notice has been hanging there.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally good hotel!\u201d", "Author": "giemeigi", "ReviewID": "UR115383812", "Content": "Hotel really well located, like a block from the Callao metro station.

How it got a 3 star rating is beyond me. For 40\u20ac a night you dont expect 5 star luxury but you do expect cleanliness. Hygiene is the very least they can do. Hotel is quite old inside..doesn't look anything special at all. It is being done up apparently. No restaurant, bar..in fact nothing but the room itself. They do have free internet downstairs in the lobby though. Staff were friendly enough until something went wrong. Checked in and left my stuff in the room and went out for the day. Was only later on that night when i went to get into bed that i noticed there were hairs in the bed! Lifted up the under sheet-hadnt been cleaned in ages! hairs everywhere. Disgusting. Got changed to a room next door. The girl who was working that night was nice about it and did her best for me in fairness but the following day the girl working at the reception didnt seem to bothered about what had happened. The manager was there the next day when i was checking out and neither him nor the girl at reception offered me any discount for the inconvenience. They didnt make me pay any extra for cancelling 4 out of 5 nights though which was good. Had checked in for 5 nights. Left the next day. Would not go back. Very difficlut to get any sleep..that was another issue. Not the hotel's fault obviously but i suppose that happens with such a central location. If you dont care about the problems i experienced then maybe its the place for you...it is very central. Less than a minute walk to the metro which takes u anywhere in the city. Awful place in general though, no character at all..very dreary. It just makes you think....what else do they not keep clean?", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "Thenoonans", "ReviewID": "UR29478194", "Content": "This is a very basic hotel but will be the cheapest you can find in the centre if you dont want to stay in a hostel. The lift broke down once when we were staying there and we were on the top floor. Its in a great location as it is right in the centre but if your looking for an early night you will be woken up by the noise outside. There are two irish pubs right near the hotel and they are full of life at the weekend. There are great places to eat if you dont like spanish food. There is an american place near the palace which was nice and the irish bars do food which is also nice. When visiting Madrid you need to go and see the palace (it is stunning inside and out), madrid football ground which costs around \u20ac15 & retiro park which has a lovely lake where you can hire a boat and has lovely surroundings. When you arrive at Madrid airport you can get the metro from terminal 3, if you buy a ticket for \u20ac8 each you can travel on the metro for 10 journeys which is good if you want to sightsee across the city and get to and from the airport. Plaza mayor is around a 5 min walk and it is square which has entertainer, bars and restaurants. Madrid is a beautiful city and well worth a weekend there.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camlough", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerfull\u201d", "Author": "seamusgi4szw", "ReviewID": "UR25651682", "Content": "The hotel is cheap, the staff are helpfull and pleasant, the location is excellant, very central and in a quiet street just a few meters from the Gran Via.

Thats all it needs, painted, the beds were made every day, clean towells, bathroom ok, tv worked, lift worked.... ok, new curtains needed, new carpet and paint, the place needs doing up but to be honest, we didn't go to Madrid to spend time in our room. The staff were great, all speak english and we had a few laughs at my spanish. Free internet and breakfast in any one of a 100 cafes nearby. The cafe next door will give you a carryout breakfast to take up to the wife if you ask, handy place for a nightcap as well.

If you want all this and don't want to pay a fortune obviously you have to give up on rooms quality. We've been couple of times there, and we found the worst rooms are at the upper floor where neither the lifts stops and you have to climb the stairs with your luggage; on the lower floors the rooms are slightly better, but of course there is more noise coming from the street. The price is moderate for Madrid and basically this can be a good choice if you only spend few night hours in the hotel.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Euromadrid Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d232825-Reviews-Euromadrid_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mesonero Romanos 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232825", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/58/8c/9f/habitacion-doble-twin.jpg"}}
