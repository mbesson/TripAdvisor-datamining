My wife and I had a package from England with Citalia and were initially shown a fairly large room on the fourth floor overlooking rooftops, but not recently re-furbished. It would have been adequate but we wanted the real Venetian experience so asked for an upgrade, which we were offered for an additional 50 euros per night. The room was 328 and was exactly what we had hoped for a 3-night stay in Venice. On the classic photograph of the hotel, taken from the bridge, the room is on the corner, on the floor next to the top, and has one window facing the bridge and two windows overlooking the canal. Absolute magic, particularly when the singing gondoliers went by in the afternoon! The large gondola station is 100 metres down the joining canal on the way to St Mark's Square. So, if you want the best experience from the Bonvecchiati, splash out for one of these rooms. The breakfast is superb, everything you could want, eaten either inside or under the magnificent canopies, with heaters, which allow you to watch the locals hurrying to work over the bridge, and the laundry boat collecting all the sheets and towels. In any other city the laundry collection would be a nuisance - in Venice it's a novel sight worth seeing! We certainly weren't going to use the restaurant for any other meal, with set lunch at 35 and dinner 60. It's easy to get lost when you first arrive, even with the map from the hotel website, so here are the directions for those arrriving from the airport on the Alilaguna boat to Rialto (the best stop for this hotel, save Piazza San Marco for when you have dropped off your luggage). Remember, the pedestrian streets, even those that appear to be the main ones, are very narrow and close together, so you can easily go much too far looking for your turning. The map indicates that you walk along the grand canal before turning down a street towards the hotel, but this is not so from the Alilaguna stop. Immediately in front of you when you get off is a very narrow alleyway - this is the main thoroughfare you must take! If you arrive on the actv waterbus you do have to walk a few yards away from the Rialto bridge until you get to the Alilaguna stop, then down this passage. Keep straight on across the small square after about 100 metres, then continue along Calle Goldoni for a short walk. If you then take any of the small streets on your right, and turn left after 50 metres, you will be on the road to the Bonvecchiati. Past the Serenissima hotel and round the corner and you are there. The staff are very helpful - especially Patrizia a.k.a.Tricia, from Cortina d'Ampezzo via Brighton! The decor is charming, the lifts are minute and it's usually worth walking down rather than wait. The second floor was being renovated while we were there but it certainly didn't bother us. Our initial room 408 is button 4 on the lift - room 328 is higher up and button 5! We just wanted to roam around and get the ambience of the city, which was busy with tourists despite being only March - summer must be awful, but in Spring you can soon find places that seem well away from the crowds. On a walk in Dursoduro we bought sandwiches and water from a cafe window and found a private garden attached to a museum and sat there in total peace to have our lunch, then used their washroom facilities, all free of charge. A good suggestion, if you are able to be very flexible with your trip, would be to check the ten-day forecasts for Venice online then book when you see a few days sunshine predicted. Prices for a package via Citalia from the UK seem reasonable in Spring, and there are offers such as a fourth night or room upgrade free. You might even get a last-minute special offer - we saw a deal in the Telegraph and booked from that. It was under \u00c2\u00a3300 each for three nights B&B and a return EasyJet flight from Gatwick, plus the room upgrade at around \u00c2\u00a365 and the Alilaguna from the airport for 24 euros return - you save a euro and can walk straight out of the airport past those queueing at the desk and down to the pier (10 minutes, undercover) and change your voucher there. Total cost around \u00c2\u00a3370, much cheaper than when we thought of going last September, the quotes for two were well over \u00c2\u00a31000. Finally, take full advantage of the timed passes for the waterbus. You can buy a 24, 36 or 48 hour pass (or longer) with unlimited trips on the actv vaporetto all over the lagoon. We found the 36 hour pass the best value as you can buy it in late morning one day and use it until your final trip back after dinner the following evening - all for 23 euros. As a single trip, even just one stop, is 6.50 euros it has to be good value, and you can explore as much as you like, getting off and on many times. Do not forget to validate your pass every time you get on! You only have to hold each ticket up to a machine while you are waiting, but you do not want a 52 euro fine. I don't know if they would insist, if you have a valid ticket, but I suggest you don't try to find out. We were not visiting the interiors of the buildings so two days, plus the afternoon and evening of arrival, was just sufficient to explore the San Marco district, and Dursoduro on the other side of the grand canal, on one day, and take the waterbus out to Murano and then another to Burano on day 2. Burano is a must-see (we avoided the \"free\" trip out to Murano by private boat then two hours in a glass factory and find your own way back!). I have also reported on the Grand Canal, and the Taverna San Trovaso in Dursoduro, separately, if you want to check those out. I'm sure we'll go back some day to take in all the art treasures, and would be very happy in room 328 in the Bonvecchiati.

Situated perfectly in the heart of Venice, a few minutes walk from the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, it's a great base from which to see this magical city. The room we had was superb, with a huge and luxurious bathroom. It looked out on one of the maze of canals and while there could be some noise from the boats going past, the double glazing kept it pretty quiet. If you want silence, don't come to Venice anyway! It was a shame that the restaurant was closed but there were a handful of decent places within a couple of minutes walk but the breakfast, with hot and cold foot to suit all tastes, was again first class. We inquired about a boat trip to the islands to see the glass blowing and the Hotel offered one free of charge which took us tehre and brought us back. Of course there's always a bit of pressure for the sell when you do one of these trips, and I've done them a couple of times before, but everyone was very courteous. I only have one gripe about this hotel and that is the internet. While it was a holiday, there are times when I needed to check in for work emails. In this day and age of iPads and portable devices, I really would expect a fairly decent level of service. I paid for 20 hours of internet but it was worse than some internet I've had in deepest Africa. Everything was slow, emails wouldn't send or download and when I finally got impatient and went to use the lobby computer, even that couldn't cope with downloading a PDF I needed. Eventually I had to ask to use the office computer which the staff kindly let me do, but, for one reason or another, that too didn't work. That said, if you don't need computers or internet - and a lot of people don't - this would be a great place to stay and one of the better hotels in venice I have stayed at.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA Reasonable Choice If the Price is Right\u201d", "Author": "1aCruise4wks", "ReviewID": "UR122001625", "Content": "This hotel met my basic needs. Location is great. A 2-min walk straight out the door gets you to Hard Rock Cafe, another minute later you're at the side entrance to San Marco Plaza. In the same amount of time in a different direction and you can be at Rialto Bridge. The room was clean in all respects. The bed was comfortable. We had plenty of hot water and the shower put out a good stream. The included breakfast was very extensive, including eggs made to order. The rooms are small just like other European hotels that I've stayed in. The hotel is being updated. We travelled with another couple and I saw their room (I've included pix of both rooms). Their bathroom has been redone very nicely. The hotel staff are very friendly. I contacted them by email before our stay and they arranged for a transfer from the airport to the hotel (at my cost, of course). The hotel has its own dock so the water taxi could drop us off right at the hotel dock. For other hotels w/o docks, the taxi drops you off at the Grande Canal and you schlep your luggage through the streets to get to the hotel. The staff was just as friendly once we were there. The restaurant staff weren't as friendly but they were efficient/effective. CONS: As is true of many hotels in Venice, it is very old and it shows. But, some might view that as \"character\". There were radiators in the bathroom & main room which seemed to be the heat but there was also a heat/air unit hanging on the wall. The radiator was always on in the bathroom and I couldn't turn it off. It turned out okay because it rained all the time we were in Venice so it gave us a place to dry our clothes. I didn't notice the unit hanging on the wall until day 2 and it took me awhile to figure out how to use the remote control to work the unit. Not a big deal 'cause it was October and we could just open the window for cooling. I never could get the TV to work but we didn't spend much time in the room. The elevators were extremely small - max of 4 if you're good friends (or you will be).

Noise - the place sounds like a bomb goes off every ten mins from 6am ; I think this is down to the builders work going on outside the front entrance Facilities - Bar is never open and consists of three old bottles of wine on a shelf anyway.

Our worries were aggravated by arriving into Venice by cruise ship and not receiving helpful information. It turned out we worried for nothing. As we pulled our suitcases out of the port terminal we quickly found ourselves at the waterside stations for the Venetian water buses and the highly expensive water taxis. When we discovered that a water taxi could take us, and our luggage, right up to the hotel we decided to pay the 110 Euro and enjoy the experience of being ferried to our hotel in central Venice. Believe me. It's worth the money. From ship to hotel was fun and we arrived at our hotel in style. Bonvecchiati turned out to be a four minute stroll to St. Mark's Square and about double that to the Rialto Bridge. It is literally in the heart of Venice. The reception service was courteous, friendly, and prompt. We had the usual problem trying to operate the safe in our room, and they came within minutes and helped us through the process.

We were wrong. To cut a long story short, I would 100% NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm not one for writing hotel reviews but I wouldn't want anyone else's trip to Venice to be spoilt by choosing this hotel, it was awful. This is definatly not a 4* hotel, 2-3* at best. Although I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone it would be unfair not to mention a couple of 'good points'. LOCATION - This hotel is in a very good location and is 5 mins walk from St Marco Piazza and the main tourist attractions. SERVICE - The front desk staff were always very friends as were the dining room staff. BREAKFAST - Mixed opinions about the food. It consisted of streaky bacon swimming in oil, very very mushy scrambled egg, cold meat and cheese, fresh fruit salad, yogurt, toast, bread and croissant/pain au chocolat (which were very nice). Tea and coffee and diluted juices were avaliable. An A la carte menue was also avaliable but very very expensive, but included fresh juice, sausage, fried egg. Now the bad points, sorry a little long, have tried to keep it as concise as possible; ROOM & NOISE -The room we were in was nothing like the photos show when booking or those in the hotel brouchure, it was terrible, it was very small, there were dirty marks on the walls and curtains and one part of the wooden floor was missing. You needed to shuffle sideways to walk past the wardrobe to get into the bed the space was that limited. The windows in the room rattled as did the door even when it was locked, so all night long you could hear a very loud rattling sound. Even though the window shutters were closed and we were on the third floor the noise from the street below was so loud it was as if the people were in the same room. Sound insulation between rooms was also poor and even the smallest of noises could be heard clearly. No tea and coffee making facilities which I would expect from a 4* hotel and would have been nice after a days sight seeing. I think that some of the rooms are being refurbed and the rooms are desperate need of this. BUILDING WORK - Building work was being undertaken at the time of our stay, which meant the restaurant was closed, we had to listen to drilling whilst eating our breakfast and the bar was closed. TV - When booking the hotel information said Satallite TV. The only channel in English was CNN and the signal was lost on a regular basis. Films were avaliable on the pay channels for 7 euro each. The TV itself was very small. TEMPERATURE - The room was very very hot. I like the heat but it was even too warm for me, this also stopped us sleeping properly. The air conditioning system didn't work either. BATHROOM - This was a wet room and again very very small and the whole room became wet and slippy after taking a shower. There was bath. There was no hair dryer as stated in the hotel details and we were not given any shower gel only bath foam! BED - We booked a double room and got two single beds pushed together which moved in the night and each morning one of us woke up in the large gap between the beds! SLEEP - We were woken at between 6 and 7 am each day by the noise from the street, rattling door/windows and people in the neighbouring room waking up and being able to hear every little sound eg conversations and sneezes. I was keen to leave this hotel and get home for a decent night sleep.

(albeit long)\u201d", "Author": "ILuv2trvl_7", "ReviewID": "UR85909183", "Content": "I must admit after reading the harsh previous reviews about their terrible experiences I did attempt to cancel my reservations prior to my trip. Since the hotel had already booked the first night on my credit card I decided to stay at least one night and make my own opinions. Luckily I listened to my sixth sense and upon my arrival at the hotel I was glad that I kept my reservation for my entire trip. Below is a very honest and objective opinion of my recent stay (10/29 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11/2) at the Hotel Bonvechiatti in Venice, Italy. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: The best asset of this hotel is its\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 location. I decided to splurge and take a private boat from VCE airport to the hotel ($110Euro but well worth it). I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to worry about finding the location on my own schlepping luggage in a new, foreign city with no cab service!. I arrived @ 11:30am and my room was not ready \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no harm since check in was not for hours (@2pm). I had the bellhops take my luggage and decided to walk around St. Marc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and stop for lunch at a restaurant on the Grand Canal until I returned to the hotel at @ 2:30pm. The 2 major sites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rialto Bridge and St. Marc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square are within EASY walking distances from the hotel. Again, the location of the hotel made it an \"excellent choice\" for my first visit to Venice . ROOM: My hotel room was #404 and I took the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smallest elevator on earth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the very professional bellhop who carried my bags to my room. Upon entry I was astonished at the small size of the room. I have never stayed in a hotel room so small but again I had read the previous posts about the small rooms so I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When in Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and put it in the back of my mind. The room was CLEAN, well attended, mini-bar stacked; closet space and hangers sufficient for the amount of clothing I packed, and the bathroom amenities were plentiful and appropriate. The bathroom (also small yet functional) had a heating rack for the towels, hair dryer on the wall, windows that fully opened, magnifying mirror for make-up, SMALL bathtub (which I did not use), free standing shower head (took a day to get used to it without wetting the floor), a body weight scale (also did not use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WHY would I on vacation?!), extra toilet paper, plunger, and plenty of lighting. Again, also the smallest bathroom I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever used but no complaints. BED: VERY comfortable for me. I found it hard to get up after my afternoon siesta from my AM activities and it was a nice Full sized bed (not the 2 beds together). There were plenty of blankets to use if needed and the sheets were 'kind to the skin' (NOT 500 thread count but comfortable). TV: I was a bit disappointed that the only English speaking channel was CNN (International) but I was never there to watch TV anyway so again, no harm. The movie (Pay Per view) selection was current although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch any of them. The TV wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a large, flat screen but medium sized, conventional format which was fine based on the size of the room. HEAT: THIS IS THE HOTEL TO STAY IN IF YOU LIKE HEAT!! My room was warm from the first day to the last day of my stay. I did not use the extra blanket (unless I wanted to feel like I was sleeping in a sauna). I love the heat (even during sleep) so definitely no complaints in this area. BREAKFAST: Not sure I can relate to the complaints about the food selection but I found it adequate. Each AM a chef was available to make eggs based on your preference (omelet, easy side up, scrambled, etc.). Cold food was the most abundant with your selection of cheeses, meats, smoked nova, grilled vegetables (new for me as a breakfast choice), cereals, pastries, toast/toaster, yogurts, fruits, coffee, and a variety of juices. I found the breakfast buffet selection more than adequate. I would rank it higher if they offered Prosecco (for a tasty Mimosa) and pancakes/waffles. FRONT DESK: Always courteous and professional customer support; and when my bathroom lights burned out they fixed them immediately. I did not experience any \"snobbery\" from the front desk staff AT ALL! Special Note: The two primary male front desk Associates were tall and quite handsome which made it a pleasure to hand in my room key upon leaving, and retrieving it upon my return to the hotel! All in all it was a pleasant stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for 4-5 star luxury accommodations hotel then you will be disappointed - point blank. A solid 3 star is fair and appropriate. I would return to this hotel if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m watching my budget and would prefer to splurge on fine dining and private boat travel to and from the hotel (which is how I wanted to experience Venice for the first time!).", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk, England", "Title": "\u201cMoldly, Sad, and Poorly Maintained\u201d", "Author": "bailliejk", "ReviewID": "UR84660200", "Content": "Due to the volcano flaring up and all flights being cancelled, hotel selection was slim when comming of the cruise ship.

Bonvecchiati Palace is the refurbished and more elegant destination. We booked a standard double in the Bonvecchiati. Given that this hotel is rated as 4 star, we were unprepared for the state of our room. (See photos!) The bed was also in a poor state, the \"roll together\" meaning that you had to cling to the edge of the bed! If you can afford it book an upgraded room of some sort. The staff however could not be faulted and appeared to be embarrassed by the fact that we'd been allocated such a room, agreeing that in no way did it resemble the lovely internet photos. We were moved to another room (but not an upgrade) the following day, which was better, but not what we'd consider to be 4 star! As you can imagine, this spoiled the start of our already short weekend break. The location is ideal, but the hotel is very difficult to find. (The hotel location plan we printed was pretty unhelpful.) If you pass the Hard Rock cafe, you're pretty close. You should be able to walk to the hotel in around 5 minutes from either Rialto or San Marco, but the narrow streets create a real maze (which is lovely when you have time to wander, but tiresome when you're trying to find the hotel late at night dragging suitcases)! We took the Alilaguna ferry from the airport to Rialto - costs 13 euros each. Easy way to travel back and forth from the airport and much cheaper than a water taxi. Venice is beautiful arriving by boat at night. A trip to Murano is worthwhile - 6.50 euros each. If you accept a \"free trip\" with one of the factory touts be prepared for a hard sell after the obligatory visit to the glass blowing factory. The glass is beautiful but way out with our price range! 10 000 euros for a modest sized vase! We booked tickets to the opera which we thoroughly enjoyed (although we're not opera buffs) at 35 euros each for an abridged concerto performance.

You can use them to other places including islands. Something that I wish had been on the site, near the Boat Stations at Pizzale Roma (No 42) is a Co-op. We collected our bottles of water when we were down there and got biscuits to take home as gifts. Buy pasta at Treviso Airport when leaving so much cheaper.

The hotel had mixed reviews so we were not sure we will like it - but it was absolutely perfect. Here is why: * The location is fantastic, right between the Realto bridge and the San Marco square, 5 minutes waking from each. This means you can get on foot to every part of the city. * The double room that we got was small, mostly occupied by the double bed (a very good mattress) - but it was very well planned and very clean. There were plenty of hangers of all kinds in the closet, full length mirror on the bathroom door, a safe and well stocked minibar, all electric switches within easy reach, plenty of light in the room and bathroom if you wanted it, several easy to locate sockets to charge the phone and camera (without a need to move anything), a good bath, scales, magnifying mirror, bathrobes and slippers - all the stuff you want to feel pampered. Airconditioning was set to 24C but perfectly adequate to the size of the room and the season. * The stuff was very helpful and attentive * The breakfast was OK - good selection of cheeses, salamis and fruit, and passable pastries. Ask for cappuchino or espresso, not the standard coffee pot - they are much better. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant in the evening - the menu is pricey but not exeptianlly so, compared to other places we saw, but I cannot say anything about food itself. There is live music in the evening. * There is even access to fitness center in the sister Palace hotel around the corner. Other tips: If you want to do any dry-cleaning - it is not possible on the weekend. Also, the hotel provides you a free boat and guide to a glass factory in Murano. The selection there is very big and you get to see a wine glass made, but the initial prices are outrageous. If you plan on buying anything, check out the price of similar items in the shops, take 20% off (at least) and bargain down to that - they want to sell and are willing to take at least 60 to 70% off the original asking price.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, excellent location!!\u201d", "Author": "Zaskerboy", "ReviewID": "UR45424025", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights at Bonvecchiati.

Mainly, the shower head in the bathroom didn't work, the tv's colour was off which made renting a movie impractical and the on-screen internet (which always froze after 1 minute) useless. The biggest drawback is the noise level, as my room was above the entrance to the hotel and it was very noisy at night with all the loud music rising up from the hotel's restaurant from 7pm-12am (you would think it would be kind of nice to hear the music, but...it's not). Staff were okay but several were a bit snooty and were not accomodating at all, especially front desk. They don't seem to be aware of services offered in their own guest book (nobody knew anything about room service, the hotel wouldn't provide stamps for postage despite the guest guide declaring that they will stamp your mail for you and charge your room, etc.). Food in the restaurant was okay (we ate there many times) but very overpriced, as I had expected. Lunch is okay but dinner and dessert is exorbitant. I ordered a small shot of Limoncello (costs 6 Euros for a 1L bottle on the street) and was charged 20 Euro! Also, they tried to charge us 750Euro on our last night for \"mini bar\" charges (which is impossible, even if we had emptied the minibar which we didn't) and the front desk guy tried to argue with me that it was \"normal\" and it was the room charge even though the room charge was listed below. After he counted and recounted the bill several times, he told me that his colleague would work it out in the morning in time for us to check out (which he did, fortunately). It could have been an honest mistake, however I noticed that several times in the 5 days I spent in Venice, waiters, shopkeepers, etc. tried to overbill us. Either their math skills are horrible or they're trying to pull one over on tourists. Having said all that, I do love Venice which is why this was my 2nd trip in 1 year.

The hotel was tricky to find, more down to the mad street layout of Venice than through the fault of the hotel. Best way to get there is to get the Vaporetto (we came from the bus station at Piazzale Roma) to San Marco. This drops you off right in front of Harry's Bar. From here walk straight up, do a left at the end, then immediately right. At the end of this lane duck right under the covered walkway which you brings you out at the 'basin' where people gather for the gondolas. Look left and you'll see the hotel right by the big Armani shop. As for the hotel itself... The staff seemed perfectly pleasant (we spoke not a work of Italian other than 'bongiorno' and 'grazie') and gave us a map of Venice, explaining our location. We ended up pretty much ingoing the map and just meandering, but it was a nice touch. The porter took our case and nigh-on sprinted up to our room. For the next day it took a while to remember the route he had taken, it was that quick. As other reviewers have noted, this place is right on the doorstep of San Marco and for that, is great. Don't be misled by that though! Venice is fairly easily navigable on foot and we realised that there was no reason to be too 'near' anything. Especially when paying such a premium. Our room (312) was tiny. I mean TINY. Some reviewers seem to have lucked out and had decently sized rooms, reflecting what can be seen on the hotel's website. We had no such luck. Having stayed in a few hotels around the world we would have been happy had we paid \u00c2\u00a360.00 for (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac70.00 / $120.00) each night. We'd have reasoned \"you get what you pay for\". But this was ludicrous. There were no frills with the room. No drink-making facilities. Being 6' 1\" I could not even lie in the bath without my knees bent up by my chest. We figured that it was just a place to get our head down and we could do without home comforts. However, upon our return home I came round and felt that we had been cheated. The price was extortionate for what we got, breakfast was mediocre with the worst coffee I have ever tasted (and good luck trying to get a second cup!). In short, if you are going to Venice, don't be swayed by location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ensure you really are getting a decent room that suits your needs and pocket.

I wonder what the previous reviewers may have done to upset the staff, as we found them all unfailingly polite and helpful. After a delay at the airport (BA had managed to split my suitcase) we took a water taxi to the hotel, but could not be dropped at the hotel door. This was a bit unfortunate, as it meant I had to carry my case through the streets, but nothing insurmountable. On arrival at the hotel, within 10 minutes we were booked in, the bellboy had taped up my case, carried it to my room and untaped it so I could unpack. The room was small but clean, and had everything I would have expected, from toiletries to fluffy dressing gowns and slippers. Our room was dual aspect, and the occasional gondolier singing under the window enlivened our evenings! The location of the hotel is superb, a couple of minutes' walk from St Mark's - most evenings we wandered back to the square around 11pm to soak up the atmosphere and watch the moon rising over the Basilica. I have a feeling that in the summer Venice must be unbearable, and I suspect I may have found the volume of tourists oppressive. However, in November it was perfect - no queues, no waiting, no jostling. Brilliant! Breakfast in the hotel is buffet style, but with enough food out that you had no real need to eat again until dinner time (which is probably a blessing, with the prices in Venice!). The room was cleaned regularly, in fact every time we left the room the maid popped in to fluff up the pillows and straighten the sheets! At one point I completely mucked up the lock on the room safe (although it turned out it wasn't my fault, the batteries had gone flat!), the concierge immediately came to have a look, and within 5 minutes the handyman had it sorted. The small bar off the foyer is not staffed most of the time, but we simply asked at reception and someone would come and serve us drinks and free nibbles. The only slight criticism I have is that the service was a little slow when we had an evening meal in the hotel restaurant, but as we were in no hurry, it didn't matter.

Combined with the fact that you only need to ask for a key for a specific room (no proof of indentity was required) and I suggest that you leave nothing of value in the room. We went as part of a group with people staying in all different parts of the hotel and it seems that no two rooms were appointed the same way. I am only commenting on the room in which I stayed. I would stay here again though I'd ask for a room in the newer section.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cdissapointed\u201d", "Author": "Halogen", "ReviewID": "UR5817452", "Content": "This was by far the worst hotel room we have ever stayed in.

Our rooms were large, comfortable and beautifully appointed and the bathroom had every amenity imaginable - but for those not used to European hotels, bring a washcloth (they don't seem to use them in Italy). The breakfast was very ample - by the end of our Italian adventure, we considered Bonvecchiati's breakfast lavish, compared with the other hotels we stayed at in Rome and Tuscany. The staff was most friendly, helpful and accommodating. The murano glass chandeliers in the lobby and rooms were beautiful. The elevators are good but very narrow. One is larger than the other to allow more luggage. (see one of the posted photos). The location is perfect - very easy to get to from Piazza San Marco and even from Rialto, once you know where it's located. Get a good Venice map. Follow the directions from San Marco in the April 4, 2006 review and you'll see a tiny square just north of the waterway that heads northward from the west edge of San Marco square. That's Hotel Bonvecchiati, next to the Armani store (if you need to ask for directions, perhaps people might know that store). It's where the south end of Calle Carlo Goldoni meets the waterway at Fondamenta Orseola which follows the waterway to San Marco. Now that you've found it on the map, you can get to it from anywhere in Venice. If you take the water bus from the train station, you can take # 1, 82 or N at night to Rialto and walk from there, but #1's stop is best because there's no bridges to maneuver if you have luggage - it's near the gondola site at Calle Bembo on the west side of Palazzo Bembo, whereas #82 and N stop at the east side (on the other side of the waterway). From either stop, use the map to get you to the hotel. I give you these details because there are 3 Bonvecchiati hotels (the Palace, the Hotel and the Residence or Suites) and the maps found through Google mixed them up, so the April 4 review was most helpful in locating the hotel. A word of warning - Venice is a walking city with lots of bridges. It is NOT friendly to wheelchairs and those with bad knees and hips. By the way we found it easiest to get a gondola from Rialto. You can reserve one from the hotel but it was more expensive. And the gondola stop behind San Marco that's near the hotel seems to be used by the tour groups so the lines were long.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "TheTimeMan", "ReviewID": "UR5207282", "Content": "We just returned from a wonderful trip to Italky that included two nights at this hotel.

I was afraid for the reviews I had read in TA, but finally, I thought that for this price, I would take my chances. And so, after a quick check-in, we went to the room, and found a large room (5x4 metres) and a great marble bath room. The room itself had a double kingg size bed, three chairs, a table, several carpets, ac / heating, 5 windows to calles and a internal yard. All decorated in Venetian 17th style. Breakfast was continental cold buffet. I asked the recepcionist for the real price of this room, without offer, and was told it was 300 euros a night, and so I understood the bad reviews od TA, as this price is too much for a room like this, even in Venice. So my advice is: if you get a room for less than 100 euros, you won't be dissapointed, to tell more, you'll be very very satisfied, as you can't beat the location, the room, the breakfast and the staff for this price, but, if you're quoted more than 150-200 euros for the room, it would be too much, as for these prices you can get better hotels and rooms.
