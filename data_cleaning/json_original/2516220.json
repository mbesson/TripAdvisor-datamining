It was a relatively last minute trip so the hotel was booked last minute and I didn't have time to do a whole lot of research, so thank God for TripAdvisor! Based on the price and the reviews, I decided to book a room here, and am glad I did. Check in and ur was very quick and the staff is great! As others have mentioned, the rooms are not suites, not as I know them at least. They're a little cramped (at least the 2 queen bed rooms are) but if you're not staying in the room too long it's not a big deal, or if you're a solo traveller. They do have a flat screen TV with free HBO, a coffee maker, a small fridge, and a microwave. The bathroom vanity has a marble counter top and a jacuzzi tub, though I didn't stay long enough to try it out. The rooms and the overall hotel were very clean and modern. The beds were very comfortable pillow tops, not too firm and not too plush. There was wi-fi in the room, though I was only able to get it to work once, which really was all I needed. In the lobby there were several computers with Internet access and a printer too, something you don't often see except in more expensive hotels. The pool area was nice though we didn't use it. There's a fitness center, again didn't use it on this short stay, It's small but well equipped. There's a restaurant at the hotel, which we didn't eat at, and also complimentary breakfast in the morning, not just the continental variety either. They had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, cereal, which was all I had time for, pastries, fruit, etc. The cereal was good, and my Mom seemed to enjoy the eggs and sausage, until she found a hair in her scrambled eggs that is. That was the end of breakfast, which was good timing anyway because we had to leave for the airport. We were just here overnight so I can't judge the location relative to anything in Phoenix, honestly I'm not even real sure what part of the city it's in... this is what GPS has done to us, but we can't live without it now can we? Anyway, it's about a 25 minutes to the airport, probably less without traffic. Someone mentioned it's on a busy street, it is, and I did hear the cars for the room but not until the morning almost when we had to get up. I would definitely recommend a stay here if it fits yours needs, it certainly worked for us and exceeded my expectations!", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Urbandale, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGood but needs improvement.\u201d", "Author": "mr779419", "ReviewID": "UR129269171", "Content": "This hotel is conveniently located.

Based on the reviews (cleanness and great breakfast) is why I went with it. I'm not super picky in other areas, that's mainly what I look for, BUT BIG MISTAKE for ignoring other \"cons\" mentioned.... Room: first the room was clean but more like a \"remodel\" type of clean looks like walls were painted over and you could still see the dirt under the paint. Sinks looked like they didn't use a good cleaner and just wasn't very clean, it was more of a surface clean. A couple of people mentioned it being small. Well it was tiny and hard to even change with privacy. There was no room around the sink, the only door was to the toilet and shower and then to go out. It is way to crammed for a family. The beds were comfortable and they had good selection of towels. I liked that they gave you an option to pick your services everyday. Breakfast: I liked it and I'd say that was very good: homemade waffles, sausage, gravy, biscuits, a lot of toast, eggs, hash browns, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, juice-it was excellent but the same everyday and it was a little small and crowded. Staff was very nice and helpful with breakfast. Front desk people were not very helpful but nothing worth complaining about. Not good: the walls were so thin I could literally hear the neighbor \"peeing\" in his restroom in the very early of the morning, we could here when someone took a shower (water turning on and running) we could also hear all the people outside (talking, walking, driving) plus the windows did not lock.

The kitchen tools are very basic, very small stove, no oven. For pots and pan, ask at the desk because they do not let them in the suite because people steal them.

We didnt have a day that was warm enough to use the pool, but it looked inviting and clean. Now, my impression of the suite was a bit disappointing, due to how tiny it was. I think they took regular sized hotel rooms and divided them into a sitting room with a bedroom with a door, keeping the bathroom to divide the two areas. It was clean, but we could barely walk around the queen sized bed. A plus was the two flat screen tvs. The breakfast was better than most, with hot entrees, but they were the same choices evey day.

After sleeping one night at another property in Phoenix that was a horrible experience I vowed that I would find another hotel that would be to my satisfaction; trust me when I tell you that my expectations of a Best Western stay were far surpassed at the Northern Avenue property. It was easy to find, the front desk personnel were very pleasant and actually glad to have you as a guest! The small suite they put me in was on the second floor away from Northern Avenue traffice and had a refreshing view of the Squaw Peak mountain with an elevation of 2608 feet, which by the way CAN be climbed if you are in for a good hike. If you cannot climb the stairs then stay on the first floor as there is not an elevator, but even tired from lack of sleep the night before I managed a small suitcase, laptop bag and my \"jumbo sized\" travel purse just fine. As I approached the door of the suite and inserted the key and fippedvon the light I knew I had discovered an economic jewel! The outer sitting area had a nice desk with a halogen lamp for plug in laptops...you heard me a halogen lightbulb! But those of you who are modern techies with WI-FI you just need to sit down on the sofa/sleeper and log in. Unlike the other property who advertised free high speed internet, but could not deliver a connection lasting more than a few minutes, the Best Western delivered true high speed internet and it was consistent the 3 days I stayed! There was also a nice flat screen TV mounted on the wall above the desk AND another one in the bedroom on the wall across from the bed...who would have imagined that somebody actually thought about WHERE a guest would watch tv. There was a small refrigerator and a microwave. The bathroom had a clean shower with good water pressure and hot water throughout my shower and yes, being a girl I like my shower in the morning so it was not a quick one! They give you a nice supply of linens and will change them daily if you wish. The vanity top was a lovely granite and the sink did not back up with water like a lot of them do when you brush your teeth! The sink had nice lighting for make up application or shaving for the gentlemen. The bedroom had the most comfortable mattress and very feather soft pillows as well as a set of firmer ones, so they thought about keeping every guest comfortable. There was a very thoughtful lap tray if you need to sit in bed and work on any writing or computing. There was also a whirlpool tub and though I did not take a soak...let me say that this would have been the first whirlpool that I actually considered getting into! I was impressed with how clean the housekeeping staff kept everything. They also thought of all the little things you might need like a bottle of water AT NO CHARGE, mints in the bedroom and on the refrigerator to welcome you and get this...their . board cover was clean! The place I stayed prior to coming to the Best Western had an ironing board cover that I had to put a towel on before I could press my skirt for a business meeting the next day. As far as the property goes - I got to park right outside my room which was convenient. The lobby has a business center with computers and printers and I know they also have some other equipment such as a copier and fax machine. There is a nice pool area with lounge chairs, and in addition to the pool there is a spa pool. By the pool there is an area of vending machines, coin operated washers and dryers and an ice machine. As far as breakfast..well, yes it was called continental, but I found it to be exception, not because it was INCLUDED, but because it was good. They had 2 kinds of juices, Starbucks coffee, cereal, toast, yogart, 3 hot dishes including scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage and hash browns. Hold onto your hat because after all that for a \"continental\" breakfast they also had 2 waffle makers so you could cook your own fresh, hot waffle and they even thought about those of us watching our diets because they offered regular and sugar-free syrup!

Another thing we found unusual , but very impressive , was the fact that the manager Mr. Quick spent a great deal of time talking to the guests- an excellent idea!

Upon our arrival, after booking an expensive suite, with an online website, we were assigned our room. The room did not match anything advertised online, and even after calling the hotel prior to reserving our room, didn't come close to what we thought we had booked. The first room assigned was very small and dingy with one king sized bed that just fit, and a smaller front room. After about a half hour of going back and forth to the front desk to clarify what an executive king or queen suite was about, we finally found the suite we thought we booked online, and were courtiously moved by the staff. The warning here is buyer beware. While at the front desk, I did overhear the clerk on the phone with the website agent informing them that they had charged us the wrong price for the wrong room. I heard my name mentioned while they were confirming credit card charges, and saw a copy of my confirmation on the desk. This made me question if this website is charging more these days and skimming profits, booking inferior rooms at their customer's cost. When we moved, the room was nice, new clean and spacious. Nothing like the hole in the wall super cheapie room. The customer service was great and accomodating. No complaints on Best Western's end, just the online provider of the rooms. Beautiful pool, beautiful hotel, lovely area, close to the airport. Final bottom line. If you book at this hotel with an online website, bring your confirmation printed out with you, make sure you have the room you booked. I feel we were deceived by this onling website booking agent, which makes me wonder now why American Airlines has dropped them. Best bet is to book directly through this hotel.

The hotel is located in a nice residential area of North Phoenix, just up 16th street from the Point Hilton Resort. It is about a one minute drive from the 51 Expressway and 10 minutes from I-17. The airport is an easy 15-20 minute drive straight up the 51 Expressway. The hotel is in the final stages of refurnishing.

There is a small area to hang clothing, a modern 32\" flatscreen TV, and a simple formica desk and chest. The wifi worked well--but I could never connect to the internet using my ethernet cable. The AC was not as noisy as it was annoying as it blew directly onto the bed. I moved a small table over to deflect the breeze. There was only a recliner in my room---no sofa. Breakfast was good although the same menu is served daily: waffles, scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausages,breads, biscuits with gravy and a selection of 3 cereals and some fruit. The ladies in the dining room were very friendly. I didn't attend the afternoon cocktail get-togethers. The printer in the lobby was not working, but the staff allowed me to print out my boarding pass on their printer. There are four public guest computers. My only complaint, other then my disappointment over the room size, was that a noisy group of guests stayed in the pool until I called the front desk at 2:30AM. Apparently the pool should have closed at 10PM, and the guests left after the clerk spoke with them, but this indicates that no one did a security walk about the property during those hours.

Travelling on a budget is always a little tricky - you are never quite sure what you are going to get. Based on the reviews on this site, we felt fairly confident that we would be satisfied, and we were. We booked this hotel through an online discount travel site for the price of $77.00 per night (Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights). We opted to take a taxi from Phoenix Sky Harbor airport to the hotel - the cost with tip was a little over $30.00. We should note that our friends were staying in Scottsdale, and we were about a 20 minute car ride from eachother. We arrived around 10:00 p.m Friday night. The girl at the front desk was friendly, helpful and efficient - we were in our room in no time. The room was GREAT! (We were in Room #138). A couch to the left when you walk in, a desk with computer chair and computer hook up to the right. A brand new looking, sparkling clean refrigerator, microwave, FREE bottled water and large flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom sink was outside the bathroom itself, which I love - it was very tasteful, with what appeared to be granite counter top. The bathroom was spotlessly clean with tiled floor and walls. The shower has a curved rod, which not only looks classy, but it gives you extra room in the shower. The towels were clean, generously sized and fluffy. The hotel also supplied Bath & Body lotion, shampoo, soap and conditioner. There was also a sign on the bathroom sink that if you had forgotten some basic ammenities (comb, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.), the hotel would supply them for you for FREE. The biggest surprise was the bedroom, which was seperated from the other areas by a door. We had a queen sized bed (really nice linens, with soft, fluffy (down?) pillows, and tasteful spread), a TV, two nightstands (one had an Ipod Home base, so you can play your tunes in your room), and also a TWO PERSON jaucuzzi tub, surrounded by beautiful tile work -- RIGHT IN THE ROOM! Yes!!!! All this for $77.00!!!???? We checked out the \"gym\". It is small. We work out at a gym regularly, and both of us felt that this little space offered everything you would need for a quick little work out - they had a few cardio pieces, some free-weights and some machines. Nothing fancy, but if you need to burn some calories, you could get it done. We did not use the heated pool or outdoor hot tub, but we did look at them - they appeared clean, with plenty of lounge chairs (with folded towels supplied on the back of each) and even a little patio type sitting area, which I believe had tables with umbrellas for shade. We took advantage of the FREE ice - as we had a cooler with us, and needed to keep refilling. It is in it's own area (you need your room card-key to access) and this room also has laundry facilities (not sure if they are free or not) and a few vending machines. Again, it was spotlessly clean. We took advantage of the FREE hot-buffet breakfast every morning. We thought it was great. They had 4 different types of cold cereal, and offered 2% and whole milk. Coffee, tea, orange juice and cranberry juice were also available. There was also packets of oatmeal, fresh fruit (apples and bananas), and yogurt. There was a make-your-own waffle station (two waffle makers) with pre-made batter for you to use, scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns, bisquits with gravy (new to us Northerners!) and about 4 different types of bread with jelly and butter available, and a toaster to use. This was such a nice ammentity for us...not only did we not have to pay for a hot, filling breakfast, but we didn't need to venture out to find something either. This hotel also offers a FREE Happy Hour, which unfortunately, we were unable to take advantage of! You get two FREE drinks, and FREE appetizers - I don't recall the hours it is offered, but we never made it back to the hotel in time. There are also two large grills outside near the pool, for guests to use for FREE. You can borrow the utensils from the front desk, and we noticed a sign near the grills that said that the first Wednesday of every month the staff offeres a FREE barbeque for all the guests. The lobby to this hotel is really nice as well. There is a gas fireplace, a small area where coffee is available throughout the day, as well as chocolate chip cookies, nice couches and chairs, mailbox, and also about 5 computers for you to use...again, for FREE. There is a laser printer as well - no charge for that either. The staff at this hotel could not have been nicer. We called the front desk one evening to see if they had information on pizza delivery - they gave us three phone numbers (local calls are free). We called another morning because we needed a taxi, they took care of that for us. We called the front desk at 12:30 at night because our bedroom smoke detector was beeping, and they got right on that. And, when our phone mysteriously stopped working for local calls, the maintenance man came right over. He was professional and friendly. Another thing that we loved about his property was their effort for going \"green\". They had a sign in the bathroom that stated if you didn't need your towels changed, to just hang them on the rack. Also, they will only change your sheets once every three days. They also made a suggestion about how to leave your airconditioning when not in the room. We love this! For the price of this hotel, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff, the clean, modern accomodations, and everything that is included with it, you CANNOT BEAT THIS HOTEL.

The 2nd night we stayed there we had a king jacuzzi suite. Awesome suite, 2 bathrooms, sinks and showers seperated by french doors. Also 2 flat sceen tvs and lots of space in each room.

Despite booking the hotel on-line well in advance I got two different rates $116 for the first night, $152 for the second + tax. I'd say that the first rate is closer to the real value of the room - we debated looking for another less expensive hotel for the last night and canceling the second reservation but didn't want to go through the hassle, especially since we were traveling with a baby. What you get for your money - convenient location close to I51 but not close enough to hear the traffic. Easy 30 minute drive to the airport or car rental drop off. Good quality, clean rooms, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast (already described in detail in other reviews). Good area. We were upgraded on our first night to a two room suite (because they were overbooked) which came equipped with two washrooms (one wheelchair accessible), flat screen tvs, fold out couch bed. Very nicely done. Only complaint would be that the view was the stairwell heading up to the second floor and several mattresses that were being stored(?) there. On our second night we had a standard room with a single king bed - also very nice (but not worth the extra $40 we paid). We overlooked the pool and the jacuzzi was running all night. Front desk staff were very helpful and had good recommendations for restaurants -you're within walking distance (about 1 mile) from several restaurants - try Carlos O'Brien's.

Breakfast room small and usually crowded with no pastries - had to settle for banana/yogurt. Coffeemaker in room was the one-cup-only variety rather than the usual (4-cup) pot.

Normally we stay at Hampton Inns but wanted to be in the Squaw Peak area and thus decided to stay here. Right from check-in we should have known what to expect. We arrived too early to check in but since we travel very often we knew it was possible to leave your baggage there until check-in. While initially the staff was rude, the gentleman FINALLY agreed to have us leave our luggage and said it would be in our rooms when we checked back in later. Of course it was NOT in the room and we were on the second floor and no elevator! We are in our 60s and this was NOT convenient for either my husband or me. Breakfast is boring with the same thing every day, not like Hampton Inns that vary the menu. The air conditioning did not function well, the water in the tub did not drain out so that when taking a shower you were up to your knees in water. When we arrived and I asked where one could go to check on e-mails, as had been advertised in their listing service available in the Business Center, they told me it was \"down\" and not expected to be up until Monday.........this was Sat. On Monday when I checked again I was told still not up until Tuesday. One couple standing at the desk when I asked that question and heard this, turned on their heal and left as this was a businessman who needed that service. VERY inconvenient. Still not up when we left on Wednesday. Maintenance is terrible......lot of evidence that the place has been \"let go\". Breakfast area is very small..........as is the pool.......and with a tendency to cater to kids' traveling sports teams, you are lucky to find a spot to sit. This is the second time we have encountered this with a Best Western and will never stay at one again. Hampton Inns much better.

We were looking for a budget hotel and I got an awesome deal on the Best Western site. (49.00 a night) Good points: room was clean and comfortable what you would expect. NOTE: We traveled with a 2 year old and there was NO room for a crib/ playpen with the two queen beds. This proved problematic as she was in/out of bed!!! Therefore keep this in mind before you order two queens! GOOD: Free breakfast in AM - \"You make waffles\" yummy, lots of juice, cereal, and other goodies. Unfortunately the breakfast room was small and often cramped, as well you may have to wait for your turn at the waffle cooker. GOOD: Staff where polite and offered travel tips. GOOD: First Wed of month they have a free BBQ (Hamburgers) looked OK but we skipped it. NOT SO GOOD: Pool was not the cleanest - scum around edge of pool. Hot tub either bath tub temp. or too hot? Also pool is located around the parking lot...therefore not the most relaxing, private or scenic. NOT SO GOOD: no place to sit outside room. There is a little deck, and pool area but we had to stay close to our room when our daughter was sleeping. We sat on cement railing and were in the way of cleaning staff. ADVICE: If you are traveling with kids, especially young ones - stay at a resort with LOTS OF AMENITIES! You do not want to be putting kids in/out of hot cars trying to find a place to eat or an activity to do. NOT RELAXING! ALSO: Avoid Tempe Town lake - not much there! Water park at Zoo fun choice! Lots of shade! AVOID AT ALL COSTS: Forgot the name but it is a \"Cowboy\" steakhouse in the hills of Phoenix.
