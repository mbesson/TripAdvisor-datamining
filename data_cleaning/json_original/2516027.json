At the end of an extended trip down the west coast, I wanted to spent two nights in West Hollywood to be near friends. I have also ALWAYS wanted to go to the Magic Castle. When you stay at the hotel, you can get a reservation for the dinner and show which was so much fun. Staying here is like being in a Melrose Place episode set in 1955. It has a retro wholesomeness. The decor in the rooms is a welcome throwback that makes you smile, it is somewhat minimal, but it has every modern comfort. Huge rooms, nice bath products, plush robes, flat screen tvs, big kitchens with free coffee and tea, awesome lighting fixtures and good sized balconies overlooking the pool in the central courtyard. The friendly staff and HUGE number of perks is what really makes this place a fantastic find. Free internet, daily breakfast, water and fruit laid out daily, free paper, free DVD rental, free rides to local destinations and free snacks and sods off a huge list any time of day. You can also use the pool any time day or night, just be quiet after 9pm. Try finding that at a Hilton or Marriott. They have great on site maps, and are glad to help with any arrangements. The hotel is a quick walk to the Chinese Theater, Kodak Theater, and the Walk Of Fame. Lots of other unique buildings in the area if you take a walk. Took a late night walk with a friend and had the Chinese Theater all to ourselves. Thank you for a great stay and experience at the Magic Castle!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cThin walls...but otherwise perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Pinkpeonie", "ReviewID": "UR129147498", "Content": "I am still going to give this hotel a 4 out of 5 despite the fact that the walls are thin....because it really is a fantastic place.

The bedroom contained a huge very comfortable bed, and there was also a fold out sofa bed. This was a little uncomfortable for 2 adults, however the staff provided us with an extra roll-out bed for no extra charge. The staff were definitely the highlight of our stay. Nothing at all was too much trouble for them. From the endless supply of free snacks (Yes you heard right - free snacks. Chips, chocolates, sodas etc) to the Popsicle out by the pool, we felt very spoiled and looked after. Free breakfast every day was something we hadn't expected but we took the opportunity to enjoy while sitting by the pool. There was a selection of cereals, toasts, condiments (Including Vegemite for us Aussie travelers) pastries, yoghurts, juices and coffees. The staff were also very helpful in organising tickets for theme parks, bookings for restaurants and recommendations for shopping and public transport. A must do while staying at The Magic Castle is dinner and a magic show at their exclusive members only club. As there is a strict dress code they supply jackets and ties for the men. We had a fantastic night at the magic castle club and really enjoyed our drinks at the bar after the show. The bartenders were extremely attentive and friendly and made our experience there even better. The location of The Magic castle is perfect. It's a 5 minute walk from Hollywood walk of fame/Kodak theatre, and close to the tour operators and public transport. Overall i would recommend The Magic Castle to everyone, and if I'm ever in LA again i'll definitely be staying here again.

I think it's very hard to select where to stay in LA. Hollywood is way over-rated but if you want to stay there you can't get any closer than here. Keep in mind this is renovated apartments into a hotel so don't expect a four star hotel. But if you understand that's what you're getting then you'll like it. Kids, especially, will like the free snacks. I wasn't sure about this claim but anytime you want, go to the desk and order sodas, snacks and candy of your choice and there were like 40 selections! Teenagers will like too. It was nice to have a separate room for adults and a pull out sofa for kids. Kitchen nice for families who can't afford to eat out all the time. Overall, affordable for LA area in a key tourist spot. Most importantly, this place understands customer service and this is the best story of the review. We only stayed one night but upon check in mentioned we were attending the LA Dodgers game that night. A few hours later my daughter went down to get a soda and they gave her a prepared bag with Peanuts and Cracker Jacks and a card telling us to enjoy the game.

The free snacks is really an awesome touch of service especially to those who have young kids but really it's just great for both kids and adults! Plus they also have a DVD collection that you can look at and borrow to watch in your room. Breakfast was a simple array of pastries, cereals, yoghurts, coffee, tea, oats, hot chocolate and juices that can either be enjoyed by the poolside or in your room.

I've never stayed there before, but have been to dinner/show at their Castle. On the outside, the hotel doesnt seem impressive, but rather 70's apartment like. It's a small building with just a nice lobby...but once inside, it feels like you've arrived at your own small apartment complex (I guess if you ever lived in one) complete with an inviting \"24hr' heated pool and a great staff who will act as your personal 'concierge'. The staff is very professional, courteous and accommodating. You arrive and they make you feel like a valued client and not just another body occupying a 'room'. The rooms are very large and if you reserved any of the one bedroom suites, you are in for a surprise. Comfortable, 'homelike', and everything you need to relax, including all the free snacks you can munch down. Soft drinks also...and all the rooms have kitchenettes. Upon arrival and throughout our stay, free popsicles and a lemonade spritzer served in a champagne flute was just awesome. The location is great...I had to go all over LA with my 11yr old daughter and leaving and coming back was easy. I liked that we had acces to anywhere in all directions, whether by freeway or by any major street. I've read some of the negative reviews and feel that some people are just spoiled. Every hotel will have some flaws. I've stayed at brand new hotels with bed bugs and bad service at $400 a night. Indeed, Magic Castle is an older hotel, so don't expect flawless rooms. The place is well cared for and the service is wonderful,,better than ANY large hotel I've ever stayed at and I travel frequently. Some of the rooms have been recently upgraded and some are due, but I didnt see any trashy looking rooms while I was there. Again, older hotel,,so you are gonna see scrapes and scratches here and there. The most comfortable mattresses also! We even had friends come to visit us there and they were impressed. They felt it was more like a 'vacation rental' than a hotel. My daughter loved it here! she loved the rent free DVDs, the snacks, the nice staff and said she wants to come back again. That's all that matters to me now. So we'll be back! I left my camera in the room and they found it and shipped it back to me. It didnt 'disappear'..now that was the 'icing on the cake'. As soon as I get it, I'll post the pictures of the room we stayed in.

Never before, and I travel a lot, have I come in contact with such wonderful people who genuinely care about the stay of their customers. The front desk staff went out of their way to ensure your stay was wonderful. Whether it was reminding you of the free snack list (think vending machine snacks but free anytime) or making you a plate of breakfast and delivering it to your room (because you can't get yourself ready in time to go out there) they are there to serve you. They even sit down and talk to you if you are lonely during breakfast. The rooms at the Magic Castle Hotel aren't just rooms, the majority are suites. This hotel is much like the apartment on Melrose Place. Think of a bunch of apartments gathered around a swimming pool. So your room includes a separate bedroom, full kitchen, living room, dining room and then a vanity area, shower and separate toilet. You can do your make up while someone is taking a shower without bothering them. It's awesome! Are you a fan of Magic? If this is the case be sure to book your reservations at Magic Castle Hotel and be sure they get you reservation at The Magic Castle. The only other way you'll find yourself inside is if you know a magician because it is a private club. You still need to pay $25 to get in and purchase a meal inside, but the once in a lifetime experience is worth every penny! I think it's about the little touches. On their website you'll read about the white glove Popsicle service. I saw this happen more than once on my trip. It is entirely too neat. They also offer you free washing machine detergent which doesn't sound like a big deal, but I promise it is huge when you need it. All in all this is one of my favorite hotels in the world.

After our stay I think I have found the answer. It is the staffs at this hotel, starting from Front Desk to Housekeeping, which has made this a traveller\u2019s favourite. It is not only the service but the way you are getting the service makes a big difference. May be the small size of the hotel helps the staff to cater to individual needs but the main factor here is the positive attitude and it comes through quite clearly. It is not that everything is perfect at this hotel. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is an old apartment block which has been converted into a hotel with a pool in the middle and some part of the property shows its age. Some of the furniture and fixtures needs improvement and looks and feel dated and if you are staying at the upper level of rooms like us then anybody with a mobility issue will have a problem. Of course the lady at the reception helped my wife with her luggage but as there is no elevator at this property you have to climb a few stairs. But apart from these we do not have any other issues with this hotel. The rooms are actually one bedroom apartments with plenty of space. The hotel provides free soft drinks, snacks and DVD movies throughout the day which was a big hit with our son. The breakfast is a small affair with limited choices but whatever was offered was of good quality and enough to start our day. The hotel does not have a restaurant but if you are feeling tired and do not wish to go out then the staff provides menus of a number of nearby restaurants and will help you in placing the order. We ordered pizza on one occasion and the delivery was fast and the taste was good. Of course being just next to the Hollywood Boulevard there are number of eating options nearby covering all kind of budgets and taste. Major tourist attractions like Madam Tussauds, Kodak Theatre and Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre are all within five minutes walking distance as is the Hollywood and Highland metro station from where the Universal Studio is just a station away. The area felt quite but totally safe during our stay and we did not encounter any problem even during late evening. The hotel provides secure parking at the ground level but it is not free. Free Wi-Fi is provided and the connection speed was pretty good. We could not find any convenience store nearby and bought our necessities including water from the petrol station next to Renaissance Hotel which is a short walk away.

We had a suite and it didn't overlook the pool or have a balcony but that was fine for us as we didn't chill at the hotel during the day. Room was huge with seperate bedroom/living room/bathroom and a small kitchen linked to the living room. To be honest it was a bit wasted on us, the bedroom was so big we just used that! Pool is open 24 hours and is heated to 85 degrees. I was tempted to have a late night swim just for fun but decided against it - wiuld be nice though I imagine. Location is literally across the road from Hollywood Blvd and Walk of Fame, 2 mins away. The subway is right there too and just 1 stop from Universal Studios. You'll need a car/train to go to most other places but this is a fantastic base and wld stay here again in a heartbeat!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cA short stay in Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "LeeWellington", "ReviewID": "UR126371517", "Content": "Overall the hotel is nice.

We were visiting the Hollywood area for 4 nights, booked a one bedroom which included one king bed in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. Included a full kitchen, eating area with table and chairs, also a small bathroom, clean, but with older tub/shower combo, new glass enclosure. Tub fixtures were older and it took a while to adjust, but water was always hot throughout the shower. Towels were large but not fluffly, suceeded in getting me dry! Kitchen had basic tools, small coffee pot (coffee/tea included), and the office had a snack list that was complimentary just for the asking, included soft drinks, candy, chips and microwave popcorn. Also a full DVD library, free. We had asked for a balcony as I had heard these rooms were newly refurbished, the hotel contacted us that we could pay a $25 upcharge to hold one and we did so. Not sure if it was worth the money to upgrade, but as we didn't see any other room to compare we accepted what we had. Only window air in bedroom and living room, room is either cold or hot. We did find the heat control after one chilly night! The rooms are not well insulated, can hear everything from the stairwell and courtyard. Light comes through under the main door and anyone sleeping in the living room can hear everyone that comes up or down the stairs. The best part of the hotel is the staff, who are very friendly, helpful and go out of their way to make sure your stay is the best it could be. On arrival we were handed fizzy lemonade, and since we had arrived before check in, the staff offered to watch our luggage so we could go on our way, but while we were discussing where to go, our room became available and our bags were whisked away to our room. The staff is always available and happy to help with suggestions on what to do, where to go and always offer to make reservations, or call a taxi, etc. The personalized service more than makes up for any short comings the hotel may have and their graciousness make you feel most welcome. There is a good breakfast served from 7-11 am each morning in the lobby, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and homade crossaints, muffins and biscuts. Juice and milk is also available. Tables are available around the pool or trays are at the ready for you to carry your breakfast to your own room or balcony.

By far, my favorite is the Magic Castle hotel on Franklin. I like this place so much that it's become my default spot for business trips and our favorite for trips with my two young kids. Why is this nondescript \"garden apartment\" style hotel my favorite? A few reasons: 1) The location can't be beat. You're in the heart of Hollywood with easy access to the major freeways. 2) You get access to the Magic Castle. While the drinks are overpriced and the food is mediocre, it's an experience not to be missed. 3) The rooms at the hotel are HUGE. They are all one bedroom suites and perfect for the visiting family that needs a kitchen and room for kids to relax. 4) The services is fantastic. Unlike the major chains, the Magic Castle doesn't nickle & dime you at every turn. The wi-fi is free, the snacks are free, they even gave us a free postcard stamp! It's the little touches.

Just quickly: We booked for one night because of a meeting on Wednesday evening in LA, less than two miles from the hotel. We drove in six+ hours, and while it wasn't the easiest to find it was found quickly. I'll start with the positives because they started right away! First off, the staff - wow. They are enthusiastic, helpful, friendly - heck, it's like the Boy Scout motto is part of their training! They offered a glass of sparkling lemonade while I was checking in and while I declined, they took it out to the car to give to my wife. They then directed me to the gated, underground (i.e. under the building) parking, which while not free was certainly both reasonable and unbelievably magnificent in Los Angeles. (Small note - the ceiling is not terribly high, therefore the pipes below the floor are fairly low, resulting in hatchback contact. Worth watching out for.) Due to our meeting time, we could only just put our stuff in the room, wash our faces, and head out. It was at this point we noticed the very nice facial soap with an orange citrus scent. We also noticed that due to the design of the entryway, the door to the room does not open completely. There is some sort of weird panel near the floor behind where the door tries to open. There's a very antique wall heater of some kind just inside the door. There is a slightly musty smell. And when washing our faces, we saw the cracked basin in the sink, but with no time to talk to anyone about it we headed out. We got back around 11:30pm, exhausted, and got undressed and into bed. On taking off my shoes and walking through the room, I found an area where it feels like there are cracks or holes, where the carpet sinks in, between the bedroom and the bathroom. On laying down in the bed, I realized the mattress is ... firm, to be kind. It's on a platform. We also took the time to read the small sign on the bed informing us that if we wanted a top sheet between ourselves and our duvet, we needed to have request it. Exhausted, I put my head down. At this point, I noticed the vinyl shutters in the room do not quite completely close. As our room was on the ground floor facing the street, I had to improvise some receipts stuffed underneath to keep them closed. About the street - there is a window-style air conditioner built into the wall facing the street, which I could see to outside through (a small hole, granted, but it is still there). But that was nothing compared to the continuous and rather loud traffic. All ... night ... long! The windows looked to be single-pane and (upon further investigation of the inside of the shutters in the light of day) hardly sealed. In the daylight, I found a few other interesting items. First, the shower - nice, serviceable, old, loads of hot water, and as is typical of someone my height (six foot one) excellent at cleaning my chest hairs. No matter, a great percentage of places are like this for me. But I also saw on the wall between the shower and the bathroom door, which is quite beat up by the way, some sort of yellowish runny stains on it with an exceptionally disturbing (in this day and age) red one on the (also very beat up) floorboard. Now the fact that the door opens physically ON to the toilet may be simply because of the age of the building and the plumbing design, but the oddly placed pedestal on the sink is quite modern. There are two light switches in the bathroom, one for the light and fan and the other for ... well, I couldn't tell what it did. there is a heating element as well on the ceiling, which looks to be from a mid-50's electric stove top, but it never did a thing. And I feel fairly certain the fan was the prop from the airplane in the movie Casablanca, judging by both its age and surprising level of noise. Throughout the room, the painting job is slapdash. The floorboards are really beat up. The clothes rod in the closet is scary looking, either badly painted and worn or honestly I don't know. I'm surprised at how much I found, considering we had just enough time for me to grab some of the (very good and very plentiful) included continental breakfast and take it back to the room before we had to leave. Again, a truly friendly staff, I cannot say enough about them, but I just did not have the time to discuss it with them. I do honestly believe they would have done whatever they could to improve the situation, but this type of trip prevented me from being able to discuss it with them and frankly considering the reports everyone else seems to have made I was caught off guard by all of this stuff. I know things go wrong, but I don't expect a place rated as highly as this to require me to address this many shortcomings. Had I noticed two other items when we arrived we would have been late to our meeting, as they passed beyond unpleasant to dangerous: the first was some sort of power cable coming from the bottom of one of the outlets, down into the carpet. I do not know where it went or what it was for but I cannot believe that type of rigging would pass code. The second was the fact that the smoke alarm had no battery and appeared to be inoperative (no light). I know that wouldn't pass code. In conclusion, this is a very pretty, funky, cool place with excellent on-site underground parking, a heated outdoor pool, a staff that would make any Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons or wherever proud, in a really great location in Hollywood, but with what I found in my room I just can't come to grips with the fact this hotel is (as of 1 March 2012) the #2 rated hotel in Los Angeles on TripAdvisor.

For those who don\u2019t know \u2013 the Magic Castle is a private dining and performance club for magicians and other similar entertainment professionals. Entrance to the club is restricted exclusively to members, their guests and guests of the Magic Castle hotel. Although we\u2019re not in the field or big aficionados of magic shows, we had read a review about the atmosphere and performances and had wanted to check it out. We had an enjoyable evening at the club and saw some top-notch illusionists, but unfortunately did not see Neil Patrick Harris \u2013 he supposedly is there regularly and is on the Board. I was set to submit my hotel review and decided to read some of the others quickly and glad I did b/c my original review just looks like I plagiarized all the others especially regarding the dominant thought on the service. Rather than mimic the rest, I\u2019ll just say this is how you run a hotel or any customer service business.

The kitchen was equipped with essentials and the bed was comfortable. I especially liked the dual closets \u2013 one for each of us. While the hotel room may be rather frill-less, the amenities like the complimentary convenience store (my term b/c they had so many snacks, candy and soda to select from I literally felt like a kid in a candy store) and the pastries and juice in the morning was great. After our evening at the club next door, it was nice to return to our hotel and be greeted by glowing candles in the lobby, hot apple cider and a friendly front desk representative.

The location was great, the rooms were massive, (especially after spending the days previous in New York and Tokyo hotels!) and the pool is heated. They also provide breakfast each morning, which you can take by the pool. The staff at the Magic Castle could not do enough to help us. We were trying to book our rooms from Tokyo, with a funny borrowed laptop, and the staff were very accommodating with my numerous requests. On arrival, they answered every query we had, gave us great recommendations and tips, and when we got to our room there was a birthday cake and balloons for my husband, along with a handwritten card! What a beautiful touch! They also recommended that we try a restaurant up on the hill (can't remember what it was called), and their recommendation was spot on - delicious! They also arranged to drive us up there, and collect us once we were finished, and even arranged for an entree to be sent to us on them. Would very very happily stay there again.

So this hotel is not the Ritz, but what u do get is a clean apartment (ours was a 2 bedroom) comfy beds, good shower pressure, great Wifi.and and an awesome location (one block back from Grumans theatre and Hollywood Boulevard) At this hotel its the little things that make all the difference, the maid comes around in the early evening with a little card telling u what the temp will be tommorrow with some mints, the DVD library has a huge selection, the breakfast is simple but adequate,the complimentary mini bar is awesome offering candy and sodas and if u need to go somewhere the staff will help u plan right down to the finest details. The first night we were here my kids went down to the front desk to grab a couple of movies, some candy and sodas - came back to the room pulled out the sofa and had a movie night, they were so comfortable at this hotel right from the start. The kids also.loved the pool and we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast by the pool each morning. As this is more like a small boutique hotel, most mornings you would find the manager just wandering around just making sure that everyone was happy and if there was anything else they could do to make your stay more pleasant. I would also like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to the Manager of this hotel for allowing us to stay beyond the usual check out time - due to a late flight back to Australia. The kids were able to spend one last day in the pool and we were able to relax and pack before the long flight home - thank you so much !!! Then when we did check out we were offered complimentry candy for the road.

They were spot on about the excellent location and the wonderful service provided by ALL the hotel employees. From all the rave reviews I was expecting a really beautiful hotel. This hotel seems to actually have been an older apartment complex that was converted to a hotel. The rooms themselves are like a small apartment. The furniture is older and well used, but maintained okay, but seemed kind of bare bones. The sofa was really saggy. There was a small kitchen with dining table and chairs. Bath products were the Taracco brand which is wonderful. We had a room with a balcony, but there is NO privacy. The balcony overhangs the pool and you could have a conversation with your neighbors without shouting because they are so close. It is a small complex of rooms. The hotel seemed pretty secure with access mainly through the garage or the front lobby doors only. The housekeeping service prior to us being checked in was not too great because there were spider webs hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. The garage was great. They charge about $11 per night, but it is steel door gated and accessible only with the insertion of a room key...very safe. The \"mini-bar\" , which is free, is not in the room. I kept looking for it when we arrived. They provide you with a list, you just them what you want and they give it to you at the front desk. The hotel itself is about 2 blocks from Guaiman's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood walk of stars. Be sure to ask the front desk personnel about recommendations for eating, sight-seeing, etc. We were there when there was a movie premiere and Twilight stars putting their hand prints in the cement. Needless to say, there were a lot of Twilight fans during this time, but it did not stop you from getting anywhere UNLESS you wanted to drive down that particular section of the street. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the wonderful service provided by the friendly staff, security and prime location. The hotel itself is only average, but if you know that going in, your expectations will be realistic.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cForget the others when visiting Hollywood!

You'd be surprised how many of the big and more popular hotels didn't do this throughout our trip. As others have said, their breakfast is free and is awesome. Cerial, pastries, juices, fruit... More than you could ask for. They also freely offer you free snacks throughout your stay. Thanks for the Peanut M&M, Nick! Free hire of a great list of DVD's, Very helpful travel tips and never too busy to help you with anything you require. Nick advised us to visit Yamashiro Japanese restaurant thats located on the hill behind them. We did have dinner there, and were very glad we had. Strongly recommend it if you have time.

I booked online with the hotel direct and from the first contact to book right through to waving goodbye upon leaving the service was never anything short of first class. We chose a one bedroom suite and with 4 girls sharing this was ideal. The suite was huge with a massive lounge/dining area, large kitchen and equally large bedroom. The place was spotlessly clean and nothing was too much hassle. We only had enough towels for two people but a quick call down to reception and the extra towels were with us in less than 2 mins! The staff here are one in a million and nothing is too much trouble. They made reservations for us, advised on where best to go for a night out and one of our party stayed on their own one day as the others were taking a trip, they made sure she was well looked after and gave her great advice on places to go to fill her day. Upon arrival you know straight away that this is quite a different hotel to the norm - the free 'mini-bar' at reception was fantastic with a huge choice of drinks sweets and snacks for free 24hrs a day. The free ice-lollies by the pool was also a lovely touch.(the staff even insisted on giving us a bag of goodies to take with us for our journey when we checked out!!) There is no restaurant in the hotel however the lady on the front desk provided us with take-out menus and helped us to order food in. The main advice I can give anyone who stays here is to ask the main desk to try to book you for dinner at the exclusive adjoining 'Magic Castle Club' Dinner was slightly pricey however we had a fantastic meal and this also grants you entry to the Magic shows which were out of this world and a definite highlight to our trip.

However there is no other word to describe the staff at the Magic Castle Hotel. This was our second stay in as many years to celebrate my birthday but this time we were joined by three other couples after having bragged so much about our stay the year before. Since there were so many of us I made the reservations several months in advance and also asked them to make reservations at the Magic Castle Club and Yamishiros Restaurant for us. Prior to our arrival I had to have called at least 5 times with changes or special requests of one sort or another; most of which were pertaining to the restaurant or Magic Castle Club reservations. Not once were my requests met with anything but \"No Problem, we'll take care of that and e-mail you confirmation\" and each time confirmation was waiting by the time I got to my computer. When we arrived the staff immediately remembered us and you would have thought we were part owners. Our friends were in awe and wanted to know how well we had tipped them the last time. (Actually, we had only left a tip for the maid) During check in one of the group mentioned we were celebrating my birthday and all of a sudden everybodys room was available but ours. (Late checkout, the maids would have it ready asap, etc, etc) Some 20 minutes later our room was ready. When we entered, on the dining room table was a fresh baked birthday cake with with my name on it, ballons tied to each of the dining room chairs and a birthday card from the entire staff! How they did that we will never know since we were standing on the paitio not 10 feet from the room the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. What a suprise! Once again our friends were awe struck and wanted to know who we knew. During the entire weekend we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful staff I have ever seen during continental breakfast on the patio (by the way the croissants are to die for), when requesting the shuttle to Magic Castle Club or Yamishiros or returning to find mulled cider and pastries waiting in the reception area each evening. (This was March) Normally I would mention the great location, absolute spotlessness of the rooms and other amenities but many of these things have already been mentioned in other reveiws. Besides, even if the place were a dump (and it is far from it) I would stay there because of the staff! To close, it is September and our trek to the Magic Castle Hotel, Magic Castle Club and Yamashiros for my birthday is now truely become a tradition. As soon as we can all decide on a weekend, I will be making our reservations for next March. Oh, and there will be at least 2 new couple joining us this year.

The continental breakfast was not particularly large, but stocked very thoughtfully and with quality items instead of the usual junk most places qualify as \"continental.\" Free wi-fi, free parking, and spacious bathrooms too!

The desk agent came around from the desk to wish us a good stay, which is unheard of. Our stay ended up having some complications (outside of the hotel), but the staff continually answered questions, helped us adapt, and showed flexibility with a smile whenever needed. From Zeeshan, who answered our incessant questions, to Nick who helped us get out of a reservation when we were in a jam, to Marcus and Gabby who kept the small details rolling along for us. The breakfast attendant wouldn't let me pour my own coffee as he saw my hands were full; the housekeepers kept offering to cary things for me wherever I went, and the shuttle driver came to rescue us after we walked quite a bit to far for dinner one night. I certainly enjoy rooms with some bells and whistles, but what matters most to me is when I am made to feel like a welcome guest in the hotels home and met with gracious smiles all the time, rain or shine. My only regrets were that I did not get to see the Magic Castles' dinner and show even though a local bartender recommended resoundly and that the hotel does not have a business center where you can print items like boarding passes, maps etc. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to the Hollywood district whether it be for business or pleasure.

Let me just say that I have literally traveled the world and the service at the Magic Castle Hotel is simply unmatched. Now keep in mind that this is not a 5 star pretentious cookie cutter hotel and if that is what you are looking for, this is not the place. But if you are looking for a great location, spacious rooms/suites, unequaled service for families and reasonable rates, look no further than the Magic Castle Hotel. Here are my thoughts: -Suites are large and good for families or others willing to really get the most out of the room. You should note that some rooms are not yet updated so ask for one that is. If you get an older room, know that they are decent but definitely somewhat worn and outdated. However, everything else makes up for it. -Staff couldn't be better. The GM Darren was amazing as was his staff, with white glove popsicle service for the kids, free snacks and smiles and friendliness all around. I can't stress enough that these people make you feel at home and very comfortable. THis comes from the top and Darren does an exceptional job with this very caring staff. It is THE difference maker. -Nice touch with welcome drink, continental breakfast, free snacks, dvd'd and wireless internet. They don't nickel and dime you to death. -Spoke to Darren at the pool area for quite a bit of time and he made many recommendations for us including a great dinner at The Farmers Market in The Grove which was a great experience. -Pool small but decent. Not a luxury resort pool by any means but the pool is enjoyable after a long day of tourism. -Location is superb, just a block from Kodak Theater, Graumanns, Hollywood Blvd and minutes from Beverly Hills, Universal and much more. Very central and convenient. Overall, very impressive. I stayed here before on New year's Eve and it was a different vibe (more of a party atmosphere) but if you are looking for a great place to stay in the LA area, this is the place. It was likely an apartment complex before being a hotel and has a Melrose Place type of feel. As unconventional as it is you simply cannot go wrong with this place.

The view gives you the feeling that you're like in the Melrose Place TV series 6- You can benefit from free food at the front desk whenever you want such as diet coke, coke, m&m's ...It's not essential but very appreciable when you want to chill outside close to the pool checking your emails ...(because the wifi is also included and free) The Magic Castle Hotel is definitely a place to go ... and to stay - We will definitly come back here and we will also recommend this hotel to our friends and family if they plan to go to L.A Thanks the Magic Castle Hotel you made our trip in L.A AMAZING !!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel, incredible service\u201d", "Author": "ma0ffst", "ReviewID": "UR117198697", "Content": "Me and my wife stayed here during the final week of out honeymoon to Los Angeles.

Nick on the front desk booked us a taxi to pick us up from the airport, booked us a table at a top restaurant, and also booked us baseball tickets - this was before we had even set foot in the country! When we were arrived, we were amazed that the room we booked was actually an apartment, with a separate bathroom, kitchen, lounge, and balcony overlooking the pool. We loved the fact that the pool was open 24 hours, as was the front desk, where we could get complimentary snacks and drinks whenever we wanted.

We had one minor issue with a window not closing properly and the maintenance man appeared immediately and fixed it!. The pool was heated, clean with loads of pool toys -the kids had so much fun. A generous breakfast was presented around the pool each morning with delightful pastries and the Darren the owner/Manager was always on hand for a friendly chat. In fact on our last day he let the kids run wild with the mini bar and their backpacks were filled with goodies (thank you for those delightful Hershie Bars that you can't buy in Australia).

I guess this review is realy a warning for singles because I certainly heard other guests, particularly those with children say how great it was. As I was leaving I heard one kid say it was the best hotel he had ever stayed in. Not so for me. I was in a room at the top of the building well recessed from any natural light, which was quite frankly depressing, especially as I was quite unwell on my second day and had to spend most of the day in bed. As I was climbing the many steps to my room I could sometimes peek into the larger accommodations and they did seem to be very comfortable, and spacious and bright, so it made my room seem more depressing. Breakfasts were ok, location was good. The service well, they tried to be very helpful, but for me it backfired. I wanted to post a parcel back to Australia and I asked at the desk if they were able to arrange it. On the Saturday the person on duty said yes, no problem, so I packed my bag accordingly and made a trip to the post office to get a box to send home. When I took it to reception on the Sunday morning at around 9.30 am the problems started. I wasted around 2 hours while they tried to complete the forms, and eventually decided that they could not arrange to post my parcel. Basically I wasted my entire last morning at the front desk, and then had to return to my room to unpack my box and repack my bags. Of course by then the key was de-activated and so I had to go all the way back to the desk to get it activated and climb back up to my room (I mentioned earlier that it was at the top of the building). I could not fit all of my clothes into my bags and had to leave some items behind (I had been shopping on the previous day on the strength of the earlier advice, so I was not happy.) The hotel knocked $50 off my bill but it did not compensate for the loss of my last morning in Los Angeles.

There was hair on the sink... on the showerwall...and when we wanted to bathe our child, the tub seemed to be plugged. Oh..let's not forget some splatterings on the wall above the sink.

It is a quick and easy walk to the Hollywood walk of fame and the metro is nearby for a quick , cheap and easy way to get to Universal studios. On Thursday night the hotel staff recommended the farmers market up on the hill that had good views, delicious foods, the best gourmet ice cream sandwiches I have ever had and wine and beer was avaiable with live music. The observatory was another great free treat that was nearby. You have to allow for time to wait on line to see through their telescope.

This hotel was our last stop i had heard great things on here. Our room was not ready which we were a tad surprised at is was about 4pm. We werent too bothered sat around pool after driving for most part of day and the staff raced to help take bags to room for us. My 8 year old daughter was a tad disappointed the hotel was not part of the castle and we did get a tad confused when we arrived parking at the castle not the hotel. Parking was $10 a day bargain. ROOMS- we had a two room unit, older but refurbished. Massive fridge, full kitchen, large tv. one king and one queen bed couch and chair coffee table desk lamps. Clean tidy. Bathroom had sep bath and shower not anywhere to put your toilet bag but there is a bench outside door with a mirror. The best smelling soap youll ever smell. The beds are so comfy I have two negatives- 1- the noise coming from the road was very loud. Busy most part of the night and i was super thankful i had ear plugs. I dont think you would get this from all the other rooms, ours just was directly onto front. 2- our room was not inside the unit complex but on the outside which did concern me that anyone can just walk up to the door and windows. Most of the windows are second story but the one near the front door did not have a lock we realised when going to bed however the second wed mentioned it the next day staff had fixed it within 30 mins. I would have still felt safer inside the complex as everyone has to walk through the office to get inside. FREE SNACKS - surprised they still offer this after our three kids kept them busy. Not once did the staff blink an eye at the amount of snickers and cokes my teen sons requested. They even sent my husband out with some to the car for our plane ride home on checkout. STAFF were simply amazing. Couldnt help enough from directions and maps to special requests. little notes in the rooms BREAKFAST- loads of cereals, toast juice, hot choc coffee tea etc, some pastries and fruit bowl. My only suggestions would be to change it up every couple of days perhaps put different pastries for the customers staying a few days.

When this turned out to be via hire care, he then went about booking it for us and arranging to have it dropped off and picked up at the hotel by the hire car company.

Magic Castle Hotel is a slightly unconventional establishment, extending from a very curious private magic club next door - housed in a fantasy-like early century victorian mansion.

The rooms are spacious and flow nicely without being up-tight. It's no criticism that the rooms are not as slick and shiny as some of the luxury chains and you might notice an endearing squeak in the floor or that the windows actually open. This all enhances the relaxed feel of the place. Service is outstanding. Nick, you will go a long way in life - don't lose your enthusiasm and willingness to help. I need people like you at my work!

The staff were incredible and were ALWAYS happy to help. They printed us off maps, brochures and always had time to answer any questions we had. The breakfast was great and the endless minibar snacks were fantastic. I couldn't tell you how many packets of oreos my kids went through.

And all I can say about this place is that it is the best and most friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in. We came here straight from the luxury and glamour of Mandalay Bay in Vegas, and the moment we went to reception and were met with the most lemony lemonade I have ever tasted, I felt I was home. Helpful, friendly staff and a place that has a real look of the old \u201cMelrose Place\u201d tv show. It\u2019s magic! The rooms are not spanking brand new. And I was glad of that. Our room, 207, was on the 2nd floor, up the back of the complex. Our bedroom window overlooked the wall of the Magic Castle magicians club. Our balcony overlooked the pool. The room was quiet as anything (except when people trudge up and down the echoing stairs). Lugging up the cases was a chore, but worth it. We had a 1 bedroom apartment. Massive, comfy bed. Big screen tv in the room. Lovely robes. A full kitchen. Dining area. Cute balcony. Big lounge room with the kids fold out bed in the sofa. I thought the old and too small tv in the lounge was something that definitely needs to be attended too. But, the treats don\u2019t stop with the welcome lemonade. The have free soft drinks and snacks all day long. You can go and get as much as you want. While snacking up, why not grab a couple of complimentary dvd\u2019s to watch after a day of sight seeing? I cant comment on the pool (though it looked nice and clean) as L.A. had 2 days of torrential rain while we stayed here. The Magic Castle is located just 1 block from Hollywood Blvd. The train station that takes you 1 stop to Universal Studios is just around the corner. Parking is charged at $10.00 a day, which I thought was unnecessary. The complex has a take away menu. We ordered a pretty awful pizza and they already have your room number when you order. Just a quick walk down to Hollywood Blvd, turn right, and there\u2019s a big pharmacy that sells everything you need, including really cheap booze. A supermarket is also just nearby, where you can buy fresh food and cook dinner or lunch if you want. Don\u2019t worry about breakfast, the Magic Castle provides a decent breakfast of pastries, toast, fruit and cereal. They suggest you eat it with other guests around the pool, or take it up to your room. Eating breakfast on the balcony would have been wonderful, if the rain wasn\u2019t pouring down so hard! All in all, this place is gold. It has real character and charm. The staff are amazing and you can tell they love the place. Sure, if you are fussy, the rooms can look down right haggard. The carpet is not the best. It was clean and I saw no stains (not that I was really looking) but it\u2019s a bit rough. The walls need a new coat of paint. Skirting boards have scuff marks. Touch up paint on the bedroom wall. Who cares?

The service aspect is great in terms of promptness, civility, and helpfulness. The kids loved the free snacks. The parking is useful. These are the reasons for two stars. The weaknesses: Unfortunately service alone cannot drive a hotel stay. What is also equally important is how good the room and the amenities are. In our room, the main bed was ok, but the sofa bed sagged a lot, and my son could not sleep. The bathroom door could not be locked. The microwave was not cleaned, there were coffee stains. The amenities are all very old, and need a desperate upgradation. The area where the washing machines are kept was filthy (Management - have you even looked behind the machines, ever?). The hotel(?) is an old apartment complex with paper thin walls. I could not sleep the whole night because of the sound. The hotel cannot control the road noise, but it does have the option of investing in insulation. The breakfast is a nice touch, but we could not find butter. The \"free\" internet did not work.

Normally I would have booked us adjacent to the LACC, but when my husband insisted that we book the MCH instead, I read the TA postings and made the booking. After only two days, I am hooked. All the details of the reviews below are dead on: excellent staff, free goodies, heated pool, free LA Times,free shuttles to MC or the spectacular views from the Japanese restaurant on the hill above, quiet complex (we are in 211 - the top center one bedroom, so no noisy upstairs neighbor issues, but an occasional car or truck in the middle of the night on the road behind the bedroom - what do you expect? You are IN a city). And yes, the kitchen stove should eventually be replaced along with the rolled linoleum in the bathroom, but everything is spotless. They offer turn-down service with a mint and the next day's weather forecast - a LOVELY touch that I have only experienced at 5 star boutique hotel in Paris and Quebec City. Match that with a glass of cold, sparkling, Italian lemon soda served in a champagne flute to welcome you at the check-in desk to sip while completing the normal boring paperwork and I daresay, even the road warriors among us will soften. Now, DO make reservations for the Magic Castle. As anyone who knows me well, as a 20 year veteran, former Lincoln Center opera and ballet production stage manager and personal assistant for years to a multi-Tony award winning director: I don't \"do\" bad theatre - or theme parks. That said, our Magic Castle adventure was top notch - ok, I agree that the food could have been better, but not the experience. Here is my top advice: arrive before your dinner reservation so you can see the two smaller venue shows before dinner or the main hall attraction. Once you get into the castle (yes, you get to whisper, \"Open, Simsim\" to get through the library \"door\" ) send your partner to the bar directly in front of you for drinks and walk your own feet directly to the left (stageright) and get in line for the Close-Up Gallery. There you will be only one of about 20 audience members, in the tiniest venue I have ever experienced, to watch - and participate if you are picked from the 1st or 3rd rows in what I can only express as a private magic show. A delightful start. This review is getting too off track from the MCH, so... We will be here for another three days and it the MCH is an oasis to return to after all day on your feet in an exhibit booth.

The hotel is a converted apartment complex (think Melrose Place) and it is a refreshing change from the cookie cutter \"hotel in a box\" that so many chains have become. The staff is friendly and helpful. The amenities are great - especially with kids - free snacks, sodas and movies. Anything we asked for was promptly delivered. In the afternoon, they offered cookies and cider (wonderful smell upon entering the hotel...) Of an evening, they lit candles on the tables in the courtyard surrounding the pool. The location is one block off Hollywood Blvd, right near the Kodak Theater. We'd venture out and about during the day, then park the car in the free hotel garage and wander out for dinner. All of that is wonderful, but then there is the one big negative we experienced. Our room was a 1 bdm suite on the 1st floor. It was large and clean and right next to the courtyard pool. The problem was the noise from upstairs. Anytime the guests in the room above moved, it sounded like a creaky herd of thundering elephants. When they took a shower, it sounded like a foghorn. Now, our neighbors were not overly loud - they were just moving about their room. To the hotel's credit, when I complained after the 1st night, they offered to move us, but they don't allow roll away beds on the 2nd floor, so we decided to tough it out. Earplugs were a must for sleeping. If we find ourselves in Hollywood, we would definitely stay at the Magic Castle again - our boys absolutely loved it.

The suite was very large and comfortable and well-appointed...great for a family. The one significant problem was that our room smelled funny. It had a musty smell and it was very strong. The staff was constantly cleaning, so it was not a surface cleanliness issue. We advised the staff and they came in quickly with Febreze and then left a full container with us. It helped somewhat for the first night, and with each time we sprayed it masked the odor, but the smell was ultimately overpowering. We probably should have requested a room move, but we instead vowed not to spend any time there other than to sleep. That turned out to be a good thing as it kept the whole family out at the pool or in Hollywood doing fun stuff rather than watching TV. I regret giving a low rating for cleanliness because the rating really does not reflect the overall cleanliness of the hotel, which was very good. The smell alone knocked the rating down to 2 stars.

There was constant traffic that woke us up several times during the nite, and on our first nite there some person was screaming out intermittently at 3am for 20-30 minutes. Don't know who it was, but there are homeless people camped out right across the street from the hotel. The suite was roomy but old and surely did not look as new/modern as some of the pictures taken by previous visitors, which could only mean that some suites have been renovated more recently. If we had only known... Other cons with the room included an ant problem in the bathroom (when we brought attention to it at the front desk, the lady there acted like it was the first time she had ever heard of such a thing, even though other reviewers have spoken of a similar problem), which they attempted to correct with ant spray, but the smell lingered and the ants came back intermittently. Also, the bathroom was small, the paint was chipping off of the bathtub, and the bathtub drain would back up if you showered for too long. The DVD player could not be connected to the TV in the living room (even the maintenance guy couldn't fix it), so the kids could only watch their DVDs in the bedroom (that was a bit inconvenient). The wi-fi connection was spotty, and there was surprisingly a lack of utensils in the kitchen (only provided 2 forks and 2 spoons) for a family suite. Also, for those who aren't aware, there is a daily parking fee of $10. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and responded quickly to any problems. The free minibar was a real plus for everyone, and the staff was always generous in asking if we needed any more for our excursions. Location is great, as it is just a couple of blocks to the walk of fame, mann's chinese theater, kodak theater, etc. Also, it's just a couple of miles from Universal and the Hollywood sign. Also, the continental breakfast was fine, with a selection of cereals, oatmeal, scones/pastries, juices, fruit...good when you're on the go.

It had a large renovated kitchen, living area with sofabed for our daughter, hallway with lots of storage cupboards and a large separate bedroom. Our friends stayed in another one bedroom apartment that had not yet been as recently renovated so I can see why some guests would not be happy, however even so - the space makes it a perfect base for families visiting the area.

In the middle of the hotel area there was a decent pool which is open for use 24 hours a day, the only thing they ask is that you keep the noise level down during night hours. The hotel is located just a short walk (under 5 min) from the walk of fame of Hollywood. Here we did some shopping, some sightseeing and got some tasty food for dinner. I will defenetly book this hotel again in future LA stays.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe Bates motel is alive...dirty, dingy and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "quicktraveler2010", "ReviewID": "UR65772054", "Content": "I had read all the excellent reviews on Trip Adviser and was very eager to get to the Magic Castle Hotel. Well, as soon as we arrived we were greeted by a lovely young man who was enthusiastic and welcoming. He offered refreshing lemonade and then walked us to the room (even waited for us to get in). So yes, the service is more personable that any other hotel I have stayed in. Although the overall hotel needs a revamp...and quick! When I walked into my room I was a little shocked... outdated, dirty furniture and scuffs all over the walls. The kitchen and bathroom were worse - peeling paint and begging for a bulldoze. As we got in very late in the evening, I decided to stay in and check my email. I connected quickly to the free wi-fi, although found over the course of my stay that it was an unreliable connection that dropped out every 10 minutes or so and one evening would not connect at all! None of the TV remotes worked...I suppose it is a little too much to check the batteries every now and then? And the lounge room was infested with ants...they proceeded to crawl all over me whenever I sat on the couch. Oh and a moth was flying around in the bedroom when we went to bed. The whole place just felt dirty, like you needed to give the chair a wipe before you sat on it. I was glad to have brought my disinfectant wipes - they came in handy! Stains all over the furniture, from the couch to the footstools and carpet too. The linens on the bed also had stains on them, and we had to request they be changed. The air-conditioning units rattled and rolled all night long. The hotel was quite noisy overall...from the pool area, to the slamming doors, the thin walls of the room which meant you could hear everything! I was even kept awake all night listening to the loud snoring coming from the next room. And don't be fooled by the free mini-bar...you have to ask every time you want something, which really defeats the purpose of a 'free mini-bar'. The breakfast was average, given you had to get up very early or miss out. The highlights - the staff! Absolutely the nicest and friendliest bunch of people. The breakfast scones were delicious too, and we also loved the 'turn down service' of mint chocolates with a note on the follwoing day's weather. You could not request for a better location...very close to the famous Hollywood Boulevard and public transport of the red metro line. It is such a shame that a place with such excellent customer service falls short on the rest. The Magic Castle Hotel needs a revamp of the decor and interiors...from the outside it can look like Melrose Place but peer in a little closer and you feel like you have ventured into the Bates Motel.

This time we spent 8 nights at the property and stayed in a 2 bed suite. There is still much to like; the location is great for all the LA attractions and the staff are still really amazing and very helpful. However, our 2 bed suite was a disappointment. Many of the cheaper 1 bed suites have balconies, the more expensive ($350 per night!) 2 beds don't. As a result of its position the suite was always dark and never got direct sunlight. And while the public areas (and in particular the pool and lobby) remain in good condition it just felt like it was getting shabby. There were signs of shabbiness in all the rooms but the large bedroom in particular where my wife and I slept just had an unacceptable amount of knocks and scuff marks everywhere. A bodged repair paint job on the AC unit had been done which looked horrible and there were some (minor) stains on the door (see photos). Obviously it is not realistic to expect a hotel to repaint walls every time a guest scuffs the walls, but this room was WAY overdue for redecoration. At the very least, a member of staff should have been in the room wiping down the walls with a bucket and sponge to clean the doors/walls to make it look less grubby. I did mention this (twice) to the front desk and they promised to pass it on to maintenance but they did not want to come see the issues for themselves (it felt like my complaint was not news to them) and nothing improved in my remaining 6 nights in the hotel. I hope the hotel are not trying to milk their reputation by under investing in upkeep of the rooms. I can't recommend the 2 bed suites, particularly at the price Magic Castle now charge, and I would be cautious about going back to any of their rooms unless I had confidence that the room was in good decorative order.

No disrespect to Trip Adv as the rest of my USA holiday was based from its reviews on accommodation and local attractions were spot on, but this place left a very sour taste in our mouths in an otherwise great overseas holiday. We holidayed in Vegas, NYC, Tennessee, and (in the end, alternate LA accommodation) and this place was a disgrace!. We arrived at about 3.30-4pm in the afternoon and (after struggling by ourselves with about 6 bags of our luggage up the stairs) were greeted by a polite young man and woman who greeted us with a glass of soda squash each. We were informed that the room we requested with a roll away wasn't available, but they had organized a room with all our bedding requirements in their \"sister apartments above the current hotel next to a Japanese restaurant\". I asked if the rooms were of the same standards as the original rooms I viewed on the net, and she replied \"oh yes but with a much more fantastic view\". I thought OK until she said' and we will also drop your room rate back to $99 a night\". And that's when the alarm bell started. We were shuttled up the hill by the young man Marcus(who always I must say was polite through this) to a what looked liked a 'hostel\" complex. He unloaded our luggage and pointed to a hallway which was partially blocked by bags of rubbish to venture down to find our room. By this time my family and I were extremely concerned, but after Marcus opened the door ushered us in and quickly departed we noticed our concern was more than warranted. This place was a disgrace. The tiles were chipped, stained, and where the tiles met the fridge there was a 1-2 inch gap full of dirt and grit. And this was at the kitchen near the entrance. The blinds were falling off the ceiling, paint peeling off the walls and veranda and numerous stains everywhere. I sat stunned, and I never complain as a rule but i was really ##** off at this point, and so I rang reception and said to Marcus, this room was not up to my expectations of this hotel and could I be moved back to my original booking at the previous hotel. He said\"oh, i will ring you back\". He then rang back and said\" we have had some flooding in your original room that was booked and it is undergoing repairs, and if this current room isn't adequate I will give you assistance in finding another room at another hotel\". I replied to Marcus, if this was the case why wasn't I contacted by phone or email, and sensing his nervousness, I asked when the flooding occurred, and his response was \"I don't know\". I then informed him that I had only booked this room from the reviews on Trip Advisor and only then he informed me he would ring and talk to his manager. He rang me back about five minutes later and said I could have a room in the original hotel the next night and they would comp my current room for that nights stay. I declined and asked him to find me alternate accommodation elsewhere. He could find nothing to my liking so a found accommodation elsewhere myself. All up I felt humiliated that I was, I think duped of my original room, and told a falsity about the flooding, due to the fact that if a flooding had occurred that someone would have known when. Every other hotel I stayed in the states including my final hotel in LA was above my expectations of room and service. This place was disgrace! AND SO WERE THE ROOMS. Ps I also spent almost two hundred dollars in peak our traffic from the airport, to this hotel and finally to my final destination in cabs and shuttle hire.

The pool was open 24 hours and a couple of nights we were awakened by clubbers taking a 3:00 a.m. dip. The people in the room below us left for the night, leaving their blaring stereo going. The second night we finally called the front desk to have them enter the room and turn it off. We are not overly fussy travelers, but this hotel needs some TLC. The location is good but we had great difficulty finding decent, reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance.

The kitchen and bathroom are both quite dated with original fittings but with fresh paint, while the bed and sofa and linen is all very nice and modern.

The central pool area is also nice enough with tables and chairs and umbrellas for lounging around. There is a quaint internet computer hiding in a 1970's space invaders style cabinet, which costs about $6 per hour. You can't beat the location as you can walk easily to nearby Hollywood Boulevarde, and the reception staff will organise for all the tours to pick you up from the hotel.

At check-in, we were upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite which was a fantastic surprise for our family of 4 (especially considering we paid under $160 for the AAA rate). The suite was basically a really roomy 2 bedroom apartment (bigger than our 1st apartment, my husband said), fully equipped with everything you might need. We all LOVED the free snacks--everything from chips and pretzels to cheese crackers and candy and sodas--and the staff was so sweet and would make up \"goody bags\" for our kids each morning as per their requests. The hot apple cider and cookies each night were a nice touch too. Breakfast was delicious (I'm seriously missing the scones now that I'm home) with scones, croissants, muffins, toast, cereals, yogurts, fruit, oatmeal, etc. Location was excellent--a block from Hollywood walk of fame, Graumann's, and the other sights and a short drive to everywhere else. The kids loved the pool and found it plenty warm even though it was quite chilly outside (they spent HOURS in there!). They also liked the free DVDs that were available. The nicest touch, however, was when the staff ordered an adorable and delicious little cake for my husband's birthday and sent it over, complete with balloons. Oh, and the staff drove us up the hill to Yamashiro, a great Japanese restaurant up in the hills behind the hotel, which was really convenient.

The genuine friendliness was astounding and they seem to bend over backwards for everyone in so many ways. The accommodation was incredibly spacious (especially great when you are with small children) with a full kitchen and all the facilities to feel at home. It was also clean. The overall feel of the place both inside and out was one of good feng shui. The breakfast provided is simple but a great choice and like everything else they do, it was displayed with care and style. We ate it each morning in the cute courtyard by the pool. The kids loved the FREE minibar service available from reception and the list of order-in foods they provided us with was fantastic (they even put the order in for us once we had decided which to settle for!) The proximity to all the attractions couldn't be better. It is just a short stroll to the walk of fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Metro station for Universal Studios (and it IS a short walk - even for kids). At the same time it was like a quiet oasis from all the action. Seeing the busyness elsewhere I was SO glad that I had chose the Magic Castle. I could go on....this is the best kept secret.

The hotel allows guests to borrow DVDs from a good list, free snacks and soft drinks (which we didn't use until the last day, but if you were going to be sitting by the pool could be invaluable) and the complimentary breakfast is exactly what we were looking for - lots of fruit juice, coffee, cereal, pastries and yogurts - perfect for filling up before heading out for the day.

I'm so glad I decided not to rent a car, we didn't need it at all for the local sites we wanted to see and use of Metro. And by the way, check your Coke can for $15 off coupons for Universal Studios! The only thing to be aware of is very weak water pressure in the shower, but that was just so minor and I would not hesitate to highly recommend this place to anyone.

They also have a DVD collection you can pick from for free, another great touch for after a night out. It was our first time in LA so we asked the staff at reception for somewhere nice to go for dinner, they recommended some great places and drew us a map to get to them. The breakfast was good too, breads, muffins, cereal, yogurt, juices, teas and very drinkable coffee with syrups. There's a decent pool with Popsicles handed out and ice cold towels on the hour. Every evening our bed had been turned down when we returned and the weather forecast for the next day left on the bed with some chocolates.

The hotel itself is a 50's-era apartment building, converted to a hotel. So the rooms are huge - 1- and 2-BR apartments.

An investment in decor would improve the property immeasurably. Service was fine, and the included continental breakfast - enjoyed on the pool deck - was appreciated. The rooms, while basically clean, are in need of attention and suffer from inexpert repairs - bad caulking in the bathroom, stained tubs, flaking paint.

The Magic Castle is simply great. The entire staff are just wonderful. The property itself is a former apartment block and has retained the original floorplan - hence the \"rooms\" are huge. The property is non-smoking - but - balconies abound for the afflicted! Heated pool (in California!) is fastidiously clean. Guest facilities cater for tourists and business travellers alike, eg, laundry facilities for $2 a load. The property itself is getting a little tired - but - IF this was a concern then the staff and facilities more than make up for flaky paint on the gutters. The Magic Castle is a short block from Hollywood/Highland and all of the Hollywood tourist attractions and conference facilities. This intersection is also a major public transport hub for buses and the Metro Red line - you can go anywhere in greater LA from here. And contrary to popular belief - public transport in LA is great. In our ten days in LA we didn't (as tourists) use a taxi once - the buses and trains were just great - and only $5 for a day pass. I have recommended - and canned - other properties in the past but the Magic Castle takes the absolute cake - this is the best property we have used anywhere - due in no small part to the performance of the entire staff. This property compares very favourably with European five star properties! We returned for a second stay within the month - cancelling another property to do so. We were THAT impressed with the Magic Castle. Suffice it to say we could rain all the superlatives in the language on the Magic Castle. They even drive you up to the restaurant on the hill behind the hotel - and pick you up after your meal. We were actually sad to leave - we've been sad to leave places before - but never because we'd miss the staff! We miss being at the Magic Castle.

We had some heavy suitcases and the staff was quick to help us with the bags. In fact all the staff were amazing, everyone was pleasant, friendly and willing to help at all times. One feature we loved which wasn't there in 2004 was the free soda/water/snacks available any time from the front desk.

The location is fantastic for exploring Hollywood. Short walk to Hollywood and Highland and main Hollywood area. First time we stayed here we used the subway to get to Universal Studios which is extremely convenient and cheaper than a taxi or paying for parking. It's main benefit though this time was for the short distance to Hollywood Bowl, which is not too far away (we caught the bus from Hollywood and Highland to get there, but you could easily walk). Hollywood still felt like a rough area, particularly at night, it's not an area we felt safe walking in, particularly away from the Hollywood and Highland shopping area.

As other reviewers have noted, the service was incredible -- we've stayed in Ritz-Carltons that didn't have as good service. Really. All of the staff was friendly, helpful, ready with great suggestions for dinner, always offering free snacks and sodas. I can't say enough good things about them. That said, this isn't a five-star resort, so don't expect the rooms to be elegant. They're basically a converted apartment -- living room, dining area, kitchen, bathroom and separate bedroom. We loved that one of us could be watcing tv in the living room while the other slept late and since the bedroom had a door, there was no noise. It was great to have a fridge and a stove/oven, too so we could heat up leftovers and chill a bottle of wine. The rooms could use a little updating, though, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Everything was extremely clean, but definitely some wear-and-tear -- old paint on the tiles in the bathroom, cracks on the concrete walkways to the rooms, and wall units for air conditioners (which worked extremely well but were a little noisy). It didn't bother us in the least, but if you're used to everything being modern and perfectly maintained, this might not be the hotel for you. The location was great -- 1 block walk from Kodak Theatre and Mann's Chinese, a few more blocks walk for shopping, restaurants and pubs (we liked Happy Ending for a beer -- definitely try the andouille corn dogs, the food was incredible for a pub). We felt safe walking in the neighborhood, even at night. One more thing to mention about the hotel -- you can go to Magic Castle if you're staying here. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience (a private members-only club) to see magicians perform up close. We probably saw 8 different shows + dinner over about 5 hours and the magicians were incredible. Make sure you go early, when it opens, so you can get in line for the best shows -- and prepare to wait -- we went on a Saturday night and had to wait 1 hour+ for the best shows (there were at least 250 people there). Dinner was good but pricey - $135 for two with one glass of wine each. And you do have to wear jackets and ties for men, very dressy dresses for women, we saw lots of people in black tie.

Our room was a one bedroom suite on the 1st floor up with a balcony overlooking the pool...amazing. As we had four, we made use of the sofa bed which wasn't too bad. People who say the aircon is loud, hmm it can be but we just used it during the day and shut it while we slept and had the balcony doors/windows open with shutters closed. We had a good kitchen with big fridge/freezer, dining table etc. TV in the main room and the bedroom, bathroom was good with a shower/bath and a huge mirror. Room was awesome basically, I hear what people say about the dated decor...but I think it adds to the charm and at the end of the day for the price...its FINE. Got to add that the pool is lovely, temp is brilliant always and they offer towels so you don't have to have your own! Location is incredible and if like us you will not be having a car, public transport is SO easy to use and is like 5mins walk from the hotel, bus and subway. Cabs are expensive try to only use those for longer journeys. Right so everyone ALWAYS seems to mention the staff and rightly so, they are all amazing. Always there to help with a smile! Everyday we got the next days weather delivered to our door with chocolates by the lovely dave! The free mini bar was also incredible which we made use of everyday for either snacks or water as we went out anywhere. Thanks to all of the staff for making our stay brilliant!!

Apart from the charm we also liked the balcony with pool view ,the kids loved the free snacks & drinks & the free D.V.D library ( dvd player/ 2x t.v `s/ hi-fi in suite) full size kitchen , 2 x air-con units , 5 min walk to Hollywood bvld , close to Universal studios (easy by car or metro) but the big plus here has got be the staff ,nothing is to much trouble , any help or advice needed is gladly given by knowledgable staff, they have pre-printed colour coded sheets with details of how to get where you want go & will print of any additional maps etc you require,whatever you need they will help, when we asked about local car hire they had the hire firm fetch the car to the hotel & arranged to have it collected when we were ready, a great place full of character ,clean, plenty of those nice touches like turndown service ,mints on your pillow with next days weather report ,nice quality bathrobes etc etc , I would love to go again & would not hesitate to recommend both the hotel & the fantastic staff , thanks for a great stay!!!!!!", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cmagic castle a big hit with family\u201d", "Author": "vdams", "ReviewID": "UR19029112", "Content": "My husband, our two teenage children and I spent four nights at the castle and enjoyed it very much. We checked right in (did not get the welcome drink everyone talks about and I saw others get when they checked in) to a bottom floor room facing the pool that I had requested when I booked directly with the hotel. We like the room right away because of the size ( we just came from a much smaller room in san fran.) My son was in his glory with the free snacks that were given to him with a smile every time. I also made use of this feature on beach days and we must of saved a good one hundred bucks overall getting snacks before we left for the day. We swam one night the pool was clean and heated with nice music playing. We loved the baked goods in the morning the best of any continental breakfast we ever had. Another great feature of the hotel is they have washer and dryers. we were on vacation for two weeks so we need to do some wash. washer was one dollar per load and dryer around seventy five cents. They give you free laundry detergent. This hotel is everything this web site claims it to be. Friendly hard working staff, clean, great location , and with All the freebies its a good value for families. I have to give a shout out to the housekeeping staff. perfect service never knocking on door when we slept in and room always spotless when we returned with the extra turn down service you don't see much any more in this class hotel. Now I do have one complaint and its pretty significant. the air conditioning system is old and very loud which made it hard for me to get a good nights rest. Besides the noise the room temp changed from hot to cold all night long blankets on blankets off. I was unable to get up as early as I usually do making my mornings a little rushed. I never complained about this to management because moving rooms was not an option for me ( I hate doing that more then anything) and I read that was a problem so I suspected all the rooms were like that. I know the manager reads this site. Please do something with the air conditioners and you will have your self a perfect hotel in my opinion.

If you are a family with lots of kids who would sacrifice room quality for quantity (size), the Magic Castle is perfect for you. If you don't have kids, you may be disappointed in the quality of the rooms. The staff at the Magic Castle is the best I have ever seen in the US. They go out of their way to smile, assist, and otherwise be polite. As an example, I asked for directions to NBC studios, and they promptly looked up the best route on mapquest.com, and gave me the printout, while concurrently advising me of the best / worst times to drive. Unlike other hotels that have a good staff, at the Magic Castle they seem very sincere. They deserve the oft-mentioned recognition. However, there is one downside: the check-in counter is very narrow (as is the front entrance), so they can only serve one person at a time...when they try to accommodate 2 guests, it becomes quite chaotic. The location is also excellent. Its one long block off of Hollywood Blvd, so its easy to walk there. The room comes with free WiFi and the 'free mini-bar' was also a nice touch. The breakfast may not fill up some people, but I was personally happy with it. I had a suite and the room was huge--much more than my wife and I needed. It would be great for kids. Unfortunately, the bathroom was very small, with peeling paint and tiles and an unintentional retro look of the 70's. The beds, carpeting, and furniture looked like it was several decades old, though the bedding was excellent and the downturn service--complete with tomorrow's temperature and soft music on the new stereo--was very nice. Sadly, it seems lost on the tiny TV and cheap (thin and harsh) towels...the plusses and the minuses cancel each other out. There was one other major disappointment with this room. The first was noise. It may be far enough from Hollywood Blvd to not hear anything there, but if you're on the ground floor with a room on Franklin Ave, good luck trying to sleep unless you turn up the tiny AC unit and drown everything out with white noise. Trucks seem to rumble on Franklin all night long, and you can hear every footstep in the room above you. I would have switched rooms but I also knew the hotel was full during my stay, so I didn't bother. As comfortable as the bedding was, it was hard to sleep with all the racket. If my wife and I return with our kids, we would definitely stay here again--there's lots of room for them to run around, and the cheapness of the room will alleviate any fears of their misbehavior. Based on this scenario, I could see them as being the best that LA has to offer. But would I return without them? I am sorry, but I could not recommend it. And having stayed in several other hotels in LA before, I can't quite fathom how its #1 overall.

A complimentary breakfast was available at the reception each day which you could eat while sitting at the pool and if you required a cold drink or even a snack, you just asked at the reception which was always manned and again there it was complimentary.

We arrived early and unfortunately were not able to check in. That was fine as we had just travelled from NY and were starving. They sent us to \"The Grill\" for lunch and said they would call when the room was ready. We walked around the corner to the the Hollywood/Highland Complex and had lunch. The front desk called within an hour to tell us the room was ready. I had asked to be put on a waiting list for a 2 bedroom but there weren't any available. They offered to move us if we wanted the next day when one became available. The thought of packing up again didn't appeal to us so we stayed put! The room was fine- very clean and spacious with plenty of space to have 4 people spread out. We had 2 yound adult kids with us- 18 & 20. The 20 yr old got the sleeper sofa and the daughter shared the 2 queen beds with us in the bedroom. The bathroom was small but certainly adequate and it was nice to be able to open the window as there wasn't a fan. The 2nd day we returned hot and exhausted to our room at 4:30 and it hadn't been cleaned yet. The cleaning staff was just entering it when we got to the hotel. We were a little disappointed but just got a drink and waited on the pool deck with the free snacks. The parking garage is really different- you need 2 people to operate the entry system and it is very tight quarters. We never used the pool- it was closed the day we arrived -very milky white. The following 2 days people swam in it and it looked fine. Again ,everything around us was very clean. The 3rd day I asked if we could take the bath towels withus to the beach. Before I knew it - the girl at the front desk had packed us up a beach bag with beach towels, snacks and cold water. She even wanted to give us sunscreen!! This service is what MCH is all about. There wasn't anything they wouldn't do to make your stay wonderful. The location is perfect for Hollywood in a very safe residential neighborhood. My only concern was when we checked out there were 2 calls from our room which we never made. We had cell phones and honestly never even saw the room phone. Also- there was no one in LA for us to call! It was a local # and I would bet that housekeeping probably used the phone. That was the day we were at the beach the whole day. We paid the $2 fee and that was the end of it. It could use a coat of paint to spruce things up but other than that- it was great and we would return. There is nowhere else in LA you can stay for the price. The breakfast was fantastic and my kids loved it.

The check in was a very friendly and welcoming experience; I was given a glass of complimentary lemonade and also an overview to the local area. I was also informed of the complimentary 24/7 mini bar! My initial impressions after the check in were very positive. Hotel The room itself was not a suite, but a king bed. The bed was very comfortable and it actually has a proper duvet as opposed to a single sheet that is very common in hotels. The bathroom was also nice, particularly the shower which was a large walk in style with sliding doors. The stairway leading up to our hotel could have done with a paint job and a bit of an update, but a minor complaint in such a fantastic place. Also provided was a large LCD and DVD player. Don\u2019t forget to ask for a free DVD rental at reception! They have a large selection of complimentary DVD\u2019s that you can watch in your room. Overall the room was average looking and could probably do with an update, but it was adequate for our needs and we felt very comfortable. Glancing round the hotel, the suites look very cool! We also had a fridge freezer in our room, but no other kitchen facilities, useful for keeping our drinks in and that was about it. There is a well sized heated swimming pool in the centre of the hotel, which is an attractive feature to glance at when you walk through the reception area. The rooms are kind of built surrounding it and if you are lucky you will have a balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel also has a very secure and cosy feeling to it when you are roaming about. Breakfast is also included and is a very relaxing and fulfilling experience. They have a continental breakfast on display which was very satisfying. We relaxed by the pool enjoying our food with other guests, everyone seemed to be very happy and this created a positive atmosphere for your morning meal. A great start to the day! Another thing worth mentioning is the free mini bar they offer. You can go to the front desk and ask for anything off the menu for free. It is a good selection of snacks and drinks, very impressive and served to you with a smile always. The free wireless internet access was the only real upset here. It was a working service, but was very slow pretty much every day. It was useable, but not as fast as other hotels I have stayed in. It is also worth mentioning that as the hotel is small and cosy, the noise can sometimes be a bit frustrating. The main thing is slamming doors. Pretty much every morning I could hear doors slamming at early hours, I guess some people are just inconsiderate to others. Some hotel have devices on the doors to prevent them slamming, something the Magic Castle may want to invest in perhaps. Staff 100 percent the best hotel staff I have ever experienced. All of the staff at the Magic Castle are exceptional and provide the best service in any hotel I have stayed in. They all deserve a pay rise and are the backbone to this hotel. Every single person I spoke to was extremely helpful and also happy to listen to what I had to say. They also demonstrated going that extra mile on many occasions, Example 1: Myself and my partner were relaxing by the pool when one of the staff approached us offering us bottled water or a popsicle!, perfect to quench us whilst bathing in the hot sun. Example 2: I went to the front desk and asked for a DVD for the evening, the lady then said \u2018how about some popcorn to go with that?\u2019 I actually didn\u2019t have a microwave in my room, but don\u2019t worry they then offered to microwave it for me and bring it to our room! 2 minutes later there was a knock on the door and we had our delicious popcorn ready to eat. Outstanding customer service and what was more impressive was the fact we never actually had to request any of this, it was simply offered to us. If you want to feel welcome in a hotel this is the place to come! Another thing I found quite nice was a knock on the door each night with a card detailing the weather for the next day and also some free chocolate! Location We arrived at Union Station by Amtrak rail and the cab was 25 bucks to the hotel. About 8 miles I believe. Not too bad! The good thing is that this hotel is just round the corner from the main walk of fame strip in Hollywood. It was very convenient to go back and forth from the hotel to the local attractions on offer at Hollywood Blvd. Perfect location for what we wanted. Overall This has to be the best overall hotel experience of my life. Whilst not necessarily being the best hotel in the world, The Magic Castle compensates by offering exceptional service and value for money, whilst also providing a location 2 minutes from the main features Hollywood has to offer. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Hollywood and I most certainly will return here if I am ever in the area.

The best asset that this hotel has is the staff - they truly are the most accommodating group of hotel staff that I have ever come across. I received the warmest, friendliest check in that I have ever had in my life. To me, the little touches is what differentiates good service from exceptional. To the welcome glass of lemonade, to the unlimited complimentary mini bar and the attitude that nothing you asked was any trouble - the service was first class. They make you feel like they are truly glad that you are their guest. I can only imagine that the owners must treat their staff well for all of them to be so happy. The worst asset of this hotel is the hotel itself. When I entered my room there was a very unusual and unpleasant odor in my room. I was only there for one night and was going to see 'Wicked' that evening so I didn't bother about asking to move rooms. However I got the feeling that the same smell would possibly be in the next room anyway. It was a mix of mustiness and cleaning product. It didn't go and was still there the next morning. The hotel room was extremely generous in size, especially for one person, however it was in bad shape. The kitchen and bathroom felt dirty; they weren't but they seemed like they were because they are so old. The security did not feel that great. From what I could see (and I could be wrong) there was only one door separating the guest rooms from the reception area (which anyone can walk into). I walked straight into the reception area and to my hotel room without anyone seeing me and as all the rooms have an outside entrance it kind of felt a little unsafe to me. It is close to Hollywood Boulevard however for those people visiting LA for the first time, I think it is better to stay in an area like West Hollywood or Beverly Hills. I spent one night at Magic Castle and another two at the Chamberlain in West Hollywood (I had always planned it this way), I felt so relieved when I got to the Chamberlain - I could just relax and not feel so on edge. Very long story short - the Magic Castle is conveniently located, has wonderful accommodating staff and offers a very good rate. However, when I visit LA I go there to relax by the pool and chill out.

We had a suite with a bedroom with queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The quality of the pullout couch wasn't wonderful, but it was fine for a teenager. The kitchen facilities were adequate although we didn't make full use of them. We got some takeout from a good local convenience store on Hollywood Blvd., about 10 minutes walk away, with a nice variety of prepared asian & western foods, but the oven, microwave, etc. in the kitchen were very handy. The room wasn't as modern as some generic hotel rooms, but it had a 40's/50's charm that you can't get in a modern hotel room, and certainly the rooms and bathrooms were clean. The staff was wonderful, even offered to drive us to the top of the hill to the Japanese restaurant, for us to admire the amazing view of Hollywood and L.A. We walked back down again, but I'm sure they would have picked us up had we requested it. Snacks were free upon request, as were DVD's from their extensive video library. The staff was always cheerful and friendly, and seem to enjoy working there! The location is great, about 2 blocks from the Chinese theater and Hollywood Blvd., but far enough away that noise was not really an issue, despite the hotel's location on a fairly busy street (although not a major boulevard). We didn't use the pool, but we did see a number of families using it. The nice breakfast buffet (included in the price) was a real plus; guests can either take their trays and sit by the pool, or bring them to their rooms to eat there. If you're looking for a luxurious Hollywood hotel stay (probably for a lot more money), don't stay here - but for budget-conscious travellers, especially families, looking for a good location and friendly atmosphere, this is a great place!", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cSmall in Stature, Big on Service\u201d", "Author": "Mardukas", "ReviewID": "UR16496156", "Content": "On our first trip to Hollywood, we stayed in the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. The location was ideal for us, but the hotel left much to be desired. It's not that the accommodations themselves were bad, but that you feel like second class citizens when you stay in one of those trendy places. We had to show our room keys in order to get into the pool, only to find that many of the poolside seats were reserved for people who were apparently more important than we. And who, most days, didn't even seem to show. Not to mention the fact that if you wanted to enjoy the pool you had better do it early, because it was off limits at night, as this is where the trendy outdoor bar is located. Which we didn't even try to get into. For our second trip to Hollywood, we were to have more people with us, requiring an additional room. With the Roosevelt out of the equation, our only reasonable options seemed to be the Hollywood Renaissance and the Magic Castle. And by reasonable, I mean somewhere you'd want to stay. Because there is nothing reasonable about the prices at the Renaissance. The fact that the Magic Castle offered two bedroom suites with full kitchen for the price of one room at the Renaissance is what really sealed the deal for us. Though I did have my concerns after reading some of the reviews on here. Those concerns were largely unfounded. Upon arrival we were greeted with sparkling lemonade and a menu for the free mini bar, offering everything from sodas and candy to chips and granola bars. We made good use of the mini bar during our stay, even receiving more of the sparkling lemonade as requested. And, although we did not end up using the in-room DVD player, I could see that they had a healthy selection of free rentals on hand behind the front desk, even such recent releases as The Simpsons Movie. Unlike our experience at the Roosevelt, seating at the pool was first come first served. And the pool did not close at dusk, or even at all. Which proved to be a bad thing a few nights into our trip as the rowdy group of twenty-somethings who had checked in next door to us engaged in a late night (3:00 AM) swim with no regard for their fellow guests. But after a call to the front desk, the woman on duty sent for security (I don't blame her for not wanting to handle it herself) and shortly thereafter we were able to get back to sleep. With the Magic Castle, we were able to stay in the same location as the Roosevelt, but with much better service for the common man. The rooms were nice and clean, if a bit dated. And though I'm no interior designer, there seemed to be more they could do with the space. But that didn't really matter. What did matter was we had more than enough room to accommodate our party and were treated as well as you could ask. Other nice touches you won't find most other places; the poolside popsicles provided by the staff, the free continental breakfast, and the nightly mints and weather forecast card for the following day. And, though the room description indicated that only one of the bedrooms would have a TV (in addition to the one in the living room), we actually had one in each room.

The staff was welcoming, and the hotel had lots of perks included. They gave us a welcome glass of lemonade and a list of DVDs you can borrow for free. The staff really went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. At least, that's how it seemed. THEN...We borrowed a DVD from the front desk. We went into the room and saw that the DVD player was missing. We went ahead and asked the girl at the front desk about it. She seemed very surprised and said there would be one in the room when we got back that evening. We got back to our room at about 10 pm, ready to settle into our movie. We were stopped by the guy at the front desk and told that they couldn't get the color to work on the DVD player, so we'd have to watch it in black and white. (Seriously?) This is when we realized that the customer service during our arrival was just an act. We thought, ok, that's ridiculous, but we'll suck it up and watch black and white. We turn on the system and realize the DVD player not only has no color but no sound. Additionally, the picture looked so pixelated, it was basically unwatchable. I called the front desk to ask how they could resolve this situation. The girl told me she'd have to call me back in 5 minutes so she could talk to the manager. Fine. 10 minutes later, she called to tell me that the room description did not guarantee a DVD player, so we were out of luck. Now I started getting upset. Most hotels would offer to move you to a different room or comp you in some way. NOT THE MAGIC CASTLE. I asked to be moved. She said she couldn't do that, so I asked to speak to the manager. Coincidentally, she had left 5 minutes before. She would talk to the supervisor, who was on his break. He'd call back in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, she called back to say that the only room they had was a suite. If we wanted to move, we'd have to pay an extra $30 for the \"upgrade.\" Now I was getting really upset at the horrible service. I asked her if she would rather have an empty room and an upset customer. \"There's nothing I can do unless you want to pay the extra money.\" I told her there was no way I was paying extra to get the services that they had promised me when I checked in. 20 minutes go by, and she calls back to offer a complimentary move to the suite. It is now 11 pm! When we checked out, the girl at the front desk asked how our stay was. I told her we had some problems. Her response: \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" Seriously, that was it! No follow-up. No offers to make things right. Nothing. And the last straw was that when we got our bill, there was a $10 parking charge that is neither listed on their website nor mentioned when they give you the parking permit. Lastly, these rooms are renovated in the cheapest way I have ever seen. Door jams look like they've been broken into. The tubs were resurfaced and are now peeling.

We reserved a 2-bedroom unit, which is recommended if you are troubled by noise, as these units are in the back (away from the street). We also appreciated the heated swimming pool, the free breakfast (fruit, scones, muffins, juices, coffee), the laundry facilities, the free water bottles and snacks and the cheerful hospitality of the staff (who readily offered advice, printed directions to sites and help with dinner reservations). It was also convenient having a reasonably priced parking facility ($10 a night) underneath the hotel. (L.A. is huge and sprawling, so you need a car to see anything beyond the immediate Hollywood area.) I would choose something newer and nicer if it were just the two of us, but if you are traveling with kids who are too big to share a sleeper sofa (and the local suite hotels I tried informed me that they did not have additional cots at their L.A. locations), this works out well.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cAVOID!!!!\u201d", "Author": "c4sper21", "ReviewID": "UR14657168", "Content": "Possibly my worst experience of Los Angeles.

We were shown to our room....right at the very back of the hotel in a corner on the first floor. Right away...I had my reservations. The room layout was very very odd and \"snug\" to say the least. As we had been travelling by parter was desperate for a shower. As soon as the shower went on..the lights and the tv in the room started to flash on and off.....there was a terrible rackett from a generator and the pwoer cut on and off.... Right away I called reception who told me they'd send an engineer....The engineer arrived to tell me that the room had been made by splitting a larger room into two...and that he'd had reservations about the electricity circuit since it had been done. Right away I called reception to explain....they advised that they'd fix it the following day. I refused to stay in a room which was unsafe.

The staff is incredibly nice and helpful and the little amenities - the cold drink when you check in, the cider at night, the music playing when you go into the room - are great.

Franklin Avenue itself is historic - parts of Rebel Without A Cause was filmed here, Janis Joplin died next door, Yamashiro, the Japanese Restaurant on the hill has an incredible history, and Ozzie and Harriet's (and Ricky's) house where they lived during their long-running popular TV show is just a few blocks away on Franklin.

Following this, I was shown to my room and was amazed at the size of it. It was as big as an apartment that you would be quite happy to live in. There was an open plan living room complete with TV, radio, sofa, comfy stools that lead into a dining area with full sized dining table and then on to a kitchen complete with sink, cupboards, microwave, full size fridge and a fresh coffee maker. In the back was the bedroom with two full size built in wardrobes and large comfortable bed and in the next room the bath/shower. My room was on the ground floor near reception so the view looked out onto the pool that is in the centre of the complex. A continental breakfast was available in the reception area and you could eat it in the sunshine at the tables around the pool. An internet service is also available in this area. The hotel is in an excellent location, just five minutes walk to the Chinese Theatre and all of the other attractions of Hollywood Boulevard. As mentioned, I didn\u2019t have a car, but getting around was not a problem using the Magic Castle as a base as it is only about 7 minutes walk to Hollywood/Highland metro station, 4 minutes walk to a bus stop on Hollywood Boulevard that has buses that go to numerous places such as Sunset Strip etc and close to a number of attractions such as the Kodak Theatre and a stunning view of the Hollywood sign.

When and why we stayed: We stayed here for 5 nights in December 2007 during a holiday in LA and Las Vegas. Cost: We paid \u00a390 per night for the room plus breakfast. We booked the room via Expedia. Room: We stayed in Room 219 which was actually an apartment with separate bedroom, bathroom, kitchen & lounge/dining room. The bedroom contained a king-sized bed, television, drawers and vast wardrobe space with no shortage of hangers (a pet hotel peeve of mine is that most provide a dearth of hangers!) The lounge/dining room was family sized and contained a sofa; desk and chair; television; DVD player; CD player, as well as dining table and chairs. The kitchen contained a fridge, microwave, oven, hob and a life-saver - a coffee maker! The bathroom was clean, and included a smallish tub and shower. Complimentary toiletries were supplied each day. The Hotel: The Magic Castle may not be the most modern or grandest hotel that we have stayed in but more importantly for us the customer service provided was superb and the staff were very helpful, something you can\u2019t always state after a stay in a chain hotel. It was the nothing-is-too-much trouble approach that we appreciated, for example, the hotel posted our cards for us for no charge \u2013 and they all arrived! The Magic Castle provides some wonderful extras like a complimentary Mini Bar (from Reception). The Menu includes Coke, Doritos, Kit Kat and Popcorn. The in-room replenished daily Wolfgang Puck coffee was super! Breakfast cereals, juices, scones and croissants are left in reception from 7AM each morning. Breakfast can be eaten at tables besides the pool or in your room (trays are supplied). There is parking outside the hotel or in an underground parking area (access obtained via your room key). A $10 per day charge is levied. If you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room as there is no lift to the Upper Floor. Location: The Magic Castle is in a great location \u2013 it really is only 5 minutes (safe including at night) walk from Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood & Highland Mall (where the Oscars are held in the Kodak Theatre); Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. The city: LA is a fantastic, cosmopolitan, real, living city. This was my second visit and my wife\u2019s first, so I could guide her to the highlights. We visited: Hollywood Forever cemetery; the Capitol Tower; Hollywood Farmers Market (excellent); The Grove Mall (A Mall!); Santa Monica (The Pier isn\u2019t as good as Brighton\u2019s) and Venice Beach; Pasadena; The Getty Art Gallery; The Getty Villa in Malibu (it was cool to drive on the Pacific Highway to get there); and Beverley Hills which is such a clich\u00e9 but I strangely enjoyed none the less. Driving in LA was nowhere near as bad as I had expected. Although in the words of the Dionne Warwick song: \u201cLA is a great big freeway\u201d.

There were some really great things about the hotel - staff seemed very jolly, the free \"mini bar\"; basically you can select soft drinks, chips, candies from a huge selection - for free, 24 hours a day. The continental breakfast wasn't really gourmet, but certainly there were some nice pastries and hey - it's free! On the downside our room was barely big enough for cat swinging and the recent renovations themselves look like they need some renovating. Our main complaint was that our room was really noisy. The walls are paper thin and, apparently unlike the other guests, we are in the minority as we like to sleep until 9.30am or so when we are on vacation. Sadly we were woken daily at 7am by stomping up and down stairs outside, doors slamming and whoever happened to be in the room next door - thanks to an adjoining door they literally sounded as though they were in the same room as us. Also slightly off-putting - the ashtray for our floor was right outside our window and by our air conditioning unit so a few times we had the A/C on only to find moments later our room smelling of smoke. Also pretty annoying was the lack of regulation of hot water in the shower - every day there was leaping in and out of the stream of water from either being scalded or frozen.

We made our way to our room and were amazed by the size we had been given a suite and it was lovely, it had a kitchen a living area a fab bathroom that had lots of mirrors to do your hair and makeup and really good lighting! They had even left some chocolates on our pillow with the next days weather forcast! Only complaint would be how dark the rest of the room was but thats all! The Location is also fantastic it is simply 5 mins walk to the chinese theatre and the area isnt scary at all, so we were very pleased. Having that location made the Magic Castle worth every penny. The next morning breakfast was served around the gorgeous pool area and we had coffee cerals and muffins in the sun it was a great way to start our days sightseeing!

Sean and Megan deserve a special mention here, in particular Sean who really went the extra mile.

Every question posed to the staff (you know , those boring ones about where to go, how to get there etc, the ones they had heard a thousand times before) were met with a cheerful smile and enthusistic reply.

I know people don't like it when people give bad reviews. If you read my review you will probably think \"well that guy is picky or a snob\" or \"this guy is an idiot that has never travelled because look at all the positive reviews\". Just so you know where I am coming from and can better judge whether or not you believe my bad review. I'm a 30 year old professional and have done a lot of travelling - some for business and a lot for fun. I'm from Toronto. I've travelled extensively in the United States. I know that this place is a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star hotel. I understand that in a major North American city that $180 is not a lot to spend for a nights stay in a downtown location. All I expect from a 3 star hotel is: clean and current decor in the lobby and rooms but nothing flashy, basic amenities like internet and a desk to do some work on, and reasonable staff that are polite and moderately helpful. If this place had all of these things I would have given it a 5 rating or said it was excellent. I was on my honeymoon and I would not come back to this hotel. My main complaint is the rooms. I'd rather just spend an extra $75 or $100 a night to stay somewhere decent. If I had known what this hotel was really like I would have gladly dropped the extra cash somewhere else. I paid about $180 bucks for a Thursday night stay - too expensive for what it was. - Cons - The pictures on the website are misleading because they don't show you the grungy bathrooms, noisy window unit air-conditioners, or stained carpets. The room also had a musty smell which I might expect in Mexico or South America but not in the United States. I was pretty disgusted with our first room and asked to be moved. The next room was still grungy but slightly better. Honestly, this place needs to change the carpets in the rooms. It could use a complete overhaul, however, it definitely needs new carpets. I know that the rooms are probably just as clean or dirty as any other hotel but when the carpets are beat up and stained it just makes you feel like you need to wear shoes in the room at all times. Both the rooms had a dirty $30 a night motel feel about them. - Pros - Good location to do all the tacky Hollywood stuff (visit Mann's theatre, the walk of fame, etc.). Friendly and helpful staff during the day time. The night time staff llooked like they were into goth, demons and depression. Maybe I'm getting old but I'm not into hotel staff having lip rings and blue hair (I don't know if they were friendly or helpful because I didn't bother talking to them). The pool was open 24 hours (but looked pretty nasty and was more of kids urinal than a pool). Free WiFi for your laptop. Nice soaps, creams, and stuff. Pretty comfortable bed and bedding. Free snacks and DVDs that are available in the lobby. - How is this #2 on TripAdvisor???? - Because of this hotel and it's #2 rating in Los Angeles, I don't know whether I will ever trust TripAdvisor ratings again. Are travellers so enamoured by friendly staff and free candy bars that they overlook the rooms being disgusting and in drastic need of renovation. The only thing magical about this place is that it somehow got a #2 rating on TripAdvisor. Don't stay here if you want to spend anytime at all in your room or at the hotel. This place is NOT romantic. It might be okay for famillies with kids because you can get rooms with kitchenettes to save on dining costs. We just had a room without the kitchen.

This is a hotel with history and personality. It's not another Holiday Inn Express or whatever. It is also in the city, folks - yes, you will see homeless people, and yes, you will see interesting street life on Hollywood Boulevard. If that scares or upsets you, I would advise picking another area in which to sightsee. Hollywood may be undergoing some gentrification but it is not Disneyland. As everyone says, the front desk staff members go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied. I saw the manager all over the place all the time, not hiding back in an office. We had a king bed suite and the space was just huge. The kitchen and bathroom were very clean; I had no problem at all there. My favorite spot was the balcony over the pool, where you could sit and read the newspaper, watch the kids in the pool, or just drink your morning coffee before another day of sightseeing. Breakfast included the yummiest scones ever and top-notch coffee. Now, on the other hand, it is a remodeled older former apartment building and there are some irritants. The stairs and railings need paint, and some coverings on the stairs are coming loose. The carpet in the hallways is getting worn. There was a crack in the paint on one wall in our kitchen, and a small hole in a window. The stopper in the bathroom sink didn't work. Some of the housekeeping was a little spacey - plenty of forks and knives in the utensil drawer but no spoons, no glasses replaced one day, no bath mat another day. But if it really deeply mattered to me I am sure the desk would have sent up more spoons or another bath mat immediately. I think this is a great little hotel, and I'll be sad if it gets sold and turned into yet another condo development or generic hotel. The best option would be new owners who could spruce it up without raising the prices too much or losing the great staff members.

This hotel was on a list recommended by the school that my son was attending an open house for as it was only a 15 minute walk from the school. I thought the hotel would be bigger and was a little disappointed when we arrived. It reminded me of the show Melrose Place with the rooms all surrounding the pool. But the staff put us at ease the minute we arrived and the good thing about a smaller hotel is that the staff get to recoginize you very quickly and they also know who doesn't belong there. They were so friendly and greeted every time we walked by.My son and I had a one bedroom suite with dining area and kitchen and 2 queen beds that were very comfortable.The rooms were very clean and large. The shower was amazing as it had so much pressure that washing my hair was so easy. 45 minutes before we were checking out and our limo ( that the hotel had arranged for us) was to pick us up, I dropped a glass in the sink and it broke and I sliced my finger quite badly and I could not get the bleeding to stop. My son went down to the front desk and staff came to my aid and said I needed stitches and they would drive me to a local clinic. Panic set in as I was afraid we would miss our flight. The hotel manager drove me and my son to a clinic she goes to and that was 5 minutes from the hotel and when we arrived she explained my delimma. They saw me immediately and she waited in the waiting room for me and helped my son with all the paper work. 30 minutes later with 5 stitches in my finger we were on our way back to the hotel, were the limo driver had been contacted and asked to wait for us. He did and we were only 15 minutes off schedule and we made our flight with time to spare. I can't thank the management and hotel staff enough for taking care of me and keeping my son calm through this unusual event.

This is an older building and nothing fancy but nevertheless, clean, tastefully decorated and spacious.

Sort of a throwback, of sorts, to the hotels of old where customers were treated as royalty and where the entire staff are all on the \"same page\" when it comes to taking personal responsibilty for exceeding customer expectations. Very rarely do you find this prevailing attitude among staff in American hotels. The hotel offers free beverages, movies and snacks unlike most hotels that \"nickel and dime\" its customers to squeeze out every bit of profit imaginable. Here, they truley understand that their customers are their best advertisers. Needless to say, we had a great time at the Magic Castle and overall we had a blast in Hollywood.

They offered us popsicles as we lounged by the pool. They lent us free DVD's for viewing. They also printed out information on a world premiere happening on Hollywood Boulevard. By far, the nicest \"touch\" was the birthday cake and balloons they had for my mother-in-law in her room when we checked in on her birthday. Their covered parking is very secure and we took advantage of the added bonus of entrance to the Magic Castle for Saturday brunch. That is a \"must do\" as well!!!

The only problem we had was that I had reiterated that we had three older sons who WOULD NOT even consider sharing a bed.............it would not do with their Aussie teenage pride!.....but when we arrived late there was no extra bed. Any angst I may have felt evaporated immediately when the concerned staff did everthing in their power to remedy the situation. I wish I had noted the name of the lovely lady who spent so much time on her knees trying to get the airbed to work and the gentleman who helped her. I would like to thank them here!! The boys swallowed their pride and the next evening a mattress was carried up for us. All in all this was a small inconvenience considering all the pros. Each day when we came back the room was spotless, there were chocolates on the master bed and soft music was playing on the stereo. The pool is lovely and we had a midnight swim each evening. Breakfast was lovely out by the pool and everyone seemed to take in the atmosphere, chatting through breakfast. There was a large variety for breakfast and with three teenagers it was a wonderful start to the day....sorry about the consumption of all those croissants....THE BEST EVER my 13 yr old says! A quick walk took us to the subway for Universal Studios one stop away..following the carefully detailed directions from the outstanding young man on the desk who gave us bottles of water as we were to be out all day! Sorry again for the lack of name (my husband's fault this time!!) but our grateful thanks all the same.

It is interesting if you look back at the reviews that all the bad ones express the same problems and believe me they are true. The only thing this hotel (more like a motel) has going for it is that it is near hollywood boulevard. Bedroom/apt was a short walk from main motel.It was beside other residential apts. Not very good first impression, very un hotel like. Room had light door with paper thin walls. No dvd player even though all rooms were supposed to have one. Left a do not disturb sign on door when we went for dinner, but came back to see a maid had entered and left two chocolates on our pillows but stole a bottle of piper champagne out of our luggage. I am being totally truthful & sincere when I say this. Hotel will probably write a response to this denying it but I am not a fool. I know when I am fleeced. It is also very interesting if you look at other bad reviews of this motel, that I was not the only one who was stolen from. There was noise all night long from cars zooming right outside our bedroom window and cars pulling in to car park just outside our front door with partying yobs etc. Any reply from Magic Castle in my view is a desperate cry from a desperate motel.

This is the only property I've stayed at in the Hollywood area so I can't compare it to other nearby properties but feel that would be the fairest way to evaluate this property. I research my vacations to death and hadn't run across many properties that had such a uniform, overwhelming positive response so I felt this was a no-brainer. Three words best decribe this place: Location, Staff, and Location. Did I say location? As far as I can tell, if you want to be within walking distance of the center of the Hollywood Universe, this is a superb choice (although there is really not much to see besides the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theater, and the new Mall at Hollywood & Highland - otherwise this area is pretty cheesy/touristy definitely something you can see in a half day.) Nevertheless it is a good base from which to explore other surrounding areas. I'd say the reviews in general overhype this place a tad too much. The staff is on the ball and provide little 'extras' here and there like the champagne glass of lime pop when you check in, popsicles at the pool, the chocolates and weather report card in the evening. I guess these little things really impress people as many other properties don't make the small effort to do similar things. As a result, these little things they do help to give the illusion (yes pun intended) that this property is something very special. The reality is the rooms (at least ours and from reading some of the other reviews) are spacious and clean, but bit run-down and apparently have probably had only minor cosmetic rennovations in recent years such as a coat of paint and maybe some new carpet. Most (not all) of the furnishings are sparse, cheap, dated, and in some cases tired looking. There are many small aspects (although minor) of the room which were in disrepair such as peeling paint on the bathroom ceiling, linoleum coming up around the tub, slidding shudder off it's hinges (which maintenance didn't fix properly), etc. The bathroom is small, basic, and very dated with very old fixtures. It appears the only thing they've done recently to the bathroom is slap some cheap, ugly Corian on the countertop. Water pressure is good and hot water doesn't run out. A big plus. Bedroom bed was comfortable, although a little on the firm side, too firm for my wife. The mattress on the pull-out was a joke. No way anyone over 50 pounds could get a good night's rest on it. Definitely need a new pullout mattress. The rooms have a very (I'm guessing) 1950's feel so don't book here expecting to get something newly renovated with latest furnishing and appliances. I didn't really expect this anyway but you get the feeling the owner is trying to maximize profits instead of reinvesting back into the rooms and the staff is trying to do these little extra things to make up for it. (You can rennovate while still retaining that old-school charm.) Many may characterize the rooms as having a nostalgic feel and the overall hotel having a boutique feel, which it does, and we liked that feel. The pool is small, but adequate. There is no Jacuzzi (a big minus). The layout of the hotel against the side of a hill with a U shape is great as it makes the inner courtyard/pool area shielded from the loud traffic of the busy street out front. Housekeeping service is excellent. I'd recommend staying here but don't go here with high expectations like you'll being staying at a small, boutique version of the Beverly Hills Hotel.

I'd requested the same 1-bdrm I'd had the last time, but they put me in a room that was actually bigger and nicer than the first one! (The bathroom in this one was especially roomy.) Reception was great about getting me checked in quickly since I was exhausted and needed a nap! Again, the sound of soft music was playing as I first entered the room. I should say apartment instead of room since the suite is enormous, with a hallway leading from the large living room to the bathroom, and then another to the bedroom. Just incredibly big for a hotel room! I was going to a comedy club on Hollywood Blvd, and instead of calling a cab in the nightmare Saturday night traffic I was advised by the hotel staff to walk where I was going instead, so I did. That was just perfect. I walked up the bustling boulevard over all the stars on the sidewalk and watched the tourists gawk at the familiar Hollywood landmarks and street performers. It was about a 10 minute brisk walk and well worth it. I got back to the hotel earlier than I'd expected that night, so I went down to the desk for snacks (complimentary) like candy bars and microwave popcorn. I was even able to check out a DVD for the night, free. (There's a DVD player in the full entertainment center in the large living room.) Since it was still fairly early and the hotel shuttle driver was on the site I asked if they could take me up the hill to their sister property, the Hollywood Hills Hotel. (It's on the grounds of the restaurant Yamashiro.) The view of all of Los Angeles and Hollywood from up there was just phenomenal. Evidently, the rooms aren't as nice as in the Magic Castle Hotel, but the views more than make up for it. (No views from the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill.) Afterward, I made my microwave popcorn and a cup of tea in my large full kitchen, and sat out on my big balcony overlooking the pool and just enjoyed the quiet night and the great weather. Overall, another great stay. Management and all the front desk employees went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and get me everything I needed.

We have enjoyed staying in many 5 star hotels around the world and have experienced very good service. I have to say that the Magic Castle Hotel can stand with the best when it comes to friendly staff, great service, and cleanliness. Arrival: The hotel is centrally located in Hollywood and was easy to find. The lobby is not large but is very accommodating, welcoming and tastefully decorated. The staff greeted us warmly and seemed genuinely friendly. On one side of the lobby there was a large arrangement of cookies, an assortment of teas, spiced cider, and packets for hot chocolate. There was also cool water containing sliced cucumbers. A delicious continental breakfast is served every morning from 7- 10AM. The food is arranged in the lobby and can be enjoyed out by the pool or you can take it to your room. Checking in was quick and the staff carried our luggage to our room which was on the second level. There are no elevators but there are rooms on the ground level if stairs are a challenge. There are also a few steps to the front entrance of the hotel. The rooms surround a large, lovely courtyard. Many of the rooms on the second and third levels have balconys overlooking the courtyard. Ours did not but I will know to ask ahead for one next time we visit. In the center of the courtyard is a 'splash pool'. If you want Olympic laps this is not the pool for you. It is just the right size for a refreshing dip and floating around. My kids loved it. Our room: We had the junior suite and found it to be fairly large and very clean. The carpeting looked new. In addition to the TV there was a DVD player and CD player. My kids brought their laptops and there was wirless internet for them. The hotel has a nice complimentay DVD library. When my kids went to select DVDs they were surprised with a complimentary bucket of microwave popcorn packets and an assortment of candy. The beds have down comforters and the mattresses were firm and comfortable. Turndown service is provided every evening along with chocolate mints. Location: The hotel is located at the foot of a hill within 2 blocks of busy Hollywood Blvd. Once you turn off of Hollywood Blvd the crowds and noise seem to thin out appreciably. The subway is about 3 blocks from the hotel on Hollywood Blvd and we used it to get to Universal Studios. The city was in preparation for the Oscars while we were there. All of these preparations take place in the 2 block area close to the hotel. The Hollywood/ Highland subway stop is closed on the day of the Oscars. Metro and auto traffic is detoured as well beginning several days before the Oscar presentations. Pedestrian traffic is also detoured on Hollywood Blvd beginning several days prior to Oscar day but all the major sights are still accessible such as the Kodak theater, walk of fame, and Chinese theater. I was told that this inconvenience only happens during the week of Oscar preparations every year. We found it fun and exciting to watch the city get ready for the Oscars day by day despite the inconvenience of the detours. Staff: I have never been treated better at any hotel that I have ever stayed at. The staff just go out of their way to make your stay pleasant and enjoyable. They are friendly, courteous and they let you know that they are there for you. When my kids were up into the night with jet lag I spent lots of time going to the lobby for DVD's and snacks and Marzia on the night shift was so patient and helpful. All the staff should be commended. They give you 5 star service and 5 star treatment. There are lots of bigger, grander, more luxurious hotels in L.A. but the staff at the Magic Castle make it stand along side any of them. In my opinion, there is none better.

It is not an exclusive 4 star ,but by far the most inviting, comfortable place.

The hotel is small but in a great location, just two blocks from Hollywood Blvd. One of the best parts was its association with the Magic Castle. Minors can't get into the Castle to see the performances except on weekend brunches and unless you are with a member. The only exception is for those staying at the hotel. Since my son is a magic buff, that was a big attraction of staying there. However, we were pleasantly surprised with just about everything. Most impressive was the staff which was so incredibly friendly and helpful. They were never overbearing but always willing to help out. The rooms were decent, but not overly impressive. They had everything we needed. I was a little taken aback by the carpets, which looked a little worn, but half-way through our stay, they were being replaced. The beds were very comfy while the bathrooms were a little tired, but still very functional and clean. Every morning there was a continental breakfast served in the small lobby. I ususally took my food out to the pool-side tables and sat there. The pool was a great feature; it wasn't too big but was great for cooling off. My only complaint was one night, at about 2 a.m., some drunks jumped in and were a little noisy. But that was an isolated occurence. If you're there on vacation, you can easily walk to Hollywood Blvd and all the attractions there. As well, the hotel next door -- which I wouldn't suggest you stay at -- is where Janis Joplin was found dead. Overall, I'd go back to this hotel in a minute, based largely on the staff.

The cleanliness was well below standard as the room was very dusty in all corners. Very old worn carpets, a functional but run down bathroom, a very noisy dilapidated air conditioning system and hard to control ceiling fan are among the highlights. On the plus side the room was a decent size, the bed was quite comfortable, there is an empty fridge which is useful and a desk, plus a large TV and a DVD player. The wardrobe is a fair size with large mirrors and a safe.

We found the staff to be varied - some were helpful when we asked for advice. However there was a general reluctance to change our traveller's cheques each day which seemed incredible - we were often told they \"didn't have\" $100 to change, but then go back and ask someone else and they would. This is a small apartment style hotel, with the feel of a beach hotel without the beach. The very small pool is the focal point around which the three or four floors of rooms are built - with no ramps or elevators! Getting your cases up the stairs is a nightmare! The location of the hotel is it's best feature. Our main reason for visiting was to see a show at the Hollywood Bowl which turned out to be a 10-15 minute walk which saved being stuck in traffic.

Some of the pictures showed the motel with very contemporary rooms. However, when I arrived at the hotel I was less than impressed. It must be said that there are two sides to this hotel. On the one side, you have what are called \"one/two bedroom suites\". These are the the rooms you are going to see in the pictures when you are booking. However, the room I got was a \"deluxe queen\" I believe. These rooms it seems are not yet renovated, and not at all up to the standards of what you pay for. My girlfriend and I checked in to what looked like a rennovated apartment building next to the magic castle. Not met by sparkling cider and not shown to our room as the other guests were when checking in. The first room we went to had a broken lock to its connecting room which made it free for me or my neighbors to open up our doors and enter each others rooms. So, the hotel decided to place a small table in front of the door to make all well. Beyond that, the room was sitting well in the 90 degree range. So...we asked for another room. No problem there...and we were given another unimpressive, unrennovated room. The room was steaming again and until we left we had to run the air conditioning unit on high to stay at all comfortable. After complaining about our first room and expressing our concern that we didnt get what we paid for, nick at the front desk said he would try and get us in to a nicer room the following day. Next day....back down to the front desk to ask about a new room (and to ask why the wireless internet wasnt working, which we were directed to a 1-800 number for tech support). We were told by one of the ladies that since we didnt come to the front desk by 11am someone was already booked in the nicer room. So were they willing to give us some kind of discount or do anything for us? Nope. She said she tried to contact us, even though our phone never rang and we were only about 30 feet away for her to walk and knock on our door. So following that...we decided to check out early. We had already walked along the strip the previous day and didnt mind moving a little bit further away. During our complaining and early departure, not once did we talk to Mike, the front end manager who sat just behind the glass at the front desk, or did we talk to darren, the hotel manager who was onsite as well and who also knew of the situation. On the positive, this motel is extremely close to the Chinese theater and if you get a rennovated room, your stay will probably be quite nice. However, while I stood at the front desk to check out I called Comfort Inn and Suites and got an exceptionally nicer room for about $40+ cheaper, but it was just a little futher off the strip. Basically, only stay here if your going to pay the extra for the larger rooms, and that is if you really want to pay that much. If your just looking for a room close to the strip, there are more than enough close to hollywood blvd or sunset that are quite cheaper and much nicer. On a side note of the staff at the Magic Castle, Nick was professional and nice enough as was one of the other gentleman we were helped by on our first day there. However, the two ladies we ran in two at the front desk on the next day seemed to possess little knowledge and even less tact. But, most of all the management was not at all up to calibur.

It was dingy, had only 1 of the 2 promised bathrooms, offered closets so musty that I immediately re-closed the doors, and a shower the size of a coffin. But the real horrible twist was the paper-thin walls and the loud noise from the street. I immediately requested a room change but none was available and the newbie clerk said \"just close the windows\". With all windows closed, this heavy sleeper was awoken multiple times and finally crawled into bed with her children in an inner room where noise was still heard. I went to the clerk the next morning almost in tears: for $250 a night, I expected more, at least a decent night of sleep. She ended up refunding the night's charge, assigning us to a new room (switching us with new unfortunate guests), and treated us to a box of treats. Very pleasant. The new room was all that I had expected: light, roomy, and hip. No street noise since we were in a courtyard off the street.

The rooms all surround a pool (very Melrose Place like) and are very spacious. Our room had a full kitchen with microwave, stove, fridge and dining table. There was a fold out sofa bed in the second room for our son. (Great for kids but not really for adults as it was not all that comfortable.) There was a television in both rooms (though the one in the master bedroom would only show one channel), a dvd player (you could borrow dvds from reception at no charge) and the bathroom had a bath and shower but was a little tired. The room itself was not young, but was spotless and there were some very nice little touches including chocolates on pillows, a card with the expected weather for the next day and a complimentary continental breakfast. The bed in the master bedroom was incredibly comfortable! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the security was good and undercover, secure parking was available for $8 a day. The hotel was located a block away from the Chinese Theatre and the stars in the sidewalk of Hollywood Boulevard - but LA is somewhere you really need a car so depending on what you are interested in this would determine whether you thought it was a good location.

They helped us whenever we needed it, and they treated us with a sincere friendliness that you don't learn in customer service class. It seems that the owners or managers have done a great job of hiring the right people. They all seemed genuinely concerned about our happiness at the hotel, and they went out of their way to help us whenever necessary. Again, this wasn't the \"false smile, patronizing attitude pretense\" that seems to pass for customer service; this was a bunch of nice people trying to make sure we had a good time at their place. One example: Our key card was not working for us to enter their garage, so one of the staff members came out of the hotel to help. (Yes, apparently they were monitoring the garage entrance and noticed our problem.) When I pointed out the problem, the gentleman used his card to open the garage for us, then said that he would run inside, re-program my key card, and meet me in the garage to give me my card. (Yes, he came down to meet me.) This is just one example of how they went out of their way to take care of us. We also enjoyed the other aspects of the hotel: the location is great (close proximity to all of the Hollywood attractions), our 1-bedroom suite was spacious and decorated with personality (not a generic hotel look), and the heated pool, although on the small side, gave us a peaceful retreat from sightseeing (my kids loved the pool).

You can eat by the pool or take it back to your room while you read the complementary paper. As well as being terrific value for money, the location is excellent; one block from Hollywood Boulevard and one metro stop from Universal Studios. All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, always. I have never stayed in a hotel where everybody was so good-humoured.

The next morning I woke up and went to the lobby area to enjoy a wonderful continental breakfast. This is not your typical hotel breakfast. They served Wolfgang Puck coffee, fresh fruit, juices and cereal. You must try the scones and the criossants! Excellent! They even came to my table to refill my coffee! Later that day I approached the front desk on advice on what to do. They have tons of information on area attractions. Did I mention that they are one block from the world famous Chinese Theater and the new Kodak Theater? I was given information on local places to eat, museums and great tourist maps! So I went on a great walking tour of the city. It was nice! After a long day of walking and sightseeing, I came back to the hotel to find my bed turned down with a small chocolate kiss on my pillow. Of course, I went for my late night swim and called it a night! I often travel to LA for business and was happy to see that the hotel offers free high speed wireless. Its great to be able to work from my room or sit around the pool area. It was pretty warm when I visited, so I was offered popsicles! I thought this was playful and friendly! Every single staff member I came in contact with was ever so friendly. Always smiling and willing to help! They even remembered my name!! The room I got was spacious and lovely.

The reason that we picked this hotel was to have a kitchen and be close to our destination - Universal Studios. As previously stated in all of the other reviews, the crown jewel of this hotel is the very good service given by the young staff. Also previously stated, the layout of the hotel is as the set of the Melrose Place TV show. All of the rooms surround a small courtyard with a small pool in the middle. No elevators, just stairways. The rooms themselves are reasonably sized for a suite-type hotel. They have been recently renovated, but not particularly well. In our room, the bathroom door didn't shut properly and the baseboards were already peeling. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils, etc. Besides the TVs, there was also a small stereo system in the living room and a DVD player - nice. The sofa bed was not comfortable as the mattress wasn't well supported to the metal frame. A nice feature is that they use down comforters instead of regular blankets. Of special note, was the great water pressure in the shower. It was like standing underneath a giant waterfall! The continental breakfast is good, not great. As previously mentioned the baked goods were above average. Parking is $8/day for the small gated garage. The garage is a little tight, but we didn't have problems finding a spot every night. The main reason that I'm only giving an average rating was the level of night-time noise. The walls are pretty thin. Eventhough the location of our room was supposedly one of the more quiet sections, there was much traffic and weekend-partying noise until 2am. Of course, this isn't solely the hotel's fault, but rather the nature of their location - 1 block away from the night-life hub of Hollywood and Highland. On the plus side for the location: a) the hotel is a 4 minute walk from Grauman's Chinese theater b) we took the metro to Universal Studios, which was another 2 minute walk from the Chinese theater Here's an example of the good service: One of the female staff asked me if I slept well when I went to get breakfast and I complained about the noise. She purchased some ear plugs for us, and the plugs did help somewhat. In general, the staff is pretty attentive and helpful.

We paid over $1000 for three nights' stay. That included $8 a night parking and over $40 a night in taxes. I had told them on the phone that I was travelling with my mother who can't walk very well, and they said they'd do what they could but when we arrived we were put in the far outside building, up quite a lot of stairs. This required walking across a sloped and often slippery driveway as well as two flights of stairs. When we got to the room, it was huge, which was nice. Two separate bedrooms and an uncomfortable fold out couch in the living room (there were 3 of us), as well as a nice kitchen. But no balcony, no view of the pool, and the street we faced (Franklin) was NOISY - the traffic was horrendous, loud, constant honking and loud stereos until 3 in the morning every night. If you seal the windows and turn on the air conditioning it's tolerable but just barely. There was a musty smell to the room, and none of the remotes worked. Three tvs and not one remote worked. They did come up and fix that when we called down. The furnishings and carpet were serviceable but not as nice as the pictures on the website would lead you to believe. The breakfast was nice - Wolfgang Puck coffee and nice pastries, cereals and some little fruits. The staff is the best part of this hotel - friendly, helpful and very knowledgable. Shawn was the best, and Gretchen was nice too but they were very busy with what seemed to be more important guests than us, and we didn't feel particularly special.

With all the rave reviews of the Magic Castle Hotel, how could we not try it? We arrived there in the evening with high expectations, but we were quickly disappointed. The carpeting in our room had numerous holes like cigarette burns (it turned out that these were dark spots). The next morning we debated about complaining to the management. After some hesitancy, we decided that management should know that our experience was not consistent with the reviews that we had read. After all, we were going to be there for three more nights. We started wondering whether the reviews were written by real guests of the hotel. We addressed the carpet problem with the person at the front desk. She was very understanding and offered to place us in another comparable room. However, this room was near the street, and we did not want to risk the possible noise. So we decided to stay put and thought that was the end of it. As we were enjoying our breakfast at poolside, we were approached by the general manager. He apologized and offered us further assistance. He indicated that another room was opening up that morning. A little later that morning he gave us the key for this newly vacated room. Were we surprised! The room was enormous with a full kitchen, dining area, living room, etc. Besides this free upgrade, he advised us that the first night would be deducted from our bill. With large smiles upon our faces, we promptly moved over our luggage to our new luxury suite. We then went back to the pool for swimming and sunbathing. Upon our return to the suite, we found a beautiful bouquet of flowers from a florest with a note apologizing for the inconvenience from the general manager. This was astonishing! Where do you get such service from a hotel? The remainder of our stay there could not have been better. The location is 2 blocks from Grauman's Theater and other tourist sites, as well as the subway that we took to Olvera St. The pool was refreshing with staff members bringing out popsicles and cool towels.

Never have we encountered a staff like the crew employed by the Magic Castle Hotel. These young people go the extra mile to make your stay in Hollywood memorable. We returned from a month-long vacation of the West Coast having stayed in 22 hotels and the Magic Castle was without a doubt the best experience. I was leery booking a hotel for a week which AAA rated only two diamonds but after reading the reviews by the \"folks\" on Trip Advisor, I decided to ignore the pros. Wise choice. The hotel is in an excellent location for tourist yet quiet. We did not want to rent a car as my husband had already driven 1,200 miles on the first leg of the trip. This hotel is close to all forms of public transportation and sightseeing venues. We arrived three hours before check-in time in hopes of storing our luggage. To our shock, the staff said our room was ready and we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite!!! The suite was immaculate. The staff recommended which tours were worthwhile, what to see on our own and how to get there and advised us what we should NOT do via public transportation. I had wanted to take the transit system to Long Beach to tour the Queen Mary. They were adamant it would not be safe to do so. Only my mother has ever been this concerned for my well-being. The staff even went so far as to call taxi services on my behalf (without my asking) to check rates to Long Beach. They advised public transportation to The Reagan Library in one day was not do-able either....too many stops thus not enough time to tour the Library. The staff booked tours for us, which when we tried to book ourselves, were told there were no openings....hence the name Magic! The heated outdoor pool in the courtyard is open 24/7. They just ask you keep the noise level reasonable after 9pm. The on-site laundry facility is suppose to close at 9pm but when I was doing laundry after that hour, they said \"no problem\". When I inquired as to why AAA only rated the hotel two diamonds, they explained that several factors are considered by AAA in their assessment which they don't tell the reader. 1. There is no bathroom in the lobby. This is silly as all 39 guestrooms are a short walk from the lobby. 2. There is no elevator. Another stupidity as there are only two floors. 3. No restaurant on site. Another no-brainer......there are two very classy restaurants right next door.

Our itinerary included a number of hotels in the $US150-$200 range across the globe and we would have to say that the Magic Castle was by far our best hotel experience. The friendliness of the staff is exceptional and extends way beyond the shallow \"have a nice day\" that often passes for good service in the US. The staff and management appeared genuinely eager to assist in any way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - (well done guys!). The hotel itself is ideally located in the heart of the resurgent Hollywood district and for a tourist has that quintessential \"Hollywood feel\". This was aided by the hotel's apparent appeal to out-of-town creative types who stay there for a day or two to pitch their film scripts - so wireless laptops and movie talk by the pool. The hotel is actually split in two, with the main building down the bottom of the hill and another one up the top. We initially booked a room up the hill and although the LA views are good, these rooms had not been renovated (Jan 2005) and were rundown. Guests are also required to walk up and down the hill for breakfast and any other concierge needs. After a couple of days, we decided to move into the main building and were put in a much nicer, larger and newly renovated room that was surprisingly at a lower price. The Magic Castle is not an international luxury business hotel (and hence lacks some of the trimmings), but is excellent value for those seeking an LA experience at a reasonable price. (Note we have also stayed at the similarly priced LAX Airport Sheraton, which is a good hotel too, but has no atmosphere) Some tips: To avoid disappointment, we suggest that you ask for an upstairs renovated room in the main building that faces the pool and is not on the main road. Guests at the Magic Castle Hotel are given the privilege of being able to visit the Magic Castle club next door to watch some of the top magicians in the world perform in a range of atmospheric theatres in a big Victorian house. Even if you stay for one night at the hotel, definitely take up this offer (and book ahead) as it is a genuinely unique LA experience that is not open to the general public. Visit the Japanese restaurant at the top of the hill (behind the hotel) for either dinner or a late night drink as it has some of the best views in LA.

Darren dropped by during dinner to see if everthing was satisfactory and we said yes, but the next time we stayed at the Hotel we would request a room with a balcony. Within seconds Darren was on his phone to the front desk and secured a balcony suite for our next two nights with them. We know where we will stay the next time we are in the Hollywood area.

The hotel part is small and set around a courtyard, there are lots of steps to navigate if you have heavy luggage or are unsteady on your feet and no elevator (check out the photos posted by another reviewer). The rooms are pretty basic and our bathroom was quite roughly finished, but it was clean and comfortable and had everything you need, including a refrigerator. The table top ironing board was a pain as it collapsed every time any kind of pressure was applied - a regular ironing board would have been much better.

It was quite noisy at night with other guests arriving back late and also there was some traffic noise as our room was right by a side street. Breakfast was OK.

After following the wrong set of stairs with two rollable filled luggages, we finally get to our room. Boy what a nice room it was! The living room had very nice and comfortable couch and chair. They had marble counter tops in the kitchen and in the bathtub! Even had a bathtub/jacuzzi that I had to use as soon as I saw it. Talk about being in heaven!!

We stayed there for 5 nights, and we had no problems. This hotel is definitely one of the better places I've stayed. This was my first trip to Los Angeles. The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, giving us accurate directions to wherever we wanted to go. This building was an old apartment building, and it doesn't have any elevators. There are plenty of stairs to climb, so if you're physically disabled or have problems walking, this may not be the place for you. The rooms, however, are fantastic! If you get a suite (which I thought were reasonably priced), you will get a bedroom, a bathroom, a living room (with couch and coffee table, not to mention the DVD player and television), and a kitchen. The beds were very comfortable, and there are air conditioning units in the rooms. The Magic Castle Hotel has a private garage, which you will receive a key for when you receive your room key. I found this very comforting, as it is a small garage, and no one else has access to it besides the hotel guests. There is a nice pool at the center of the hotel, and also a continental breakfast every morning, which includes pastries, toast, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, milk, and juices. It's not a large breakfast, but it's sufficient to get you through the day. Uphill from the hotel is the Magic Castle Club (you must be 21 to enter). It is located in a Victoria-era house, complete with some secret passageways and a piano-playing ghost. The club is exclusive, and you can only be allowed in by a member of the club or by making reservations at the front desk. I had a very good time going and watching the magic shows there. (There is a $15 cover charge, and you must order food... but the food is good, and the shows are worth it). As for location, the hotel is 2 blocks from Hollywood Blvd... we walked to the Walk of Fame and Grauman's Chinese theater. It is located near an entrance to Hwy 101, Sunset Blvd, and La Brea avenue, which will get you pretty much anywhere you want to go in and around Los Angeles.

For the money you just can't beat it.", "Date": "December 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel! Great Staff!

Employees are great! Always a smile! So courteous and helpful! Didn't get a new room, but my room was great! Had a balcony so I can smoke since its a non smoking hotel. Its nice that my room didnt stink like old smoke. Breakfast was free and great too! Try the scones! All I can say is, if you are looking for a great LA getaway, check this place out!

We stayed at the Hollywood Hills Hotel, great views and very quiet, away from all the hustle and bustle. Housekeeping let the side down though, no toiletries in the apartment when we arrived, not even soap, these were supplied promptly when asked for. We had no coffee pot when we went to make coffee in the morning, and had no plug for the sink to was the dishes that housekeeping never washed. Dont let this stop you going there though, as the location is great and the rooms are clean and have a great view, management were fantastic (have probably fixed housekeepng problems already) the pool is fantastic, can definately recommend this one!!", "Date": "October 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wassenaar, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!! we would certainly stay here again\"\u201d", "Author": "stefanovas", "ReviewID": "UR2702651", "Content": "We spend 8 nights at the \u201cMagic Castle Hotel\u201d. Our room was not overlooking the pool, room 305. We had no trouble with noise from the street. Our room was normal size. The bathroom too. Everything was very clean. We want to say a good word for the great job of the people at the reception: Mike, Nick en Gretchen were always very friendly and helpful (they also booked for us a studio tour). They are really doing a great job over there. The staff were amongst the most helpful and friendly we have ever come across anywhere. A few mins walk to Hollywood Blvd, subway, restaurants etc.. Great breakfast served in the lobby (pastries, coffee and cereals) that you can take to your room or sit and enjoy around the pool. You are given a key to open the electronic gate into the underground garage. You get a coffee pot, fridge, and iron in the room. Internet access in the lobby (10 min. for 2 dollars). It was an excellent hotel, in a super location, and we would certainly stay here again on our next trip to LA.", "Date": "October 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMCH and Hollywood Hills\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2620618", "Content": "Hollywood Hills Hotel & Magic Castle Hotel are run by the same people. Walking distance to Mann's Chinese and Hollywood Blvd. Walk of Fame. Check-in at MCH lobby. Gated parking is $8. The HHH is at the top of the hill, across from Yamashiro Japanese restaurant. MCH at bottom of hill, across from the famous Magic Castle. Great views on top at HHH; there's a big, quiet pool up there too but it needs a new pool floor. MCH pool is much smaller & less private but newer/better maintained. My first room at HHH had a fantastic view but carpet and chairs were worn and stained. I asked to be moved to one of the newly refurbished rooms (improvement going on at both HHH & MCH). The staff was very understanding and immediately moved me to a new suite at the same price. Nice staff here, unlike some other uptight LA places. Continental breakfast served in MC lobby is great, but somewhat incovenient for HHH guests who must walk or drive down the hill. Not enough seating too. If you stay at either HHH or MCH, you get access to the Magic Castle next door, an extremely cool private club of magicians. Plan a night for dinner there-- wander around the club afterwards, it's awesome. Jacket/tie required for men.
