The room is very clean and comfortable. We had the best shower in this hotel throughout our 2week trip around Turkey! Breakfast spread was decent, but make sure you go early before it runs out. What made this hotel stand out was the staff coupled with its new facilities. Staff (especially Suat!) was always very welcoming and charming. Suat even walked us all the way to Hagia Sofia Musuem about 10 mins away so that we could link up with our tour guide. The staff also shared with us practical advise on how to protect ourselves as tourists. Also, we were offered tea everytime they saw us! We would usually spend 10 minutes in the lobby after a long day just catching up and chatting with the friendly staff! The staff was also very responsive. Internet was down for a short while, but was fixed in a jiffy after we informed the reception. The location is great! 10 mins walk to the historic areas in the \"Old City\" or Grand Bazaar. We had to stay in another hotel on the last night of our Istanbul trip as it was arranged by the airlines that rescheduled our flight. However, this other hotel pales in comparison to Cesme Hotel. Cesme's staff exhibited a 5-star service, making it the best hotel we stayed at in Turkey.

What struck us immediately about the hotel upon arrival was its clean, modern design and the hospitality of the staff. Located in the heart of the old city, the Cesme is an ideal place to come back to at the end of a long day of walking around Istanbul and visiting the sights. The hotel is a new construction so the rooms are very comfortable and clean, with great bathrooms. Each room has a mini-bar, where you can keep your own food and snacks, as well as free Internet, personalized climate control, satellite television, and a hot water heater for the coffee and tea, which are complimentary. The breakfast in the morning, served on one of their terraces, is great--breads, cakes, cheese, eggs, meat, cereal, fruit, tomatoes, cucumbers, jams and honey. The hotel also has a rooftop terrace with comfortable lounge furniture and breathtaking views over the old city and onto the Marmara Sea. What we also appreciated at the hotel was its incredibly helpful and welcoming staff. Whether taking us personally to a recommended restaurant or helping us carry purchases to the rooms or offering us tea upon our return each evening, the staff couldn't have been more attentive. If I were to return to Istanbul, I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very good price/quality ratio\u201d", "Author": "alikus", "ReviewID": "UR126038480", "Content": "Located in the very heart of Old City, 5 mins to main attractions, beautiful view over the Bosphorus from the breakfast terrace.

Lovely small streets in the hotel neighbourhood are packed with other small hotels. There are no many cafes and restaurants in the vicinity tough, but you can find some very small shops nearby in case you need something urgently. We had a triple room, which was of a decent size, nicely furnished, equipped with a mini-bar, safe, kettle, cups and coffee and tea-bags. We also got slippers, the towels were changed every morning. The bathroom was brand new and perfectly clean. The TV was tiny, with not so many interesting programmes. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The breakfast is served at a small terrace, which is in winter covered only with nylon sheets (so, no closed windows). The terrace is heated, but if it is very cold outside, windy and rainy, it may be cold and inconvinient to have breakfast without your coat on. The main hotel terrace is on the top of the hotel, above the breakfast area. This terrace has a magnificent view onto the city, it is large and we used to enjoy our coffee up there after the breakfast. The breakfast was OK. They served a variety of dried fruit, fresh apples, oranges and bananas, cheese, olives, only one type of ham (no pork), baked potatoes, meat pie, some corn flakes and butter and jam. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. We had an early flight, and they prepared a room for us for an early check-in. We booked the room for 4 nights, so we qualified for free transport from the airport, which we had prearranged by e-mail before we arrived. On our departure, we tried to arrange the transfer organized by the hotel and the younger receptionist wanted to charge us \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 30 (this was the one mentioned by another reviewer, I believe), whereas another receptionist told us that the price of the transport organized by the hotel was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 25, but he also advised us that it was much cheaper to take usual taxi, what we decided to do after all. But when we started from the hotel on our departure day, he gave us the hotel driver to take us to the airport at the same price as the usual city taxies. I would gladly recommend this hotel to all my friends.

We had booked on internet from NZ and had excellent communication from the hotel prior to our arrival. We did not notice a particular problem with noise, with the windows closed and the air-con on, we were very comfortable and would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, it's so well placed to visit all the main sites of Istanbul. If we wanted to get away, we loved the Terrace rooftop (which is actually one level up from the outside breakfast room mentioned in the previous review) and very much enjoyed the Bosphorous views and the view of the neighbouring mosque from there. The staff at the Cesme were very helpful and organised cars for us to the hotel, and to the cruise ship. We also qualified for a car to the airport by staying three nights.

The breakfast terrace does not overlook beautiful Bosphorous views - it overlooks the rooftops of the neighbours with a gap in between which you can get a glimpse of the sea - if you sit at the right table. The breakfasts are substantial with something for everyone though. We were on the 2nd floor 203 and were deafened with the traffic struggling to get up the hill as the hotel is situated at the bottom of a hill. There is only room for one car to pass so there were a lot of rows on the street. We couldn't open the window because it was possible for someone to get in easily. We endured the noise. The hotel is quite small so be prepared and I found the staff rather indifferent if basically polite.
