We were very disappointed with the location; this resort is nearly an hour from the restaurants in Kuta, and 30 minutes from anything else in Nusa Dua. During traffic hours, these times can increase dramatically.The accommodations are acceptable. The communal pool is quite nice; however, the private pool is nothing more than a wading pool, and there is no view from the resort. Your basic view is the walls surrounding your villa.The living room is not air conditioned; however, the individual bedrooms are. The bedrooms are quite acceptable, and the bathrooms are quite nice. Very clean. As the living room is open-air, be prepared for a litany of mosquitoes and bugs every evening. Make sure you ask for an extra mosquito coil or two for the evenings.Though in existence for quite some time, the staff at the Asri Jewel were quite inexperienced. The spa was empty during our entire stay, making us wonder if the staff there had any spa experience at all. The pool area is mostly unused. The covers stay on the lounge chairs all day. If you are looking for privacy, this would be an acceptable choice; we were there during peak season, and felt that we were virtually the only group there. (There were two other groups of travelers there).Most of the staff do not speak English and had a tough time understanding our requests. We had a broken light in our entryway, and spent a couple of days trying to explain this before giving up. It took us quite some time to explain that we were looking for additional towels. Upon our departure, we had several problems. First, the hotel overcharged us. We had to dig out records of our original deposit receipt to explain to them that we were being overcharged. They remedied the problem by simply changing the invoice value upwards (I believe the invoice difference went to our local travel agent). We probably ended up paying 15% more than we agreed, but since we could not communicate effectively with them, we just gave up and agreed to pay the revised invoice. We were extremely frustrated with the staff, as we were in a hurry to catch a flight.Additionally, once we we agreed to pay the inflated invoice, the credit card machine at the Asri Jewel did not work. The staff asked us to pay in cash (we were talking about nearly $3000 US dollars), and insisted that we accompany them to an ATM machine. We were extremely fed up by that point, so we left them a credit card number and took off. Overall:* Extremely inexperienced staff. The staff do their best to accommodate your needs; however, they are generally very poorly trained and managed. * Remote, distant location. If you are looking to eat anywhere, be prepared to sit in a car for over 30 minutes. It takes 20 minutes just to get down the hill that the villa is located on.* Clean bedrooms and bathrooms.* No view.* Private Pool is just a wading area; much smaller than represented on the website.* No Air-Conditioning in the living room. Living room is open air, so bugs can be a nuisance.Our group will NOT be staying here again and would NOT recommend the Asri Jewel to fellow travelers. We are very experienced travelers, and found the Asri Jewel to be an extremely poor value for the price.", "Date": "Feb 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR683371396", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "euwang"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1219108-d681376-r15208180-Asri_Jewel_Villas_Spa-Ungasan_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "681376", "Price": "$352"}}
