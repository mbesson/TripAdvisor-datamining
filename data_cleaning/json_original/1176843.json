First, the hotel manager Mr. Abdel is very professional and he understand what to do, I had a couple of problems on booking, both mine and colleague's reservations had complicated situation, however Abdel handled well and replied in emails and phones immediately, I appreciate that. Location is good, easy access to many places on foot or by metro. My room was looked new and clean, in overall services were pretty good to me. Although, room is not big, well you are staying in Paris, what can I say !? My colleague complained that his room is noisy by subway running underneath, but in my room didn't hear much, maybe depends on which room you get. Free WI-FI is good as always, but it was very slow, a little frustrated when you staying in business and needed hi speed internet, but most of hotels should be the same. The only thing unacceptable thing for me, it was on Sunday morning, the lady at breakfast dining room was very rude, I don't know what was wrong with her but she was so mean to every customers, food was good as 22 euros but her attitude, it's not free, we customers paying big bucks to have breakfast at there, why can't you make us happy ?? For overall, I'm happy that I chose this hotel. If you know Paris, you know it's hard to find good place to stay in central Paris, you have to compromise few things anyway.

My room was smart and clean: not huge, but reasonable value for central Paris. Like a previous reviewer I found that the shower cubicle leaked water onto the bathroom floor, but the plumbing was otherwise fine. Spoiling what would otherwise have been a positive review was the manager's rudeness: as we were checking out, we were informed that there was a small extra tax, of just under 9 euros, to pay. We gave a 20-euro note and the receptionist went away to get our change, returning with a heap of coins. We said we didn't wish to carry round so many coins and would rather have our change mainly in notes, whereupon the manager came out from his office looking somewhat angry and insisted on having an argument about this. We said we weren't interested in doing so, and would pay the extra by credit card. The manager flounced off after uttering something that (probably fortunately) we couldn't understand. To their credit, his staff seemed embarrassed by his odd behaviour and made polite talk to try to smooth over the problem. A small matter, to be sure, but it tarnished an otherwise positive experience and ensured that we will look for somewhere else next time.

I stayed in Room 202 and while small, it didn't feel claustrophobic. The bathroom had pretty tile and was relatively spacious compared to other Paris hotels. The bed was really soft and comfortable - reminded me a lot of the heavenly beds at a Westin. The hotel is on a fairly busy street so don't sleep with the windows open. It wasn't too noisy to sleep as long as the windows were closed. As with other Paris hotels, it's impossible to get an iron in your room. Apparently there is only one in the whole hotel so you have to ask and hope it's not being used by another guest. The only other complaint is that the free wi-fi was real spotty. I was never able to maintain a strong connection and had to use the lobby computer to do any long sustained internet surfing/email checking. The channels on the hotel TV were all in French - I never could find one with English like CNN International but I spent very little time in my room so it was not a big issue.

The receptionist (obviously a night shifted receptionist who could hardly speak english) told me that he is all by himself and therefore could not find any showergel for me. I then asked for toothbrush as i was expecting they would have this kind of amenties. Again, he said their hotel does not provide any toothbrush at all. Luckily, there is a supermarket just opposite to the hotel and i managed to buy the amenities myself. Forthly, the room is extremely small. At the moment you walk in, the bed is almost right infront of you. The towel provided is of very poor quality. Apart from the above, the room is quite new and the bed is very comfortable.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, recently opened and all new, nice and modern look.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who looks for a modern, clean room in a very nice location.

Recently renovated, really great location and good service. Room size is average for Paris at this level and there were no issues with cleanliness. Service was good and breakfast was very good. The hotel has not star rating yet, and I'd say it is a \"just 4 stars\". Some negagtive issues: - Breakfast room is a tiny crypt in the second basement, very small and not very confortable, but at least properly decored and serving very good breakfast. - Very small room. More like 3 stars than 4 stars. Very well mantained and OK decor, but small. - Towels. The worst fabric quality they could find and with a disgusting smell (like vinager!). We preferred to buy some cheap towels acorss the road and use them. Overall the hotel was OK and given we paid less than 50% their rack rates including breakfast and internet, it was very good value for money. Would not recommend if you have to pay near rack rates (300 Euros and up!).", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Park Lane Paris", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1176843-Reviews-Hotel_Park_Lane_Paris-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$211 - $409*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4 Rue La Boetie</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1176843", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/de/6e/de6e524522b6ce76dc56125b1ad3d03a6large.jpg"}}
