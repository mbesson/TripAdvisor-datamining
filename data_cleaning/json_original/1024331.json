First, our room had never been cleaned for 20 years. The amount of filth on the floor was soo built up that we had to wear shower shoes and turn off the lights so we could not see how nasty it really was. Second, the window was covered in mould as well as the walls, the showers, the floor, the microwave and the tables. These people who run this place are disgusting. Third, the window was broken, the door had fist holes in it, the microwave and all kitchen utensils were unusable becuase no amount of soap could clean them. I felt dirty just being in the hotel. Fourth, the staff was none exsistent, and were completely rude. I have slept outside and felt cleaner then I felt in this place. On the way out we saw the exterminator come to deal with the bug problem. No air conditioning and even if there was I would not use because you might contract TB. I would not let my dog sleep here. Furthermore, I have never written a negative review about any hotel, but this place needs to be condemmend.

We were advised when we first got there that there had been a plumbing leak on one of the floors and we may have to be sent to another place. It was being resolved and we could elect to leave our bags there and come back later or we could wait. We waited as we had just got off a 20 hour flight and were wiped out. Our guaranteed room was to be at the front of the building, with a balcony. We were warned it may be noisy as it faced the road and it was Mardi Gras weekend. Shortly thereafter our room was ready. No indication of wet, or mould, the bed was solid and had triple sheets, which is usually reserved for higher ended places. The area with the fridge, micro,and tv, was tight and, yeah, the tv was small, older, but it worked fine and we had a remote. There was a large queen bed, a bureau and a clothing rack. The furniture was, well, old, cheap and needy. We had a beautiful curved window with a door that opened to a small non-walkable scrolled iron area. There was a desk and a chair pushed against the wall that we moved and added one of the solid nightstands to make a second seat by the balcony area and it worked fine. We dined sorta alfresco. The bathroom was clean, updated, and actually rather nice. There was a amber glass window that was old and in the shape of a quarter circle that opened as a vent. The water in the shower was nice and hot. Complementary toiletries were adequate. Our room was cleaned daily and linens changed. I am 62 and my friend 60. Considering we were there Mardi Gras weekend and we were facing Macleay just one story up, we did not have a problem with noise. Nothing woke us up and the hotel seemed unusually quiet. The receptionist had warned us and originally even tried to recommend we take another room because of the potential noise, but we were glad we didn't, especially after reading the words of another person staying there during our time. We were also told by the receptionist who was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay that the hotel had recently been purchased and was in the process of being updated. They were under certain restrictions and it is in a historical area in a historically protected building and it was taking some time and red tape. This was later confimed when I found sticking out of a stall in the hallway inthe reception area a public notice to that effect that looks to have been attached to the building at one point. She had also mentioned that the hotel was understaffed and looking for help. We did take a few pictures of the inside and will try to add them later. We were in Australia in both Melbourne and Sydney and stayed in different hotels during our 2+ week stay. This was not the best and not the worst either.

Admittedly we picked the wrong weekend (Mardi Gra), which we didnt know was on until after we arrived. I did wonder why there was not much in the way of accomdation, and why all the prices were ramped up, but the airfares were cheap, so I thought it was a good deal at the time. The room was disgusting. There was mould all through the bathroom. The toilet was jammed between the shower and a wall, not great for hygine. The room had 2 double beds jammed in it, so 2 people had to sit on the beds, so the 3rd could walk round the room. There was a 20+ yo TV with most of the buttons missing and no remote. The aerial socket was broken, and you kicked the cable out everytime you went into the bathroom. The TV was sitting on a very old wooden table, with a 4 set dinnerset & cutlery, jug and tea/coffee just sitting on it. There was a very old small bar style fridge in another corner, that had leaked before we arrived, it took 2 days to dry the carpet (we actually left before it dried). I think Noah used the microwave to heat up food for the baby animals. The beds were very saggy, no mattress protector (too scared to look under the sheet), the sheets though clean (again, too scared to look too close) were well worn. The TV power cable and extension cords also ran across the room, including the door to the bathroom. There was a fan on top of the ancient TV, plus the extra one that had been supplied, but all they could do was move the hot air round. The room was smelly.
