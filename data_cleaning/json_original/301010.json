From there you can walk easily to may exciting places without the need of taking a taxi all the time. On the other side the close location to the nightclubs come with some light bass sounds in the night until 3 AM, but it was not too load, so we could sleep without problems. The room was spacious with 28sqm (although that is only the standard room) and from the 19th floor we had a fantastic view over Marina Bay Sands and could even see the sea and the container ships passing by far away. The Fitness center is more like a small room and not very comfortable , but at least with new gym equipment and a tv flat screen. The pool outside on the roof at 6th floor was not cleaned and prepared to use, maybe because we had some rain the days before. But it looked like its not maintained at all at the time, we stayed there. Only one thing was really annoying: The internet rates per day were 30 (!) $ and that is by far too much. We needed that in our room for business purpose and stayed 6 days, so we had to pay to lot for a service, that is free of charge in other hotels.

Didn't expect much from a mid-level hotel chain so maybe that's why we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Room was small but very functional and seemed like a lot of thought was put into where things are placed so everything was convenient and not obtrusive. Bed was not firm but not too soft which suited me really well (though may not be firm enough for some people) and the pillows were not the flattened-when-you-put-your-head-on-the-pillow kind like in 99% of chain hotels. And the towels were big, thick and fluffy -- the best among the 5 hotels we stayed at in this trip to Hanoi and Singapore! It is conveniently located if one does not mind taking cabs around since the nearest MTR is several minutes walk away, and in the Singapore heat, the distance matters. It is far from Orchard Road so not ideal for those who prefer to be in the middle of the shopping area. But it is right smack in Clarke Quay so perfect for those who like the nightlife. Maybe because we were on the 14th floor so we didn't hear the noise even if we were in the midst of party central Clarke Quay. The rate we got did not include breakfast so I can't comment on that. The only significant negative for me was the internet connection. Wi-fi is not free in the rooms and even in the lobby though there are Macs with internet connection by the elevator lobby that guests can use for free. But one can end up waiting in line to use the Macs, which is what happened to my husband and I when there was a family of 4 each using a Mac, so 4 out of 5 or 6 Macs was used by just one family whose 2 children were just playing games when there were already 4 people waiting in line. The parents were just so inconsiderate and total jerks! Considering there is limited free internet access made available to guests, the hotel should prohibit the Macs from being used to play games. Over-all, I won't hesitate recommending this hotel.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSimply lovely\u201d", "Author": "SatayEater Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR128201985", "Content": "With wife and baby, we only stayed in this hotel for one night, but all was as it should be, and I couldn't ask for more from the staff.

It's one of the few places that could accomodate a family of 4 in one room. Of course these are cheaper places, but it was a family trip and we wanted good hotel memories, not bad, and this Novotel was a good midrange choice for us. Yes, it's a great location, that's one reason we returned for one more night. The room are clean but on the small side, the bathroom are quite modern design with a great shower. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast buffet was just fine. Some great people watching in the neighborhood, particularly on weekend nights. I thought it was interesting that most of the stores in the mall below the hotel are Japanese, including the grocery story, so we enjoyed some good okonomiyaki, which is hard to find at Japanese restaurants outside of Japan.

Our smallest child slept for a while on a very small sofa seat ledge thing, and then joined us in the big bed. As such fine for a short stay but not really comfortable for a family for a longer stay; but to be fair you're only paying for one room, so it's decent value. The room was big with a nice view of the park over the road, and a luxurious marble bathroom with separate shower and bath.

Clarke Quay is night club central on the weekends and certain weeknights. I mean all the young kids from Singapore come here to party and get crazy.

Location: An excellent location in Clarke Quay and an easy walking distance (7-10mins) from Clarke Quay Metro station. The metro is super easy to use, making it easy to get to other parts of Singapore. The hotel is located above a shopping centre which also has a food court (asian options) as well as Subway and McDonalds. 7-11 is also nearby. Service: Disappointing and very average from the reception staff. Concierge tried to be helpful but at times their information was not always accurate. Food and Bev staff was average. Value for money: At ~\u00a3140 per night for a twin bed superior room, I felt this was OK vale, esp given the time of year.

I am a creature of habit and would usually like to stay in the same place each time if I found it good, such as the Traders in KL. However in Singapore I have always had 'hotel issues'. The conclusion I have come to, is Singapore is not really set up for families; which is strange given the high volume of family orientated activities the city has to offer. We chose Novotel this time due to its reasonable price, and that it offers accomodation FOC for children under 16 years of age. The catch we found, is they may offer inclusive accomodation, but they don't supply a bed for them! Upon check in, even though we had specified two adults and one child aged thirteen (with a printed document), they said they had no available rollaways for the thirteen year old, with the excuse it was Chinese New Year. Interestingly, when I had casually asked the porter earlier if he was busy, his answer was the hotel is 'always busy Sir, but occupancy is low becasue people go home to their families'. This was not the story from reception. After reluctanly taking at face value we woud be given a room with two queen beds, we found the beds were even smaller than double beds. After returning to reception to advise we just could not sleep two adults and one thriteen year old in two large singles, I was again told they were queen sized. After a few phone calls I was approached by the night manager and told that they now had a rollaway (apparantly someone had just checked out - although strange someone had check out at 8:30pm). The manager also confirmed the hotel does not have any rooms with queen sized beds. We went to get some food at the conveniently located resturants in Clarke Quay, and upon return, the rollaway was still not provided. A call to housekeeping, and another call to reception, the rollaway was supplied a little later. The remainder of the stay was thankfully without fuss. Expect until the third day when the thriteen year old develped little bites all over. We could not confirm exactlymwhat they were, but developed new ones the next night. We suspected bed bugs as they were not mosquito bite sized. Rooms were decorated nicely with a very modern feel, a good bedside console to operate all electrical items such as lights, TV and Aircon. There was a little mould in the bathroom and carpets looked aged. Forget the breakfast in the resturant, even at SDG$25++ with children free, better food can be sourced at the food court under the hotel, or even McDonalds if you are not keen on local food. The local food was very cheap, and more appealing. Staff in the resurant at breakfast were unresponsive and appeared bored with soing their jobs. Service was not forthcoming unless asked for, and even then, came with more of a grimmace than a smile. Having said this, the Novotel was the most reasonably priced found in Singapore for the star rating. Singapore hotels are always pricey, and difficult to find hotels to accomodate children without purchasing an additional room (which is what we were 'offered'). As with most hotels in Singapore, internet is very expensive, and the 'package' offered rediculous. Better off getting a prepaid SIM card and getting 1GB for SDG$7 which lasts seven days. The location great for nightlife, and MRT very close, made it easy to get anywhere in Singapore. I still haven't found a hotel in Singapore which I would return to, and maybe I won't, but suggest hotel staff are sent to Malaysia for hospitality training, as the Malays do it much better.

Look, when I arrived last time I was an idiot and left my bumbag in the taxi, with my passport etc in it. It wasn't until I got upstairs to reception that I realised what had happened. No worries, ?Mohammed the evening concierge/manager told me they would rewind the security tapes, get the taxi's registration number, phone the company, speak to the driver and get my bag back. They did and I did! Excellent. The thing about Singapore hotels is they are expensive by anyone's standards, and what you may pay for 5 star + in some parts of the world is barely 1 star in Singapore. It's expensive so take it on the chin. The Novotel is expensive, but not as expensive as many and to be honest the rooms are as big as any you will find in Singapore, and everything, although not 100%, lined with gold, staff on your beck and call, is a hotel which in my opinion does the job and what it says. I have never had a bad stay yet. Yes, I get annoyed with Singapore ++ rates, no free internet (but note the free computers in the lobby), and stupid drink and food prices, but I have learned to work around that and I come back to a comfortable room, nice bed, everything works, and of course the location is fantastic.

Yes, the location is good; and the beds are very comfortable. However, there were 2 major areas of extreme disappointment. One was the lack of hot water in the bathroom, despite running the shower (not environmentally-friendly, so why recycle your towels) for extended periods of time. We reluctantly complained, and John Chetty did everything that he could to get this fixed on multiple attempts. We fear that room 2312 has gremlins in it and would advise anyone who is given this room to ask for another immediately. The problems with lack of hot water seems to be a common theme in other reviews we have since read on Tripadvisor. The other major area of discontent was the renovations underway, and the way that this was not managed as promised in writing to guests by Simon Jones, the Resident Manager. We were provided with information that \u00efntermittent noise disturbance and reverberations\"might be experienced, between 9:30am and 6:30pm. The noise was much more than intermittent and it extended way past this time. One evening it took an hour of our time to insist to that the workmen leave the building when it was still noisy at 9pm. Having travelled for 22 hours the previous day, we resented having to give up our valuable time to get some resolution to the noise issue. The offer of a late checkout does not really restore our faith in the Novotel Clarke Quay, nor in Novotel generally. Unfortunately, we left with the impression that the Hotel was content with playing catch-up only if people complained, rather than building quality in from the beginning. Hot water and a good night's sleep are basic expectations of a hotel guest, and this hotel did not meet our needs on this occasion. The good location, the good staff, the large rooms did not make up for these shortcomings.

Housekeeping was efficient and left thoughtful touches like extra water bottles and toiletries. Our spacious, upgraded room featured sweeping views of the riverfront and Singapore's skyline, and had excellent amenties and, like everything else in the city, was spotlessly clean. Despite its proximity to Clarke Quay, where the bars and clubs are open until 5:00 AM, noise was never a problem due to the excellent soundproofing. Other facilities at the Novotel were top-notch. A second set of elevators lead directly from the lobby to the mall below, so you can shop and get a bite to eat at the excellent food court without ever having to leave the building. The breakfast buffet was of very high quality, with varied choices that we never tired of eating here for 6 days straight. The restaurant overlooked a superb rooftop outdoor pool filled with lush tropical foliage and featured panoramic city views and lots of spacious lounging area.

After calling maintenance (who turned up very promptly) we were shown that the way to switch the TV to the DVD input was by putting your hand down the left handside of the TV , finding the 3rd button down and pressing it until the appropriate TV input was discovered. Also the spa/jacuzzi in the bathroom didnt work until an unmarked lightswitch in the bedroom was turned on. Simple user guide fixes this and saves the mntce man a trip in the lift !! NOT so good was the fact that the hotel is being refurbished ..... the noise didnt help with trying to recover from the longhaul flight... this was a minor inconvenience compared to the smell of the paint which seemed able to permiate all throught the upper floor .... and with the windows being locked it was hard to get the smell out. A packet of nurofen was required to manage the resulting headaches over the stay. So if they werent refurbishing the hotel I would definately recommend it ...... but before I book a premium suite again I will be checking whether the painter man is going to be around or not - - because if he is then it is holiday ruined. cheers", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cVery specious!\u201d", "Author": "misoTokyo", "ReviewID": "UR122954722", "Content": "Pretty close to Orchard.

I noticed that there has been a lot of complains in February 2011 but I understood that the hotel was in the middle of renovations at the same time. So be it and we booked for 6 nights an executive room for me and my family (two children 6 and 3 years old). I am member of the A-Club and asked through them to have the exceptional authorization of an early (11:30 instead 14:00) checking in as we were landing in Singapore after a night in the plane, at 10:30 in the morning. I received a commercial answer saying that Novotel policy was a booking at 14:00 and if I wish to be sure to have a room I need to book (and pay) the night before. When we arrived at exactly 11:30 at the reception, the argument was the same:... Policy of the hotel is check in 14:00 and not 11:30. The room is not ready... Eventually at 12:00 reception proposed us to take a twin bed room instead the king bed that we requested. We refused because it would have been very difficult to accomodate two children and two adults in two single beds. The young intern that was communicating with me has been exceptionally friendly and polite but policy is policy even if two children are sleeping on the coach of the lobby with two luggages and several bags all around. Not even a cup of coffee was proposed. Customers were passing around us laughing to see the kids sleeping on the coach. At exactly 14:00 the young intern came to us and said that the room were ready. I cannot believe that people that were cleaning the room finished their work exactly at the time mentioned by the policy. I believe this has been deliberately obliged by the management. Several employees tried to interfere and were blaming the young intern. I totally refused to speak with another person as he has been obviously doing his best and was looking very embarrassed by this situation. We travel very often and I tried several hotels in the world including Novotel and other Accor group properties. It never happened to me to face such stubborn and intransigeant attitude. Policy seems the only reference in this hotel but management should remember that customers have the choice and there are certainly around much more friendly places to stay where at least refreshments will be offered.

In the end, I have to request for a change of room after another 20 mins...No initiative to suggest for change of room, not to mentioned to suggest an upgrade....Beside the air-con, TV and the DVD player's remote was not working well either. The new room allocated to me was as bad as the first one. The fridge was not cold and the edge of the toilet sink had brown stain. I informed the front desk about the stain and they said they will send someone up to clean it. When I came back in the evening, the stain was still there. I have to clean it myself. The bed is noisy when I sleep on it as I can hear and feel the springs. I have just enough to ask to change another room.

I was extremely upset as we were already shown to a seat, and I had already pick up a plate and was about to take a sandwich before another staff told us that we cannot be there because of my baby (I was carrying a sleeping baby in my sling) . I was made to feel embarrass in front of other guests. I felt that the situation could have been avoided if we were told about this during our check-in which I would then not have paid extra for the club access since it is not family friendly. It had not been a pleasant holiday experience for me. I would not stay there again with my family. But to be fair to the hotel, it has a great location being beside Liang Court (shopping centre) and right in the middle of clarke quay. The hotel is generally clean and well kept. There is also a nice spread of breakfast food.

Stayed in a Premier Suite 25th Floor, for 9 nights from 21/10/11 till 30/10/11. We checked in on the Premier Lounge floor, this time around the staff were much pleasant and helpful compared to the last time. The room has improved especially the bathroom and the bed is very comfy, also had a Nespresso Machine and new furniture. The housekeeping guy was probably one of the nicest guys there!. Breakfast on the Premier Floor wasn't too flash, every morning was the same thing so we didn't bother after the 4th day. We did not head down to the pool as it still look dingy plus too many little kids around running around and diving into the pool (FYI pool shared with Somerset) so it does get packed. The room we stayed in was over looking Robertson Quay (Park Hotel Clarke Quay). We did get room service twice, the food was good but a bit on the pricey side. After our second stay here and giving it a second chance, I have to say it's not so bad especially being close to Clarke Quay, a quick walk to Orchard Rd and Chinatown. Still room for improvement. FYI - Starbucks, Money Changer, 7/11, McDonalds, Mediya (for your food shopping) and Food Court in Liang Court, all this below the hotel. The food court is very cheap and great food available. Across the road, theres Burger King Bar and lots of bars and restaurants also to checkout Central Shopping Centre.

Each time I've had to change rooms at least twice. Like I said, the only thing this place has going for it is the location..and if I'm not paying for it, then I have to bite the bullet. The food in the hotel is not good either. The main restaurant is buffet only, so you are stuck with paying a high price (plus plus plus) or dealing with room service if you want to eat in the hotel. I ordered a room service grilled cheese and ham sandwich and got a stale ciabatta with a slice of ham and a cheese slice on it..not even grilled, all for the great price of S$20+++ The silver lining behind this cloud is the great food court downstairs in Liang Court..for less than S$10 you can have a really good meal compared with 3 times the price for a less than mediocre meal in the hotel. The in-room TV channels also have issues..often they suffer from bad reception and sometimes they drop out completely saying \"signal lost\"...some of the room s have TV's smaller than the monitors you use for your PC. Internet access in the rooms is also expensive, S$30 per day and not all websites work. Why do we have to put up with this crap? The hotel has positioned itself as a trendy young place to stay in..with the FOH staff reflecting this position. This creates situations where the FOH staff are arrogant, non-responsive and downright rude to guests sometimes. Coupled with the thick singaporean accent that the staff has, it can be extremely hard to speak to and get your point across to them. one point I made last time i was there, the advertisements for the buffet breakfast show a really nice looking smoked salmon eggs bendict...i made the point of asking the eggs chef for an eggs benedict and was replied to with \"what's an eggs benedict?\"..eventually the head waiter sorted it out. all told, this hotel promises the world, but delivers very little quality...for the price they charge they should be 500% better...

Beds are comfortable with a range of pillows to suite individual comfort. Access to the Premiere lounge on the 24th floor where you can enjoy a wide range of appetizers, wines, beers and spirits. The view from here has breathtaking views of the Marina Bay, Marina Sands with laser shows in the evening is very relaxing and a pleasure to watch while having your evening drinks. The staff in the hotel are polite and helpful, concierge will help you with all your daily needs for getting around Singapore. Breakfast buffet is plentiful and a wide range of continental and asian selections are available. Room order meals are ample size - try the satays they are delicious. Being on the river, Clarke Quay the hotel is situated in very close and within walking distance to the Marina, Merlion, Boat Quay, Chinatown and various shopping complexes. Highly recommend.

Being right at Clarke Quay, and within walking distance to all the other \u2018quay\u2019 spots, made it ideal. The rooms were spotless and spacious (we had a superior, river view room with a perfect view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from the 19th floor), and the towels were large and thick. We didn\u2019t pay for an inclusive breakfast deal, so only had the buffet breakfast one day (it was $31 SGD per person), but it provided a large choice for every possible taste. To be honest, being savoury breakfast people, we did the bargain option of having Subway from the shopping centre downstairs. Some people have complained about the fact that you have to change lifts to get to your rooms \u2013 one set of lifts from street level to the reception on the 7th floor, and then another set for the rooms \u2013 but this is not really an inconvenience, and it is there for security. This hotel\u2019s facilities are used for business, and they don\u2019t want non-guests having access to other floors, or even taking up spaces in the lifts designated for that purpose. Quite sensible, actually. The mac centre in reception (which provides about 6 very new macs and free internet access for guests) is very handy. It made checking emails and printing boarding passes a breeze. The pool area was very nice, but stipulating that guests cannot bring food or drinks from outside the pool area is a little restrictive. Not everyone wanted what was offered on the menu. The Chinese restaurant on the 6th floor was lovely, and had excellent dim sum discounts for lunch, as well as a la carte choices. One slightly negative point would be that sometimes staff were misinformed, and passed that misinformation on to us. For example, at 1:45pm I asked reception if the Chinese restaurant was open still for lunch, and was told no, so we nearly went elsewhere. We decided to swing past there on our way out, and found they take their last lunch orders at 2:30pm. Also, the concierge told us that we did not need to make a reservation to have breakfast with the orang-utans at Singapore Zoo, but when we arrived, we found we should\u2019ve. These are small details, but they do, on occasion, make a difference. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again for the value for money and location \u2013 afterall, not all of us can afford to stay at Raffles or The Fullerton.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Pandie", "ReviewID": "UR118715453", "Content": "We have stayed at the Novotel several times and have always found the service to be at a good level.

My sister was with me and we have actually made a booking for another hotel from booking.com which we did not like at all. We checked out after one night and moved to Novotel. The front desk staff, Ming, could understand from our expressions that we had a bad experience and promised to give us the best room he could and we were very happy after seeing our room looking at Marina Bay Sands. After that we knew that we could approach him and all his colleaugues for our concerns. My 2nd stay was a stopover with my husband after our Phuket trip for our 7th anniversary. We made our booking for a superior room but were upgraded to an executive room. When we arrived our room we already had a bottle of complimentary wine which we really appreciated the quick service. The rooms were clean on both of our stays, we enjoyed the pool area a lot, but the best part was the staff's attitude to the guests. On our return day I realised that I lost my immigration card and Ratis from front desk was so kind to call airport for us and as it was late afternoon we could not reach anyone at all. He was still asking us what else he could do for us. He even called one of his colleagues from guest relations to check if he had any idea what could be done. He was so calm and patience within this period that me and my husband knew we could not thank him enough. One more positive thing about the hotel that they have 4-5 Apple PCs next to the front desk for free which is very good as most Singapore hotels don't have free internet or Wi-fi.

Obviously the location is great, that's the biggest selling point of this hotel. On the to negatives though, their \"check in desk\" is on the 7th floor, not on the ground floor, so the sense of arrival is not so great, and actually a bit confusing. I stayed on the \"club/lounge\" floor or whatever they call it. It was ok, bed was fine, AC was extra cold, the ceiling feels a bit low, the bathroom was ok, the shower water was hot enough and had ample water pressure. The shower was a bit too small for me though, it's like showering in a box. And there is no where to put your shampoo, conditioner, soap etc. They just have a tiny soap tray in the shower - it sucks. Anyway, if that were the only comments I had about the hotel, I would say I had a good enough time there - not great, but satisfactory. Apparently, with my room, without me knowing, they booked me an airport transfer to and from the airport. When I left the airport, I looked around to see if someone was standing there from Novotel waiting for (sometimes hotels provide free hotel pickup... so I thought it would look, even though I don't recall hearing about a pickup (free or not)). No one was there from Novotel waiting for me. So, of course, I get my own taxi to the hotel. As I arrive at the hotel and check in, they tell me about the driver waiting for me at the airport. I tell them, I wasn't aware of anything being arranged, so I took a taxi. They told me they would sort it out later, ok, fine. As the front office clerk is showing me around my room, the phone in my room rings, I don't pick it up because I'm still putting my bags down. 3 minutes later the phone rings again, it's concierge telling me that there was a car waiting for me at the airport for 1 hour. I explain again! the situation, he says \"Well, I'll look into it.\" Not exactly friendly, they're already assuming I'm guilty or lying. I get a letter the next day from the hotel saying that they called my secretary and that an airport pickup and drop off was indeed listed on the booking confirmation and if I wanted to cancel this mysteriously added / unrequested airport pickup, I would have to call them one week in advance of checking in. And so, because I didn't, I would have to pay $70.09 as the cancellation fee! Who charges $70.09? Why not just make it $70? Where do they come up with these numbers? As I check out, I see a charge for both airport pickup and drop off $70.09 each way, I explain: A) I was unaware of the pickup - if I was, I would have used it B) There was no one waiting for me with a sign at the airport! C) $70.09 was a bit excessive for a cancellation charge. The lady at the front desk says she'll call the manager. Ok, fine. 10 minutes later a guy comes, with what looks like poppy seeds in his teeth and sharp pointy fang like teeth, to explain the same thing to me. I explain my reasoning again. Another 15 minutes wasted - I need to get to the airport. Then he says he'll have to call the sales manager. I wait another 15 minutes and I ask the front desk lady, \"I thought you were calling \"the manager\", this guy is now calling \"the manager\" \". The whole idea of \"calling the manager\" is that this person is able to solve all problems, whether it is a definite yes or no or we'll reduce the fee etc - not to have to call down a team of \"managers\" to solve a small problem. So, as time was ticking away I was running out of time to make it to the airport and the other \"manager\" still hadn't arrived. It became clear to me that they were not going to help me with this and instead have me arguing with a circle of people from the hotel. I wasn't interested in doing that and I really needed to go to the airport. So, I just paid it all and left. Bad first impression of the hotel and bad last impression of the hotel.

The front desk ensured a speedy check in, the Manager goes the extra mile to ensure gr8 client service and the chef at breakfast makes a mean chilli omelete.

This was a modern hotel with a lot of comforts run by a fantastic group of family staff no matter what time of day/night it was. I chose this hotel for the brand reputation and also for its location...Clarke Quay...which is situated near all the waterfront hotels and restaurant. Below are my pros and cons. Pros: The hotel is close to everything! Restaurants, nightlife, shopping complexes (in fact the hotel sits on top of a small shopping complex) and there is public transport easily accessible. We caught the taxi with ease every day. Although it was close to everything it was also not in a place where it seemed very busy and noisy which was a bonus. The rooms were very modern, clean and spacious. I actually wish I had a slightly smaller room since I was staying in one by myself. The minibar was well stacked, some of the beverages were a little too expensive so I bought my own drinks and kept it in the fridge. The breakfast every morning was a treat! It was all buffet (didnt really want room service, but if I wanted to it was available 24/7!), they had all forms of eggs, breads, meats, cereals, fresh fruit, curries, noodles....First morning there we ate so much we didnt even have lunch! The staff were very attentive and polite, serving us coffee. There were also a restaurant and bars which we didnt get the chance to try, but looked very nice! Cons: The late check in was the only time we had a staff member seem really...uninterested...but when you consider that we were checking in at 3am, I too would be tired and wanting my shift to finish. Getting to the actual hotel lobby itself was a bit confusing, it was located on the 7th floor and if there were no staff at the building lobby we would of been lost, its only a minor issue but since there were always staff available its also nothing major. Bathroom was large, but when you turned the shower on, remember to close the glass door otherwise water will flood the bathroom and also the toilet is positioned in an awkward way so when you sit on it and have to lean forward your head hits the shower glass.

It provides an open space feel, not like hotels located amidst multi highrise buildings of the CBD. We had stayed at this hotel in 2005 and wanted to go back because of it's position. The river area is fantastic, particularly at night with many eating and drinking places, boat rides up and down the river and of course some shopping centres. Also located close to Chinatown and the MRT train system. We stayed this time for nine nights in an Executive room which was very large with a big two shower bathroom, and accomodated our granddaughter with a rollout bed and there was still plenty of room. I think most rooms if not all have a small balcony which is great for taking in the wonderful views of Singapore, but not necessarily for sitting. Breakfast was included, most plentiful and of excellent quality and choice. The hotel entry at road level is the concierge and luggage, then you go up lifts to the seventh floor for reception. From there you enter lifts to your rooms, which require your room key cards to operate for security. I have read some reveiwers complaining that this is an inconvenient way of getting to your rooms, however I consider this more private and not a problem. The hotel has been around a while but the rooms and pool area have been renovated. The pool area is okay with plenty of space, lounges and cabanas, but is not your typical \"lagoon type\" pool, but it is very servicable when you want to cool down. Our granddaughter enjoyed it and we relaxed there on a few occasions. The staff are very pleasant and helpful, and in particular Mr John Chetty assisted my wife to find a doctor when she developed a medical problem ( nothing to do with the hotel or Singapore). We did have a minor issue with the room service ( nothing serious) and was pleasantly surprised to find when we arrived home, I got an email from the general manager Mr Kevin Bossino asking for my phone number so he could ring and talk to me about the problem, which he did. This to me indicated how much importance they place on ensuring their guests looked after. Singapore is a lovely place to visit and very safe. They do it so well for tourists and there are many things to visit including the Zoo, Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Flyer (Scenic wheel), Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino and Sentosa Island with the new attraction Universal Studios, Sky Tower, Laser Light Show, The Luge.

I'm staying here right now, in room 2106. i arrived last night at 2:00 a.m. (7/24/11) -- late due to equipment problems with our jet in Beijing. Check-in lady was very friendly. Went to room. Room was a complete disappointment. If you're from the U.S. and have ever had the misfortune of staying in a Microtel, the rooms are modular like a Microtel....i'd say to accurately describe it would be a cross between a Microtel room and a Marriott Courtyard room. The rooms are tiny too. I'd say about 200 square feet. But i was OK. It's just for a week of business. Plus, the view is terrific and you have a balcony that they will open for you. i'd never have stayed here if I had purchased the room myself, however. Not for $200 USD/night. There are MUCH better options in Singapore for quality vs. price point. Then morning hit. At 8:00 a.m. it sounded like people slamming palettes of heavy boards (coming from the center of the tower where the staff moves around in service elevators. Every 20 minutes it sounds like they just dropped another palette of heavy items somewhere about 30 feet from my room. Turns out it is the door slamming in the service area, behind laundry carts that are coming up. Crazy loud. Went down for breakfast. Another mistake. The buffet is dreadful for a \"4 star\" hotel (but this hotel is truly more of 3- 3.5 star variety). It's free with my rate but it's so bad that i won't return. i'd rather pay for breakfast elsewhere...it really is that dreadful. Food is horrendous. The last straw: i had laundry that I needed clean before work on Tuesday. I called downstairs and they sent a gentleman from housekeeping. As i passed him the bag he looked over his shoulder and into my room and he said, \"when will you have your room cleaned? We can't clean your room until you clean up your room.\" I had 2 pieces of luggage with shoes, some socks, and a robe on the floor. I had just arrived late last night and had not had a chance to organize yet. The nerve. i'm not a 21 year old. i'm a 39 year old man who travels 40 weeks/year for my work. i'm well aware how to organize before housekeeping arrives. i do not appreciate being condescended to. You're also in a very heavy weekend party area for 20 somethings. They mob the 7-11 and McDonald's downstairs by the entrance and there are restaurants/discos with patios right beside the hotel. It gets very loud on weekend nights until about 3:00 a.m. If you're into that, then stay here cuz the location is unmatched for partying at Clarke Quay. But if you're not into it, remind yourself that many of those early 20 something people will be at the hotel, to take advantage of the location, and will be carousing through the hallways late at night as well, normally drunk and screaming. I can count on one hand the number of people i saw who were sober when I arrived last night. Last night felt like a weekend peek into my fraternity house, back in college. Unless the manager can move me to a room away from the housekeeping door, i'm leaving tomorrow. I'm hoping that the partiers are leaving today. Even though our training is inside the hotel, i'll walk to work from another location! i'll end this with Pros & Cons: Pros: 1. Front desk is nice. 2. Concierge gentleman was very helpful this morning. 3. View from balcony is very very nice. 4. Mattress very comfortable. 5. Location if you're in your early 20's Cons: 1.

It was just a hotel room, very clean and roomy enough for us (Two adults and two teenage children).Our room was high and over looked Fort Canning park so we had no noise from the clubs, I can imagine noise could be an issue so ask for a room away from the noise. Pool was huge, clean and had plenty of sun beds, the position can't be beaten and that is what we wanted, a hotel in a great position where we could all be together and didn't have to pay a fortune. I did get the room on a special deal, with breakfast and internet $263 SGD a night for four of us, over New Years Eve. Our room was ready when we arrived, but like so many past reviews we had to ask a few times (and make a bit of noise) for the roll away bed, we had to ask a few times for the balcony door to be unlocked. Actually we had to ask a few times for anything we wanted. It was all good though as each request was met in the end and it didn't affect our stay here. We absolutely loved Singapore and didn't stop the whole time we were here. Little India, Suntec Computer complex, Duck Boat tour (pre book), Singapore flyer, Marina Bay Sands (amazing want to come back and stay here), Haw Par Villa (Google it, amazing place it\u2019s bizarre!!), China town( could spend a whole day) and so many other places. Taxi drivers were all so friendly. We got the train out to Haw Par Villa and a taxi back, it was cheaper to get a taxi than the rail system! Mostly we walked and walked, soaking everything up. We will definitely come back to Singapore and if our needs are the same and we got a good price I\u2019d stay at the Novotel again.

On our last day in Singapore they asked at 8am if they could check the minibar, even though check out wasn't until noon.They were very intrusive, I've never struck that before & have stayed in many hotels.

I didnt try the breakfast, a bit to pricey but the mall next door does have a maccas and star bucks as well as a food hall with lots of local food with great prices. Centre of town is only a short bus trip away or a 15 -20 minute stroll around the park..Its a nice walk... If doing a stop over or staying for a few nights I recommend this hotel Only downside is there is no free wifi and access is very pricey, they do have 4 0r 5 pc's in main lobby for use in 20 minute lots", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shenzhen, China", "Title": "\u201c30 SGD FOR INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "powerrose", "ReviewID": "UR107668277", "Content": "Wow. 30 SGD for internet, and not even wireless internet.

There were 7 of us so we needed 3 rooms. We got a deal for Executive Floor room with breakfast and lounge access. Around 250 SGD per night. Not cheap but not bad also. We booked for 3 nights. We had taken the Royal Carribean cruise from singapore and got into SG at about 9 AM and went to the hotel. The hotel location cant be beat if you want to have a good time at Clarke Quay (CQ). It is literally 50 meters from CQ action. The hotel is on top of a mall. The lobby is on 7th floor. We were early and we got our rooms by about 10 AM. That was good. We were first given room 2519. On top floor. The room felt a bit hot. Turned up the aircon but nothing. Finally after half an hour complained and engineering came and fixed something and then it started working fine. Went for a shower and there was no hot water. I mean zero. Complained. They said they wud fix it. Our room faced CQ. The good thing was the view. Entire marina sands and bay view. The bad thing is that on the weekend ur in trouble. Although the windows were pretty sound proof we could hear thumping sound till 4 AM in the morning. So if you are a light sleeper choose the bad view but peaceful opposite side. Next morning went for shower, again no hot water. Complained again. Took my daughter to universal (excellent; get the express pass). Came back in evening and wanted to shower again no hot water. Then I lost my cool. Started pulling up people all over the hotel. Engineering spent half an hour in my room and then said they cant fix it. The manager on duty decided to give me a new room (wonder they they waited for 1 full day to do this). New room was 2001. Supposedly an upgraded executive room. The hot water was working but the aircon was not. At this point I really lost it. Called the 2 managers and was pretty annoyed with them. Airconditioning and hot water is par for the course. How can it not be assured in a 5 star hotel when ur paying 200 usd per night!! The manager asked us to relax at the executive lounge as he wanted to give us another room and wanted to test all to make sure it was working. After half hour he came back and apologized that the room in mind was not fully operational. Finally after an hour he moved us to a suite; 1723. There all was working. The next day the Quality assurance manager met me. He told me that their top floors were brand new and that these rooms were released for sale just a few days before we checked in. My point was that they needed to make sure that all was working fine before they sold the room. Seemed like the manager was genuinely interested in fixing these problems. So that was that. Overall the hotel is great. Food was decent. We ate breakfast and had dinner at the Indian restaurant in the hotel. The rooms are brand new. Only they need to improve their service and response time and also empower people on duty to make decisions. My room shud have been changed the very day I reported a problem as there was a problem with the piping; a problem not to go away quickly. I will surely repeat this hotel once more and give one more chance.

I can related to much of what previous reviewers have said both pro and con. I purchased a package that included breakfast, a \"view\" and free internet. On arrival we were given an upgrade to the 24th. floor. The room was of good size and seemed clean. The view was great, but even on the very top of the hotel the disco music from way below vibrated until the wee hours of the morning. The buffet breakfast was good and the variety extensive. Service in all aspects of the hotel was good for us. We enjoyed the pool that was never busy but never used any other hotel services. The location of the hotel is quite good. It's near a subway station and one can easily walk to China Town and other sights. Taxi's in Singapore are of a reasonable price and are right at the hotel door at moments notice. The hotel is situated directly on top of a large shopping mall complete with McDonalds and Starbucks. There is also a large supermarket in which one can get almost any type of food one could want. If you are homesick there is something from your home country available in this store. The lobby on the 7th. floor is at first a bit odd but it's really no big issue. The elevators were quick so if you do get a high floor the ride is fast. Our biggest gripe was the air conditioning. It was either \"on\" or \"off\". When off the Singapore heat quickly takes over Opening a door offers little relief. When \"on\" it was like a freezer in the room. The temperature adjustment device never worked so we just threw on another blanket. Better cool than hot for sleeping. If you can get a decent rate and can get a room up high that doesn't view the river this isn't a bad choice. There is much to do in the immediate area of the hotel including a wonderful brewery called \"Brewerkz\" directly across the river (great beer). Be prepared to spend lots of money for dining and drinking in Singapore. The signature Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel will set you back $27 U.S. However at a bar on Clarke Quay it was \"only\" $20.

We thought we were booking a 4.5 star modern looking hotel with a central location. We are regular travelers and not regular complainers. After booking two rooms online we were very disappointed in how old the hotel was and when we arrived they informed us they were renovating and sorry for any inconvenience. No discount offered naturally. The first room was in terrible condition, access to only one side of the king sized bed, bathroom very ordinary, old towels etc etc. We complained nicely and they transferred all of us to a floor that had already been renovated, and apart from a nicer bathroom you could hardly tell the difference. No free internet unless you stand in the lobby and share 5 computers with the rest of the hotel. Toilets not cleaned for 3 days until we asked, room not cleaned one day until 3:30 after we called them, lights not working properly and when we asked them to be fixed they left a mess on the floor which we had to call about getting cleaned, and they still did not work. The daily paper only came once in 4 days, the sheets had marks on them, the decor was still old in the \"renovated\" rooms, and you could not have a rest during the day due to the work going on in the hotel.

Seeing that it was a peak season, we experienced none of the earlier review's check-in delays, etc. Our room was ready when we walked in (about 1.30 p.m.) and the view was the best (Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, etc.). We couldn't be happier. Extra bed was set up very quickly and luggage was sent up in less than 5 minutes. The porter came with extra information on what to do during the first couple of days (during which many shops were closed in Singapore). We were upgraded to an Executive Room the next day (don't ask me why), and was given a chance to check the room and then decide whether we were willing to move (or not move). We did move. Although the second room had practically no view, it was larger and travelling with kids, more space is always a good thing. Ratthish at the front office (I hope I spelled his name right) was very helpful during check-in and check out (and all the paperworks in between), making everything smooth as silk. Vinny at Reservations was also very good at making sure that all my requirements are met. The construction work were 3 floors at a time, and each group of floors took 2 weeks. We were not bothered by this because a. The first few days they weren't working and b. We were out most of the day. On our last day, however, we were in our room at about 11-1 p.m. and the room reverberated with all the impacts of the renovation. My brother in law (who stayed longer) was moved to a much higher floor due to this renovation. The mall in the hotel complex had everything we needed and more. There was a food court with the local foods, Subway, McDonalds, Starbucks, 7-11, a pharmacy, a bookstore, a supermarket and lots of restaurants. If you are a fan of all things Japanese, then this place is perfect. Owned by a Japanese, it had many Japanese tennants selling Japanese products that you wouldn't normally find elsewhere (recently been to Japan to know this). All in all, service was very good (top to bottom). They could do with a little more care in checking the amenities in room (1st room: no toothbrush but had everything including body scrubs, 2nd room: lots of toothbrushes, soap, shampoo and bath gel, but no showercaps, etc.). We had a very smooth stay and would come back and stay there again without a second thought (especially with the renovation done). FYI: A superior room has enough space for 2 adults and 2 children under 11 as long as you don't mind sleeping in a bed with a child each (their twin bed is 120x200). An executive room gives you an extra sofabed (and space).", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, but too noisy.\u201d", "Author": "coconutti", "ReviewID": "UR96223456", "Content": "This is an older Hotel which is currently under refurbishment.

The lift doors sometimes wouldn't close when they should and there was o e lift that kept randomly stopping at the 13th floor. Another downside of being sooo close to the nightlife is that the staff have to put up signs on the front doors directing the drunkens to use the toilets at McDonalds, the outside is trashed by midnight on a Friday night.

It was not a happy stay. The rooms are a bit tired and slightly weary looking, though clean and mostly comfortable. The first problem was that the air conditioning didn't work properly (I see someone else has reported the same problem). The room was really, really cold, despite turning the thermostat up to 28c. After reporting the problem, we were told it had been fixed, but it was still the same. I reported it again and a technician came. He said that basically the only solution was to turn it off. This resulted in the room being too hot and humid. So we had a choice of very cold or very hot and nothing in between. On our second night, neither of us got any sleep because of noisy music until 5 am from Clarke Quay - a relentless pounding bass and drums. Next morning I asked to be moved to a quieter room. The reception staff were very helpful, but the move was stuffed up twice, firstly by not moving our bags which they said they would, and then by giving us a double bed instead of twin beds, which we had booked. Eventually we got a room which was quieter and had working air conditioning, but it was a frustrating and tiring exercise. Breakfast was included in our stay - it was ok, but VERY crowded - there always seemed to be a series of minor problems - missing glasses, missing cups, missing cutlery, coffee machine not working etc. and if you got up to get a coffee, there was a good chance your table was given to someone else before you sat down. The staff try hard but something is wrong which results in things not quite working. My last comment is that $10 per hour for internet access in your room is over the top in this day and age, when many hotels provide it free - the Novotel does have free terminals for 20 minutes in the reception area and we had some complimentary time in our rooms, but it seems to expire after your first day. A beer by the pool will set you back $14 - I didn't bother. Singapore in general has become very expensive - its not unusual to be charged $12 for a beer. Most main courses in tourist venues are $20+. Its not a cheap destination any more.

Every time we stood at the front counter trying to sort out the issues the hotel had created (at one point they had created bookings for 11 different rooms on totally different dates from the ones we were staying, and tried to charge us for them) other people would comment that they also had been shafted by the administration, or join the queue behind us to register their own complaints. Despite having booked (the previous April) rooms for 4 people, we found ourselves having to argue for (and being charged extra to get) enough beds in the rooms for us all to sleep. During the multiple phone calls we made from Qatar to Singapore to try and sort out the situation, when money would suddenly go missing from our bank account because the hotel had charged us yet again for the same rooms, we were told that it was too difficult for their staff to understand and we would have to call back at another time. Even the maintenance of the rooms was an issue after we had arrived. We would go out for an entire day and come home to find that we had to leave the room so it could be cleaned. On more than one occasion rooms were not cleaned and beds not made up at all. It is a great shame, because the hotel has so much going for it.

Worth requesting this side of hotel but be warned outside music can be just heard until 5.30am! Our sons room on level 16 facing swimming pool, no disturbances. Hotel as described and expected for the novotel chain, clean, functional and just right for Singapore, as mostly out and about, sight seeing and shopping! Taxis available immediately outside hotel main entrance. Have visited Singapore previously and stayed in Holiday inn orchard road, which was a little more stylish, and great for shopping as no taxi required. However, if it's night life on doorstep you are after than novotel is the answer. Don't be put off by the hideous colour of the outside of the hotel, can only assume they don't change it as it is easily recognisable!! Hotel staff very efficient and pleasant, breakfast buffet style was adequate, Plenty of selection, but obviously busy as hotel full for new year celebrations. Small supermarket and larger shopping area just around the corner. Supermarket sold alcohol aswell, so great if you don't want to pay the mini bar prices! Be careful not to be drawn into thinking happy hour is the cheapest beer option! 23 dollars for 3 Hieneken bottles of beer, better going for the pitcher of local Tiger beer! We stayed on the promotional hotel offer for discounted attractions and breakfast. The discounts however, were just between 5 and 10 percent which are also available in the many sightseeing booklets at the voucher section. The free bus tour we picked up from the Singapore flyer, which was on the green line tour, which was ok, but only used the once. We found it easier and quicker to jump in a taxi, as we managed to see the many attractions of Singapore in a shorter time period and a little less tired and hot! Didn't make use of swimming pool area or bar areas, which both seemed small but adequate. Although there were many families with smaller children staying at novotel, I'd say it was more suited to those with older children, if travelling with family. No connections for iPad use in room, only cable connection. Complimentary wi fi connection did work in lounge/ lobby area for ipad despite initially being informed that it didn't work! So worth a try! The other complimentary computer areas were very busy but you can use them for airport check in and print out boarding passes for no charge. Hotel reception is on 7th floor and use of room card to access the other lifts to the hotel rooms is required. We booked x2 superior rooms which I would say would be standard rooms in other hotels. Mattresses differed in each room, didn't cause a problem for us, but if you prefer a softer mattress, worth mentioning at booking in stage! Bathrooms had separate shower enclosures so maybe this was the \"superior\" upgrade?!

The pool on the 7th or 8th floor is open, spacious, and clean - ready for you to dive in! There is free Internet on Mac Machines at the hotel lobby for hotel guest...which is always a bonus. The Central Mall is right across (cross a bridge), the MRT is 5 minutes away, and Boat Quay is very walkable. We even walked up to the Merlion and Esplanade from our hotel. It was an ambitious walk but the weather was on our side and we could do it with our 7year old!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cNovatel Clarke Quay\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR90937185", "Content": "Excellent service, the staff are very persoanble, not stuffy and treat you like a friend.

We were also quite pleasant with our rooms and thinking that we had made a good choice.

We were absolutely certain that this piece of luggage was completely intact. Therefore we raised the issue with the reception and was told that they would investigate and would give us a feedback before our departure on 23/12. The next day we received a \"3 lines letter\" from the \"Assistant Manager\", Ms Marina [--]. The letter simply stated that their \"video record showed that there was no damage done to your suitcase by our staff\". There was no apologies, no explanation whatsoever. When we expressed our frustration her attitude was extremely arrogant and the fact that she asked us to call the police did not help the situation.

We arrived after a 20 hr flight from San Francisco with 2 children, very tired. After the initial niceties at the lobby, we were informed that we would get a room that did not exactly match the one we booked. One less bed. We bent over and said ok. When we went to the room we found that it was 2-beds short. So we called and they apologized saying that there was a miscommunication between reception-desk and the other department. 30 min. since we arrived. I went down to the lobby and they changed our room. I collected my family and moved to the other room. Well, this was 2-beds short as well. Hmmm. I called. Reception desk apologized again. Same reason. Miscommunication between their 2 departments. They said they will fix this problem and that we should just wait in our current room. 50 min since we arrived. I decided I should go down to the lobby again. I had waited for an hour to get the room I had booked. I was less than cordial and it showed. When the lady at the reception desk once more offered to change my room to \"fix\" the problem, I asked to talk to the manager. The manager, who happened to be at the next station all this time, responded that she will help. We had to wait for one of the vacated rooms to be cleaned before we could move in. Changed us to a superior room in the way of an apology for their mess. We soon realized that the superior room was the apology for putting us through this crap. Not much for words, the manager only offered a smug attitude and small talk with the kids. One-and-half hrs after we arrived at the hotel we had a room. This is a 4-star hotel with terrible service.

I can definitely recommend Sentosa Island which is a purpose built island that has several attractions which are worth visiting. It is very easy to get to, as indeed the whole country is due to a brilliant underground system which is cheap, very punctual and clean.

Our view was among the best you could find in Singapore - straight down the river to the Singapore flyer & the new hotel (Marina Bay Sands).

At check in I requested the mini bar be emptied & the balcony door unlocked & both were done within the hour. We didn't try any other restaurants but the breakfast buffet had a good choice & omelettes & waffles made to order. A minor complaint would be the pastries were cold & not as fresh as they could be.

They then needed to go verify if the room was OK for me to go into. Not sure what the heck that was all about, especially since it was only me at reception, but they did say they gave me an upgrade room, even though it had two single beds (reserved a king) but it had a nice view of the city, I'll give them that.

Food was cold, in some cases sparse, then even though I had breakfast included in my rate, I still got double charge one day because they insisted I needed to fill out a bill, which I did, but I knew that would bite me at checkout.

I hit McDonalds and 7-11 after the first two days and bypassed the restaurant, even with supposedly included breakfasts, it wasn't even good enough to be free, except maybe the pineapple juice, that was pretty good! The room was clean for the most part, but the AC unit rattled quite a bit in the middle of the night, but turning it off then on seemed to fix it. The pillows sucked. They were hard or way too spongy, beds actually were OK. But even on an upper floor, I oculd hear the club music from Clarke Quay nightclubs most of the night, which sort of sucked too. Then at check out, I spent nearly another half hour arguing over the breakfast bill. they said I signed for the bill and should pay. I said that the breakfast area insisted I sign because for whatever reason my room number was not on the list. I think we were only talking about 17 Singapore bucks, but they had to dig out all the receipts to try to find the double charge and actually didn't find the receitp while I was there, so they finally removed the charge. Also be aware, if checking out early, the club kids come to the hotel to pick up taxis and this seemed to delay getting a taxi a bit in the morning Plus, it looked like a bunch of couples were heading up to try to get a room for the morning (6:30a by the way) so maybe that's why my room wasn't ready or a king bed wasnt' ready when I checked in at 2:30a as they were handing then out to the nightclub kids wanting a bed to share... Will I return, I probably would only because this is one of the recommended hotels for my company.

Our Singapore stay was at the end of our three week overseas adventure, coming straight off a cruise ship we headed straight to the hotel where we were met in a very efficient and cordial manner; our bags were loaded up and off we went up to the reception area on the 7th floor. Upon our arrival, we were very well looked after by the Supervisor in charge of reception counter who by the way we were received, was aware of our impending arrival and requests that we had made through our travel agent; we were booked in and had our room cards in less than 10 minutes. On arriving at our room, we were met with a well appointed room with everything that we had requested, even down to two portable beds for our children instead of what you would usually get (portable bed and a fold out sofa) - suffice to say, our children were wrapped! We had a view over Fort Canning which was great to wake up to. The bathroom was very clean and well maintained and the daily cleaning of the room was without fault. The pool area was also well maintained and easy to get to without having to go through the lobby. The free internet usage on the 7th floor was a great bonus, huge screens with a super quick ISP; the 20 minute limit is a great idea, especially keeping young teenagers from spending hours looking up face book!! The breakfast (included in our stay) was well appointed, with heaps to eat, especially the HUGE waffles - there was plenty of food with coffee / tea being constantly offered - you would have to be extra picky to fault the breakfast meals served here. Underneath the hotels there are a variety of small shops and a eating hall, money changer etc; there are also plenty of other eating venues around; dare i say, unless you like spending $70+ eating meals along Clarke Quay proper, you will find equally fantastic at a far lesser cost normally at the bottom of the various shopping centres around the immediate area. When it came to our check out, it was quick and painless - less than 5 minutes!

I found some reviews mentioned about changing the elevator in order to go to reception but seriously there's no problem for us at all considering that there are 4 elevators and very very fast. The hotel offers the free internet services at 7th floor where the lobby and restaurant located. We got a nice Executive Room which the room size is spacious. The bed is very comfortable, we added the extra bed for the kid but still have plenty of room for her to run around. The amenities the hotel provide are excellent. Water pressure with both hot & cold worked properly. The breakfast selection are more than enough. The pool area is lovely and good size. All staff are very professional and always smile. Novotel is one of the best hotels in Singapore, located in the heart of Clark Quay, very very convenient for everything and it is worth to pay for especially they provide the breakfast for the children for free when you hardly find that in Singapore as well as the free internet services.

One thing the Novotel do not supply is wash cloths and as I did not bring any I had the inconvenience of having to buy one. Staff were very polite and always greeted you when you passed them. Hotel is right on Clakes Quay and very lively, loads of bars and restaurants. We really liked the Cuban bar as they had a live band every night and we like that Latin sound. We did the normal tourist things, Raffles, China town etc, but I really enjoyed the river boat tour as you get to see a lot of the city from the comfort of the boat. Only downside to Singapore is that it does have fantastic malls, shops, etc but no cheaper than home, so no real bargins to be had. Did like the market etc at China town though. One last thing about the Novotel, we were there for our 25th Wedding anniversay, but nothing special from the hotel, not like the hotel we stayed as next in Thailand, chocolate and fruit, so something like this from Novotel would of been nice.

First, checking in was a total nightmare. I was served by a lady called Lisa at the front desk, no hello and not even a smile from her. The room booked was a premier suite room. While checking she advised us that there will be a $900 dollar bond! I thought that was just ridiculous. I only had $250 singapore dollars on me. She told me that I cant give you your room key until you have paid the bond. I was furious when she said that to me. I said that there was no way I am paying that much of a bond! After a few phone calls to her supervisor in a different language (little did she know that I can understand and speak Malay). I told her in Malay that the hotel has been paid by the travel agent here back in Perth so what is your problem?. Secondly, after been allocated a room (2323) - the room stunk so badly that my partner threw up. The was such a bad sewer smell coming from the air-con system. This just made me even more mad. I went back downstairs I spoke to the Duty Manager at the time Genie, she was very helpful and gladly changed our room to room (2114), this time the room was much better but for the amount that I have paid for this room it was so NOT WORTH IT! Dirty lamp shades, mould in the bathroom, dirt and dust under the TV, old TV in the room and mould around the air-con. Also, having to take two lifts to get to your room is ridiculous. We also had access to the premier floor lounge - free drinks from 6-8pm which was ok it just didn't have much of an atmosphere to the lounge - staff were nice there. Thirdly, after coming back from Clarke Quay during the night Lisa is normally on her shift - I have noticed that she has very bad attitude - she will look at you, whisper and laugh about you to her colleagues. On the 2nd last day of our trip - I spoke to Manager Mr Tan, I explained to him the situation from the start till end and advised me fill in a Survey Feedback form. We normally stay at Park Hotel Clarke Quay - which is so so so much better, because this time there 3 people travelling and Novotel could accommodate 3 people in a room. I advise all you people that are intending to stay here - please choose a different hotel (so many good ones around). I was wiling to give this hotel a chance after reading all the feedback on here and now I know for myself not to step foot here again. The only good thing is it's just footstep away from Clarke Quay.

Teresa, a young talented foreign (Vietnamese) student and part time trainee waitress impressed us with her highly commendable customer service never seen before in my dining experience in Asia \u2013 Teresa is an absolute asset for any service company The buffet and food served here was sensational and their signature dish \u201cChillie Crab\u201d was a favourite and the best I ever had in South East Asia. Their durian pengat was an excellent dessert too and I highly recommend anyone to give it a go. My client and I enjoyed them heaps. Their location on Level 7 was a plus point; a perfect spot for business dealings, quiet, peaceful and cosy, away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore's busy lifestyle & overlooking Singapore skyscrapers \u2013 it seem like a perfect place to dine with a love one too. Hats off to the management and staff for the wonderful experience and the positive results they help me achieved. Chef Michael and Andy along with Jason Yang (Asst Restaurant Manager) were equally great. Chef Michael and Andy came over to our desk to enquire about their signature dish and other meals while Jason was elegant and professional in his approach introducing himself as the Restaurant manager .

We arrived well before check in time and were whisked off to the executive lounge for check in and apologies that our room wasn't ready (even though we were very, very early). We had breakfast and a really good strong coffee and relaxed until our room was ready. It was on a nice high floor with a balcony and wonderful views. We freshened up and there were a few things we wanted done in the room (balcony door opened, batteries in tv remote fixed, that sort of thing) so we asked at the exec lounge on our way out and it was all done when we returned. The staff in the Exec Lounge were happy to help with anything at all, including directions, reservations and making enquiries on our behalf. There is also a balcony in the exec lounge - the balconies are not big enough to sit on but it was nice to stand out there and have a drink and watch the city. It was a tiny bit noisy from Clarke Quay on the Friday & Saturday nights but not enough to keep me awake. We had breakfast at both the club lounge and the restaurant downstairs and both were fine. The pool area was well used but we were always able to arrange a sunbed & umbrella for ourselves (although it is interesting how the pool seems to be shared with the Somerset apartments). For anyone considering staying here in a club room, the hotel seems quite unfussed by dress in the club lounge and most patrons didn't seem to dress up (we saw people straight from the gym having breakfast, and thongs (flip flops) and t-shirts seemed acceptable in the evenings). The location is really handy to walk to Chinatown or the MRT or any of the Clarke Quay establishments, and the 7-11 and shopping centre in the building is useful also, although the multiple lifts to try and exit onto the street can be annoying if you're in a hurry!

The hotel definitely has problems managing its room inventory. I arrived at 2pm and was told that the room with a king size bed which I had already booked and paid for was not available. They offered me a larger room if I was willing to accept a room with two single beds instead. I accepted that only to be told that the room would not be available for another 30 minutes. I walked around the shopping mall next door and came back 45 minutes later but still had to wait several minutes longer before they finally had the room ready. I'm an Advantage Plus customer and I don't think that is a very good way to treat regular guests. They could at least have offered me a complimentary breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Anyway, the problems didn't end when I finally got into a room. There was only one channel available on the TV. The remote control didn't work, and I manually tuned the TV through all channels but nothing else was available. Make sure you're a fan of Cartoon Network if you choose to stay here. The worst experience of all was during the night when it became clear the thermostat on the air-conditioning was not working. Even on the warmest setting, the air-conditioner was still on full blast and the room got absolutely freezing. The only option was to turn it off completely, which made it too warm.

I read a few of the negative reviews but I disregarded what was written, thinking that other travelers simply had bad luck. I have since found out that it is not bad luck, room problems with this hotel is normal and an everyday occurance. Anyway, here is my story and if you compare it to the other reviews, it's exactly the same experience! Problems with getting: (a) the room you booked (& paid for) (b) getting INTO the room you booked (c) getting extra beds into the room for your children (even though you had already asked for extra beds when booking) Ware a family of 4 (2 adults & 2 young children) We had pre-booked and prepaid our 'Executive Room' because the website says it accommodates \"up to 2 adults and 2 children' with one king size bed and 2 singles for the kids. We arrived at night, around 1.30am. The kids were overtired and exhausted as they could not sleep on the plane. We arrive at the front desk and got our room key. We arrive at the room, ready to crash out but notice that there are only 2 single beds in the room and nothing else! I call downstairs to tell them that I asked for the Executive Room (i.e. 1 King Bed & 2 singles) The idiot replied \"Oh, you didn't tell us so we didn't know what you wanted, so we just set up the room with two single beds\" I was furious as I had a print out of what I booked and it specifically said that we were a family of 4 etc. Anyway, the ditz then fumbled around and said that she would send up an extra two beds asap. [Mind you, the room was very small and they were going to fit another 2 single beds into the room? That means they were planning to put 4 single beds into one room. But, alas, I was tired, and any bed was better than nothing] So, we started unpacking our suitcases and I tried to get the children to sleep whilst we waited. However, after 20 minutes, still NO extra beds. I call down to the reception again and ask about the whereabouts of my bed. The ditz then says to me \"oh, we decided to move you to another room which is already set up with the King sized bed\". Then I freak out. We had just unpacked two suitcases full of clothes and now she wants to move us. She could have told me earlier! So, I go downstairs to speak to the imbiciles face to face. I am very angry by now. Then \"Meng\" at the front desk sees me approaching and he says in Chinese \"oh, here comes a mad crazed woman\" Little did Meng know that I know how to speak Chinese! I was FURIOUS. But lucky for him, I held my tongue for fear of being escorted out by security as I am not an unreasonable woman, all I wanted was a bed to sleep in! So, another girl gives me the key and we move to another room. We arrive and it has one King sized bed and one sofa bed. Oh my God, we are STILL short one bed. I freak out again and go downstairs again to speak with the Duty Manager now. I tell her the problem. She says she will get a bed to us asap. I return to the room and we wait another 5-10 minutes and the beds arrive, finally we can sleep. After all this, NO ONE even apologised or even followed up on our check in problems. It is the worst customer service we have ever experienced. Very very disappointing for a 4 star hotel. The worst part is that this is a constant problem in the hotel. Whilst we were there we met two other families who were also having problems. One Indonesian family had to wait one hour for their room to be ready (check in wass 12.00pm and they arrived at 3.00pm) They were offerred a smoking room which they declined as they booked a non-smoking room. The poor family had to wait all this time and on one even offered a complimentary drink or meal in the adjacent bar/cafe. Not even a sorry was muttered from the Novotel staff. Another family we met from Spain arrived late afternoon and found out that their room also did not have the requested extra rooms they booked. We all later found out that the hotel does not put in any extra beds until you CHECK IN. Therefore, you have been warned. If you are checking in during the day, then be aware. If you are checking in late at night, with kids, then please don't stay at the Novotel. There are plenty of other good hotels out there.

My first comments will be strictly about the hotel which is in a fantastic location in the heart of dinning/entertainment options, boat trips on the river and near the Chinatown MRT. Within walking distance is both Chinatown, the business district and waterfront. Because of a hotel reservation mistake, our room was not available upon arrival at 2am, so we were upgraded to the Premium Floor with privileges in the hospitality suite. The room was clean, well appointed with good amenities, a flat screen TV, average size. The bathroom had slow drainage and you couldn\u2019t open the balcony door; they are kept locked. Buffet breakfast was included and you couldn\u2019t ask for more options both Asian, Malay and Western food. They even offer ice cream for freshly made waffles. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for it\u2019s fantastic location and rooms. Booking the hotel and their reservation management is another story. I booked online via their website one room with a \u201cspecial package\u201d which included free internet and \u201cvaluable coupons\u201d. I had to cancel the first booking which is very straight forward on their website and provides a confirmation number. I rebooked another room with single beds. PTD I emailed the reservation manager to make sure they noted our early morning arrival (we booked the night of July 29th, but actually arrived July 30th at 2am) and requested information on how to book the \u201cspecial package\u201d city tour and night safari. Because of our arrival time and limited time to see the city, we needed to have our activities organized to make the most of our time. I received an email back noting our arrival time and no further information, so I emailed the reservation manager again asking to have the requested information available at check-in, but never heard back. Upon arrival at 2am, there was no information as requested, the room we booked was not available and they had not cancelled the first booking I made, so we had two rooms and neither had single beds. It took them over an hour to straighten out the list of problems and put extra beds in the one king size bed room. In the morning we had to pack up and check out because that room was promised to another person! This is why we were upgraded, which I believe was reasonable compensation for our inconvenience. The next morning I provided copies of the canceled room confirmation and my emails to the reservation manager that had gone unanswered, so our reservation could be corrected by check out the next day. When we checked out the following day, they STILL attempted to charge us for the second room that I had canceled on the internet and provided them with a copy of the confirmation! So if you decide to stay at the Novotel, book with care as they seem to have an inept reservation manager!

There were many groups of people sitting at the lobby waiting for their rooms. The receptionist was poorly trained in customer service. We had booked a King size bed on a non-smoking floor.

However, the receptionist looked at me as a matter of factly and asked me to choose kind bed smoking or non-smoking twin beds. There was no apology or sorts for not being able to meet our request. It was a totally frustrating experience. We spoke to the manager and she mentioned that she would freshened up the smoking room for us but it simply didn't cut it. The room, the sheets all reeked of smoke. We could even see burnt marks on the sheets and carpet.

May I also add that once we were settled in our room we realised that our baggage had not arrived in our room.Finally around midnight everything was in order. The whole check-in procedure was absolutely disgusting. We travel quite frequently and have never experienced anything like this before. If we were told the truth at 4:30pm and not strung along for 6 hours it may have eased our frustrations. We found out the next day from a guest at the motel that an airline had cancelled a flight therefore instead of looking after incoming clients the motel decided to look after their existing clients by letting them check out late, hence leaving us sitting around with no where to go.May I add that we were not the only clients that were let down that night. We chatted to numerous disgruntled guests about their bad check-in experience as well. On the brighter side the location was great and so was the buffet breakfast. Its just a shame the way we, and many other guests were treated so poorly that night.

The management had been asked by a major airline to accommodate 17 passemgers who had been delayed 24 hours by the aircraft breaking down. Even though the hotel was fully booked they took the offer of high paying corporate business. And that is OK I guess. But in doing so they knew they were about to displace 17 incoming guests.

At 1am the staff decided that they would arrange an alternative hotel. And the good news was we wouldn't have to pay the taxi fare to get us there!! Yippee. The generosity!! We finally got to bed at 1.45am the next morning in an alternative hotel-in a smoking room that we had specifically not wanted.

However one complaint even though small was our covers had two rips in, which throughout our three night stay was never changed. When this was highlighted to the front of house, they graciously offered to send out a maid to change the sheets for us, however I would have liked this to have been an automatic necessity when the maid clean our room daily. Facilities-We did not opt for the breakfast, as previously mentioned they are plentiful pit stops close to the hotel to grab a bite to eat, or the much needed wake up coffee from Starbucks is next door. They have a large pool situated on the 7th floor with towels provided, sun loungers and shaded areas if need be. On the 6th floor they have a small gym accessible 24hours with two running machines, a bikes, cross trainer, weights and free weights. With water machines provided. In the lobby they had free internet available on 4 computers however during our whole stay only 2 were functioning. Service-The service on the whole check in etc was excellent; staff were more than gracious and polite. Positives Great location Hotel amenities Mall close by Close to the MRT Food court 7 eleven Negatives Minor gripe was having to get into 2 separate lifts, the first lift will only takes you up to reception level, where you then have to walk through the lobby to get in another lift to access your room.

It also happens to be among the cheapest on our corporate list. My stays have usually been one or two nights long. The rooms I've usually stayed in are at best functional. Nothing lavish certainly. A working desk, small sofa and either king or twin beds are typical. The size of the rooms are a bit small and the low ceiling makes it even appear smaller. The TV is still a small CRT type model instead of the flat screen LCDs that are now becoming the norm. There is wired broadband internet available in the rooms and wifi service in the common areas. The bathrooms usually have a separate bath and shower stall and the ceiling is even lower at the latter for some reason. Despite the vibrant club scene below, I've never really had any problems with noise. I've only had breakfast once and it was nothing special. The choices were limited and the quality was nothing to call home about. There are breakfast options nearby the hotel that probably give better value. The hotel is centrally located and dining options abound. The Clarke Quay MRT station is a good 5 to 10 minute walk away though. Most of the negatives I've found are bordering on nitpicking. For instance, I find the need to use two separate elevators (one to get to the \"lobby\" on the 7th floor and another one to go from there to the room levels above) a minor hassle. I've also encountered several occassions when the reception was flooded with people either checking out or checking in but most times you'll be attended to quite promptly. While the Novotel is definitely not tops among Singapore hotels in terms of facilities and service, its room rates are certainly competitive. The good location is also a definite plus. One probably just needs to temper expectations when staying here however. If you are looking for luxury, lavish surroundings and top of the line facilities, then best look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for functional accomodations at a decent price (at least by Singapore price levels) then the Novotel may be the place for you.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWon't be back again\u201d", "Author": "merkon", "ReviewID": "UR63173174", "Content": "Checked in with my husband and our 2 year old boy and that was our 2nd stay at the hotel.

The basic problems are incompetent management, and no ability to resolve even small problems. The general manager accused me of being a liar, and they proceeded to pad my bill, and brushed it off as just some minor accident, when it fact it was not. It took almost 30 minutes to check in. My key card didn't work, which mean a ten minute trek back to the front desk. I was in what they said was a nonsmoking room, that reeked worse than any place I've ever been in. I was too exhausted to go through another 30 minute nightmare at their front desk. The room was old and worn down: filthy mold, filthy grout, stains all over the bathroom, worn carpet, dirty tub, old crumbling wooden doors, etc. See my pictures, attached. And this was on the PREMIERE LEVEL. I can only imagine the condition of regular rooms. Truly an embarassment to Accor Hotels and NOVOTEL. Also, the size of the room was absurdly small. THe air conditioning temperature didn't work: you either had the room temperture for Siberia, or 100% Singapore humidity. They charge about $25 per day to use the wifi internet. THere are a few terminals in the lobby, which are always occupied and you have to stand to use them. Then I discovered the remote control didn't work. It took me a day and a half, six phone calls, and they still never delivered a remote that worked. I spoke to six different employees from the maid all the way to the General Manager, and no one could get a remote that worked. THe General Manager accused me of not knowing how to work it. I told him it worked, only if you hold the remote 1 inch away from the t.v., which I didn't consider a \"remote\". He said I was making a big deal out of \"small problems\". I asked him what the rate was for a room without a remote control that worked, and he accused me of trying to get a free hotel room out of him. That pretty much is calling me a thief. THis General Manager is an embarassment to Accor Hotels and Novotel. He is completely incompetent, and has no ability to resolve small problems. And he gave me some story that he is \"an Ambassador for the guests\". I guess that doesn't including figuring out how to get a remote control. And it gets worse. When I called the operator to speak to the General Manager, they connected me to his mobile phone, and didn't inform me that would initiate a charge on my bill. So at check out, I see a big charge made, when I complained to the General Manager and Duty Manager. So the Novotel Singapore CHARGES people to make complaints, which they ignore. ONe of the Duty Managers I spoke to lied to me and said the Resident Manager's phone was busy. THen that story changed no less than 3 more times to, \"he's in Thailand\", \"I think his phone is broken\", \"he's in a meeting\", etc. The good points: not exactly, but there is a Starbucks and 24 hours 7-11 downstairs, which is good so you don't have to pay outrageous prices in the hotel dining rooms. THe location isn't great, as it's about a 15 minute walk in Singapore heat to the nearest MTR subway station. And it's not a great line, it's the one where you have to connect at least once to just about anywhere a tourist would want to go, and you lose a lot of time. THe hotel is in a very crowded and congested area where there were constant traffic jams, well into the late evening. THe bottom line is this hotel is substandard, and is in need of a total refurbishment. And it's not cheap either, which makes it a very bad value for money. Combine that with incompetent management, and you have a recipe for a bad stay.

We took out the A-club card (well worth doing!) when we booked the room which was excellent as we had free wifi and a free hopper bus for the day which picked us up from hotel and took us on 3 different routes around Singapore where we could jump on and off wherever we wanted. A great way to see Singapore stress free! Other services There was a good size swimming pool which looked lovely (we could see it from out our window) but we didn't get a chance to use it. same with the gym. I highly recommend this hotel.

The room itself was average in size, probably a little on the small side. As i mentioned, this didn't really bother us since we didn't spend much time in it. The best thing about the Novotel Clarke Quay is the location. MRT station just across the bridge, and if you don't feel like going far for a meal and entertainment then the Clarke Quay area is amazing. There are certainly a lot of restaurants to choose from, all are incredibly expensive when compared to eating in a China Town food court.

The hotel has a strange layout as the reception is on the fifth floor, however, as we had a suite reserved on the executive floor, we had to check in at the executive lounge. What was surprising for Asia was that I had to lug my own baggage around, although I am quite physically capable of doing so. I was given the wrong room on arrival, however, that was rectified and I again had to move my own luggage - again, no big deal. The suite was roomy enough but the decor seemed a little dated, however, there were some little niggles. The wardrobe door was hanging out of its runner, the in room safe was not secured and just resting on a shelf in the bottom of the wardrobe, one of the televisions was not tuned in and batteries were missing from the TV remote - although not major issues, were however quite surprising for one of the supposed premier rooms in the hotel. I had lounge access that offered two hours of free alcoholic drinks (to which you helped yourself - unsurprisingly), however, I was a little disappointed with the limited choice of snacks available. Although breakfast was included, I did not bother eating the following morning therefore I cannot comment on the fayre on offer. The location of the hotel is ideal as it is (as the hotel name suggests) right on Clarke Quay and is within a short walk of the MTR system. Overall, the stay was pleasant enough and maybe I expected too much, however, I would probably stay at the Novotel again as the location is the hotels prime attribute and ideal for easy access to the attractions of Singapore.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "eatingoutSydney", "ReviewID": "UR54290983", "Content": "This is my favourite hotel in Singapore.

Very informative and hassle free. Really appreciated the fact that family with children was considered. I asked for a Non smoking, River view and an Executive Room. Check In - We arrived early and was well taken cared of by Annabelle. Initially, a trainee was assigned to help check us in. Then Annabelle immediately took over the process when things became complicated. I had stated at point of rsvp that I had a 15 year old and 10 year old traveling along but was still asked if I needed an extra bed. Managed to get us a non River view room and was told that it would be ready in an hour and a half. We left and returned 3 hours later and was taken care by the duty manager whom seemed unsure of what was going on. I was asked again for my credit card and was told my room was not ready. After a few minutes of back and forth, he checked and all was in order. I had to wait a further 15 minutes for this process. The room was spectacular with a view of fort canning park and marina sands, singapore flyer etc. Had to call for bag to be delivered and Porters delivered the wrong bag. 10 Minutes later bags were delivered and porter were very helpful. The Breakfast was truly first class and service was impeccable, sincere and efficient despite what seemed like 300 people at the restaurant. The only comment I had were the spoon for the rice were not soaked in water hence it was all sticky. The coffee machine clearly was not simple to use as everyone had to get help. F&B service was very friendly and was very insightful with transportation tips but front desk seemed biased except for a few staff. They only smiled at caucaseans and Asians had no eye contact. Annabelle was an exception, and she befits her title as Guests Loyalty Ambassador. We had a problem printing from the guests internet at the lobby and she came to our rescue.

On your right is the river, clark quay (clubs and restaurants).

Don't ever try the mexican restaurants across the river, it is really overpiced and tasted really bad. Instead go for Turkish Kebabs or snacks within Clark Quay. Chinatown is 5 minutes by rickshaw or MRT (train/subway). Try porridge or night food. Bad points: please note you have to pass by a few formal Chinese restaurants and Indian restaurants in order to get the shared swimming pool (shared with Sommerset Hotel).

On arrival we upgraded to a suite on the Premier floor as a treat. The suite was very large (absolutely enormous bed) with typical mid range furnishings (fairly basic but clean and good condition), a large marble bathroom with single sink, large Jacuzzi bath with shower over and electronic toilet which looked like something out of a Star Trek film. The room had a separate lounge with sofa, desk and another TV which was also handy. Everything was clean and well maintained and the extra space was a bonus. The premier lounge was wonderful, they really take care of you and as Singapore is such an expensive city the \u2018free\u2019 drinks and food at breakfast and early evening add up to a great deal. The food and drinks and service are worth the upgrade, but what really makes it worth while is the peace and quiet! No screaming kids or hustle and bustle, you can start your day or evening perfectly chilled before heading into Orchard Road or Clarke Quay. The lounge staff make sure you leave feeling very spoilt and pampered. The hotel has free use of Apple Macs (20min use) in the lobby and for Premier Floor customers there are two more with printers and no time limit in the lounge. We tried the restaurant one evening and the food was ok. Unfortunately we had come from Bali which totally spoilt us in terms of quality and price so it was not favourable to compare. My husband enjoyed his Lamb Shank Rendang but sadly my Nasi Goreng just couldn\u2019t compare to the ones from Bali. The Singapore Slings in the bar were mixed fresh, served with a smile and tasted good (S$26.36 for two). I had heard that Singapore service tended to be poor but we found all the staff at the Novotel to be friendly, helpful, professional and charming and could not fault them. The Novotel is in the heart of Clarke Quay and a short MRT ride to all the main attractions. We headed to City Hall MRT where we bought a 3 day tourist pass for S$34 (S$10 refundable on return of card). This gives you unlimited use of the MRT and buses for 3 days, it is also incredibly convenient as you don\u2019t have to scrabble for change (buses only accept the right change) or fiddle around buying MRT tickets on every journey. Central MRT is right over the bridge from Novotel and the most convenient to get to. Singapore is very very expensive. Even in the great Singapore Sale it is far more expensive than the UK. A Radley bag I can buy in the UK for \u00a3150 was \u00a3180 in the sale in Singapore. If you want a bargain head to Bugis street where you can haggle, steer clear of Orchard Road (the unfavourable currency exchange didn\u2019t help.)

Free internet access also. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The concergie were great for booking transfers and arranging sightseeing taxis -v- train etc. Taxis are well priced in Singapore. Singapore Airlines has a hop on hop off bus which is great. S$6 if you have flown with Sing Air or Silk Air otherwise S$12 but well worth it. Get on and off as much as you want for the day and it takes you to all the tourist places. Sentosa Island is ok. If you have been to Disneyland or Universal studios and have teenagers I would not bother going unless you want to do the cable car which takes about 1/2 hour for round trip S$18pp. Buses go around Sentosa as it is so big but would not rush back to that. Singapore Flyer is great. Go to tour desk and see if you can get better price, normally S$29 but we got for S$21, takes 1/2 hour also but worth doing. Clark Quay is like being in Melbourne's Southbank with lots of restaurants and bars on the river front. We read on TA that Satay King was great for food, we were disappointed in the food there.

I stayed at the exec premier floor room with access to the premier lounge. I am comparing it with The Hilton Exec Rm with access to exec lounge. The Novotel room was much smaller! Fixtures and fittings were just ordinary. Everything was open - there isn't any drawers by the bedside to put any books or reading materials. There is also no wardrobe drawers for that matter. It's just a square room. Lightings could be improved upon. There is no bedside reading lights by the side. And there is only 1 bedside pedestal (without any drawers). What kind of an exec room is this? I mean, the Hilton's exec room is so spacious, well furnished and wonderfully bright with good lightings and ample cabinets to keep our stuff. The TV, though LCD, was only 21\" (compare this with Hilton's 37\" or 42\" mounted on the wall) and the proprietary cable TV remote control is frustrating as I have to keep on pressing the \"up\" button when I switched on the TV to get to CNN or Discovery, as there are no buttons for the digits to be entered. There is a DVD player alright - but it could not play my DVDs, even after 2 changes by the technician (he took the DVDs from other rooms on the same floor for me). I was told later by the receptionist at the premier lounge that the DVD players could only play Code 3 discs (Asean region), which baffles me, because the clientele are mainly Europeans and cabin crew staff from Middle East. Surely hotels need to have a multi-player system? The good thing about the toilet is that the bath and the shower stalls are separate. Having said that, the housekeeping is a bit mean in issuing towels. Only 2 were issued out per day. There are 2 toilet holders, but one was so loose that whenever I pulled on it, the whole toilet roll dropped to the floor! There is a small balcony, and being at level 24, this was one of the better features of the hotel - having a scenic and wonderful view of Singapore's skyline. I got the housekeeping maid to open up the sliding door for me, so that whenever I get depressed seeing the size of my so called \"exec room\", I simply escape to the balcony. Service - was also mediocre. Although the premier lounge staff were courteous, they were not overwhelming in their hospitality, unlike the exec lounge staff from the Hilton. For example, we took a bottle of fruit juice, drank it halfway and decided to go back to our room, only to be told that it is meant to be fully consumed within the lounge area! The premier lounge food? pales in comparison to the Hilton's. Nothing is being offered here after breakfast - no cookies, no finger foods, no cakes or tartlets. Only drinks. Have to wait till 6pm when evening cocktails start. Even then, the range of food wasn't as good. The lounge though offers 2 Apple PCs connected by broadband for use by those having access to the lounge. This is a plus point. But I am used to PCs operating on Microsoft windows OS. And one last bit of annoying fact is that you have to get to the 7th floor where the hotel check-in desk is located. This means you have to use the hotel lift from your room to the hotel lobby at 7th floor, walk to the shopping centre's connecting lift across the lobby and go down to street level. It's just a hassle after some time for us.

The hotel is very modern, clean and the staff is courteous. They provide van service to different parts of the downtown area on a routine schedule. They even paid for a taxi to take us to Chinatown when the van was not available. Breakfast is good and they change the menu a bit every day. The fitness room is large bu the equipment is lacking. The two treadmills are in constant use during peak hours. A wonderful shopping mall (The Pavilion) is a short walk and it has many eating choices from fast-food to top end dining. The only annoying thing is that it seems the staff is constantly coming into the room to check things.

Novotels are never adventurous or exciting, but they are really good at what they promise to deliver -- a consistent traveler experience in every city they are located. And the fact that they never charge for 2 kids under 16 years old in the room is a HUGE plus. Especially in Asia and Europe where we found many hotels won't even let you have 2 children in the same room with you (they often only allow 1). I think they also give the kids free breakfast, although we ended up going out to the Starbucks in the bottom of the building every a.m. The hotel itself is in good condition. There is a first floor elevator lobby, you go up to the main lobby and restaurant area. There are 2-3 free usage big screen MAC computers in the main lobby that my kids used to play games when there was no one else waiting to check email, etc. The buffet lunch in the main restaurant was expensive but amazing in the array of food and the desert table, complete with chocolate fondue fountain. We took it as a good sign that there were mostly locals eating in the dining room, not many tourists. The best part of the hotel is probably the large pool area on the roof of one part of the building. We actually got a bit of a breeze up there (it was stiflingly hot even in early June), and there were many umbrellas and wait service from the restaurant. Singapore itself is a bit antiseptic -- its a very modern city and much of the culture has been \"Disneyfied\" but it is certainly clean and there are an abundance of restaurants and things to do. The Novotel is located on Clark Quay along the river, and I would say that is the best place to be if you are traveling with children. There is a large pedestrian mall, at least 50 restaurants within walking distance, and the bumboat river cruises leave from 50 meters away. Our kids also enjoyed Sentosa Island, and walking around through the bazaars of Chinatown and Little India. We didn't get to do the day trip to Pulau Ubin unfortunately, as it shows the traditional way of life in stilt houses, etc., but we had just finished moving out of our house in Sydney and spent one day just resting by the pool.

Usually when you think of buffet you think of leftover food the chef is trying to get rid of. Not so here. This is a place where Singaporeans come to dine, because they know it's great food at a great price. Absolutely delicious. And my wife and I are very picky, mostly vegetarian and macrobiotic eaters, and we are sensitive to things like MSG and preservatives (get reactions, etc.). But I stuffed myself to the gills and felt full of energy that night and the next day. The famous Maxwell Market is great - if you can tolerate high levels of MSG. At the Novotel you won't miss Maxwell; what a selection of foods: sushi (so delicate and flavorful), beef, selections of fish, scallops on the shell, shrimp, soups, cheeses and breads, and desserts galore. All gourmet standard. Everything extremely fresh - it was a work of art. I'm now spoiled and I don't think I can accept anything less anymore. And the cost was about US $25 per adult, very cheap because guests at the hotel get a big discount.

She was right - the hotel is right next to the Clarke Quay area with dozens of restaurants, bars and discos. The nearest MRT station is underneath The Central shopping mall across the river, 5 - 7 minutes (hot!) walk. We preferred using the metro during the day for sightseeing / shopping etc. and being able to have dinner at a walking distance from the hotel. Room: We had booked a standard queen room but after 1st night decided to upgrade to a bigger room (+85 SGD/night) with more closet space and better view. The closet in the first room was absolutely tiny! Standard queens overlook the pool + next hotel and not the city skyline. The second room on 25th floor was much better and the view was really good (my photos are from the 2nd room). As we stayed for 6 nights we preferred a larger room and view. Bathroom was big with bath and shower. Service: The staff was friendly but quite neutral, nothing special. We had to call maintenance 3 times to our rooms. In our first room the main light did not go off at night, staff came in 10 minutes and fixed it through the ceiling. In our second room TV remote was not working properly, sink was not working well and the desk light was not working. These were all fixed as well, but made me think that they could check these things every once in a while by themselves without waiting or the guests to inform that the sink is not working (which housekeeping should notice!) etc. Hotel: We did not take the expensive breakfast nor did we use the restaurants so we cannot comment on that. There are so many restaurants right next to the hotel that we did not consider eating at Novotel. The pool is rather big and with app. 20 - 30 sunbeds. I went to the pool a couple of mornings around 9 am and it was reasonably busy already in the morning (but still got a good sunbed facing the morning sun). There are towles ready on the beds and extra towels on the side. They are renovating something by the pool so you will see some construction issues going on but they did not make any noise at all. The Clarke Quay discos, on the other hand, play music quite loud late at night and we could hear the disco beat to our room on 25th floor at night (didn't bother me but my light sleeping spouse mentioned it a couple of times). There are 2 complimentary computers with internet in the lobby but they were always occupied - we used them only once for that reason.

Fire alarm testing took place on one morning, however, we were not informed of that in-room, so there was concern when it first went off. I rang reception and no one answered! I only figured out there was no need for panic when the alarm went on and off several more times. Only after we went downstairs at midday did we see a sign by the lift at 7th floor reception that there was testing going on.

We paid a deposit through the website but when we got to the hotel, they made us pay 20% on top of what the invoice stated claiming it was local taxes and room service. The website and invoice had a disclaimer about local taxes and service charges but it no different to other hotels we've booked before and we've never been charged extra. If the hotel will charge more than advertised, they should also say what the extra cost may be. Since then, having complained to ratestogo.com, we have recovered the taxes charged as the Novotel has admitted the advertised fee at the time of our booking included the taxes, but we're still wondering what the 10% charged on top for \"room service\" was about. We settled the account before we got the rooms, so I'm wondering what sort of room service they charged us for. If the invoice mess up wasn't enough, there was the room configuration problem. On the website the room was advertised as suitable for 2 adults and 2 children but when we got there the only thing they could offer us was a room with a king size bed and 2 extra king single beds. Our room was large but with the two extra beds, there wasn't much room to move about. Then there was the noise every night up to 5am or so. We didn't investigate the origin of the loud music but it sounded like there was a night club somewhere in the hotel. We were on the 13th floor so I can't imagine how people on lower levels slept at night. We can't say it's not a nice hotel.

The hotels location is excellent as it's right at clarke quay which is a pretty happening area. Lots and lots of restaurants and night clubs, shopping close by too. Also, if you like eating different, exotic cuisines, Clarke Quay is the place to be! It has everything from Balinese to Moroccan. We weren't sure whether we should stay here or in a hotel on Orchard Road, but were so glad we chose this place instead because its not AS crowded and noisy as hotels on orchard road. Also, it's just abt 5-7 minutes by taxi to Orchard Road and hardly costs anything so I thought it was worth it. The hotel is situated above a shopping mall which was undergoing renovation at the time. The construction noise could only be heard when we were taking the elevator upstairs. Could barely hear anything from the rooms so no complaints there. The hotel itself is very clean and done up well. There is a lobby at the ground floor where they will take care of your luggage. Check-in is on the 7th floor. Didn't find this inconvenient at all. Staff was extremely friendly too. We had a problem with our suitcase (the zip was stuck) and we called the reception who sent someone up immediately to fix it. Very prompt service as well. The rooms are pretty big and comfortable as is the bathroom. I thought it was very stylishly done up. There was a DVD player, mini bar and in-room safe as well. We only had breakfast at the hotel as it was included in our package. Very nice spread, but it was SO crowded! I don't know if it's always that packed, or if it was just like that because it was new years weekend, but there is actually at least a 5 minute wait for most people (I noticed that the later you go, the more crowded it gets). And because its so crowded, the tables are put within 3 inches of each other so you can actually eat off the other persons plate! A little awkward when you know the people next to you can hear every word you're saying (not to mention they can see every thing you're eating)! The only odd thing I noticed was that every day, the fire alarm would go off. It wasn't noisy or anything, just a few second beeping noise, but I did get worried at first. After about a minute, they announced that they were investigating the situation and not to panic. And after another minute, they would say it was a false alarm. Now this happened all three days we were there. Maybe they were just checking it to make sure it worked, or maybe something was wrong with their system, but I don't think you should be too alarmed if it does go off when you're there! The pool was nice, but couldn't go to the gym because of the renovations. They did say we could use the gym in the apartment or something next door, but we didn't. Other than that, our stay at Novotel was great and I have no real complaints. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Singapore as the location was amazing and I'd also stay there again if I ever visit Singapore.

The only problem was that the safe didn't work but this was soon sorted out. We found the hotel service to be extremely prompt and efficient. In retrospect the only thing I would do differently next time would be to request a room overlooking the river to get more of a view. The hotel is above a small shopping mall where one can get things to eat; there is also a 24/7 MacDonalds for coffee etc. Also in the mall is an excellent massage centre - cheaper than the hotel, and seemed to be very professional and used by locals.

I'd foregone our 'free' night in Singapore to use as an upgrade to an executive suite however we were given a standard room, when we complained we got the Accor company reply - hotel is full, I produced the documentation to show what I had booked - no-one should have to do that. We were eventually shifted to a higher floor with nice views but it wasn't an executive suite, what I had paid for and had been promised in not what I got. In our experience Accor has taken our money, not honoured our bookings, left their staff to deal their company policy and I could of got better deals booking the rooms I wanted on-line through Asia-Rooms etc. We have had this card for several years and re-newed it quite by accident (long story). As for the Novotel Clarke Quay - our new room, although not an executive suite had a great view and was very nice.

It wasn't working earlier and they took 2 days for somebody to come and repair the same. FUNNY! There was a DVD player in the room so that let me see my own collection too. I am not sure if they had a DVD movie library in the Hotel, you can check that. The bathroom tub was a little small compared to the standard sizes, i believe. There is a bookshop, electronics store, currency exchange and a tourist information center right below the hotel in the mall.

When we arrived we realised that the hotel we had stayed in before was the previous incarnation of the Novotel (Novotel bought in 2005) so we ended up staying in the hotel we wanted anyway! We chose the Novotel because we are members of the Accor Advantage Plus Club (and because its in a fantastic location right on Clarke Quay). We were \"upgraded\" to a balcony room although we were only given a room with twin beds. I did say we would prefer a room with one bed, but as we were using a complementary voucher for our stay I didn't complain too much. The room was relatively compact but had a good view over the river and Clarke Quay. When we stayed 7 years ago we had a room up near the top which I'm sure was much larger so maybe the more expensive rooms are bigger. The choice of dining at Clarke Quay is quite overwhelming, and as we weren't that hungry after our flight we chose to dine in at the Novotel's restaurant which was nice but not spectacularly exciting. The pool is quite big and has lots of lounge chairs. We managed a quick swim before checking out at midday. The hotel had no problem keeping our luggage locked up for the afternoon until our evening flight. The rooms at the Novotel are pretty much standard Novotel decor - the best thing about the hotel is the great location for night dining and a good pool for relaxing around.

On arrival there was a slight mix up with the reservation but it was resolved in a timely manner. The hotel was fully booked during our stay so it was fortunate the change could be made. ARRIVAL/DEPATURE We pre-organised private car transfers to/from hotel from Singapore airport. We have previously travelled to Singapore many times and used taxis, bus transfer & MRT (all cheaper) but wanted a different experience. It was SGD60 nett plus tax one way but we wouldn\u2019t bother with the additional expense in the future. For a special occasion it was worth it though. RECEPTION Arriving at the front of the hotel concierge is on the ground floor. The elevator only goes to the 7th floor then a walk across the lobby to the reception area. Check in was prompt. No big queues besides a tour group checking in at the same time. There is another set of elevators that are used to go to the guest rooms. So there is always the need to cross the lobby as from the street/concierge area you cant select the elevator floor to your room. ROOM Our room was of an average size. We had a lovely view of the Singapore River area. Good size bathroom with a separate shower and bath. Good selection of amenities provided, even a mini talcum power. The television had very limited cable channels. Mini bar offered a good selection of drinks. Bathrobes & slippers provided for use. There was an in room electronic safe. We found the room most comfortable. Room key only operates to the floor of guest room. We had friends staying at the hotel as well and were not able to visit there floor. Our room was quiet & experienced no noise & were on the 12th floor facing the pool/river. FACILITIES The business centre was easy to find and opposite the elevators that go from concierge to lobby. We used the internet there and it wasn\u2019t cheap but convenient. There is an outdoor pool and deck chair area. Only disadvantage with this was we had to cross the lobby to access the area the only other way we found was to cut through the restaurant. On one of our mornings at the hotel we enjoyed the buffet breakfast at The Square Restaurant. With tax about SGD 30 pp. Strange set up of tables in this restaurant as there were lounge chairs with small table that gave a modern feel. There are limited facilities at this hotel, however, in the immediate area just about everything can be found. AREA On street level there is 7/11 mini convenience store, Starbucks & a 24 hour McDonalds. There is a local shopping centre where we found good price items. The Singapore River Clarke Quay area is literally outside the hotel entrance with a great range of restaurants & bars to enjoy. The area comes alive at night with locals and tourists. It is a short walk to Chinatown & the Clarke Quay MRT stop. A taxi to Orchard Road was SGD $3.50. To make use of the hotel limousine service was SGD$8.00 plus the taxi meter.

Complimentary bottled water & shampoos etc when you are in the room, Being on the top floor facing the river, Most staff were pleasant and 2 in particular in the BIZ room (male & female) who were especially pleasant (can't remember their names though), Taxis always out the front as we found it just as easy to pay S $3-$4 to get around. Close to Chinatown as just over the bridge and about 10min walk, close to all the Clarke Quay restraunts, satay club. 7/11 is next door, shopping centre underneath.

Does have a massage service also (this is part of the negative too though). Cute how they leave a goodnight card with an orchid on it, pity couldn't bring it home and you received a free paper each morning. Negatives: HARD BEDS & HARD PILLOWS, so first nite was hard to sleep, Sometimes reception didn't seem to be interested in telling you how to get places etc, BIZ lounge were more helpful. Foot massages even though advertised were not available as the person was away, thought should advise in room if this is the case. Even though i didn't find it a negative some people would in the fact that reception is on 7th floor therefore you have to catch 2 lifts. The lift from 7-25 was very frustrating as if you do not get your keycard either in quick enough or the button won't press you end up going down or up when your trying to go the opposite way. Other than that it was a great hotel, however I would only pay to be on the Business Floors as this was well worth it for the free extra's you received. We managed to get our room for S$195 per night- i think if you paid more than this there are just as good a hotels anywhere else, especially maybe closer to Chinatown.
