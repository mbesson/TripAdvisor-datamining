Solo, female traveler here and I had no problems with it. The little yellow sign is hard to find, but once you see it and learn which part of the metro to emerge from you do alright. Ring the buzzer next to the huge door. The little door is the one you go through. Walk straight ahead to the patio area and turn right. In the doorway to the right you see the stairs and the elevator. The elevator takes you to the 3rd floor. The hotel door is little, with a little sign saying 'reception'. Most of the workers there were very kind. They did mess up once and not give me my wake up call, so that was a little concerning. There is a tram a block away, the metro is a block away and there are buses. The train station is near and it's very handy for catching the a.m. Leonardi Express to the airport from the South Entrance of the train station. The Indoor Market place is near. Fassies Gelato is right next door. A regular supermarket down the street. Many Asian retail shops around. The Asians were not that nice and one woman tried to keep a Euro she owed me by giving me a 5cent Euro when I was purchasing a cappucino.. All in all I recommend the hotel for someone on a budget. The hotel was very clean. A little noisy until after midnight from traffic. Free water and coke in a tiny fridge in the room. I was in the metro late and walked to the hotel. It was not at all that scarey.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor", "Title": "\u201cLarge, Clean, Personal, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "tyhoward", "ReviewID": "UR20651711", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Moscatello with my girlfriend during a 4 days visit to Rome in the Summer of 2008. Overall it was a great experience. I'll first start with location which is actually one of the only negative things about the hotel. It is south of Termini train station (about a ten minute walk) which our guide book listed as a place not necessarily recommended but unless you are a young girl traveling by yourself I wouldn't give it much thought and even then I think it is a lot more the fact that it is dark and there are not a lot of people around that give the neighborhood its reputation. Being a 20 some male I actually enjoyed the location there were some interesting Asian shops and markets, a park, and metro station very near by (the stop south of Termini is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel). The hotel itself is so cool. When you walk up to the door it is very easy to miss because there is only a small yellow sign above it, which seems pretty standard in this area. You buzz the front desk and they key the door to let you in. One of the coolest things is the door is huge (10 ft x 6 feet) but the part that opens is tiny (5 ft x 3 ft). It was neat anyways. Once you enter the door you come into a small open area with plants and tile floors. You walk to the building on the north side and then go up a few floor (there is a small elevator available but I think it is only 2 floors up). The entrance to the hotel is small and from its appearance you might think they only had two rooms. It has a coffee machine and a small sofa but is mainly just a place to pick up and leave your key. The rooms are extremely nice. They are quite large by European standards. I had a room with a double bed (unfortunately two twins). There was a wall (12 ft) with nice wooden cupboard style closets and a built in mini refrigerator. The bathroom was small to average for European standards but was very nice and clean. There was a small 13-15\" flat panel tv which received a bunch of local television stations, a reasonably sized desk, and full length mirror as well. The floors were a nice clean tile. As far as I could tell from my stay, the staff consisted of two men who alternated shifts. They were there until 2 am and spoke good English and could give directions/advise. They also had maps available which they would share when you asked directions. The hotel did not have any internet access but the area near Termini has a few internet cafe places where we once stopped and used the internet for 15 min for 50 cents. They hotel does not have breakfast but they do give you a voucher for a restaurant which they are affiliated with which gives you a lunch or dinner for each person in the room. The meal consisted of salad, bruschetta, pizza/lasagna/spahgetti, and coffee. It wasn't the best meal but it was cheap and convenient. If you're coming back from traveling for the day just get off at Termini metro station and it is two blocks away. Then you have a 7-8 min walk back to the hotel. Overall the hotel was a great experience. I really enjoyed the personal atmosphere that it had and the spacious rooms. The area is not the most beautiful in Rome but for the price I think it is safe and comfortable and a great place to re energize for the go go go traveler. **Also I used www.HRS.com and got a great deal (stay three nights and the fourth is free). So it is definitely worth checking out.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for the price\u201d", "Author": "North28", "ReviewID": "UR18268673", "Content": "Hotel's location was very good, being near from the centre of the city and the main railway station, Termini.

The price was also good as there was a special offer. The room was exactly like the one on the website. Clean, lcd tv, a/c and quite spacious and comfortable. Also quiet. Room had new furniture, lcd tv and fittings. Room well up to 3* standard. Fridge had complimentary drinks. Supermarket down the road. Reception polite but we didn`t need help or information. The hotel is a floor in a large building with a suprisingly clean and bright entrance courtyard.
