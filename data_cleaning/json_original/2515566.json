There's no bellman to help with your luggage. The outside & lobby look new & impressive. However, upon entering our room I realized that this was once an old hotel which has been renovated. All the furniture & d\u00e9cor have been updated, but there were a few tell-tale signs: the ceiling had yellow stains (water damage?), the door to the room & the bathroom doors despite having a fresh coat of paint showed signs of an old motel door from days gone by. Upon checking in, you\u2019re required to sign a piece of paper that states you\u2019ll be charged $250 if you smoke in a non-smoking room. I like that because a few hotels I stayed at before, previous guests smoked in non-smoking rooms. The hotel is undergoing construction so ask for a room on a higher floor. There is complimentary continental breakfast which includes bagels, muffins, pastries, hot oatmeal with raisins, yogurt, apples/oranges, hard-boiled eggs, cereals, toast, peanut butter/jam, apple juice, orange juice, coffee, etc. There\u2019s a happy hour every Mon-Thurs from 5-7 pm. I went once & the theme was Mexican: chili, nachos, deep fried chicken wings & free drinks. Room was small, cozy, clean, has contemporary d\u00e9cor & equipped with a work desk, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer & 2 complimentary Kirkland water bottles. Beds were comfortable. Pillows were soft, downfill type. There\u2019s a pillow menu by the phone for you to request from the front desk if you want a firm or soft pillow. Remember to ensure the door shuts completely after you leave your room. Sometimes, it doesn't shut completely. Bathroom was large with plenty of counter space. There\u2019s a magnifying mirror by the sink for the ladies to apply makeup. Toiletries included a bar soap, small bottles of shampoo, conditioner & lotion that have a mint scent. Water pressure is strong & excellent. There\u2019s no fan in the bathroom though. There\u2019s a business centre with free internet access in an enclosed, motion-sensored room across from the front desk. You have to check with the front desk before & after you use the computer because they monitor who\u2019s using it.

The pool area was small and not very attractive, and so crowded that night with screaming kids, that our idea of sitting there peacefully was immediately vetoed.

The check-in staff was friendly and efficient, and our mini-suite was clean and welcoming. There was a refrigerator, a sink, a microwave, flatware, and silverware in the kitchenette in the front room. There were also two bottles of water and a package of microwaveable popcorn on the table in front of the couch (with a pull-out bed inside). I know that is minor, but it was a pleasant gesture. A desk and a television were also in this front room. The front room could be closed off by a door that separated it from the bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom contained a spacious king bed, a clock radio alarm, curtains that effectively blocked out the morning sun, two night tables, drawers, a chair, and a second television. The sink is separate from the rest of the bathroom and is located by a built-in hair dryer. The toiletries provided by the hotel were another detail that added a charm; two shampoos, a conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash were all supplied on the counter. The hotel was right off of the 15 freeway- which is a little bit out of the way from the heart of San Diego, but there was a restaurant next door, a complimentary continental breakfast, good service, free parking, and an affordable rate that made this hotel pleasurable stop.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Provo, Utah", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!!!\u201d", "Author": "redshoetraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3353727", "Content": "This hotel is actually called the Holiday Inn Select North Miramar. I don't know if the name change is new, but it is at this address and is the one pictured. We had an excellent stay at this hotel for one night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and spacious. This hotel received the highest rating for Holiday Inns in the region, and yet the rate was excellent...much lower than other hotels in most areas of San Diego. It's farther from downtown and star attractions, but not very far. It took us about 10 minutes to drive to Sea World. They serve a free breakfast that consists of a good variety of muffins, bagels, yogurts, juices, coffee, danishes, cereal, etc. A good continental breakfast. They also have free drinks and appetizers in the evening, but we didn't go to that. There aren't very many restaurants immediately around the hotel, but there is a fair selection within a short drive. I would definitely stay here again if in San Diego.", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn San Diego North Miramar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d212059-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_San_Diego_North_Miramar-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$115 - $165*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9335 Kearny Mesa Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92126</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515566", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/67/49/6749894d9c1a52ec1c69850ae44a765c6large.jpg"}}
