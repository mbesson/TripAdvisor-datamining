Rooms were okay but, again, the views make up for a non-descript room. We enjoyed two evenings dining outside with good food and wine (we purchased earlier), bright moonlight and water fountain providing relaxing backdrop (visual and auditory). Negatives- if you dislike walking and are assigned rooms in the 200s or 100s, then you're doomed. These buildings are located at the bottom of the driveway and you'll have to walk up (about 5 minutes...but seems like forever if you are out of shape, unused to cobble-stone like driveway, and lugging a heavy bag). Their van will pick you up but, seriously, walk...and enjoy the view while you're at it. The driveway and stairs that lead up to each separate building on the lower level are not well lit and can feel creepy if you're not familiar with the location. Their front desk is staffed by overworked and harried individuals who unsuccessfully attempt to make you feel that you're not imposing on them. Their internet access consisted of one computer that you paid one euro for and got an hour's worth of access. Bathroom was well-stocked and clean but the shower basin took a long time to drain so a long shower could've easily flooded the floor (and we were on the third floor!)...and I couldn't figure out how to pop open the drain stopper on the bidet! Breakfast room was grand-looking but the food was bland (dry bread with butter). A few fruits and dried up pastries. But you can forgive many things for the view.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, New York", "Title": "\u201cAnt and Spider Infested!\u201d", "Author": "culturalhoney", "ReviewID": "UR115266501", "Content": "This hotel was one of the worst i have ever been too! The hotel apartments are scattered along a steep hill and access from your rooms to the main reception desk is at least a 10 minute tiring walk. On top of this most of the rooms were ant infested and had spiders crawling on the wall. Disgusting! The rooms were extremely bland (don't let the pictures fool you) and the beds were hard as rock. I was happy i only spent 1 night there and im glad i didn't go to sleep-friends of mine who did woke up with ants all over them! There didn't even seem to be many workers there it was like a ghost town. It had great scenery but that doesnt make up for how bad the living conditions where.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hants", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, but............\u201d", "Author": "ppnumerianus", "ReviewID": "UR80432830", "Content": "The hotel is tucked away in the hills to the south-east of Rome. The location is stunning, with a 360 degree panaoramic view. Glorious views of sunrise one side, and sunset the other. Problem is, access off a busy cross-country lane, OK for cars, but difficult for a 49-seater coach. It gets worse when you get there; there is a steep walk from the coach park up a zig-zag cobbled road to get to the main hotel. The 'courtesy' mini-bus seemed to be reserved only for transferring luggage up, rather than people. On exit, a coach has to either drive down or back down depending on which way you want to go along the lane - can't turn at the bottom. The hotel consists of the main block, and an annexe. All of our party of 30+ were in the main hotel, where all the facilities were (except the pool by the annexe). The photos on the website are accurate, but I gather that the quality of the rooms varies considerably. We hit lucky with a room on floor 3, right in the centre of the rear of the building overlooking the ornamental pool and fountain. Several of the group mentioned that their rooms smelt damp, with wallpaper beginning to peel, and even in our room this was evident beside the wardrobe. We had a 6-foot wide bed, the room was spacious, the bathroom only had a shower, but was plentifully suppllied with toiltries. Not many staff in evidence, but then we seemed to be the only people there. (but see below!). The food was average 'group fare', edible but not great; a huge variety of vegetables (good news), but served buffet style, cold (bad news!). The local town, Marino, has little to recommend it, but the local lane leads down to the Via Appia, so there is reasonable access to the autostrada network. This hotel seems to be the place for local weddings; after 3 quiet nights, the 4th and last night was Saturday, with a large wedding party. The after wedding disco was LOUD! and the hotel hotel vibrated in time to the boom box sound. Be warned! So, this hotel may or may not suit, depending on your reasons for being in the area.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cFiasco at Helio Cabala April 08\u201d", "Author": "Banjo-Dublin", "ReviewID": "UR18939091", "Content": "This place has put me off Italy for life!!!! Decided to go to Italy in April 08 with a group of friends on a 1 week golf holiday. We go away every year for some golf - a laugh and a few beers. Booked all thru mastergolf.it online. We were supposedly booked to the Castel Gandolfo Hotel but ended up in the Helio Cabala. (Master Stroke not master Golf!) This is a hotel geared for the Locals not for golfers - there was a wedding on our day of arrival. We felt a little out of place as we were the only tourists in the place. We were given rooms in an apartment block 500 M from Main Hotel down a very steep hill. No facilities whatsoever in the apartment block. The bar in the hotel is a joke - we were offered some local beer at ridiculous prices from a domestic fridge behind a 2 metre wide bar counter by a gentleman with zero English and less interest. No guest internet facilities either in the Hotel even at reception.. The Hotel is approx 3.5 Km from the nearest town of Marino. There is nothing in Marino for tourists. Even the locals wondered what 14 Irish Golfers were doing in town. We were supposed to have free 24 hour shuttle available to the town & back - never happened.(Master Stroke again) Walking to the town was not an option - no foot paths on a very fast busy country road without street lighting. We arrived Saturday and taxied to town for a few beers and a meal. Had a very ordinary meal in a local trattoria and a few beers - then when we looked for a taxi to get back to Hotel - NO TAXIS IN MARINO AT WEEKENDS!!! - after hours waiting & wondering in a strange town we paid some local lads to take us to the hotel. From then on we had to bargain with Bar / Restaurant owners to get lifts to the hotel if we ate / drank at their place. All in all a complete fiasco. THANK GOD FOR MICHAEL O LEARY & RYANAIR - WE BOOKED FOR 1 WEEK - ARRIVED SATURDAY AND GOT FLIGHTS HOME ON TUESDAY . The hotel did not have the decency to allow us book flights online - we had to have this arranged from Ireland online.
