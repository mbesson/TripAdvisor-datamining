The hotel is in a great central location, and has car parking on site for around $23 per day for guests. The foyer is lovely and the staff are really helpful.... but the rooms are not good at all. The room we were originally booked into was so bad we complained. We're not 'complainers' usually, and I can handle modest, but this room was so run down it felt dirty. We were moved to another room, which was better, but only marginally. Really got the feeling that the staff are used to complaints about the place - which is a real shame for the staff, as they were all fantastic! Honestly, as you can see in my photos, the carpet in the first room we were in was so stained it looked like someone had been stabbed in there or something! The rooms were refreshed daily, but the towels and linen reeked of bleach, which was a little disconcerting. In our 'upgrade' room the bathroom was in bad condition - broken tiles, chipped enamel and dirty grouting - and because there are no exhaust fans the ceilings are getting a lovely coating of mildew. The bench for luggage looked like it was about to collapse and the furniture was old and falling apart. At one point I pulled down to doona to discover the sheets didn't even cover the whole bed! I have to say though that the staff were fantastic - one girl in particular, I think her name was Elly, was so friendly and accommodating. We ordered room service once, for breakfast Christmas morning. Nothing to write home about but fine. I booked this place as a 'secret deal' through wotif, and it is supposed to be four star, and it may have been once, but it's sure not any more.

The Citigate hotel is, not the sort of hotel you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pick to celebrate a special occasion. The Citigate hotel is, not the sort hotel you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pick if you were chasing a luxury escape for the weekend. And to be fair, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t how the hotel markets itself. The Citigate hotel is perfect for the business traveller, or the frazzled tourist, on a one or two night stopover in a big city. Located on the borders of Chinatown- a 10 minute walk from Darling Harbour, and a 20/25 minute walk from the Opera House or the Harbour Bridge. The Citigate hotel is your perfect silent business partner. I spent two nights at the hotel recently. I arrived well before the appointed check in time and my room was ready (this is always a good introduction to any hotel for the first time visitor). Check in was fast and friendly and I was allocated a room on the 16th floor. The room was clean and presentable- however there is an unmistakable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153package tour bus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel to it. The bathroom was small but adequate. It did however have one great advantage over its more high-brow accommodation providers located nearby. When you turned the hot water tap on in the shower, you got hot water (first time) and likewise, with the cold tap. There was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rainforest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shower- head or water-saver device, popular now in most hotels that sees you having to wrestle the thing half to death in order to get wet at all. The shower was the shower. The sink was the sink- and so at infinitum\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This utilitarian approach to hospitality may be a little agricultural for some, but I found it refreshingly honest. At the Citigate, what you see is what you get! The only meal I ate at the hotel was breakfast, which again, was a hot honest buffet, a mixture of fish and fowl, grains and legumes. Each night I repaired to the hotel bar after a day of business meetings, and I was always greeted by a drink, well-mixed, prepared by a friendly face... Given its location next to Chinatown, which is busy, boisterous and a bit trite. The hotel is relaxed and clam. So what will disappoint you about this hotel? If you arrive expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Four Seasons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the cheap- then you will be disappointed. If you arrive expecting afternoon tea and canap\u00c3\u00a9s at three- then you will be disappointed. If you arrive expecting breathing taking views of Sydney- then you will be disappointed. If you arrive expecting to get what you paid for, then you should leave a happy customer I did!! Would I stay here again?

Bathroom was the worst part - dark (one fluorescent tube above the mirror which provided very little illumination into the shower with the curtain drawn), chipped tiles, stains in the bottom of the bathtub.

As a number of other TA members have claimed, this hotel certainly requires renovation and would not be good value above what I paid via www.hotelclub.com.au of A$179 per night excluding breakfast. The hotel staff member checking us in, Resa, was pleasant and allowed early check-in at 1130. The hotel lifts and corridors were both in excellent condition. The room doors were not noisy which was a bonus. The room, again as others had claimed, had minor staining on its carpet. It had a flat screen, reasonably small television set. The bedside tables had reasonable lighting including bedside lights. The king bed mattresss sagged slightly at one side but this did not affect my sleep quality. Good curtains effectively blocked the light. The main bench in the room had seen better days. A giveaway for the hotel's age (it was formerly the Carlton Crest) was the 30 year old unused phone socket. Annoyingly, there was no in-room compendium so it took me a while to locate the air-conditioing switrch as the setting was initially far too warm. The wardrobe was of a good size and had an iron and irning board. As others have noted, the bathroom was small but the shower over bath worked acceptably. Baths may be out of fashion in typically cost-cutting disguised as radical environmentalism (particularly when eastern Australia is not enjoying heavy rainfall, showing the fallacy of climate change alarmists) but the bath here was welcomed by yours truly. Shampoo and conditioner provided was a reasonable size and of the 'Bliss' brand. The soap was also fit for purpose. An alarm clock is in the room and worked fine. While not in a room facing it, the student accommodation being built on the corner of Quay and Thomas Streets appears, externally at least, to be virtually complete so any noise problems may hopefully be a thing of the past. There appears to be another building being constructed about 30 or 40 metres to the southwest but this did not present any obvious noise problems. My stay was at a weekend so a weekday stay may be needed to properly assess this. Checkout was fast with the clerk not insisting on a room check (thank goodness.)

I went to reception to sort out the problem, and Tammy was there. She flat out lied and told the manager that she never even spoke to us. I was absolutely gobsmacked. We were offered a rollaway bed, but for the price of $210, I dont think its fair to expect someone to sleep on a rollaway bed.

We had a lovely view of Darling Harbour & it was a 2 min walk to Paddys markets & China Town. The staff were very helpful & friendly and well mannered. Just be careful walking around that area late at night. I felt a bit uneasy because its on a fairly quiet street and someone was stabbed on the street the day we got there but i guess that can happen anywhere. There arent a lot of restaurants near by unless you want chinese food so I suggest talking a short walk to Darling Harbour & eating at one of the many grat restaurants there. I would definately go back. Luckily we got a deal through a friend & only paid $150 a night. Its usually about $300 a night which is well worth it. Its also only a few mins walk to the Entertainment Centre so its perfect if your going to a concert there.

I traveled with my wife & two young children (2yrs & 7mths). We booked one of the Citigate Twin Queen Rooms for two nights. Let me state from the start there was ample room for us all even with the addition of a baby's cot the room was still spacious enough for my 2yr old to play with his toys etc. We stayed on the 12th Floor. Having two Queen Size beds in the same room is not something you get everyday and the beds themselves were very comfortable. The room was very clean on arrival and the weekend that we stayed in Sydney the temps were hitting high 30's low 40's (celcius) and the Air Conditioner worked a treat keeping us all very comfortable. We were provided with alot of extra towels & toiletries etc because of the children (i presume) without having to ask for it. Each bed had 4 pillows on it with a couple of spares in the cupboard as well. Can't say the view itself was fantastic .. overlooking Chinatown but it was ok and i really wasn't expecting much of a view given that this is not located near the harbour at all. But of a night it was nice with all the lights etc. Location is great .. just a couple of minutes walk to Central Railway Station and you are right next door to China Town/Paddys Market & a few minutes walk to Darlling Harbour. One morning we had a single American Breakfast and even that was good value for money. Feeding all four of us!! The foyer/atrium area is very nice and comfortable with a lot of seating areas for family to sit and wait when we checked in/out etc. The reception staff were always pleasant and polite One area i did get caught out on was the fact this hotel does not have car parking (we hired a car for the weekend). There is a car park right next door to the hotel which you can use but it does cost. It cost us an extra $AU23.00 per day (24hrs) which in Sydney is very good (even exceptional) value. You just need to make sure that if you require a car park you let reception know asap to arrange a parking ticket that allows you come in and out of the car parking facility as many times as you like. Another thing that neither my wife nor i have yet enquired about was the fact that the hotel put a $1.00 credit charge on our credit card for no apparent reason? When you first book in they ask for your credit card to take a swipe of it so they can charges things to your credit card in case you use the min-bar or damage the hotel in any way. So looking at our Credit Card statment we realised they hit us up for a dollar .. for what i don't know. We never used the mini-bar and frankly you can't purchase anything for a dollar from the mini-bar anyhow. Not a big deal but if they do that to everyone that stays there that is not a bad windfall when you think about it! If you can find a better value motel in Sydney i'd like to hear about it!!

The location of the hotel is superb for cheap eats in Chinatown and Paddys markets for cheap souveniers and the buses run from the end of the road to Circular Quay etc every few minutes.

Breakfast was great, wonderfully presented and friendly Asian staff always smiling and nothing too much trouble as always. After our experiences the previous evening we asked at reception when our neighbours were checking out and unfortunately it was the same day we were so I asked if they wouldn't mind moving us. They completely understood, as I think there had been some noise at breakfast also. We were moved directly above to the 18th floor, but it seemed we had jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire as the fridge did not work and there was a strange buzzing noise which we established was coming from the airconditioning units on a wall adjacent to our window. So I asked if we could move again, I think patience was wearing a bit thin with the woman on reception but I thought why should we have our trip marred by this, it is four star otherwise we'd have booked in to the Wake Up across the road and paid half the price. The manager came out to speak to me and said it was not a problem at all and he personally checked the new room they were giving us which was across the landing, fair enough we did not have the city view we had before but we had a wonderful sunset view instead.

Yummy quiches, french pastries and beautiful coffee - open 24/7. mini bar is overpriced but there is a conveniance store accross the road. Over all I really enjoyed my stay at the citigate central. I liked that it wasnt in the heart of the city - it was a bit more relaxed and there wasn't swarms of people everywhere.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cPrime Location, Excellent for Families\u201d", "Author": "Sian006", "ReviewID": "UR16649335", "Content": "I have recently returned from the Citigate Central with my partner and also met up with my family over there.

The hotel is situated right by the Paddy's Markets (within 2 minutes walk) and two blocks away is the monorail which will take you to the heart of Darling Harbour as well as around the city centre so you can hop off and on where ever you like (AUD9.00 for an all day pass and family passes are cheaper). From Darling Harbour you can catch a ferry around to the rocks (still very cheap about AUD5.00) and have a look around the rocks markets which are fantastic as well as go under the Sydney Harbour bridge and beside the Sydney Opera House. Also from where you catch the monorail you can catch the tram and go to the fish markets for all you seafood lovers.

The reason I say it is 4 star is it just lacks some of the trappings of luxury required to be at that next level. My overall experience with the staff was generally positive although the desk staff need a little more training as a few of my simple requests confused them pretty quickly but they were at least polite. My only minor negatives are the lifts which are inadequate and at peak times are painfully slow, and the location. It is not a particularly pretty part of Sydney but luckily the nicer surrounds of Darling Harbour & Cockle Bay are only a 10 min stroll away.
