I booked this hotel through priceline.

I got a response mentioning that it will cost $20 more for a non-smoking room as I booked the hotel through priceline. Although I was unhappy (because I never paid extra at any hotel whenever I booked via priceline in different countries), I agreed to pay extra because I don't want my young kids to get exposed to cigarette smoke. I requested them to charge me this extra amount and reserve a non-smoking room. However, when we arrived at the hotel, the clerk at the front desk said that they don't have a non-smoking room available and that the hotel was full. I mentioned about my e-mail communication that took place weeks before. Hotel manager on duty made me look into my e-mail (in the hotel computer in the common area) to prove that my e-mail did communication did occur, and I am telling the truth. When I showed the e-mail printout, she said 'sorry' but since the hotel was full they cannot give a non-smoking room. Clearly the hotel staff did not honor my request. We spent that night in a smoking room that was disgusting. Horrible smell, torn sheets and sofa (I included a picture). None of us could sleep that night. Luckily, a non-smoking room became available next morning and we shifted there by paying $20 per night for the remaining two nights. Hotel is very old, and in bad shape.

The couch cushions were sliding around, difficult to be comfortable without the seat cushion taking off from under you. Then I questioned the cleanliness of the couch, and put a blanket down on it before sitting with my pj's on. The TV was old and had lots of \"snow\", static. I turned the TV to see from the bed, and this only made it worse. I looked at the wiring thinking I had disconnected, and found that there was only 1 bare wire attaching the cable to the TV.

The room we go had 2 queen beds. The bathroom was decent with the exception of the shower. I went to take a shower just after we arrived after traveling all day and I slipped in the shower. The grip on the tub had began to come off. Being March we had to put the heater on in the room and it kept my friend up most of the night because it was quite noisy. I however, was able to sleep through it for some reason. The hallways outside our room could use some updating. The hallways were painted brown and the carpet was outdated. It could be spruced up by simply a coat of white paint and a new carpet. You can park at the hotel for $15/day I would stay at this hotel again. My friend said that she would stay here again as long as it wasn't winter because of the noisy heater.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad place to stay\u201d", "Author": "mmmikeyd", "ReviewID": "UR97586798", "Content": "As someone who's stayed in hostels to 5-star hotels, I have to say, this hotel isn't as bad as some of the reviews would suggest. Understandably, everyone has different prerequisites for a hotel, so hopefully this review will help you decide if this hotel will meet your requirements. Affordability: We got a great deal on hotwire. ($75/night). The prices listed on the website were not much more than that. I would say hotels in downtown/midtown Montreal normally run you between $120-$150, so this was a great deal if you were on a budget, or saving your money for eating out and shopping! Location: It's about a 15 minute walk from the train station, and less than 5 minutes to the restaurants and shops on St.Catherine or the Bell Centre. Cab rides to the Old Montreal, the Casino, the restaurants on St.Laurent and the gay village were all under 15 bucks. There are two d\u00c3\u00a9paneurs (convenience stores) a minute away from the hotel where you can also pick up beer/wine. Rooms: The rooms are not what you might find at the Hilton or Sheraton. The furniture is antique-ish, and the decor is dated. Our room by the elevator was fairly large, but the other rooms we saw when the cleaning lady had the door open seemed pretty standard. Rooms were clean and did not have any strange odours (the carpet in the hallway needs a shampoo however...all that salt from the streets gets dragged into the hotel). The heater/A/C unit made a bit of a clicking sound now and than, but nothing loud or annoying. The TV is an old CRT and you get a decent list of channels (french and english). The king bed was firm but comfortable and did not sag in the middle. I did notice a water stain on the bed skirt, and the bedsheets had a couple of holes in them. But they were clean and the pillows were extremely comfortable! (Also, I did a check for bed bugs, as I do in every hotel, and didn't notice anything, so not to worrry) The bathroom was dated, and was equipped for people with disabilities (high toilet, and grips around the toilet and in the tub). It was bright and clean and never had a problem with hot water or pressure, however, the shower did make a bit of a 'drilling' sound when activated. There is a safe in the closet, and wifi is free when you get a code from the front desk. Service: Staff are fluent in English and French and were always kind, courteous and helpful. Amenities: There was room service available and prices were in the $20 range for a meal. We didn't eat at the hotel, but it's nice that the option was there. Pool is outdoors, and from what I saw, pretty small. The gym is in the basement and also pretty small with some cardio equipment, freeweights and a standard weight machine but it does the trick! The spa is also in the basement. The staff are friendly, but not all are bilingual, which can make conversation a bit awkward. There is a change room, 1 'whirl pool', 1 'jacuzzi' and 2 saunas. It's $20 to use them, but they provide you with a lock and key for the lockers in the changeroom. If you book a spa appointment, the $20 fee is waived. The standard massage was pretty soft. If you're looking for something a little more deep-tissue, definitely ask for it. They have a full range of treatments from relaxation, hot stone, deep tissue and foot, along with all other spa treatments (wax, pedi-/mani, etc). So all in all, was it bad? No. Was it high-style? No. Was it convenient, comfortable and pleasant? Yes, yes and yes.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended at all\u201d", "Author": "carboren", "ReviewID": "UR97158509", "Content": "The bed was hard as a rock.

The room reminds me of an old Best Western with dirty late 1980s carpet and those absurd and tacky bed covers/blankets that never get washed. They even have one of those brown \"foamy\" blankets under the bed cover. Hello, its 2010. Where is the nice clean WASHABLE Duvet Cover and Comforter? Just by looking at the Mattress from the Door I can tell that the bed sags in the middle and is lower on the side of the TV. It's a \"lop sided bed\" - for lack of a better way of describing it. All these hotels have to do is just come through and ROTATE the mattresses on a yearly basis, but you can tell this one hasn't been rotated at all since it was put down over 10 years ago. Aside from the Bed, the Furnishings show good signs of wear and the TV is older than I can imagine. To give the room some credit, the bathroom is clean and the carpet, despite being old, was vacuumed. In short, If you like getting a good nights rest, and old 1980's style sheets, foam blankets, and \"lop sided\" beds aren't your thing.

Caveats - The hotel advertised free WiFi, and gave me the login code, but my laptop could not detect the network, even when I manually entered the SSID. Fortunately somebody living nearby had an unsecured network that I promptly mooched. There are no curtains. It has sheer curtains but I imagine the neighbours can see right through them.

Many hotels now have speedy checkout where all you have to do is call the front desk and tell them you are leaving. At this place I had to wait in line for fifteen minutes to check out, and nearly missed my train leaving the city. I suppose it is my fault for not planning for that. Fair warning: allow an extra 20 minutes to checkout! The outdoor pool is very small... maybe 10x20 feet maximum. Good enough for cooling off, as long as nobody else is there... Breakfast is your standard hotel buffet.

The hotel was easy to find, being right on Rene Levesque. There is an underground parking available for $15/night (has in/out privilege), and just a note to those driving a SUV or truck - the height max is about 6FT., and the ceilings are exposed with pipes/wires in some areas of the parking lot, so be sure to remove any overhead baggages before entering the lot, or they'll fall off your car (or worse, damage the roof). We drove a SUV, and we were just a couple of inches lower than the ceiling, and have never seen a ceiling that hangs so low in a parking lot. Also, look for signs to hotel parking. The lot is shared between the hotel and a condo next door, and we made the mistake of not reading all the signs to hotel parking before heading in the opposite direction. The other side of the lot was dark and creepy, so use caution when entering the lot. Parking spaces closer to the hotel is well lit, although small. Check-in was quick and hotel staff was friendly. Our room faced Rene Levesque, so we heard some light traffic noise at night. If noise is a concern, I would recommend asking for a room facing away from the street. The room was spacious, with a nice sitting area. Bathroom was clean, and they have Neutrogena bath products available. The hotel is a convenient walk to St. Catherine Street (1 block) where there are many restaurants. We had breakfast at the hotel (buffet $11/person), and it has a nice selection with hot & cold food. Overall, this is a great hotel with very reasonable rates. We were impressed with the room and the hotel in general (I am super picky with cleaniness and I was not dissappointed).

The hotel looks like a hybrid between a hotel and residential apartments. It is split in two buildings joined by a tube corridor.

I don't know if it was good value though because the breakfast came with my room package and I didn't know how much extra it costs. (3) The room was large and clean. Here are the bad points: (1) The fire alarm went off one night about 2AM - there was a fire in the electrical room. I was on one of the top floors. When I went out of my room to go down - there was no emergency lighting whatsoever. I could not even find the EXIT/SORTIE light - it was pitch dark and I tried to feel my way around for about two minutes. I decided to feel my way back to my room when I heard footsteps running down the emergency stairs. I did not know where it is until I saw a flash of light - from the person's flashlight which briefly leaked through the emergency door cracks. I headed in that direction and found the exit door, clambered down very slowly (it was total darkness even in the emergency stairs) until I remembered I had a cellphone which lit the way down for me. If the fire was more serious and there was smoke and panic - I might not have made it. My colleague sent a protest email to the hotel management and all we got back was an unsatisfactory apology. (2) My room's wired internet port does not work and neither does my colleague's in another floor. The wireless worked a bit but I had to work on the floor beside the room's door to get an internet signal. Very uncomfortable. (3) There was a heat wave at that time and I was looking forward to a dip in the pool but didn't because the pool was very small, cramped, and unsightly.

They have plain rooms that most of the Trip Advisor reviews talk about but, they also have 5 suites they call \"Admiral Lofts.\" The Lofts have kitchenettes, large Jacuzzi tubs, luxury bedding, and an in-room clothes washer/dryer. The pictures on the website looked impressive so, we booked 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location. Close to restaurants, bars, nightlife, and the metro station. Several restaurants not to miss: Ristorante Ferrari (Italian - amazing fresh pasta and desserts), Upstairs (jazz club with great food), and Vieux Mozart (Austro-Hungarian in the old town area)!!!! Okay, back to the hotel review... The front desk staff was very helpful and relatively easy to communicate with. Don't be intimidated if they start to speak to you in French, they are happy to change to English if you ask (or just look confused). The rooms...well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I have mixed feelings. We learned that the 5 Admiral Lofts were recently built in an area connected to the hotel that used to be a comedy club. This in itself was not a problem but, I was surprised to find all the \"Lofts\" on the 1st floor. I was hoping for a nice city view. Instead, the windows face a walkway (and fence behind the walkway) where people walk back and forth to get to the pool. I can't really fault the hotel for this as it was my assumption that a Loft wouldn't be on the ground floor of a high-rise building. The website didn't say one way or another, and I didn't ask about it in advance...so, I consider this to be my fault for not asking before reserving. However, I wanted to mention it to any others who would find the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lack of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd important. Back to the topic of \"new\" rooms...we were constantly noticing what a terrible job the contractors did. Baseboard not attached to the wall and bowing out in several places, fan/light above the shower hanging by the electrical wire (we had them fix this while we were there), towel racks and other plumbing fixtures very loose...I could go on but, I'll spare you. It mildly bothered us so see such shabby work but, we didn't allow it to ruin our trip! The nice things about the room were the tall ceilings, very large 2 person Jacuzzi tub, comfortable bed, kitchenette, and laundry machines. We love the local markets and like to cook a few meals in our room when traveling so, the kitchenette was important to us. By the way, if you are a \"foodie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- don't miss the Atwater market!!! Also, the in-room coffee pot doubles as an expresso maker and they give you good quality coffee in the lofts. We cannot comment on the restaurant as we never ate there. Breakfast was included in our room price but we never took advantage of that -- we just aren't breakfast people. We did however, have a glass of wine at the bar and enjoyed talking to the bartender, Victor, who made some great restaurant recommendations. All-in-all, we had a fantastic time...we just loved Montreal! This particular hotel was okay. I think I'd probably stay at the Marriott Residence Inn (in the same neighborhood) next time.
