I would suggest talking to the concierge when first checking in as they were very helpful with activities and suggestions plus there is a shuttle that will take you downtown from 4:00pm that leaves every 45 minutes.

The room itself was wonderful! There was a nice sitting area, kitchen, balcony, and even a washer and dryer (although difficult to use). The design of the hallway entrances to the rooms is odd. There is one door in the hallway which leads to a foyer area shared by two rooms. I think this helps to cut down on hallway noise, however when there is a shared area like that and the people in the other room are loud, it is amplified within that space. There is a huge parking problem at this resort and with the new expansion it will become even more troublesome. The parking lot is small and when it's full, people park along the street. It is a major inconvenience to park in the street and have a long walk back to your room, especially if you have luggage. At least they do not charge for parking. The resort is located in an industrial park. It's definitely not the location I expected based on the resort website. However once you are there, the beauty of the place takes over and you forget about the strange location. This is a time share resort and they will try to entice you to listen to their talk. I received a phone call before leaving on our trip to try and get me to sign up for their talk and was approached again at the concierge desk. I politely answered that I wasn't interested and they respected that each time. I did not feel pressured. We did not utilize the pool/hot tub area due to outdoor temperatures in the 50's. We ate at the lobby bar one night as well as the Siena restaurant on location. Please see separate review for this.

It only had delecate cycle working so it took 3 hours for our clothes to dry. 4) THE POOL Heated to a BRISK 55 degrees...needless to say we did not swim in the pool. 5) Only one dvd player... At least the kids could watch a movie before bed time. 6) Little or nothing to do for the kids. THE GOOD 1) They let us have 2 movies instead of just the one we were supposed to have. 2) The hot tube was acutally hot and not 55 degrees also. 3) The rooms are visually beautiful we loved that they had a full kitchen and the decore was great.

Weather was cold, crisp, raining on and off. Parking on the property is limited, but ample street parking near by. You are indeed, far from the maddening crowds of Napa, but thus, we enjoyed the peacefulness of the setting. We had a two bedroom suite in the Merlot building. We enjoyed the daily housekeeping features, heavy sturdy furniture, click on fireplace, our third floor balcony view of the sunsets, and convenient location. It was fun figuring out the deluxe shower w/ the overhead rain forest shower head and the 4 wall jets that make you feel like you're in a human car wash. Another night we relaxed in the in room jacuzzi. We've been to Napa many times, stayed in hotels, bed and breakfast establishments etc. and this was head and shoulders our best stay. (the other timeshares available in Napa pale in comparison). We even sampled some of the wine at the bar of the Meritage Resort and fell in love w// their Old Vine Shiraz. Too bad no gift store to purchase a bottle and the caves were closed for wine tastings by the time we returned from our day trips and not open before we checked out. We visited during the off season, although fully booked, the place did not seem to be over-run with guests. It was nice to have a simple breakfast in the room every morning. Watched movies (DVD's) at night and just relax. The internet was a bit spotty, at times not available at all, but that was just on one day of the six we were there. The concierge gave us some great reccommendations for dining. Gillwoods Cafe, for breakfast. Can't go wrong w/ Celedon, Brix, Mustard Grill, Angele's, and RIstorante Allegria. Disappointed with Rutherford Grill. Not sure at all, why this is rated so highly. The restaurant on site, The Siena was very good. (see other review). surprisingly good pizza.

We were in the Chardonnay building in an end unit which was very desirable for view, quiet and brightness (room 2322). We used our Shell Vacation points and must say this is one of the most attractive Shell properties as far as room layout and decorating. There were several maintenance issues that were annoying (dishwasher did not work properly and it took 3-4 visits from staff), light bulbs burned out, hairdryer kicked out. In all cases response was quick. These things come up and I think many people just don't bother to call and have them corrected, so we seem to have issues wherever we go. One of the best features is the readily available shuttle for pick up and delivery to town, so eating out was a breeze.

I normally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have problems. I was very disappointed with the management of this place. Our rate varied from $200 on Sunday night to $300 on Friday and Saturday night. Not bad in season in Napa. Unfortunately you are in industrial park a ways from Napa. The A/C is extremely loud. This I could live with. My true problem is the management philosophy. The first morning we had no hot water. I called the front desk to let them know. They told me I was not the only one and they could not insure me it would be fixed. Second morning no hot water, called the desk they told me I was not only one and may not be fixed by the next morning. They said they would get some information and me call right back. I waited around, never received a call back. On the way out I bumped into a guy in the elevator who told me he had changed rooms because he had no hot water. That evening when we returned to the hotel I called and spoke to manager and explained everything. He tried to convince me this was the first they new of the problem, and that I was the only one with an issue and he would get it fixed. All hotels log complaints, he new much better then I did they have a problem with their hot water system. They sent a guy up, who was very nice and realized this was just game. They finally admitted they could not fix it. The manager never admitted they have problems with their hot water system that appears to be ongoing. They finally moved us to a room with hot water. When I say my problem is with the management, when you travel you will have a problem from time to time that is unavoidable. Your problem may be something other then hot water but how the management responds to the problem will be consistent. The fact that they feel its fine to charge me $300 a night for a room with no (not a little not warm) hot water is criminal. There are industry standards for items like this. They failed to make any effort to mitigate our inconvenience. I guess I could have went there and begged for some money off, but if that what it takes they can keep it. I should have had the credit card company stop payment but we booked through Orbits so that would be a pain.

The hotel is aware of their major noise issue so they should either not allow check-ins at that hour or be considerate to their presently booked guest and put the late check-ins on the ground floor or at least in a room that doesn't have guests right underneath who they know are TRYING TO SLEEP!

The pillows were NOT comfortable however - two were too large and two others were small and soft. That messed up sleep a bit. Room was quiet but that is probably because there were not many people staying in that section. I heard housekeeping staff in the room next door when we arrived and they were a bit loud. No problems though, quiet all night. We enjoyed a couples massage at the Terra Spa. Spa was spacious, well appointed, and so relaxing, we were the last clients of the day and it was perfect way to unwind.

The best things about the Vino Bello is an on-site bar, on-site tastings, a jacuzzi, BBQs, a kiddie pool and water play area, vineyards on the property, a restaurant on the property, AND a spa. We like to go into towns and explore, but I could see how you literally could have everything you need there, especially if you've had enough tastings for the day and just need to chill out without driving. Also, if you're there with family/kids, it would make it really easy to sneak away and do the spa or a wine tasting without cutting out the kids for long. Just really convenient and a nice place. Also, even the studios have a kitchenette with microwave, sink, and whatever you need. No stove in the studios, but there is a toaster oven that you can use to cook some things in. Also, the bathtub was large and could actually fit those that don't usually fit! Not too far from downtown Napa. Not right in the heart of the wineries, but not a terrible location either.

This made the price of our stay a bit high for a two-day stay but we were generally happy with our stay at the Vino Bello. We stayed in the Chardonnay building, which overlooked the pool and a hillside vineyard just beyond the pool. Our suite offered efficient central heating/air conditioning, a washer and dryer, full-equipped kitchen with complimentary coffee, bottled water and bottle of Muscato from the Trinitas winery. There was one spacious bathroom with an excellent shower with five separate heads (nice!). The living room furniture was very comfortable and the TV channel selection was standard and sufficient. The sofa pullout bed was not terribly comfortable, probably best for younger children, less suitable for older adults and not advisable for the elderly. The master bedroom included a very comfortable bed, and medium soft pillows that felt to be feathered. There was a television, plenty of space and a safe large enough to hold my laptop, large camera, extra digital camera and paperwork. There was also a patio that overlooked the pool and hillside that included four iron cushioned chairs as well as a two seat bench of similar make. This was nice for a morning coffee and afternoon wine after a day of wine touring in Napa. The Hotel restaurant called Siena Restaurant was also very good. We had two very nice breakfasts there twice and evening room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ordering two hamburgers and a cheese ($14.00), pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza ($13.50) and two chocolate deserts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall the price. Everything that came from Siena was very good to excellent, easily recommendable, making it a decent idea just to eat at the Vino Bello instead of going into Napa centre to find good food. Lastly, the service of the hotel was superb. We had a quick check-in and check-out experience and the concierge helped highlight the Napa region, suggest wineries based on our wine preferences and called in our afternoon tasting reservation to Del Dotto as well.

I was not expecting to be THIS diasppointed by this one. This was supposed to be my leisure time after my buisness in sacramento. I wanted to pamper myself in what appeared to be a very nice 4 star hotel. I had nowhere to go, I just wanted to relax and enjoy the sights and spa. The pool and spa are quite beautiful. The spa is actually in the cellar, which is a nice touch. The landscaping is very pretty and it is quite enjoyable to walk in the vineyard. But wow, the room was horrible. It is pretty yes... but that is it. Ist was sooo incredibly noisy. I was woken up at 6h00 by the kids in the other room and the cabinet doors in their kitchenne that just echoed in my room. And at night, untill 11h00 it was the TV. The disposition of the rooms make it so that the kitchennettes are on the other rooms wall. And the TV is on the counter, also on the other person's room wall. Usually in high priced hotels (like the hilton where I had a relly really nice stay), the kitchen is on the corridor wall and the TV on an inner wall or an ouside wall to minimise the noise. I had a terrible time and even cut my trip short because of the paper thin walls. It was HORRIBLE. I just couldn't get my basic sleep, and I am on VACATION, in a luxurious hotel... Unacceptable. I had a room on the third floor on my second night after I complained about the noise in my first room the first night (and a free breakfast---which would have been fine if my noise problem had been solved, but it was not. The same thing happened). It seems all rooms are built the same and all poorly insulated. They were kind enough to change my room to one on the top floor, but it was the EXACT same thing. I could hear everything in the other room: their TV, I could even tell which games they were playing with their kids (Simon says, 50 questions)... and they were not screaming, and I was watching TV or in my bed. I could hear them walk---even on the top floor, and the doors of the kitchenettes every time they closed, as they are directly on the other rooms wall, which makes little sence. Even the comfort inn where I stayed many times as a student has better insulation, and it is a budget hotel. The noise kept going till 11h30 and started again in both rooms around 6h00. I just wanted to sleep till 8h00am and I couldn't even do that. I tried to sleep with my earplugs, but I could still hear the loud bangs of the doors and the kitchen cabinets. This is unacceptable for a hotel of this class. UNACCEPTABLE. I stayed 2 nights and left for the third. I could not stand staying one more night. Also there were a lot of minor mishaps with the room itself: We didn't have a clock-radio, and there was no fan over the mini-oven so the hole room smelled. The little fridge in the first room wasn't even bolted to the counter and kept tipping forward. There were no doors in the lower cabinet where the trash cans were. and no pressure in the shower. AND no vanity to put our things because of the pedestal sink, so we had to put them on the side of the tub. Real fancy. This was the first room. The second was fine except the lack of a fan. There should NOT be so much difference amongst rooms of the same category. First room unacceptable for a luxuary hotel, the other was fine. Customer satisfaction should be important to any hotel. Because I complained the very first night and left after the second because of the same situation, any self respecting hotel would reimburse my hole stay. But as I checked-out and complained again, the hotel says it's in the hands of expedia and expedia in the hands of the hotel... and I am in hell. And now after 4 attempts to reach the unreachable manager during the rest of my vacation ---which took about 2h30 of my time---, expedia tells me the Vino BEllo will only reimburse for the night I didn't use, which was a given... but they really don't seem to care about the quality of my stay, after all I did get a free breakfast and a change of rooms. What am I complaining about. So what if I was constantly hearing my neighbours, so what if I couldn't sleep... This would not have been even a question at most hotels and they would have reimbursed me. Afterall, I paid for a luxury hotel and got only 2 star quality (in my room of couse). Usually, hotels have a satisfaction guarantee, but apparently here they do not. So, even with the horrible stay I had, I could not be reimbursed and I stayed 2 nights in 2 different rooms and left the other night I had reserved. That doesn't sound like a happy customer. It is pretty clear. So, if you're a family with small children and get up at 6h00, this hotel might be ok for you. Just pray all goes as planned... but my advise is: stay away from this horrible hotel....", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, WA", "Title": "\u201cWe were pleasatly surprised!\u201d", "Author": "TJnRea", "ReviewID": "UR111523116", "Content": "The hotel, and its property are beautiful.

The wineries I wanted to visit are located along both of these, and I would have felt limited if i had to drive a long way to get to the other hwy. The rooms are tastefully decorated, very homey, and full of amenities.

I let it go thinking it was an accident and that she was in a hurry to serve others.

It's largely devoid of decent restaurants (ones that aren't overpriced or overhyped), and the town itself seems like something that is in need of a little TLC. What tourists really want is St. Helena, up the road a bit. We made the mistake of staying in Napa for 3 nights, one of which was at this hotel. This isn't really a hotel, though, it's a time share resort that has a hotel facility. The rooms are obviously condos that are being rented out to tourists like myself. No problem there, just letting you know what to expect. The \"resort\" sits in a business park, off of one of the main roads that leads into Napa. It's a mile or two into town, though, so don't think this is \"in town.\" The free bottle of wine they give you upon your arrival is not worth opening. Seriously, pour it down the drain. You're in Napa Valley to drink some of the world's greatest wines, and this swill is an insult to wine. The room is brand new and decorated in what I might call \"suburban traditional American\" with granite countertops and cherry cabinets in the open kitchen area in front of the bed. The sound insulation to the inner hallway is fantastic -- there's the equivalent of an airlock you have to enter to get into the room through two sets of doors. Which shows the builders gave a lot of attention to details like noises from outside your unit. Too bad the builders gave no attention to details of noises *inside* your unit, like the AC unit. With the unit on, it sounded like a little tornado in your room. Great while you're awake -- lousy for a good night's sleep. It was hot while we were in the valley, so we had no choice but to suffer through the constant wakings . Everything else was top notch. So much so that we thought, what the heck, we'd stay here for another 2 nights. No go, though. Even though other websites showed the resort still had rooms available (at a much higher, different rate), the hotel's own block of rooms were all taken. Odd that they couldn't see that they still had unsold inventory available they couldn't make available to us. So we had to move on to the Marriott, which turned out to be a much better value (and just as enjoyable stay, without the tornado AC unit in the room). One last thing... We ate the on-site restaurant after trying to partake of some food in downtown Napa. What a mistake that turned out to be! Needless to say, downtown Napa is something you could avoid and not miss a thing. The resort's on site restaurant turned out to be a pleasant surprise -- outstanding meal served in an elegant but casual atmosphere. The Internet connection in our room was sketchy at best. We expected better for a resort of this caliber, and could do nothing more than try and check our emails.

Okay, now that that's done... This hotel is in a terrible location, it is far away from all of the Napa and Sonoma vineyards, and all of the good restaurants. They built it, and a bunch of industrial buildings popped up around it. When we got all of our bags up to the room, we noticed the fire alarm was making a loud and irritating buzzing/rattling sound. We called the front desk who sent a maintenance person up to look at it. He fiddled around with it for a couple of minutes, and didn't want to take it off the wall for fear of setting off alarms throughout the building. When the noise continued, we asked to have it looked at again while we were out. I don't know if anyone did, but the sound continued until checkout. Also, the air conditioning is extremely noisy, and impossilbe to sleep with it on. Wouldn't be so bad if it actually cooled the room, but it did not!! The walls are paper thin, and I am guessing my neighbor had the A/C on, and couldn't hear his TV, because we could heard it all night!! Used the washer to do some much needed laundry from our long trip. Thought it was great until we tried to dry the clotes and couldn't because the dryer was broken!! Ended up with clothes hanging all over the room. Didn't bother to call that time because I figured they wouldn't do anything about it anyway. Everything about this place is designed poorly as well. They drawers slam into door frames, because it was not thought out. The drawers to put things in are small and akward shaped. The final straw for me came when I went to use the spa facilities, which I heard were amazing. The spa itself was beautiful, and I was impressed by the location. However, my personal property was stolen while I was there, and I was out more than $500. All in all, this was the WORST experience I have had at ANY hotel, let alone what is supposed to be a 4 star hotel!!!

The hotel is oddly located in a small industrial park, about 10 min. outside of Napa, which is fine, because there is a shuttle that goes into town each night, 5pm to 1030 pm on a first come first serve basis.

Not what we had expected. But, really, that's all they can fit into this very small room. They had messed up our reservation by not noting that we requested a room with a king-size bed. So, we ended up with two full-size beds - and the staff were absolutely unhelpful and made promises to move us the next day, but never followed through on their promises. The room is so cramped with two beds that there was no place to sit. How would a timeshare owner possibly stay there for a week? I have no idea where they would sit to read the newspaper or eat a meal. The washing machine in our room dripped very loudly and woke us - and kept us up - for several hours in the middle of the night. The location is quite a drive from most of the wineries - it takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the concentrated winery area. That was an additional drawback. Finally, the rate we paid through Priceline was not a deal - anyone could've gotten the same rate by booking at the Vino Bello site and pre-paying.

The rooms were furnished in the luxury meets comfort style de jour (i.e. granite counters tops, big garden tub, big wood furniture, nice appliances etc). We received a complimentary bottle of wine plus two complimentary bottles of water in the room, the latter of which is necessary after consuming the former. There was no parking fee and ample parking. There is a $15. resort fee, which gives you access to the Meritage pool etc. I only stayed one night, but am guessing the $15 fee is a nightly one. Include this in your budget. In my limited stay, I made it to the Hess winery and the in-house wine tasting room. This hotel is not in the heart of the Napa town square. So if that is the experience you want, this is not your hotel. If you are going to do a day of wine tastings from Vino Bello, you might want to hire a tour company that drives you from winery to winery. I am sure the concierge could provide assistance.

The driver, Tony, was awesome, and gave us great restaurant tips (Allegria, most def check it out). The room was really nice, with a little patio, and check in/out was easy. Even though it's a time share property, the staff did not push us to sit through a boring presentation AT ALL, which was nice. The \"complimentary wine\" is a rose, so keep that in mind if that's not your deal. We brought a bottle of chardonnay and some cheese and crackers, and enjoyed our lovely patio. My only big complaint was the RIDICULOUSLY loud air conditioner. It kicked on every fifteen minutes or so, and seriously sounded like a plane was taking off or something. Like, my mom and I had to literally raise our voices to hear each other! But, overall, this was a beautiful place. We got a deal on expedia....I would DEFINITELY not pay three hundred bucks to stay here, but then again I probably wouldn't pay that much to stay anywhere.

This resort located in a industrial area sits on the same grounds as the Mertiage Hotel. We had a one bedroom studio which was just perfect for the price ( didn't have the points to book through RCI) and the two of us. The location of the resort is perfect, just off the highway and 4 to 5 miles from downtown Napa. You have to visit the downtown area - Allegria - Restaurant was the best. I mean the very best. The food and service was top notch - went there on our first day of arrival - 20th and then we had to celebration our departure with a great meal. Some of the other gotta try restaurants (sorry can't think of the names of them but you have to go and eat there) are right in that little square near the vistors information center, another one that stands out is Piccolini ( good - decent). Also go by the um... riverfront right off of First street near the courthouse and Napa Inn B&B a few other good eats and a delicious sweet shop. Don't go to Buttercreme Bakery! It was a waste of our time and money. Not one of our personal favs - have and MUCH MUCH better and the staff wasn't very friendly. Back to the resort for a minute: The staff at the Mertiage is great - people friendly and the bar area is perfect with great evening entertainment. I am not a wine drinker but my husband drinks socially. We visited some very nice wineries - the most memorable being in St. Helena just about a 30 minute ride from the resort. Our two favorites were The White Hall and Prager ( actually met the owners). They are just off the main highway down the road from each other. Prager was very interesting because the tasting and wineries are in the backyard or basment of the owners summer home? Busy they are but very accommodating. Heading back to the resort is a restaurant called The Mustard. Fine to California Casual dining. nice prices and the food looked very good but the wait was 25 minutes and we had, had too much to sip so we needed food ASAP (LOL). I mean a day full of sipping can take its toll. Anyway, back at the resort there is a sufficient fitness center to meet your cardo needs and the pool and jaguzzi was great. This resort doesn't have a restaurant on site so you share with the Mertiage which is maybe 20 steps away. The food was always excellent. I hope this write up helps and if you have any further questions please ask. Oh.... evenings require a lite sweater or jacket.

We always stay a couple of nights at our favorite resort in the world, The Carneros Inn and save it for the last two nights of our trip. If you've never stayed at The Carneros Inn, and want the ultimate relaxation and top-rated guest experience and can afford the over $350 per night price tag, then please skip past the Vino Bello Resort and head over on Hwy. 121 to The Carneros Inn. You won't be disappointed. My wife can usually only afford two nights at The Carneros Inn and always spend a couple of nights testing out other resorts. For us, the experience at Vino Bello was just ok. Vino Bello gave us a room in their Chardonnay building which happens to be their Shell vacation ownership rooms. The toaster over was broken, their was a large stain on the carpet, most likely wine, and the toilet paper holder was broken. The couple next door to us on the 3rd floor had their TV on and we could hear every word of what they were watching. I had to turn our TV on to drown out the noise. Another worry is that the ice machine is located on the first floor outside of the secure entrance. It is in a back service corridor which is a bit odd place to put it for your guests to find. Also, we don't have kids, however I would feel uneasy sending my child to get ice when you have to go outside of the hotel building and the door lock behind you. Also there was cigarette butts at the base of the ice machine which tells possibly the employees are using this area as a smoking lounge. Be careful when asking the concierge in the main check-in building for a list of nearby restaurants, they don't have one, which is very odd, however they will start to recommend many in the Napa valley which they partner and use the list to sell you into joining them for a 90 minute presentation for selling their Shell Vacation Resort ownership to you. All in all, we will continue to search for other resorts and always get that wonderful feeling when we head down the road to The Carneros Inn for a couple of incredible days and nights of bliss. Please check out their website if you don't believe me. www.thecarnerosinn.com. By the way, this year they added two Audi A8 cars to their cottage resort and they use them to shuttle their guests around the property. The only reason I used their Audi A8 service was due to the extreme rain that was falling throughout our stay. Trust me, if you can afford the extra money then head down the road.

There are currently three bldgs. with the fourth one in current construction. They are all within feets of each other so parking was never an issue. I knew going in that this was a timeshare company and was prepared to say \"no\" when they asked if we would like to attend a meeting. To my surprise, they never asked. That was a complete joy knowing that I didn't have to deal with that. The room were spacious and very comfortable. The jacuzzi tub was nice after a long day of wine tasting and the shower had vishay shower heads which was also nice.

We were staying at Vino Bello as part of an offer from Shell Vacation Club. Check in was a breeze and we made our way to the room. It was a one bedroom with two (double or queen) beds, we preferred a king. We called the front desk and they said they had one King room available and would send someone over to give us a new key. That took over a half hour of us sitting in the room / standing in the hallway not wanting to mess up a room that we were not going to be staying in. The King room was wonderful - I guess you'd call it a mini-suite. It had beautiful decor and a kitchenette. My only complaint about the room was that the kitchenette took the whole wall in front of the bed and the TV was off to the right. There was no dresser for clothes only some small drawers in the kitchen area. Our kitchen sink was broken, the faucet was just laying there. We didn't need to use it or we would have called. We were only staying 2 nights. Every day we had 2 complimentary bottles of water and two sodas plus a bottle of wine on the first day. That was a very nice touch. The grounds at the resort were manicured and well taken care of. The hotel lobby and dining areas were very pretty. We did not eat at the hotel. For those interested and who happen to be on the same plan with Shell Vacation Club, the presentation was smooth. It was scheduled to be 90 minutes and it was not one minute over that. We received our free gift and were on our way. Check out was also no problem. My only issue with this resort is not a complaint about the resort.

The resort is adding a building so there was construction noise all day and our room was right next to a noisy elevator. The \"concierge\" seemed very friendly when we arrived but it turned out he was trying to sell us on their pre-paid vacation plan so he's not really a concierge. Seems a little misleading to make the salesman seem like a concierge. He did give us a couple of tips but other than that he talked a lot about their plan and tried to get us to sit in on their 90-minute presentation. We just wanted to stay at a hotel and enjoy Napa so this sales pitch was a little annoying. Fortunately he left us alone after the first day. Vino Bello is in the very south part of Napa Valley and to enjoy the wineries you have to drive quite a ways north through the town of Napa which was a pain. Next time we'll definitely stay at a place farther north. The towns of Yountville, St. Helena and Calistoga are very charming, unlike Napa. The complaints about the room are minor: Not enough wastebaskets, stiff and scratchy bathrobes, WAY too many light switches (it was always hard to tell which light the switch was for) and not enough channels on the TV (this from my husband, of course). Plus the DVD player didn't work right and we didn't seem to have a remote for it. We would have liked to have had a dresser and second nightstand in the bedroom - we had to put our clothes in the front hall closet which was a little strange. They do have a bottle of wine and water in the refrigerator when you get there which was nice. We got mints and a new bottle of water each evening.

Let me just say that the rooms are very nice, just as you would hope them to be and more.. I would say that this is where it ended for me, as we pulled up we noticed cars along the road far away from the resort, after we checked in I asked about where to park and was told \"where ever you can\", we had to park about a 3 min walk away from the resort IN THE RAIN because there was NO parking anywhere in the parking lot.. we even left for dinner and came back and tryed again and still no parking.. I didnt understand this because the resort didnt seem to have many people around, just ALOT of cars.. this was VERY disappointing and happened right off the bat.. another major disappointment was that this stay was for our anniversary and I had put in the comments when I made reservations on line that I really wanted a bottle of champagne to be in the room when we arrived, I also put in there to call me if there were any problems with this request and never heard from them.. so i called a day or two before the stay to make sure this was possible and the girl I talked to assured me this was no problem and it was in the notes on the reservations.. we arrived an hour AFTER check in time and when we got to the room there was no champagne.. MAJOR disappointment especially after all the effort on my part for such a simple request.. The fire place in our room didnt work right at all, you turn it on and it stays on for about 5 min, shuts off and re lights with a loud boom ever 5 min for about 20 min then just shuts off.. from there we went to turn on the tv in the main room and found that the batteries in the remote were dead.. room service was fast and reliable but I was a little un happy when you are charged a 18% service fee on the total of the order and are expected to give a tip, so really the items you buy are about 35-40% more that listed, I dont feel that this is fare, but its just my opinion.. and after we ate we left the dishes on the counter for one night and woke to ants all over the kitchen... I really dont mean to bash this place I just thought that for the money you shouldnt have to deal with these things.. the Rooms are VERY NICE!

I contacted the hotel management, and was finally told that nothing would be done at all - period because my room had been pre-paid on Hotels.com.

It's funny reading other reviews...there is just no satisfying some people! Our overall experience was great; we thought the room was fabulous (we had a suite)-perfect for anyone planning to stay more than a few days (full refrigerator, full kitchen, living room, laundry, etc.). The decorating was tasteful and \"homey\" and there was plenty of space to unwind. I'd say that the only room which was \"tight\" was the bedroom, but only so because of the dresser (which is VERY nice to have, as I tend to like to unpack, no matter HOW long we're staying!) took up some of the space. We took advantage of booking our stay online directly from the Shell Vacations site and received a $75 \"resort credit\" for doing so. This credit can be applied towards the spa and/or the restaurant, Siena, located in the Meritage. On the second night of our stay we decided to take advantage of the restaurant so we could use our credit. We opted to sit outside next to the really warm propane fire pit! I would agree with what some others have said about the restaurant...the food was very good, however, we waited EXTREMELY long for our meals (close to 40 minutes!). Fortunately we did each have a glass of wine to enjoy while we waited, which the restaurant/server kindly \"treated\" us to for our patience. We probably would have tried dessert, but were concerned about how long it would have taken (at that point it was close to 10:00 p.m.) I would also agree that the wine list was somewhat pricey, and frustrating that Siena was charging MORE for the same wines which they serve in their cave/tasting room! The pool was gorgeous, although we didn't find much time to enjoy it. Another disappointment was the fact that the jacuzzi was out of service during our stay (we could have walked over to the Meritage but the jacuzzi was a popular place there!), and I very much enjoy unwinding in the jacuzzi after a long day of tasting. Oh well. I also took advantage of the fitness center during our stay. Although small, it was probably adequately sized for the size of the resort. When I was there, there were 3 other people working out (they had 2 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, and 2 bicycles) and we were all very comfortable. (It did get HOT in there...not sure if we could have turned up the air or something...) I typically run outside when I'm at home, but, since the resort is located within a corporate park, it wasn't a terribly scenic place for a run. Through talking to some locals at the wineries, we understand that there are plans for many more wineries within the vicinity of Vino Bello, which would be great. We didn't mind the drive into downtown Napa, it was a very quick ride and not an inconvenience at all (we had a rental car). The noise: no complaints. Perhaps the air conditioner was a little loud when it kicked on and you were watching TV, but I'm only remembering that now since reading other reviews (i.e. it didn't bother me while we were there). The only other time we heard people moving about was in the morning as everyone was going up/downstairs and heading to that day's destinations. Again, no problem. We would stay here again, and I think it's fabulous that, upon return home from our stay, we received an email from the resort encouraging us to post our reviews.

We told her we weren't interested and she continued to pursue. At this point, we had no room, no indication of when we'd get in the room, and a woman trying to make us go to a time share presentation for a hotel we were treated badly at. This was overall an incredibly disappointing experience and I'd recommend AGAINST going to this hotel. In addition, it is in a commercial office park area and lacks the charm of Napa.

The pool and Jacuszzi was very nice, there is one for each building, so never too crowded, and the pool towels were a nice plus.

It was extremely comfortable, and quite soft; a good way to relax. The hot tub/pool area was also quite nice. I enjoyed the size of the tub, as well as the fact that there were BBQ grills for guests to use. Now for the not so good: The location of the resort is pretty bad, looking out over a corporate office park instead of vines and valley like many other Napa Resorts that cost the same amount per night. Also, the overall construction of the hotel was pretty low. The walls and ceilings were quite thin, allowing nose from rooms around you to leak in quite easily. We unfortunately happened to get put in a room right next to a family with young children who didn't like to sleep...not good. When we called the front desk to switch, they were not amenable to the request, saying that they were totally full and then hanging up on us. After that, the rest of our customer service experience was pretty poor. When we called to have some missing items brought to our room, it took them 25 minutes and 2 further calls to bring them to us. The concierge was very inattentive, paying more attention to the older guests, as we were one of the youngest couples there. Finally, the same was true of the wait staff at the bar and the restaurant. Both times, our waiter forgot about us more than once. We just felt like we were being overlooked.

We paid $270 for one night hotel in Napa on Priceline and the room rate is $249 without Priceline and tax. Furthermore, the hotel is located on the Other Side of the Bridge, far away from everything. Upon obtaining the name of the hotel I went to their website and was informed that the hotel is under construction. I am taking this up with Priceline, since they should not refer people to hotels with construction without FIRST informing them. I called three times to the hotel and they could not find my reservation. They finally called me at 6pm on the arrival day and told me that they found it. I was told over the telephone that I could bring my 13 year old daughter to the spa. We went early that morning and I was told that no children are allowed. The air conditioning in the room was like an airplane taking off every 10 minutes. This occurred all night long!!. We were able to hear the loud family upstairs until 1am and again in the morning. They had a child who ran back and forth throwing himself/herself on the floor. Big Booms. The maintenance at this hotel is horrible; the bathroom vent is clogged with dust hanging from it. We even had the room service man listen to the A/c and he jumped back when the a/c made the noise while he was delivering the breakfast. I contacted the Asst. Manager in the morning and asked him to come to witness the situation; however, he told me that he would speak to the Manager during the week about giving me a night stay in the future. I called and left messages for him for 2 weeks and got no response. I spoke to another Manager who told me that he would check into it and get back to me, but never did. I finally called the general manager and was told that these issues do not warrant an offer other than crediting me for $19 room service charge! He said that they can't do anything about the noise from other rooms and they might have had a repair man come to the room to service the air conditioning in the middle of the night. This is a hotel room, can you imagine a repairman working on your air conditioning unit in your room while you are in your PJ's in the middle of the night and having all of the dust from opening the unit on top of your Bed!! I told him that being in the Residential Property Management Business that I am aware that most places do not even have maintenance personnel on duty during the night and only respond to sprinkler and fire emergencies. My husband does this work and I am a property Manager. The Gen Mgr. agreed to this statement, but didn't comment as to why his Assistant Manager didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even come to the room in the morning to review the a/c situation and the noise from the other room. I paid almost $300 for a 4 Star Hotel in a horrible location and this is what they offer. After researching this hotel, I see that this hotel is all over San Francisco as a Time Share Offer. Get 2 nights at VINO BELLA for a cheap rate to view their timeshare. I have been to numerous four star hotels across this country and this is the WORST and management does nothing about your complaint. After being persistent the Gen Mgr offered me a $75 discount to come back during a week night. My rate would be $150 plus tax to spend another night at a resort??? offering horrible customer service, horrible accommodations and has severe maintenance issues. You can stay at the FAIRMONT hotel in Napa for another $50 and be at a RESORT with Great Services and Great Management OR any other four star hotel which will be more than worth the money. I will never again stay at Vino Bello (See other bad reviews of this hotel/resort online! OR the Meritage hotel their next door sister hotel (also has some bad reviews- same management) I am a member of the Preferred Hotel Group and will be forwarding the same comments to them, even though the Gen Mgr told me that their Preferred Status is only for Meritage and not Vino Bello.

On the other hand, if you're a fan of high pressured timeshare sales and noise-passive walls then boy are you in for a treat! The Vino Bello rooms were designed poorly with large empty foyers between rooms. Each time your neighbor comes or goes, you hear the echoing boom of two doors shutting. The walls are so paper-thin that you hear the footsteps above and the bedroom olympics from the room adjacent to yours (and vice-versa). Even though the property lists within the city limits of Napa, it's actually 3 miles south of Downtown Napa in a business park. There is nothing romantic or Napa-esque about the location. In fact, you're actually between American Canyon and Napa Proper. Their concierge is actually their first point of attack for their timeshare sales. The 90 minute presentation quickly became 180... one no-pressure sales person became three high-pressure sales people. In hindsight, I'd forego the $100 wine dollars and keep my 3 hours of time. They also tell you that you'll get free wine tastings from a list of wineries. Many of them didn't even recognize the voucher. My last complaint is an unauthorized \"resort fee\" charge on my credit card. I booked with Priceline and it was supposed to be all inclusive. The resort manager, Robert, later admitted it was an issue that was supposed to be worked out between Vino Bello and Priceline (but had failed to do so when I was a guest). He made no attempt to credit the charge. In fact, upon check-in and check-out there was no mention of this charge. Talk about being sneaky... and this coming from a supposed 4 star resort?! The $30 charge wouldn't be as big of a deal if they were up front about it, but they weren't. It was their fault in not clarifying who would be responsible for the charges with Priceline. They shouldn't hold their guests accountable for their contract negotiation shortcomings. On the plus side, it is a new resort. It is very clean and the common area for The Meritage Resort (their sister property) is very inviting. The rooms are large and the kitchenettes are well-stocked with many dining amenities. The furniture in the rooms are sturdy and quite comfortable. There's also a washer and dryer in each room which is a nice bonus. If you're able to get the room for ~$150 to $200 on Priceline and are a heavy sleeper, then I say go for it. Otherwise, I'd pay a little more and stay at another property.

After staying here I thought this room was such a bargain. Second, it's so well furnished, clean and up-to-date.

The pool and jacuzzi at both the Vino Bello and the Meritage (which is right next door) are both really nice and clean. Everything around is well upkept and modern.

At the end of the day, my girlfriend and I couldn't stop raving about how we would love to live in an apartment just like this place. It's so perfect in so many ways. The square footage of our suite was incredible and such an absolute steal for what we actually paid. The shower and bathroom is huge, and the bed is immensely comfortable. I heard some people complain about the location, but I actually liked it. Everything is close (provided you have a car). We actually only had to drive 5 minutes to the nearest Raley's to pick up some food to cook. Also, given that the resort is in the middle of a corporate area, it's extremely quiet and secluded.

We were very disappointed in the service on 2 occassions. 1st, we were expecting an overnight UPS package, we notified the Front Desk twice to let them know to expect it. Per their own policy, it should be delivered to our room w/in 1/2 hr of their receipt. At the time of our 2nd call, the resort had already signed for the package (we didn't know at the time). At the end of the day, when we returned to our room, no package. We called and told them it had been signed for (looked it up ourselves on the UPS website). They then discovered that the sales office signed for it, didn't notify anyone of its arrival and it is sitting on someone's desk and we have to wait until morning to get it. I thought this was unacceptable and that they didn't even try to remedy the situation. Long story short, I went personally to the front desk, told them about my disappointment, apparently, they did have the key and they were able to access the package and we got it that night. I don't think a guest should have to walk down there to ask this as they obviously didn't even try the first time. Someone paid good money to have a package overnighted to a guest (the package was clearly addressed with our guest room #) and someone just decides to let it sit and not deliver it?? 2nd issue, we called the concierge to find out where the nearest urgent care or emergency room was, we thought we were going to need it for our son. We ended up just leaving our vacation a day early instead to go to our local doctor, but we never heard back from ANYONE regarding our question.

The resort fee covers the cost of the bottle of wine they put in the room, soda, and water. We were only there 1 night but helped ourselves to all the water, soda, and wine, so it seemed fair for the 20 dollars. The room was very nice. How we got this one for $85 surprised me, but hey - we took it! This wasn't a suite, but it also wasn't a standard room. It had a nice deep tub, mini fridge, microwave, sink, toaster oven, balcony, washer, dryer, and VERY comfortable king bed. They also had a dvd library which we took advantage of. The decor was traditional tuscanny style and was very tasteful. The concierge was very helpful, as was the front desk. The concierge showed us stuff to do and gave us some great info/savings brochures. The grounds were nice. I took advantage of the 24 hour work out room. The pools were heated and there were bbq's outside of each building. Our room had dishes and utensils, so it seems like a great stay for a family in one of the jr. suites or suites. I would recommend using the BBQ if staying for a while just to save some money. The restaurant was expensive but not THAT bad (we were at a resort, afterall). It was our first time trying Kobe Beef - and it was DELICIOUS!! I think we paid $28 for the steak (that was a la carte - no side dishes) The pizza was enough for 2 people and only cost 12 bucks. I'm used to spending 60 bucks at a holiday inn and getting the usual crap bed and cardboard towels. To stay here for $120 after all was said and done was amazing! I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you were to book at full rate, (just cause I'm cheap) but if you get this place discounted, it's totally worth it. It was a nice little splurge for my husband and I. The vineyard around the hotel is nice, and you definitely feel safe. I think we had to use our room key 3 times before actually getting to our room door. The only complaint I have is the bartender at The Cave. It is the little bar where you can go wine tasting. She ignored us from the get go. I'm not sure if she could tell we didn't belong there or what, but she only came by to give us our wine and our check. She was more than happy to converse with the other patrons - about the beach, directions, night life, wine, friends, clothes, etc...but with us, it was like we were lepers. That didn't make us enjoy our wine tasting experience very much. (b/c while she was yapping, our glasses were empty). I'm sure at least the others liked their experience better ;) The location is definitely not as nice as some, it is smack in the middle of a business complex, but the amenities on the property more than made up for the location. If I could get this room for the same price again, I would probably stay here next time. But if I could get a quaint B&B for the same price I would probably do that instead, just because I think it would ft the whole Napa Valley Feel that I was looking for a little better.

We were aware of the additional approx. $20 resort fee as well. The Vino Bello Resort is a nice place to stay, but I would certainly not call it 4-Star. Our room: On the plus side, it did have a refirgerator; wet bar; and included bottled water, soda, and a bottle of wine. On the negative side, it was pretty narrow and not that big, the heating system was VERY loud (when it turned on it would wake us up). Further, the walls are VERY thin, as we were woken up by a neighbor's TV early one morning, and could hear a late-night conversation of another neighbor. Also, the Vino Bello rooms are an outside walk away from the main Meritage Resort area (which presumably are more expensive). Amenities: We did not find the Concierge or front-desk very helpful (even for some simple direction advice). The attached restaurant has a very good breakfast. The workout facilities were OK and the wine-tasting appetiers are really just cheese and crackers. There was also a billing mix-up that has yet to be resolved -- but I don't know it that is the hotel's fault or hotwire's fault. Location: The resort is located in a corporate/industrial area, not very close to any vinyards. So the views aren't that wonderful; however, you can get to the Silverado Trail and Napa proper pretty easily (much quicker than if your staying in Carneros or Sonoma). Overall, we probably wouldn't stay here again. They claim it's a 4-star. The price we paid was about what you'd pay for a 3-star (or 3.5). And we felt it was actually a 3-star (or 2.5).

Perfect if you are exploring Napa and surrounding area because after a long day of wine tasting, its nice to relax in a beautifully appointed, fully equiped new 'apartment suite. If youre like us, it was nice to relax in an 'at home' setting - fireplace, balcony, gorgeous kitchen -after a wonderful day @ the wineries. The 24 hr room service was prompt and very good. Spa was gorgeous (and expensive). Some reviewers mention highway proximity as an issue but we found it convenient (this property in a 'corporate park' but still very nice. Therefore, higher level floors and pool view might be best.) Check your room folder for specials that are not apparent. For example, we later discovered we could have added services to our massages for no charge but did not know (nor were told). DVDs & CDs are available @ the front desk but we only learned that from these reviews, not the hotel. The drawback here (altho experienced travelers will navigate these issues) is that the staff is woefully undertrained or seems in some instances, simply untrained in hospitality. Nice and willing, but totally clueless. This was generally the case and most especially at the valet stand where the young man greated us with 'huh?' when we pulled up and asked whether we should park or leave the car w/him. Maybe it was because he was chewing his lunch loudly. He never asked if we were with the hotel or condo and consequently, we removed our own luggage - he took the car. We needed to retrieve the car which could not be located (10 minutes later), redeposit our luggage and drive back over to the condo section. A bit annoying after a long,east coast flight and drive up from San Fran. On the way up, we stopped for lunch @ Horizons in Sausilito (wonderful) and then a little detour thru Muir Woods - nice to see but not much there if youre not awed by nature. (Trees are over 1000 years old!). As for Napa, do stop for breakfast @ Sarafornia on Lincoln Ave in Calistoga for excellent, home made inexpensive fare. We were unimpressed by Rutherford Grille for lunch/dinner tho everyone seems to recommend it - expensive, very limited wine list and smelled like kenny rogers roasters restaurant. St. Helena Olive Oil Company was a treat to break up the wine tastings (altho the pesto we purchased was confiscated @ the airport because we did not pack it in our checked luggage.) You can taste everything in the store thats for sale. There are hundreds of wineries and you should sample several but we found the 'touristy' ones just fine for first time visitors. (check out many wine country internet coupon specials for wine tastings, etc.) We especially liked Sterling (for the tram ride) and Mondavi (for the tour and grounds) and our favorite was Domaine Carneros where on a lovely terrace - my husband sipped pinot noirs while i tasted the sparkling wines. Don Giovanis (napa?) looked very good for dinner but after a second long winery day - we were again just as happy to have room service instead and watch a movie on one of the two flat screens in the condo. We left on the third day back to San Fran. Check out both Franciscan's on the wharf which even tho in the center of touristville- was excellent for crab and had great decor/views...and Vincentos (on Taylor?) in financial district for dinner. We also had a great time on Adventure Cats sunset bay sail. Great crew! Ecclectic, culturally mixed crowd of passengers made a fun/interesting 1.5 hrs. w/beautiful photo ops. Lunch @ Left at Albequerqe on Union in Pacific Heights was a wonderful surprise find - outstanding, inexpensive fresh food w/cafe seating.

She didn't know where in the complex my room was, (or she was embarrassed of the room she had assigned.) Next, after being shoved off from the front desk to the \"concierge,\" to get a local area map when the \"concierge\" lady finally stopped talking to her friend or co-worker, she immediately when into her routine of trying to bribe me into submitting to a sales pitch to buy into the time-share. After telling her I was only there for a couple of days and didn't care to spend my vacation time listening to a sales pitch, I was treated rudely. I had to get her attention again to ask for a local map, and was told to look in the local magazine. Fifth, upon entering my room it was small but well appointed. I opened the curtains on the patio to see the back of the time-share sales office. Temporary office trailers, with big loud air conditioning units, what a view! Of course I called the front desk to see if they had a better room available, luckily they did, no offers to have a bellman move us, just a come switch out your keys (the office is at least a football field away from the condos.) Our new room had a view of the pool, which was better, but when sitting on our patio we got to hear the sales pitch over and over again, as the sales team herded prospective buyers through the complex. Our next experience with Vino Bello is one of an overall design flaw, noise. The paths and walkways around the complex are concrete, and brick. Since the Vino Bello are not in close proximity with the restaurant, and other utilities used to service there guests, the staff has to push hard wheeled carts around on these paths, \" KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNCK, dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNK. You get the picture right. These noises started around 7 am, right when you feel like getting up, after wine tasting the day before. Overall, I would not stay here again. Mainly, because of the time-share deal, and the ignorance of the designer's choices in either the materials used to make the pathways or the choice of having the staff use the same walkways as patrons to service the rooms.

While I found many of the complaints to be valid I do not feel that they are egregious enough to prevent me from giving this resort a positive review. I will address each of the complaints individually. 1. The resort is in an office park. This is true, however, one would not know you were in an office park while on the premises. While on resort grounds you cannot see any office buildings nor experience any office traffic; you only know you're in an office park by using one of the two street entrances to the resort. I stayed Monday through Friday and did not have any office park experience while there. 2. The resort is close to a highway. This also is true; the resort is nestled in the \"crotch\" of two main roads. However, while you can see the road from the parking lot you are not close enough to hear any traffic from the roads or let the existence of the road detract from the otherwise fine view of the fields. 3. The room keys stop working. Absolutely. On the third day our key cards mysteriously stopped working. Although I was on the lookout for this potential problem I neglected to tell my girlfriend who was greatly inconvenienced. She was carrying packages to our room (while I was stumbling around the wine cave) and she had to go to the main hotel building (The Meritage) in order to get new keys made. A bellhop blamed the inexperience of the front desk staff but I think there is a greater problem here since this is a complaint many of the reviewers had. 4. You can hear doors slamming. Dead on. This is perhaps the biggest complaint I have about this resort. While we did not hear noises from other rooms (voices, tv, sounds of intimacy, etc.) we constantly heard doors closing. This was very irritating - especially at night. 5. Inexperienced staff. I am unsure about this one. Although one staff member said it about other staff members (as I discussed above) I cannot definitively state that the staff is inexperienced. The only example of incompetence (not necessarily inexperience) was that after we ordered room service (one sandwich) they forgot we ever ordered it. When we called to see where the sandwich was they confessed and then delivered the sandwich promptly - and gratis. 6. Dearth of close parking. This is also true. One night we had to park on the other end of the resort as all of the spots immediately adjacent to the resort buildings were taken. As we are relatively young and healthy this did not pose much of a problem for us; just an inconvenience. 7. The resort is far from the city center and wineries. This is true. However, it's not like you walk from one attraction to another in Napa - you have to drive . Since you're driving anyway, an extra 3-5 minutes in the car won't kill you. 8. The concierge will try to sell you a timeshare. True. After speaking with the concierge for 10 minutes she invited us to a Shell Vacations pitch meeting with the enticement of coupons, etc. However, a quick \"no, thank you\" ended her endeavor. Interestingly, while at a SF Giants game a table of gentlemen from Shell Vacations offered us similar enticements - and even added a few free nights at the Vino Bello - if I were to go to their pitch. I'll add a few last complaints before I address the virtues. The housekeeping staff is overly eager. The housekeepers try to access the room starting at 9AM and then keep coming back every 20-30 minutes either knocking first or just trying to enter with their keys. After this happened the first morning we made sure to hang the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door until we left the room in the morning. However, one morning when we decided to sleep in very late (it happens when you do many wine tastings the day before without availing yourself of the spit bucket) the sign did not dissuade the staff who repeatedly knocked on our door from early morning until we left in the early afternoon. The housekeepers lost out on a nice tip because of this. One last complaint is about checkout time. The reservation I made stated that checkout time was noon. The hotel literature in the room stated it was noon. A sign in the room said it was 11AM. On the morning of checkout I was told by the front desk that it was 11AM; although they graciously gave me a \"late\" checkout at 11:45AM. Reminding them that their own literature gave the time at noon did not give me that extra 15 minutes. Since I am a rebel I checked out at 11:50. Now on to the good points. The rooms are very nice - nice bed and pillows, large bathroom, tub/shower easily accommodated my 6'3\" frame, washer/dryer in every room and the rooms are just nicely appointed. Although I was hoping to get a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite (as did another reviewer) an Acura management outing that took up a large part of the resort seemed to put the kibosh on my hopes of getting a bigger room. The studio was fine - not huge but big enough - but it irked me that we were missing out on a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Oh well. When you check in there are free bottles of water, cans of soda and a bottle of white wine in the refrigerator. It was not until the last day that I realized that they replace the water and soda on a daily basis - I was stupidly buying my own bottled water and soft drinks when I could have had them for free all along. I am unsure if they replace the bottle of wine because I never drank it; but I doubt they do. The outdoor pool and hot tub are fine. The spa is just as expensive as any other hotel - so I didn't try it. The wine cave was nothing more than a bar - nothing fascinating there. The bartender was nice and told me that they expect the vines on the premises to start being productive in a few years. Meanwhile they serve wine from their house brand whose grapes come from other parts of California. Overall, my experience at the Vino Bello resort was fine. It is not a resort that is a destination in and of itself but it is a perfectly nice place to lay your head and go for a quick dip when on a trip visiting wineries. If you can book this place in the area of $200/night you should not pass it up. I predict that in the future it will command much more per night.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orleans, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, bad restaurant\u201d", "Author": "ZorglubWaterloo", "ReviewID": "UR8229825", "Content": "The resort is excellent. Very nice buildings, rooms are brand new and with very nice decoration, including bathroom. We have a studio, it was very big. Swimming pool is excellent, especially for kids, they have some nice games there. Location is not that bad as many reviews say. OK it is behind the highway, but not that close, we were not disturbed by any noise or proximity. The black point is the restaurant, we had 3 breakfasts there, you need to wait for 30 minutes to get 2 pieces of toast and milk for our boy. We complained about that, but nothing from the staff excepted some excuse. I even asked if we had to go to the grocery store to buy the milk for my son's cereals after waiting 20 minutes.

Vino Bello is part of a timeshare plan, but they also rent the condos (studios, one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms) on a nightly busy (which is what we did). Good Points: The condo itself. We stayed in a one-bedroom condo on the second floor. Very nice, spacious, new place. Full-sized kitchen with granite countertops, stainless appliances, dishes/glasses/pans, etc. Large bath with granite countertop, double sinks, large walk-in shower with tumbled marble/stone tile work on two walls and floor, seamless glass on remaining two walls, 5 showerheads (one large rain head and four pulsating bodysprays). Jacuzzi bath tub in stone surround in bedroom (actually in kind of a dressing alcove in bedroom, between room and bathroom). 37\" flat screen TV in living room and 26\" flatscreen TV in bedroom. Large balcony with table and 4 chairs, plus small settee (we lucked out and got a second floor room overlooking the balcony - recommend 2nd floor over 3rd floor as 3rd floor balconies don't have a roof, and the sun can get pretty hot! Bad Points: As mentioned in other reviews, service is definitely a problem. Checked in at 2:30 pm (check in time is 4:00 pm), told room would be expedited and we would be called on cell phone - finally went back to desk at 5:15 pm as never got a call. Turns out room had been ready since 3 pm but the lone front desk agent was too busy to call. Food at Siena was just OK for lunch but highly disappointing for dinner. Because we travelled on our anniversary, I decided that we would be too tired to leave the resort for dinner. Since the dinner menu at Sienna looked good on the website, I booked a table through Open Table, indicating it was our first wedding anniversary. When we arrived at Siena for dinner, it was practically deserted. There was no acknowledgement of our anniversary (no congratulations, offer of dessert or whatever). We were disappointed to find that, rather than the menu posted on the resort's website, we were given the same menu as we were given earlier that day for lunch (while waiting for the room to be ready). My husband's food was just OK while my rotisserie chicken was terrible - very dry - and the tiramisu was also not good. We didn't go back at all the rest of the stay. On third day, key cards didn't work - had to walk to front desk for new ones. On fourth day, I got locked out of room after going to the vending machine (again, key card didn't work) and there was no way to reach my husband (each set of two rooms has a little foyer with a locked foyer door to the hall - no doorbell from hall and no way for my husband to hear me knocking on the foyer door). I wandered throughout the building looking for a house phone to call my husband, but there aren't any. Just as I was about to give up and walk back to the front desk (in another building across the parking lot, at the Meritage Hotel), I tried knocking at the foyer door and luckily my husband had just stepped into the foyer in preparation for looking for me - I had been gone about 20 minutes on what should have been a 5 minute vending machine visit. All in all, I would definitely stay there again - the condo was lovely (though perhaps they overdid the wine decor slightly) and spacious, and the rates were extremely reasonable for Napa. However, I would not eat in Siena again, and we will be checking our key cards constantly to make sure they are continuing to work!", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, Lacks knowledge in Service\u201d", "Author": "Bevis1", "ReviewID": "UR8127921", "Content": "We just returned from a a 4 day stay.

I am an corporate event planner and observed actions or lack of that bring this resort short of being really good. Simple basics being overlooked..

Miraculously, we were assigned the extremely quiet room #1310 at the very end of building 1 on the top floor (well, 3rd floor) facing the pool and we completely enjoyed our stay. As some of the reviews have mentioned, the decor was well done (draping fanning-canopy-like structure over the bed's headboard, coordinated furniture) and the amenities so over-the-top outstanding that one might marvel at how much luxury and comfort can be stuffed into one space. We had a lovely kitchen complete with a dishwasher/microwave/range/refrigerator/cabinets filled with dishes/etc, a washer and dryer, a bathroom the size of a small bedroom, stacks of plush towels, cotton terry bathrobes, a huge oval tub with jet jacuzzi spray action, two flat screen tv's, so many comfortable lushly decorated chairs, a couch with a pull-out bed, extra sheets and pillows, chairs for the bar, a dining room table with chairs, a balcony with patio furniture, a safe for our valuables, and wifi. I was shocked at how clean everything was (no stains(water on wood or rust) or grout problems in the bathroom and kitchen areas) and I actually found the maids and the other workers cordial and rather kind, including one young man carrying a room service tray seemed nice. I do think that some of the staff are very young and perhaps new to the service industry. We liked the pool area and were delighted by how colorfully creative the sprinkler play area was for kids. We used 2 (1ft deep one and the standard one) of the 3 pools in the area and loved the convenience of the clean towels, the abundance of impeccable pretty chaise-lounge chairs and other patio furniture. To reach the pool area, one must pass through either the male or female dressing rooms, both (I'm guessing as I passed through just one) equipped with bathrooms and a shower area. We had problems with 2 of the 3 keys we received for our room. I chatted with someone else on our floor who said that he had 3 bad ones. Also, the wifi didn't work too well and we had to fiddle with our wireless card drivers on our laptops. I did see an RJ45 ethernet socket so perhaps one might use it as a last resort. Local calls and 800 number ones seemed to be free. The Siena restaurant was undergoing some renovations, so they moved it to one of the bigger banquet rooms. Breakfast was buffet-style with ample choices including some interesting choices such as brie cheese, lox, and tiny round pickles attached to pieces of their vine. However, you need to ask the waiter for toast choices, including bagels. In the evenings, they light up the fireplace in the lobby of the also well-decorated main building which is rather nice. There's a spa and a wine cave located near the pool area of the main building too. The resort, the neighboring business park, and the vineyards are all rather new and perhaps far from downtown Napa. So at least at the resort, it'll take some years when there'll be more shaded outdoor areas to sit and other vegetation . The resort offers a shuttle with free service to any location 5 miles or less. There's an Italian restaurant called Villa Romano nearby which serves pretty food. The dryer was noisy and moreover very weak. The way around the problem was to do our laundry during non-sleeping hours and to leave the dryer running for over an hour. I too thought that some of the toiletries like the shampoo and lotion were rather simple as opposed to those offered at for example, the Sonoma Mission Inn. However, we certainly enjoyed our stay despite whatever shortcomings we encountered.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Vino Bello Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d622921-Reviews-Vino_Bello_Resort-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$222 - $394*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">865 Bordeaux Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Napa</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94558</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "622921", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0e/9f/0e9f6ed27a360d81ea374ce200469f1b6large.jpg"}}
