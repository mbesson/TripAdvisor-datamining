The room and bathroom was clean and roomy. The bed is comfy with lots of pillows. The only complaints I have about our stay was that we had several interruptions in our sleep. The alarm clock was not reset from the last guest and went off at 5:30 am, and someone on our floor set off their smoke alarm so all the alarms had to be reset at 2:30 am. The interruption of sleep did not change our opinion of our overall stay. There are several bonus features of staying at this hotel. It is close to area attractions and has the Florida mall attached to the hotel. If you forgot to pack anything for your trip the mall is right there! The hotel and mall both have Starbucks for an early morning breakfast. We are coffee people and were super excited to have our morning Starbucks. The Hotel also has a really fun bar. The bar staff were knowledgeable and friendly. They have a happy hour with buy one get one drinks and apps until 9pm! We had a total of 6 drinks, and two huge apps and with tip spent less than $30!

The one glitch was shortly after I checked in I received a call askeing me how lI liked it, and offering me a free coupon for an appretizer in the hotel restaurant. The staff member at the front desk had no idea what was going on, made a phone call, couldn;t find the cards, and eventually wrote one out by hand. Then I walked over the the restaurant, and they had just closed for lunch. That evening, upon seeing the prices, and the emptiness of the hotel resturant, I decided the free appetizer wasn;t worth it. The rooms are pleasant, and represent good value for the Orlando area. The upkeep is good as well, often a problem with Orlando properties. The Florida Mall was jammed it was a weekend, so it can be plus or a minus, especially since Millennia Mall is close by, and much nicer. The hotel assured me that security was in place, though their hotel is attached to the mall, and also has several meeting rooms on the second floor, allowing a significant amount of public access, more so than many properties. The hotel is attractive. The location, on Orange Blossom Trail, and Sand Lake, means you have to ready to deal with traffic every time you leave the place. But the Turnpike is nearby, as are other through streets that are easier to avoid traffic. Web access was good, cleanliness was good, and it is convenient to many Orlando attractions. It was pleasant because you did not see many families with small children, at least when I was there. it seems remarkably grown-up place for Orlando. On some trips that's the atmosphere you seek. Dining opportunites in the mall, aside from a food court where there are never free tables, are scant. So be prepared to get into the car for dinner. Orange Blossom Trail is not the place to dine, iit;s one of Orlando;'s messiest streets, When a resturant has no customers on a satirday night, my thought was that hotel restuarant, at that price point, wasn;t worth chancing. beds are a bit on the hard side, for those like me, who like soft ones. Linens were nice and fresh. The strong lighting on the poles on the parking lot means you ahve play with drapes a bit to make sure the room is reasonably dark enough to sleep in, but no big deal.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "abbyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR124831333", "Content": "Just returned Afew days ago from Orlando.

While there is a resort fee, the good internet connection itself is worth it. We also enjoyed the serenity of no doors slamming or kids running and screaming in the halls. We ate only one meal in the hotel and it was decent, but with the mall and the food court literally steps away, it makes dining very convenient, especially if you have a party with different cravings. The hotel is surrounded by lots of stores and restaurants and we're tempted to try their thanksgiving/black friday special. The location is also conveniently located by the Florida turnpike and the airport expressway and if you want to shoot over to I-4 and then the parks, it's only a 20-30 minute drive.

Prices are very similar and there are hidden charges of 11 dollars per day that they can't even explain. when we arrived we were told that it was not possible to have the rooms next to each other, when we had the bookings with that request. Additionally we were explained that there was an additional 11 per night which included the self parking, when in reality the self parking is parking in the mall. The room was very two stars nothing special, small but clean. Beds were small at least, but again nothing as the pillow tops in the Hilton beds. We requested late check out as our flight was delayed and were told there was no way to get it as the hotel was full... Not even for one room.

It is right inside the Florida Mall, which offers the convenience of access to a pretty good shopping center (Apple Store inside!), a Starbucks and general goods store downstairs, access to various restaurants, etc. It has all the necessary conveniences (flat screen TV, in-room fridge, OK bed, good AC, etc.) without being \"wow\" luxurious, and its pricing is very good. Above all, it's practical. For example it has great WiFi, ample parking (it's part of a mall), and for everything it charges you $11 per night in \"service fees\". Much better than other hotels that are charging $15 just for WiFi, and $30 for parking. I appreciated the in-shower shampoo/conditioner dispenser. Not pretty, but much better from an ecological sense than those tiny plastic bottles that are probably fast filling up our Nation's landfills.

Of course, they only tell you that after you sign in and go to the room and discover your room isn't what you expect. Then, if you attempt to leave, they inform you that you will still be charged since they have a 72 hour cancellation policy. This was a most frustrating experience that happened to me. The hotel itself is \"ok\". It's really on par with a \"motel\". It is no frills--there are no amenities (soaps, q-tips, lotions, etc.) in the rooms. Mounted on the wall within the shower stall is shampoo and body soap. We asked about getting some bar soap, and (I kid you not) were told that they are only available for \"VIP Guests\". Whoops....I guess we didn't rate. O.k. so room wasn't what was promised, no amenities....Breakfast buffet is o.k.--typical hotel buffet at $17.00--made to order eggs, with basic continental breakfast spread and bacon/sausage/oatmeal, etc. Seemed pricey for Orlando, yet inexpensive compared to a \"big city\" where this type of spread typically costs upwards of $20. Lunch at the hotel restaurant, however, was low quality. Service was slow, food was bad. I ordered a burger--medium rare--it came out burnt with not a hint of pink and no juice whatsoever. During our meal they were rolling restaurant furniture past us--they were setting up a new area. You'd think they could do it during \"off hours\" when they didn't have guests--but this place doesn't really value customer service or think about how things impact their guests (at least not their \"Non-VIP Guests\"). Great part of the hotel is that it is connected with a substantial shopping mall. Lots of great stores--good walking. Don't need to go outdoors to get to it--it's literally connected. If you like to shop, this is a good thing. Nice \"walking\" for exercise, too. Sadly, the mall isn't open early enough for breakfast--that would be the best. I had to go to this hotel for a work meeting. Given my experience, I would not choose it again. I've stayed at other places in Orlando that are nicer, less expensive, and that offer basic amenities.

Let me just start off by saying I'm not too picky when it comes to hotels. I've stayed in some nice hotels and others not so nice. I got a really good rate for this hotel at $72 a night. However this did not include a $11.00 a night service charge. I'm not sure what this is for. I mean its not like they included breakfast. That was $13.95 a person!! I knew this when I booked it but I thought the nice room would make up for it. I was wrong. When I first got there I had to change rooms because I could literally hear everything that was going on in the room next to me. We could hear the TV, phone ringing, and dog barking. Keep in mind this was not early, it was past 12:00am. So we changed to another room with 2 double beds. The sheets did not fit the bed properly as they were too tight and would come off. The room also seemed dated with ugly carpet. The bed was not very comfortable. It did include a flat screen but the remote sucked, the buttons were really weird. I could only turn on the TV but getting up and hitting the button on it. One good feature was the safe which we used everyday. I only gave this hotel 2 out of 5 instead of 1 because the staff was very friendly. I would not stay here again.

That shows that it is an excellent hotel as crew and airlines will not put up with shoddy hotels and staff. The hotel pool is a little small but gets the sunshine all day long.

The majority of hotel guests stay here for a few days to coincide with conference or for a small weekend getaway. We were here for two weeks and I have to say it was perfect. This vacation was for relaxation and SHOPPING and gosh we did both!! When we arrived, we were made aware that the pool area was closed for the first five days of our stay due to refurbishment. However the hotel had made arrangements for hotel guests to use another hotel pool close to MCO. If you had a car then it was a 10min drive away and if not then busses were placed on for your convenience. I fully understand that hotels have to refurb and with September being a quiet month for Orlando this is why they do it now. it did not bother me in the slightest and the alternative pool was fantastic. Once the pool area was re opened - it is one of the best pool areas I have been too - clean - relaxing music playing at a low level, plenty of sunbathing loungers that are comfortable and complimentary towels. I was a little concerned that we would hear alot of noise from the mall or noise from the highway but apart from the odd UPS delivery van, the relaxing music drowned out any noise. other maintenance was going on throughout our stay but we were advised that they are due to open a new bistro and to make crickets more of a bar area sometime later this year. - circkets is great - we did not eat here but we stayed a couple of hours within Happy Hour - Happy Hour is on from 1600 - 2100 - Buy one get one free from what I recall everyday - NOT BAD AT ALL! Great friendly service in here. The room was cleaned and maintained throughout our 14 night stay. We did not require the room to be cleaned on a daily basis so if you pop down to the front desk and tell them your room number and you dont require your room to be cleaned you can get a $5 coupon to use either at Starbucks or Crickets. What a great incentive. One day I advised the cleaner direct that we did not require our room to be cleaned but she asked if we wanted extra water/cups/towels to ensure we were ok for the day! what more could you ask for. We had a great room on the 11th floor facing the pool and main entrance. You get a clear view of the highway, but there was no noise and on a clear morning you can see as far as the 192- Irlo Bronson (Old town attraction rides) and the Sea World tower. The room itself - was bright and fresh with a comfortable - the only thing I will say is that the bathroom could do with a drawer to store toiletries and cosmetics in - but other than that it was perfect. and the safe and fridge was an added bonus. The staff - like all the other reviews on this site - you ask they help in any way they can - they go above and beyond expecations and I am sure that if you arrive without a car they can help you to make arrangements to get to and from the Theme Parks. We did have a car and it takes approx - 10mins to get to Universal and 20mins to WDW. 15-20mins to get to the Premium Outlets at Lake Buena Vista and 10mins to the outlets on I-Drive. You dont fancy any of the eateries in the food court - try Ruby Tuesdays or the California Pizza kitchen which are both attached to the mall in different locations - the food is served piping hot and served with a smile. You have a car? - go down Sand Lake Road towards I-Drive and you will find plenty of alternative restaurants anything from TGI's to Logans Steakhouse which i have to say was fantastic... I cant rave enough about this hotel, the fact that its attached to the mall has a massive bonus especially to all you \"gals\" who do like to shop till you drop. Even the Mall of Milennia is only a 10min drive in the car...its so convenient.

However, I am satisfied with the level of service in the hotel, as one of the boxes I received did not contain my name on it (yes, the seller did not include my name on it!). They went out of their way and called the carrier, obtaining my name with the seller. Thanks, guys, I appreciate it!

We arrived early in the day so after checking in our bags we entered the mall through the lobby of the hotel and spent a few hours shopping until we got the call from the front desk that our room was ready. The room was bright, clean and very quiet. I never heard a sound from the hallway, next door or from outdoors the entire time we were there. We had a small fridge, flat screen tv and internet connection that all worked perfectly. Over the next few days my wife, daughter (10yrs), son (6 yrs) and I had a great time in the shops, restaurants, and of course, the huge, uncrowded pool and hot tub. It was great being able to split up here and there and do things with each other without having to get in the car or drive across a strange city in search of things to do. We did take a short couple minute drive to the outlet malls just to double-down on the deals but even that was fairly simple and effortless. We are from Florida so we weren't interested in hitting the resort parks in 105 degree weather but even so I would suggest staying at the Florida Hotel if you are planning more than a couple day stay in Orlando after visiting Disney or Universal. The Hotel is about 1/2 mile from the Turnpike and at the edge of International drive so you can get in and out of all the major attractions yet just outside the crowded arteries of Orlando. There's even a Starbucks and Quick Mart in the hotel lobby so you're never far from a nice hot coffee, cold beer or bag of skittles. There's also a breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant that also has a nice omelet bar, bagels, meats, fruits and more. It's starts around ten bucks per person which is fairly cheap considering the prices of everything in the mall food court. The Florida Hotel also has a 'Skycap' in the lobby where you can leave your bags and print out boarding tickets before catching the airport shuttle. They have TV screens there with up-to-date airport departures and arrivals also.

I was very please with my stay at the Florida Hotel and Convention Center.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient to Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "GA_Lady_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR115876142", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of June 2011 and all in all, it was a decent stay. The goal of our trip was to go to Universal Studios and we were nervous as we couldn't really tell how far/near the park was...it turned out to be super convenient! Just a left turn out of the mall and and two right turns and we were there -- getting on the interstate wasn't even necessary. Because it's close to Universal Studios, it's also close to the waterpark there (Wet and Wild I believe it's called). The hotel itself is located behind a fairly large mall that has everything your typical mall would have, including an Apple Store :-) This turned out to be a life saver when you came in from the theme parks and didn't feel like getting in the car again and driving somewhere--the hotel was connected to the mall. If you want to shop or look around while your friends napped, you can do that without going too far or hopping in the car. There is a Ruby Tuesday, California Pizza Kitchen, Bucca di Beppo and of course the food court (which has typical food court fare). Surrounding the outside of the mall there are also an abundance of eateries like Chili's, Red Lobster (the best I've had in a while--very good!), etc. The rooms at this hotel were pretty good. They weren't great, but they were good. No major complaints really. The carpet could use a shampoo, but generally speaking it was clean in the room. The mattress I found to be quite hard for my taste. However, after a full day at the theme parks, this is a welcome thing, so I didn't mind the hard mattress in the end. The other reviews about the hallways being dirty are a bit true...you will see random debris/room service platters in the corridors (some kid must have spilled raisins on the carpet...we didn't want to investigate too much :-P) But once downstairs or in your room, you really didn't find these kind of issues. The bathroom was fine. Marble (or fake, not sure) countertop, traditional shower with the curtain and good bath products. As this is a convention hotel, parking sometimes was scarce. There is a lot directly across the street from the entrance of the hotel. We had to park in the very last row when we arrived on a Friday afternoon. However, as the weekend came in, the parking lot emptied a bit and we were able to get spots closer in. Also, since this is a mall, it's not like there aren't spaces else where. However, because this mall is so big, it feels like you drove forever around the mall just to get to the hotel. But the fact that the self-parking was free is a bonus. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. I would give it about 3.5 stars out of 5. And I would gladly return to this hotel again, especially for the price ($94/night).", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best Hotels in Orlando.\u201d", "Author": "RiBr80", "ReviewID": "UR115812087", "Content": "My wife and I had a good time in Orlando and we found Florida Hotel a good choice and we recommend to anyone.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nassau, New Providence Island", "Title": "\u201cI LOVE THIS HOTEL VERY CONVENIENT\u201d", "Author": "lynettebain65", "ReviewID": "UR115726442", "Content": "My stay at your hotel was much enjoyed, my daughter came with me for company.

Never switched to pancakes or waffles just to change it up and entice you with something different. Food was good, but WAY too pricey. By the end of my trip I would just get a big muffin from the convenience store for $2. Lunch was always the Florida Mall for me, just too convenient to not eat there. Never did dinner there, but always had a few drinks at the end of the night there. Decent deals/happy hour. A nice thing the hotel does is there is a \"green card\" in your room that if you do not wish your room cleaned that day, just fill it out the night before and hang it on your doorknob outside your room. Hotel staff will pick it up at night and give you a free $5 to use at Crickets, Starbucks, or the Convenience store (you have to go to the front desk to get the $5 voucher). Worked out really well but realized this at the end of my trip, wish I had known earlier. But seeing as I was there for a conference, I would say that its just like all other hotels trying to make their money off a conference. Internet wasn't free in the conference rooms, but it was in your own room. And to get internet for the conference rooms, the fee was outrageous(in my mind). This includes wired or wireless. The tech support people were fabulous though. They helped us with anything we needed and didn't mind doing something extra if we needed an extra hand. Cannot thank them enough for that.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGREAT PEOPLE ......

The lobby service was welcoming and when they booked us on the top floor of this highrise, we were encouraged that it was going to be an excellent stay. The room was clean, of average/above average size, with plush bedding and much of what we expected. Two surprises, however, were the scratchy, thin, small bath towels (even the beach towels at the pool were thin and scratchy) and the absence of any mini bottles of body lotion, mouthwash, a shower cap, etc, in the room. On short trips, I normally don't pack toiletries in anticipation of using those provided in the room. The hotel did provide a dispenser attached to the shower wall with shampoo, conditioner and body wash only. Also, because of the hotel's integration in the mall, the swimming pool is oddly located on the front of the hotel, just to the right of the busy main entrance. Although walled, the noise and commotion from cars and people arriving and departing made for a less than relaxing getaway around the pool.

We had three choices to choose from, but gladly they all became my favorite by the end of the night. I really enjoyed that tea party.

Also there are plenty of other shops located near by that make this a good location: office supplies, supermarket, bookstore (closing sadly), crafts and hobbies, restaurants, ..... to name a few (not by name). And of course if you don't want to get breakfast in the restaurant you can always just get coffee and oatmeal to go! Another big plus is the free parking (unless you need valet parking) and the free wifi! We all know what some hotels charge for wigi usage let alone parking.

I rated this hotel terrible because of two things 1) the very poor welcome we received upon checking, which went along the following lines: \"hello, give me your credit card I need to bill you an extra $100\" and a piece of paper was trust at me explaining the MANDATORY ADDITIONAL SERVICE FEE of $12.38 per day. Apparently this covers use of the business centre (6 rather dirty Internet computers and 2 printers), the outdoor pool area, the gym, your in-room safe and refrigerator ( there is no minibar) and self parking (which is actually the free parking for the shopping mall to which the hotel is attached). I complained to the guest relations manager because I believe that if a fee is MANDATORY it should be included in the published rate. They said it wasn't their problem, and blamed Lastminute.com. 2) the hotel is very dated, giving it a rather dirty feel, even though it is probably clean... It's just very brown. 3)The restaurant is actually in the shopping mall and is fine for a beer and a burger, but it's not the kind of place you would choose for an evening meal.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port of Spain, Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cWill Definately Stay again & Again\u201d", "Author": "ROBTT868", "ReviewID": "UR91125041", "Content": "I stayed at the Florida Hotel For two days before spending our Christmas at a Disney Resort.

Over this past Thanksgiving day weekend, we stayed at the Florida Mall Hotel. I've stayed here at at least once year and decided to write this review. It has remained a good hotel although I would say it was a great 1st class hotel 5+years ago. Since the hurricane season of 2004 and 2005, it maintained a great staff, hotel rooms were in tip top shape. So when we checked on Thanksgiving eve, I was suprised to find the few minor changes they made to cut costs, were obviously tied to the lowest prices I've ever paid to stay here....I'll blame that on the recession. But I wouldn't rate it \"plush\" at this time. The hotel is in a great location. 1. Close to the Airport. I don't need to make a mad dash through the maze of freeways, tollroads, and surface streets that I normally have to map on paper or on my navigator to make sure I don't get lost. 2. Connected to the Florida Mall. The Florida Mall is very upscale and I've seen it through it's renovations over the years that made it better and better. The food court has a nice variety and you can always find great restaurants next to the mall or across the street. 3. Proximity to all Resorts. I actually clocked my driving time from the Hotel. It was actually faster for me to drive to Walt Disney World Epcot and Magic Kingdom from the Florida Mall hotel as compared to staying at one of the downtown Disney resorts and driving through all the stop lights. Likewise, returning to the mall, even on Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving) was a breeze and I even ended up finding a packing stall next to the hotel entrance). Areas of Improvement: 1. Bathroom toilet was very slow to flush. Room smelled a a littly musty....it was like that after the hurricanes hit in 2004-2005, but there were no hurricanes that hit orlando this year. 2. Condiments. I used to love collecting the soap/shampoo, but they've gone \"green\" and decided to install a shower dispenser. I did ask the maid if I could get a bar of soap which she did provide each day of my stay. SUMMARY The staff was friendly and courteus, and we got a nice room. We had some noisy neighbors/kids the first night, but I don't blame the hotel on that point. But I will continue to plan and stay at this hotel. It's away from the hustle and bustle of the resorts yet it has easy/fast access to all tourist locations.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft Myers, FL", "Title": "\u201c5th stay & it just keeps better every year\u201d", "Author": "lshuster", "ReviewID": "UR50215177", "Content": "I attend a yearly conference at the hotel every year.

I particularly wish to cite the friendliness, trustworthiness and professionalism of staff. They individually applied resourcefulness in response to my specific information requests and personal needs. Without exception, they seemed to genuinely enjoy helping out a traveller from Australia (me). I confess that I made that very scary mistake of leaving a major credit card in the room in my hurry to check out and make connections. I rang the Florida Hotel on a Friday night and was immediately transferred to \"Luz\" in the Security Department. She reassured me my card had been found and turned in. She then followed my instructions precisely to ensure I received my credit card in a very secure manner at my next destination. It \"worked a treat\" as Aussies say!

The hotel has a number of meeting spaces, both large and small. Support staff seems willing to help when called upon. I was not directly involved with arrangements, but second hand info was favorable. hotel rooms are pretty standard. Ethernet access in the rooms is free, but wireless is an additional charge, but wireless is free in lobby and some other areas (but not the conference rooms - extra charge there). The only restaurant in the hotel is the Crickets Bar and Grill which does offer a breakfast buffet (for a fee) as well as items for lunch and dinner. Menu is pretty limited, but there are a lot of fast food places in the food court at the mall. (all the food court places seem to offer the same teriyaki chicken under a variety of names!). One other note: HBO, Cinemax or other premium movie channels are not avaiable in the rooms. The usual pay-per-view are! If a Motel 6 can have HBO why not this hotel? Our conference had catered breakfast buffet outside the conference room which was generally pretty good with some interesting choices other than danish and muffins usually found at these things. On one occasion, the coffee tasted burnt and the food ran out on another. Our conference did not have a catered lunch or dinner so I cannot comment about that. Although the hotel is reasonably close to the airport (it is heavily used by airline pilots and flight attendents), there is no free shuttle. RT shuttle is $28. There are no tourist attractions within walking distance so a car or cab is necessary. The pool and outdoor jacuzzi were well maintained, but limited to daylight hours.

A colleague had some trouble with no bottled water being supplied in her room but this was easily resolved by the reception staff. While there we also asked the staff for some details regarding local bus services, and they have a useful print-out showing you the bus routes to get to all the local attractions. The reception staff were very helpful indeed about this. High speed wireless is also available for free in the lobby which was great. Ordered room service while there and it was very nice, well presented and tasty. They also followed it up with a call to check everything was okay which was nice.

It was an enjoyable stay :) A very nice hotel with great and kind staff. The location is very good. Not far from the different parks (disney, seaworld etc...) and the hotel it self is connected to the Florida Mall :) One great feature for the folks who stay there longer than a couple of days is that you get a decently sized Frigde to keep your stuff inn :) Its also a small freezer there. Our room was spacous and really nice. The bathroom looked nice and there was a 32\" LCD tv on the wall :) One thing we really liked was the car service the hotel had :) A company called VIP Inc. drove the customers around in nice luxury sedans and vans :) The prices was about the same as a normal taxi but the QUALITY was that of another world :) We used this service all the time and got to know a really nice and friendly driver called Carlos :) He had a lot a great tips about eating and shops :) Some recommondations: Shopping: The mall is quite expensive compared to the different \"Outlets\" you`ll find in the area. There are mainly two places for \"Outlets\" - You have the Prime 1 Outlets at the North of the Int. Drive and there is also a place at the far South of the Int Drive - think the last was called Premium Outlets. Both places you have outlets for most major brands and they do GREAT prices, This reminded me of something we call factory sales here in Norway. My girlfriend was in heaven anyway and managed to buy clothes to fill TWO suitcases ;) For eating there is LOTS of places to go. In the mall you have the food court for simple junk food. >But there is also some resturants. Its an American diner style place called Ruby Tuesday witch have the BEST burgers we`ve ever tasted :) We also have a pizza place (California Pizza kitchen) and an Italian place. Both the pizza place and italian is quite good but our favourite is Ruby Tuesday :) They are located next to the main entrance to the mall :) For breakfast we can recommend going to the bagle place called Panera. Its located in walking distance from the mall. When you are at the main entrance just go straight forward and on the other side of the road you`ll find Panera. They have freshly baked bagels every day and they serve typical breakfast/lunch dishes. Good prices and nice food. Highly Recommended. Eating breakfast on the hotel is kinda a waste. At first we wondered about why the breakfast venue was so small. But its because noone eats there ;) Its pricey (think it was 15-20 dollar pr person) and the selection is not impressive. Nice service though. Go to Panera instead. For the longer stays go to Publix (high end grocery store) and buy food :) Its great for filling up the frigde with drinks and simple foods :) General tip: Orlando is HOT with HIGH humidity. Remember to bring lots of \"non-warm\" clothes. I actually brought a ton a long sleeve shirts witch was no point at all ;) To quote Carlos our driver \" When it got cold once I had to search my entire closet to find a jacket. \" ;-) Enjoy your stay :)", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe Greatest Hotel Ever\u201d", "Author": "regiluswedding", "ReviewID": "UR40051273", "Content": "I would like to say that by far Florida Hotel was the greatest I've ever had the pleasure to stay in.

I had unconventional room layout needs and they were more than willing to work with me on those. Coordinating 350 people from 22 states into 2 days was not easy, but they make it look that way.

First of all, everything in this hotel is oriented around tourists. The hotel people are nice only if you are a tourist who is looking to go to a restaurant, buy a ticket for parks, or asking for recommendations (in short - commissions). Rooms are nice, king bed, nice LCD TV. There is so much noise coming from AC units of huge mall located next to the hotel that you will have difficulty to sleep. Not anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault but noise is noise. After all, you are supposed to get rest. In addition, they forgot to send room service every single day (to clean the room, make bed etc). Not one day, but two days I stayed there. I had to call twice (seriously) to make sure that they clean my room. (#1508) We had a conference there. Conference rooms are nice. Second floor is a quiet place. No complain about that. Ok now, you get free parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except valet parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c same place. Now my story; somebody broken into my car by breaking the front driver. Second morning, I wake up and go to my car to get my folder and see that windows is broken and glasses everywhere. Now rather than getting angry, I said myself; this is just a bad day, it can happen to anybody. I went to from desk and explained what I found. I then asked (only) for a portable vacuum cleaner to clean the broken glasses so that I can catch the conference. (I did not ask for anything except a portable vacuum cleaner.) I was going to clean the car, and place a towel temporarily so that I can get it fixed later at the service. They said, \"We do not give out vacuum cleaners. They sell those in the mall. You can purchase from there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Please do not assume that I was faced with another person who is also having a bad day. There were 2 other front desk people (1 female, 1 male) during this conversation. There were no questions about \"what happened? Why happened? Is everything all right?\" I suppose it is a common thing there\u00ef\ufffd\u0160 Being shocked, I went to the mall and purchased a vacuum cleaner, cleaned up my car and went to Wal-Mart to place plastic wrap on the windows and later that week I got it fixed.

I had to return to the conference after staying with her for awhile but the staff members came back to the room every 30 minutes to check on her and bring her ice and water. this to me was over the top as I knew she was well taken care of and i was able to continue with my meeting with out worrying about her condition and for that I am grateful.

I had booked the package of Bed and Breakfast and that was also awesome. I rented a car and one of the things that I enjoyed the most was that I didn't have to pay extra for parking nor did you have a hard time looking for parking.

Hotel AND Priceline. After being in the Orlando area 5 days visiting family as well as business, we \"pricelined\" a 3-4 star hotel near the airport in preparation of an early morning flight. The Fla. Hotel accepted our bid, with a Final Charge made to our credit card at the time of reservation, before we knew the identity of the hotel (using Priceline). Arrived at 9 PM, check-in, lobby, personnel, room were fine; except an $11.00 mandatory charge at time of check-in. When I pointed out the that Priceline had already given me a \"Final Charge\" which was paid, the desk personnel stated this extra charge was for in-room safe, refrigator, and (?) bottled water. I asked them to change us to a room that did not have these items or remove them, and they would not. The personnel were unfailingly polite, and as I stated the 6 hr. stay was just fine. It is extra charges that appear, when one believes that an item or service is completely paid for, that annoy me. Priceline states that one should call the hotel to see if these charges exist, however, one does not know the name of the hotel before the reservation is made; thus your credit card is credited (non-refundable) before the hotel can be queried. Thus, one is obligated to the hotel whether or not they charge extra fees upon arriving. I do not know if this practice is widespread, I have not run up against it in the larger US or European cities; but it seems oneous. To their credit, when I contacted the hotel regarding this instance, they credited the extra charge off my card. I firmly believe that a hotel (or any service, item, etc.) should have an agreed upon price at the time of purchase, and further charges should not be added at the time of check-in; be they $1.00 or $100.00.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "kayoticlaudia", "ReviewID": "UR24240529", "Content": "This is a great hotel to stay - esp. if on business.

It was akin to walking into a cabin on a cruise ship. It was obviously a tiny room. On a cruise ship you conclude; it's small, but it works. This room did not work. The door cleared one of the beds by a few inches. The bathroom was tiny. The sink provided virtually no space for supplies for a single person, not a chance for two. There was a chair up against one wall facing in the opposite direction of the TV, as there was no where else to put it. There was a desk, but no connection for the computer. This room might have worked if there was only one bed, but two made it a cramped mess. There was also another small table. Beneath it was a mass of wires, cables, and computer stuff. It was jumbled up in a huge ball. It looked like an explosion in the back room at Radio Shack. We were trying to hook up a lap top, but could not make sense of this pile of wires. We called the front desk and they promptly sent a tech man to the room. He walked in and shook his head in disbelief. He looked at the electronic pile of spagehetti and said this was unacceptable. He called the front desk and asked for a different room. He walked us to the new room and let us in with his pass key. The new room was fine. Spacious, comfortable and well laid out. It was a flawless stay from that point forward. Two points: First, it annoyed me that they would assign a clearly inferior room when there were better rooms available. Two, presumably there are few of these rooms on each floor. There are probably a couple of dozen of them throughout the hotel.

Well i then asked for 2 seperate rooms as I had paid for a quad room (to which he said he will charge me for), he then told me he can put in a rollaway but will not charge me for this!!! I accepted as my children who I hyped up this hotel too where looking forlorn and I did not want to disappoint them by going back to our main (lovely hotel Fairfield inn and suites in LBV) as we had only booked the Florida Hotel for 1 night (thank God) so that we can be there for the shopping. The room i requested was no smoking (but smelt like someone had just had a cigar in it). I did not get or were offered cookies like the other posts have mentioned. Even to get the Sunday Orlando sentinel was a problem (i was sent to the left and right side lifts and also to the hotel shop but none were there and no member of staff even cared to look for one, they just sent me on a wild goosechase to find one myself). I asked where I can buy an international card to make overseas calls and was directed to their shop. On buying a card I went back to reception to ask for a phone (public) to use and was told that phones are only in the room (which costs $2 as a standing charge plus 75C a minute to make a free call or local call)!!!

All in all, the hotel is \"okay.\" Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high from previous stays in higher quality and nicer hotels at similar prices. Others may find this hotel perfectly adequate, depending on your expectations; yet, I think the price per night is far too high for the quality you get.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly Nice\u201d", "Author": "Dogfish60min", "ReviewID": "UR14344916", "Content": "This was one of the closest hotels I could find to a conference I was attending that was not very overpriced.

There were a lot of places to eat up and down the main road. I did hear someone at the check out desk about being charged for 2 bottles of water. So, I guess if you're going to get charged $7.50 for 2 bottles of water than you might as well take them. Maybe it's just me, but the roads around the Orlando Airport are a nightmare. I'm a tried and true believer in MapQuest, but I think even for them it was a challenge giving directions from the airport to this hotel. The hotel is situated on a road that winds behind the Mall so it's a bit tricky. We didn't use any of the facilities and there was only 1 restaurant and 1 coffee shop in the hotel itself. I messed up a little When I reserved the room/pkg. that included a free breakfast buffet, I apparently only checked that there was 1 person in the room instead of 2 so I pointed that out to the gal at the front desk and she wouldn't give me another voucher for breakfast, which was okay since it was my fault. However, the awesome Buffet Manager woman (I feel bad that I forgot her name) did not charge me for my breakfast buffet..she said that was silly that they didn't give us 2 anyway.

We were also fortunate to have a room with a good view! The staff was very friendly and helpful, seeming how we didn't know our way around Orlando very well. I also took advantage of a Starbucks being right downstairs in the morning. The hotel management left a survey for visitors to fill out and write comments on how they could make our visit more pleasant. I suggested that they have full length mirrors outside of the bathroom so other people could get ready at the same time. A few weeks later, I got a letter in the mail informing me that full length mirrors were being put into all of the rooms in the hotel. EXCELLENT customer service on their behalf!!!!

It's a large, but pretty quiet, hotel attached to a fabulous mall (Nordstrom's, Macy's, etc.). I stayed here attending a 4-day conference that was happening in the hotel. Check in was very smooth at a very large circular \"desk.\" The room was very nice: * Large with lots of windows (and effective curtains) * Very nice, large desk with a free high-speed, trouble-free Internet connection * Comfy bed with lots of pillows * Small, empty refridgerator where you can store water and/or the left-overs from room service meals - not a rip-off stuffed full of tiny liquor bottles and $5 cans of soft drinks and candy bars in it. * Safe in the room (would hold a computer somewhat larger than my 7.5\" x 11\" travel Dell) * Nice, big bathroom with marble floors and counter, tub and shower combination * Comfortable couch and coffee table in addition to the desk * Doorbell for the room Nice Starbucks in the lobby. Cricket's bar/restaurant also in the lobby. (Be sure to say hi to Cricket - they named the bar after her and she's very nice.) However, watch out in Cricket's - they add an 18% \"service fee\" to the bill when you receive it, so don't do your usual tip on top of that or you'll really be over-paying! Room service is good. It was a long wait one evening for the fruit plate and had a $2 fee plus an 18% service fee added to the bill (not unusual, in my experience). The mall is excellent, but beware if you eat a late dinner at the excellent Italian restaurant in the mall (Buca?). We walked back through the mall, but couldn't get back into the hotel without going through some maintenance corridors to the outside and then walking around to the front of the hotel. The hotel closes their entrance to the mall at 6:30 on Sundays and 9:30 on other days. They ask you to accept changing the sheets every couple of days rather than every day. And, they also ask you to re-use towels in the bathroom from day to day. All in the interests of conserving energy, etc. OK. I don't change the sheets every day at home, and I do re-use the towels at home. HOWEVER, my bill had a $5 fee added every night for \"services\" I never used. And management would NOT waive the DAILY fee. The fee covered - * use of the swimming pool (didn't use the pool) * use of the shuttles to the attractions (never visited any attractions) * the water in the room (2 bottles of water sat on top of the refridgerator, unused, untill the last day when I realized I was paying for them whether or not I used them) * the local newspaper which was available for you to pick up every morning by the elevator in the lobby (not even delivered to the room!) Be on guard for the extra fees they slip into the bills. When you check in, ask about that water! There wasn't a price on it or an indication that it was included in the cost of the room. It struck me as sneaky. The manager implied that the conference got a reduced room rate so the hotel had to charge extra for the other hotel features that they provided, even if those features weren't used. Balderdash, as my grandmother would say. All in all, a very good hotel, and I would gladly stay in it again. Except for those *^#&$&#* fees!

Well I contacted Race.com for our tickets and the packaghe that we got booked us into the Florida Hotel. When my family and I which not only included my wife and I but our 2 daughters 18 and 16 pulled up we were impressed at what we were looking at. Then we went inside and was immediately greated byv there desk staff who were very friendly and curtious. He answered all our questions and even had a message for me that was left earlier in the day. We entered our room and it was perfect. I turned on the AC and withing just a coup;e of minutes the room was cool. We did have one small issue in that when we took our shower it would not drain properly. So I advised the front desk as we were leaving for the race and when we returned that night I had a message advsing me that the drain in the shower had been fixed. I have nothing but good things to say about the Florida Hotel in fact we stayed there an extra 2 days and I would most definitely stay there again as well as recommend others to stay. There is something I should let you all know about so you do not get ripped off. The first is the restaurant 'Cricket\" what ever you do I would not recommend that you eat breakfast there. It is $13.95 for a buffet breakfast and the food is not that great for what you have to pay. I made the mistake and ate there with my 2 daughters and with just the 3 of us and one of my daughtets just ordering breakfast off the menu our bill was $46.00 and the daughter who ordered breakfast did not gte her meal until after myself and my other daughter ate our breakfast and got seconds.And secondly do not buy your tickets to any of the venues from the ticket agent at the main desk. I should say tyhis agent is not an employee of the Florida Hotel. But what they do is presure you into trying to get you to buy property and a vacation home. Now if you sit throught their 90 minutes brainwashing you can get a fairly good deal on tickets. But if you just want to buy the tickets so you do not have to stand in the ticket lines I suggest you stand in the lines. The cost to get into Disney World through the person selling tickets at the hotel is $77.00 but when yoiu show up at the park you will see that the day ticket is only $67.00. So I suggest if you do not want to sit and listen to their speech and show and tell you buy your tickets at the parks. But for the hotel itself it was a great pleasure instaying there as my wife can attest since she and the kids visited the mall several times. As I stated above I cannot say nothing negative about the hotel or its staff.

Unfortunately, I am disappointed in the final result. I have noticed that the carpets in the hallways are loose. At first, I thought it was isolated to 1 floor, but after multiple stays, it is on multiple floors. I also was disappointed on my last visit. The entire toilet paper holder was not attached to the wall. I set it on the floor 2 days in a row in hopes that housekeeping would have it repaired. To my surprise, they kept sticking it on the wall and literally when I came back to my room, EVERY piece came flying off of the wall when I needed paper. I called Housekeeping and literally within minutes the guy fixed it. I interpreted this as a sign that there is a lack of pride with the maid staff. The last two rooms that I stayed in had ineffective AC controls. I never could get the room to cool to 68, even after leaving it on all night. The hallway is actually cooler this week. This week my bathtub has the faucet 1\" away from the wall. Every morning, I have tried to push it back. When I come back to my room, the faucet has been turned to a 7:00 position and is still detached from the wall. In addition to that, the temperature indicator is not secured to the handle and it just spins around. The parking is not customer friendly either. Every time I have been here, there are only a handful of cars in the valet area. The valet area is huge. I have never witnessed it over 20% full. It seems that they would give up that remaining 80% to paying guests. And as they increase the valet parking, they could increase the lot area. As it is now, I have to park a couple hundred meters away from the hotel and walk next to a valet parking lot that is 80% empty, which has no revenue generating impact, and is a poor way to treat customers.

We opened the window only to see a roof top that looked all moldy and nasty--some view, huh? We immediately called the front desk and told the guy who worked there (he had an attitude). He said they only had ONE room left in the WHOLE hotel (yeah right) and he could transfer us. It was supposed to be one of their \"better rooms,\" I guess. Well, we ended up transferring to it which was a little better than the first, but I was still not impressed. The bathroom was gross! The tile was nasty and had mold between it. After showering, I felt dirtier than I did in the beginning! And get this, the covers were stained in this room, too--looked like blood! I requested new sheets and a comforter. The price is way too high to be staying in such a place! We couldn't get our money back though. The hotel staff was not helpful at all. I called the front desk for information about nearby stores in the area because my sister needed Tylenol. The receptionist told me to go to a gas station to get them.

Although this hotel is slightly out of the way from the parks and international drive, if you have a hire car this is not problem. Looking at some of the hotels on international drive i felt glad we had managed to change hotels and stay at the Florida Mall. It was definitely a better class hotel. If you like shopping, the location of this hotel is perfect. Situated right on top of an excellent shopping mall - i could not have asked for more. The rooms were extremely clean with large flat screen TV's. The beds were huge and so soft and comfortable to sleep in - i didnt want to come home! The room had a safe, refrigerator and the bathroom was clean and nicely decorated. The mall offers lots of choice in food - we particularly liked Ruby Tuesday's (on the front of the mall) they had an amazing salad bar which gave us light relief away from burgers and fries!! Smokey Bones (in front of the mall car park) also did amazing ribs. For breakfast we tried all the buffet breakfast chains and we thought that the Golden Corral offered the best value and the most choice. Ponderosa was cheap but the food was not great. The hotel reception were extremely helpful and gave us directions to where ever we wanted to go and provided us with helpful maps and park information. Tip for the parks - if you get to the parks by 8.30am you can get straight on all the rides with no queues and be out of the parks by lunchtime when it gets frustratingly busy. This gives you the afternoon to rest by the pool or do some more shopping!!
