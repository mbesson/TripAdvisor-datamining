The hotel provides a great base. The location is right on the main highway, so it was easy to get started up the Valley and to get to Sonoma. Even though the hotel is on the highway it is separated by a frontage road and the rooms go back away from the highway. We did not hear any street noise. It's only about 5 minutes from downtown Napa. There is a Target store on the other side of the highway that was convenient for bottled water and a few other necessities. As others have written the rooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was helpful. Even a little snafu at check in, they somehow had us with two rooms reserved instead of one, the problem was resolved in a minute. The breakfast in the hotel is very good. it may seem high at $12.95, but that includes coffee, juice and milk, so it's really not so bad. They call it a buffet, but you basically order about anything you want from the waitress and she brings it to you. I had eggs benedict one morning and a crepe the next. You help yourself to drinks, fresh fruit and pastries. It was good to get a big breakfast f=before a day of wine tasting. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi in the evening and the complementary wine tsting aon Friday and Saturday were another bonus. They have lots of coupons for two for one wine tastings, so make sure you ask at the front desk. We got a coupon for the Hess Collection. It's a beautiful drive into the hills close to the hotel.

From previous leisure visits to the region, I knew two things: quality lodging is at sort of a premium in that region, and that the prices would almost certainly reflect that. As such, the options were perhaps more limited than usual. So, rather than staying (as I often do) in an extended-stay property, I was based at this hotel. From the moment I checked in, outstanding customer service presented itself as a huge draw to this hotel. Nearly everyone from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff were exceedingly courteous, liked to engage the guests in conversations, and were always checking to ensure that everything was to the guests' satisfaction. That never wavered for the duration of my stay. Of special note were Megan, Bunny, and Hannah at the front desk, and Becky in the restaurant. It is also important to note that while it is not uncommon for me to reach a point where I am recognized by name by the staff - not because I am a \"demanding\" guest, but because of the duration of my stays - the staff at this facility took it to another level. I continually observed that they would strive to \"get to know\" every one of their guests, even if they were only staying for one night. That kind of effort really goes a long way to make a guest feel welcome, and sets that facility apart from its competitors. As for the accommodation itself - a room on the third (top) floor of the facility - it was adequate for my needs during the stay. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, the workstation comfortable and compatible for written or computer tasks. There were absolutely no issues with the Internet connectivity, which can be accessed either via ethernet cable or wireless. The bathroom was spacious for a guest room of that type. Storage space - closet and dresser - were more than satisfactory. I never really felt \"cramped\" in the room. Lighting and climate control were decent. In terms of drawbacks, the channel selection on the TV (a nice flat-screen HD unit) was very limited and was very mediocre. Occasionally a moldy smell would be noticable near the entry door. One would also have to check the bedding (pillowcases, sheets) and bath towels to make sure there were no mold spots or other stains. The coffeemaker was a touch too small, and the \"college boy\" refrigerator was configured in such a way that it was difficult to store too much. Also, while the room was largely quiet, noise from the hallway and adjacent guest rooms was easily heard and could be disturbing. Fortunately, those distractions were minimal, as the noisiest of guests were often only there for one night, and usually on the weekends (Friday and Saturday nights). As for the rest of the facilities, the business center was fantastic, in that it provided most everything (including a copier) needed for people like me. The laundry and exercise facilities were immaculate and in good working order. The rest of the public areas were also consistently clean and well-lit. I did not use the outdoor pool/jacuzzi during my stay, mostly because it rained for almost the entire month of March. The restaurant served very good dinners, albeit a tad on the expensive side, and also had a selection of wines and beers that was certainly reasonable for a facility of this type. The breakfasts - which featured a limited continental service and a cook-to-order grill for omelets and the like - were also very good, but also a bit on the expensive side. I only ate breakfast there once or twice, if only because I couldn't really get past the fact that they didn't have an option for complimentary breakfast (for example, complimentary continental, and an additional charge if you opted to include one of the cook-to-order options). I tended more to eat dinner there once or twice a week. This facility sits on a siding road along Highway 29, so it is easy to access the highway to travel up and down the Napa Valley. There is a Target, a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Safeway, and Ralph's all within a mile of the facility, so groceries are easy to come by. There are several restaurants within that same distance, and more further away, both elsewhere in Napa and up the Valley. However, as with nearly everything in the Napa Valley, it gets expensive really fast, and the businesses (including restaurants) close early, so travelers should plan accordingly. All in all, this was a very pleasant stay. As I said, the outstanding customer service made all the difference in the world. While this probably wasn't an ideal facility for extended-stay travel, the customer service made it feel like one. I can't give it a full \"Excellent\" rating, if only because of a few of the drawbacks I noted. However, I am viewing this through the eyes of a business traveler. I wholeheartedly recommend this facility for leisure travelers visiting the Napa Valley for an overnight or a few days, because I certainly will return for any future leisure travel I make to the area. You would be hard-pressed to find a more pleasant experience elsewhere.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "deezoomo", "ReviewID": "UR106897005", "Content": "We just returned from Hilton Garden Inn and it was great!

For our short Napa trip, we couldn't have done much better. Call them to book - their website doesn't book it properly. The people working at the desk were very friendly - always greeting us with a hello and were helpful for getting around. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and modern (flat screen with included HBO). Our room was beautiful and spacious (as well as a spacious bathroom). Free USA Today in the morning. Free fruit and coffee in the lobby. If you become a Facebook fan you get a free breakfast coupon (they have a yummy breakfast that cost about $12). On the weekends they have an in-house tasting, but we were there mid-week. The one detractor is that they are not within walking distance of any wine bars/tasting rooms and they don't have a shuttle downtown either. We knew before we booked and were expecting it, but just one small complaint. As far as recommended wineries, we loved them all :-) Here is what we visited and what I remember of cost etc.: --Black Stallion (hotel wine pass ~$10/person without) They had a lovely wine bar but were building an outdoor area that will be really beautiful when it's finished! --Van den ?Heuval? (hotel wine pass ~$5/person without) Very small, not a very nice tasting area but made up for it in personal attention and delicious wine. Known for their late harvest wines. --Gustavo Thrace tasting room downtown Napa -free- must watch the movie Bottle Shock before you visit Napa -- the man behind Gustavo Thrace is in it - fun! --Uncorked Napa downtown tasting room - free with printable online coupon - yummy and fun. --Wine Train to Grgich - Wonderful experience. Gourmet meal on the way up. Nice tour and tasting. They gave us each a memento wine glass as well. On the way back down we sat in the dessert car (both delicious and beautiful). --Mumm Napa - (~$15/person) Beautiful sitting area to taste their sparkling wines (and another sitting area to taste their more expensive ones as well). They have an online coupon to print off before you go on their website. V. Sattui - they have a museum and picnic area for items purchased there, we didn't get a chance to taste because we got there too late :-( Alpha and Omega - (hotel wine pass - $20/person without) - Beautiful vineyard and tasting room That's all we had time for in a day and a half since most wineries seem to close at 5. Oenotri is a fun Italian restaurant downtown where we had Salumi (salami tasting plate) which was a new experience for us (and also delicious).

The Hotel and the rooms are spotless clean. It is located not far from the main road, but not exactly right by it. So it was nice and quiet. And because of being close to the Hwy you'll get to any vineyard pretty fast. Oakville is around 15 minutes away and St. Helena around 30 minutes. This place is a really good base to travel to vineyards. The rooms had a good size and the beds were really comfy. You'll have a good sleep here...There was also a table with chairs and a nice, comfy TV chair in the room. Also the bathroom was really clean...bit small, but nice. All in all we really enjoyed our stay here in both Napa Valley and the Hilton Garden Inn. We sure would come back here again. On a weekday we paid around 180$ a night (plus tax).

If you do not use the B&B option I think the breakfast is overpriced, but it is convenient. The service provided by ALL the staff was outstanding during our entire 4 night stay. When we arrived they asked if they could help with our luggage! And when they found out it was Mom's 90th birthday we were celebrating they brought complimentary wine to the room! Our room was the typical HGI room-2 queen beds, flat screen TV, microwave, refrig, coffee maker, hairdryer, etc. The room was very clean and looked brand new. Some of our group rented suites and these rooms provided a somewhat separate living area with a sleep sofa. Good choice for a family of 4 or more. On most nights there were complimentary wine tastings w/cheeses in the lobby. The HGI is located near the highway and is convenient for driving to Yountville for dinner or further for the Napa vineyard areas. I recommend a drive on the Silverado Trail and a meal at Auberge du Soile on the terrace.

The lobby area was comfortable with an inviting fireplace and small wine bar which we didn't visit. In general we found the front desk staff ranging from competent to very friendly and engaging.

I say that because in comparison to other HGI's, the breakfast was tiny. Also, there was no buffet style, you asked the cook for service. While I think that's fine, he was quite stingy. NEVER try to get more than two slices of bacon at one time! The waiter at breakfast seemed offended when I mentioned that their breakfast was smaller than other HGI's I've stayed with. They not only offered just one type of juice (most of the other ones have offered 3-4) they didn't offer chocolate milk, a toaster that worked, waffles (even though the machine was in plain view in the kitchen), muffins...but I'll stop being petty. Otherwise, this hotel is almost perfect for the location. Most of the huge Napa wineries are just down the road, a 5 minute drive and you're in the heard of the wine country! There are pleanty of good places to eat in the area (Try Fume' for brunch, it can't be beat). Also, just down Solano Ave, the road the hotel is located on, you can find Starbucks, Squeezeburger, companies that will ship wine and the Napa Premium Outlet mall. Ok, another complaint, no hot coffee during the day. Lots of HGI's have coffee pots out for all day self-service...not this one.

I booked 30 rooms at the hotel for my wedding guest's during the weekend of June 1st. Instead of the hotel developing a rooming list the right way, I had to book 30 rooms individually in order to honor a $99 rate, via the internet and then manage the rooming list myself.

The GM that I was working with the whole time of course is no longer with the hotel-remember he was fired. As far as customer service the front desk is horrible, they are inefficient, rude, stand-off'ish, uneducated about the area, and just plain unhelpful.

I really hate to give a bad review, but I feel like my fellow travelers need fair warning before they book a room here. At least if you do book, you will know beforehand what you are getting into! The hotel has a great location but that's it! The rooms rates are always ridiculously high (over $150 a night) for what is esentially a 2 star hotel. You can do much better for a night in Napa Valley. The rooms are typical Garden Inn decor but with a much lower quality. It's almost as if the hotel management just cleans the rooms once a month with no maintenance whatsoever. I found the room to be very dirty. The floors felt sticky and the room smelled very, very musty and moldy. It just felt \"unclean.\" If you blindly saw the rooms here, you would assume this was a very old hotel in dire need of renovation (broken and chipped tiles, torn bedding, dirty curtains, peeling wallpaper...the list goes on and on). I have to issue a strong warning to anyone planning a romantic getaway or honeymoon to avoid this hotel at all costs! I could see this hotel really ruining a romantic weekend. It is honestly that bad! We originally booked a 4 night stay at this hotel but I was too worked up about how much we paid for the room versus that quality that I couldn't relax and we ended up moving to another hotel for the remaining 3 nights of our trip to Napa. On the positive side, the hotel has free internet access in the rooms and a convenient 24 hour pantry on-site for beverages, food and toiletries. Parking is also free and ample.

One plus is that they have a refrigerator and microwave in every room, which is nice if you travel with people with special diets (like people who keep kosher) and need to bring or purchase their own food. The \"wine tasting\" that they have in the lobby from 5 to 7pm isn't really a wine tasting - it's more of a cheese and wine (with one white and one red) for the guests - it's free, but once the food runs out, that's it.
