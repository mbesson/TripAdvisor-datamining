For a two night trip where I had to go to Tec de Monterrey (Campus Santa Fe), it turned out to be okay. Positives: large size rooms, very quiet at night which for a light sleeper like me is always welcome (esp in Mexico City), breakfast is edible, free internet and why isn't it free everywhere, reliable drivers with newer cars usually only 5-7 mins to Tec, walking distance to some great restaurants (Cafe Torino). Finally and somewhat unbelievably to me, the staff had a better sense of service than much higher end restaurants I've stayed in Mexico City - they were friendly and genuinely friendly. Negatives: bit of a grim ambiance in the lobby and breakfast area, rooms have carpeting when there are more hygenic alternatives, noisy aircon but it was cool enough outside that I could switch it off at night, no minibar, no restaurant other than for the buffet breakfast, no gym or pool. As mentioned by other reviewers, this place works if you're only going to be in Santa Fe for a couple of nights, you want everything to function, but have no need for feeling luxuriated (not sure if that's a word, but you know what I mean).", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Celaya, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood option for business in the area\u201d", "Author": "J2EN", "ReviewID": "UR116403739", "Content": "Hotel is a little difficult to find, but once you locate the Guillermo Gonzalez circuit it is no problem at all. The hotels is quite new, all furnish is new, bathroom is nice marbel like walls and cristal sink. Internet acces si free, and brakefast is not outstanding but it has fresh fruit, bread, and a couple of hot options. The only inconvenient I saw was some noise from the neiborg room, I don\u2019t now if it was because of thin walls or just I got bad look with noisy neighbors. They have free transport to the nearby companies, so I left my car in the valet parking and ride on the shuttle for the meetings I had.

The Camino Real and Sheraton Suites are located on the same street, slightly more to the east. This is a good business hotel for the traveler who is working long days, leaving early and coming back late. The hotel is \"no frills\" but does have a limited room service menu. The food is very basic, it depends how hungry you are. The rooms themselves are clean, well maintained and very functional. The staff here was helpful and courteous. Parking is available under the hotel. There are many nearby restaurants, Papa Bill's Saloon is immediately adjacent, Los Canarios very nearby. There are probably a dozen other restaurants within a few hundred yards at most. The new Underground Garden Mall is under construction across the street. DHL's offices for Mexico are immediately next door in an adjacent office building. There is a new office tower under construction next to the hotel on the other side, but the noise level was surprisingly muffled. What was not muffled was the other sound of flushing toilets in the hotel....at night, one can hear various toilets being flushed in surrounding units....not every toilet in the building, but enough to think \"that is weird\" every time that it happened. Management might want to work on that issue. Otherwise, this is a reasonable choice. This is not a good place to stay if you are attending an expo or convention at the nearby convention center because despite the proximity in a straight line, getting from the HIE to the convention center, or from the convention center to HIE, is a very difficult exercise. It is just about totally impossible to walk, and driving or taking a cab requires a very torturous and convoluted route....traffic engineering in this part of Santa Fe (and the valley as a whole) is not a strong point of the master plan.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Express Cd. de Mexico Santa Fe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1113916-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Cd_de_Mexico_Santa_Fe-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$87 - $138*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Guillermo Gonzalez Camarena 1400</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
