In the reception (smelling of chips and cannabis smoke) I was informed that payment (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac325 for 3 nights) must be in advance, which I have never encountered before. Then had to take heavy luggage up two ladder-like staircases (no offers of assistance and no lift) to my second floor room. Door to room was unvarnished plywood and would have looked more at home on a portacabin. The room number plaque was cracked in two. Inside the room was dark and very small. Linoleum floor. Two rickety wooden chairs/ table and a tiny wardrobe with one hanger. Small TV. Window view was another wall. Shower and toilet acceptable (yes, surprising, but yes). Bedhead put against hot radiator (what is the logic behind that - tourists in Amsterdam like sweaty heads?). Scab-like stain (blood/ ketchup?) on ceiling. Double bed very small and saggy. On the 2nd night my wife complained of itching in bed and I too got a bad itching and rash on the 3rd night. On our last morning, the morning after the daylight saving time shift, we were rudely awakened by a key turning in the lock and an unfriendly lady telling us we have to check out now, pointing at her watch, showing 10.05 am. I was given a good idea of what Idi Amin's sister would be like. Really charming stuff! The worst part was this hotel isn't even cheap. Booking 7 weeks in advance we were paying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac108 per night which, back in England, I would expect to secure a family room plus breakfast in a half decent hotel. The lack of comfort, the sense of being ripped off and the lack of any attempt at service thoroughly ruined my first trip to Amsterdam.

We booked this Hotel fairly late and felt relieved having found somewhere to stay. The secret behind why it was the only place in Amsterdam left vacant was soon revealed. To this day, I am surprised that a room (which l would be more at home on a canal boat, being around 9ft square) cost 120 Euros per night. Especially given it had no toilet or shower. I ended up with the bed on the right hand side of the room. With the 30-degree gradient of the floor, gravity forced me that way. I could see that getting to the other side would almost certainly require special equipment. I unpacked my case and placed three t-shirts in the wardrobe, taking half of the 12inch capacity before sitting down on my bed (shelf). It felt a little hard so I pulled back the cigarette burned sheet to reveal the heavily stained \"mattress\". Clair Raynor flogs maxi pads thicker than what we had to sleep on. I suppose the good thing about being on my side of the slant though meant that I rolled into the wall. Instead of the floor. Thank the Lord for small blessings. Enough about my room though- we got chatting to some people during our stay who told us about their room, which came free with a little friend, Rudolf. Rudolf the Red nosed Cockroach (so named because of his Antler like tentacles) I asked how they found the place apart from that and they mentioned they'd been trying to get friendly with the South African reception guy the night before.
