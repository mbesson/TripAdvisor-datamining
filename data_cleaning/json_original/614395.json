I usually go for the higher rooms with balcony ovelooking the main street with nice view without being too noisy . They provide excellent toiletries used to be from the White company but the latest range is equally good. The staffs ate friendly and since being under H10 wing the service is better.

Great location to visit the tourist sites...kinda noisy with the road...a few loud ambulances, but not that bad. The rooms are big and have nice beds for European standards. One thing that needs to be fixed is their showers! They are typical european half enclosed with a wall and half open to the rest of the bathroom. The spicket that shoots out water does not point down. As a result, you have to hold the shower sprayer at all times. You get water all over the bathroom...we put down 2 towels and that seemed to help. The only other complaint is kind of petty, but the scrambled eggs at the breakfast are bad...they are fake eggs and taste strange. Also, they don't have American coffee. The coffee they have tastes like espresso on steroids! We couldn't bear to drink it.

When we arrived to check in at this property, we were told our room was not ready and could we please wait in the lobby. In retrospect, this was a bit of a red flag. We sat down in the very beautiful lobby and waited. Having been so vigilant about security, I disappointingly let my guard down here and didn't hold on to one of my bags (putting it on the floor in front of me). A few minutes later, there was an insistent tapping on the glass behind us. After multiple annoying taps, I turned around to see a man on the street waving a key chain at me, asking if I had dropped it. I shook my head no, and when I turned back around, my bag was gone. I immediately asked some other guests if they had seen anything, and they confirmed they had seen a few men loitering inside. I ran to reception and was greeted with a very uninterested staffer who told me that I should \"be careful in Barcelona, especially downtown\" because there are thieves. Great advice EXCEPT I HAD JUST BEEN ROBBED IN THE LOBBY OF THIS VERY HOTEL. He gave me a map to the police station and told me there was nothing they could do. When we returned from filing our police report, another manager came up and apologised. She said they had reviewed security footage and we had indeed been robbed by a team of about four men, three of whom had been casing the lobby. They let us have free access to the wireless internet, but that was the only concession made to us by the hotel. We only stayed one night and left early the next day to get a new passport in a different city. I sure hope the thieves enjoy my seven year old iPod, diary and sweater, because that's basically all they got. Lax security aside, the hotel is indeed very well appointed and the rooms are lovely. I understand we were unlucky and the theft wasn't necessarily the hotel's fault, however I would advise against staying there due to the behaviour of the staff after we were robbed.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay - Close to the City Centre\u201d", "Author": "SV-1979", "ReviewID": "UR126172910", "Content": "H10 Casanova is located just 10min. walking distance from Plaza Catalunya.

We took the bus to and from the airport, which was very easy with bus stops very close to the hotel.

We stayed in a courtyard room, which was very quiet at night - not disturbed by noise at all. We were offered a balcony room when checking in and the receptionist seemed very surprised that we wanted to stick with the courtyard! However, the front-facing balcony rooms are on the main road so although you get the view we thought it would be too noisy at night for us. We didn't have a problem with the shower as some others have mentioned - we had an enclosed glass shower rather than a wet room, which was great, although it didn't have a shelf on which to place toiletries, which was a bit strange. The bathroom was huge and had a proper hairdryer rather than the usual ineffectual hotel ones! Very clean, safe, nicely designed public areas. Be aware that the main doors are locked at night (not sure what time) so you have to ring the bell to get in but the security guy does sit right by the door so will open them quickly for you! I would say that this is an absolutely great hotel if you want efficency, trendy rooms/communal areas with good design features in addition to the four-star amenities you would expect.

Overall, though, it\u2019s quite funky, quite modern, clean, good breakfast buffet and it\u2019s in a good central, location, particularly if you want to explore Gaudi (Casa Battlo and Sagrada Familia are at easy walking distance). The service was superb! Friendly, helpful, competent. It\u2019s gay friendly, everyone friendly, really. My one major issue was that a lot of the room face the Gran Via Cortes Catalanes, which is busy and noisy. I had asked for a quiet room, but the hotel was full so they just couldn\u2019t accommodate my request. I sleep lightly so that made sleeping nigh impossible for me the first night. We moved to another room facing the courtyard for the remaining nights and slept beautifully. I think other reviewers have mentioned the little strange details (like you can\u2019t stop the water from running out onto the floor from the shower), but my partner (who has travelled throughout Spain more than I have) suggested that the building itself and level of comfort is of a high standard for Spain. For the practical bits: Casanova is right between the metro stops Universitat and Urgell, a 5-minute walk from either of them and a 10-minute walk from Plaza Catalunya. The airport bus stops at Universitat coming from the airport, so it\u2019s very easy to find! There are a few good restaurants up in Eixample, a short walk from Casanova, but we found they were generally quite pricey. There\u2019s a pharmacy on the opposite side of the road, a little grocery shop nearby and bus no 50 (which takes you to the Joan Miro Foundation) goes right outside. If you aren\u2019t bothered by traffic noise or can guarantee a room facing the courtyard, I would recommend this hotel. Best: the fantastic service.

I struggled very hard in what I would rate as I really do think they tried hard to make our stay a good one. Let me first say that the location is ok, you are about 15 minutes to Plaza Catalunya and the edge of La Ramblas. I would not say that it is that much quieter than staying closer to the action though, if you want less noise, ask for an inside room, the outside rooms are facing the street and it is one of the busier streets. Getting to hotel isn't too bad, in general I really liked how easy it was to get from airport to central Barceona, just take the Aerobus on the ground level and it stops at the 4 major spots ending in Plaza Catalunya.and costs 5 EUR or so each way. This is a nice boutique hotel, nice clean rooms of average size. I never tried the breakfast so i cannot comment on that. We did have drinks and food in the restaurants a few nights as well. Their sign saying \"free tapas with first drink\" is abit misleading, they will give you their choice of a tapa but it is only one per group. So if you go their with a group and expect to get one per person and the one of your choice, you will be disappointed. The prices are abit high considering where they are as you can go across the street or even to La Ramblas and get the same for less, including tapa prices. Service - the are all very nice people that work at Casanova, especially the Assisant Manager, Sarah, she is probably the best asset the hotel has. As I have said nice things about the hotel, I will now outline the things they lacked service wise to justify the rating that I gave them: Day 1 - Our plane was delayed so we didn't arrive at the hotel until around 8:30pm. We found the hotel very easily and went to the front to check in. I had booked us for a non smoking double/queen room. When we went to our room, the first thing we noticed was it had been smoked in, all you non smokers would know what I mean, and if you have asthma, it is even worse! We went back to reception to ask for another room, the one guy working at reception then tried arguing with me that it was a non smoking room! Well, I asked him to come to the room with me and then he knew I was right. They did not have a room available with a double or queen, so they had to move us to a room with two twins and promised they would move us to a room with a bigger bed the next day. Day 2 - I woke up and went to reception asking to see when the new room was available. they informed me after people are completely checked out, so mid afternoon around 3pm. I told her that we would be touring the city and we agreed that we would pack up all our stuff and keep our belongings inside our room and move it when we got back. This was better for us as we had our passports and valuables in the safe. We toured around and came back around 7pm. I went to reception and once they got through all the confusion that we were allowed to move (you think they'd actually talk about it with the differents shifts), they gave us a room. My wife and I went to our old room to grab our stuff. When we went to our room all of our luggage was gone and they had checked in someone else into our room!! AND TO MAKE IT WORSE, they felt they had the liberty just to open up our safewith their master key and leave it for the new guests, so now, not only did they allow someone to check into our room, all of our confidential information and valuables were left open for the people the checked in, including alot of jewelery and money. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. Thankfully the people who checked in after us didn't take anything or maybe they hadn't seen the safe yet. We went back to reception in panic to find out where our belongings were and to ask them why they would just open up the safe and leave it wide open??? They could not explain and did not seem too concerned by it as we were quite concerned, especialy for our passports. They then realized they took the liberty to move our belongings to the new room with a double without letting us know, but did explain why they would just leave the safe open for people to go through our personal valuables. Thankfully after much grief we located our belongings in the new room and went through our valuables, and found our passports, etc. The only thing that was missing was my sunglasses and some food and snacks that i purchased. I had informed recpetion of this and they told me they would try to locate it. Day 3 - I went to reception to ask about my sunglasses and snacks. They informed us that the snacks were thrown out but they would just let us by the snacks and reimburse it for us, which was around 10 EUR. But my sunglasses were no where to be found. they checked with housekeeping and claimed to check the room again and said they could not find it. I wasn't happy about it and they said they would look again during the day. We got back in the evening and ask them about my sunglasses. After much confussion again, as they thought I had found them, they sent people to see if it was in the lost and found and checked the room again. They could not find it. and could do nothing to help me out. One of those \"your words vs ours\" - they could not prove I actually lost my glasses. This upset me a little as I know i was not trying to make a false claim. But I understoood where they were coming from. My only response if Casanova Management is reading this is: \"NONE of us would be in this situation if they would have had better communication and not moved our belongings and opened up our safe for everyone to have access to in the first place. Not like I just left my room door open, they checked somone into our occupied room and used their master key to open up our safe!!! \" They could have at least offered a complementary breakfast or supper at the least to help us out for our trouble. They did not offer us anything. So now i was missing my sunglasses because of all the moves and not going to get compensated for my loss, wasn't my fault I had to make so many moves if they would have done things correctly the first time. Also upon touring around we came back to our room to find the maids had not cleaned it, so now we had to ask for new towels, soaps and shampoos. The guy at reception then argued with me that maybe we had the sign on the wrong side.... AGAIN i was 100% confident that i didn't. I went upstairs and looked at the sign and it was clearly on \"clean my room\"!! Don't know why this guy liked to argue so much. Day 4 - They reimbursed us our 10 EUR for our snacks they lost, but nothing else, we consumed hours dealing with our issues on OUR HOLIDAY, which really frustrated me, not like were were in Barcelona for a few weeks, 4 days isn't alot so 4-5 total hours dealing with issues is not fun. To summarize, we moved rooms 3 times, had my sunglasses lost during these moves, had to go buy snacks again, didn't get our room cleaned and had to go back and forth for supplies, Management should realize things like this are very annoying when on holidays. No compensation for our lost time or just to say \"I'm sorry we inconvenienced you they way we did\" it was an ok stay, the room we finally had was loud, lots of screaming at nights and traffic going back and forth. Other than Sarah, the rest of the people did not communicate well and did not follow through on much. They are very friendly and helpful but just did not know how to deal with problems. So if you have problems you will see the lack of knowledge and customer service. They never asked us ever our names, so it was obvious we could just say we were in a certain room and they would have given us the room key. Very poor security. Not to harp on it too much, but when traveling internationally, certain valuables and passports are your prized possessions, and to have them just open up your safe and leave it open is just WRONG. Overall, for the price we paid, and after knowing the streets and noise issues, etc, I would likely have stayed closer to La Ramblas as there are literally hundreds of hotels around there. I know i had a choice of about 10 highly rated trip advisor hotels within the $10-20 of eachother, next time I will try them out instead. I liked the people at Casanova but I would personally want to find a a hotel that can deal professionally with problems when they arise, I just don't feel they are that competent when it comes to deal with issues, especially SECURITY issues.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, great location\u201d", "Author": "GenuineJudge", "ReviewID": "UR75792194", "Content": "This hotel is very unassuming and you might miss it outside as there is no real sign howvever it is a classic example of a fantasic boutique hotel.

The restaurant is also quite good and offers a good selection of tapas. In terms of location, the hotel is not more than 5 minutes walk from University Square, where you can get on the metro... or get a Starbucks coffee! You can walk to Catalunia Square within 10 minutes or so and from there you can get on to La Rambla or one of the sightseeing buses which will take you round the main sights of the city. Taxis are quite cheap and you can get them anywhere. If you are using a taxi to get to the airport, the receptionist at the hotel wil be happy to call one for you, but make sure you have plenty of time to spare as our taxi was about 10 minutes late due to early morning traffic.

I had a slight problem with one other male receptionist who came across as very abrupt and unhelpful, telling me simply to get a taxi to the airport rather than providing me with details of the much much cheaper Aerobus.

We had an assortment of meats,cheeses, Spanish Omlet, pastries along with juices, milk and coffee. We didn't notice until the second day at breakfast that near the hostess station was an American Breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon.

Long Read.\u201d", "Author": "NEFAST", "ReviewID": "UR45288947", "Content": "Prior to booking my trip, I read many reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor, and based on the positive reviews, booked a room for 4 nights in Barcelona. We did not request the breakfast at an additional charge. The room is small but comfortable and clean. My gripe with them was with other issues, mainly having to do with the customer service. When I arrived, I wanted to connect to the internet to make a Skype call to the U.S., only to struggle to connect - they have an ethernet landline available that was included in the price of the room, not Wifi. Called reception on two separate ocassions asking them if there was anything I needed to do - set up a log in, password, etc. They said, \"just plug in the cord and you should be able to connect\". My Wife called again and asked the same thing. Continued to play with the computer to see if I could connect and called reception again to ask them if they could send someone up to help me and they said no one was there to help me with that and that all computers are different and they couldn't do anything. After almost two hours of trying to connect and not being able to connect, we went out to spend the afternoon around Plaza Catalunya and get something to eat. When we returned that evening, I tried for another 30 minutes to connect until I got fed up and went down to the reception, to let them know I NEEDED to connect to the internet and had requested assistance three times previously and had received no help. There were three people at the reception desk at that moment. Two of them were unsure about how to help me and could not do anything. The last person was helping someone else at that moment, but we he finished, he handed me a sheet of paper on how to configure my IP address in order to be able to connect. At that time, and only at that moment, did the lady behind the counter say - \"oh, is your computer from the United States? We seem to have this problem a lot with people who come from the United States. If you configure the computer using these directions, you will be able to connect, no problem\". I gave them a short and polite, but very pissed off \"thank you\" and went to the room where I was able to connect within 5 minutes. Thank you Casanova Hotels for wasting 3 hours of my trip to Barcelona, just so I could connect to the internet to check on my 1-1/2 year old son and mother entrusted with his care during our trip. During this whole time, they also offered me a Wifi card, for 9 Euro an hour, so I could connect wirelessly. So the lesson here is, landlines may be tricky, or this particular hotel's internet configuration was tricky, but the issue was how they dealt with my request for help. And also I learned make sure the hotel say WIRELESS internet connection included so I don't have to try to guess how to configure my computer to connect to the internet. Sorry, Casanova - I forgot my crystal ball at home so I could magically decipher how to connect to your network. My other gripe was the room service food, but this was our own fault. After spending the whole day walking from site to site, we were exhausted one night and decided just to get room service. Terrible idea. But, once again, our own fault. Who gets room service in Barcelona when there are so many amazing places to eat? Well, we were just wiped out from the day and thought we could have a quick bite and go to bed early. We figured \"how bad could it be\"? The answer was: Bad. The food was just not good, but more importantly: They put some condiments on the room service tray - ketchup, mustard, mayo. Two of them were open and had previously been used. The kitchen decided it was ok to close the lids on them and just send them back up to another seemingly unsuspecting hotel guest. You want to know how I knew they were used? Aside from the seal being broken on the lids - the mayo had a glob of ketchup frmo the last guy who as scooping up his burger, or whatever he was eating. Needless to say, we lost our appetite. At this point, what's one to do? If these are the hotel practices, the complaining will not do anything to fix it. It didn't help much with my previous issue, but I figure I can warn others so you will take this information into consideration when evaluating this hotel. Aside from that, I guess the place was ok.

I called directly and booked a Deluxe room with the Front of House manager, emphasising that this was the first break my wife and I would have alone since the birth of our daughter almost two years ago and we wanted a quiet room at the top. I was assured that all Deluxe rooms face internally into the courtyeard, and they would make the stay special. We arrived, big surprise for my wife (she thought we were staying at a friend's apartment), and checked in. On arrival to the room, I realised immediately that it was the basic level room and, worse, it was facing the street. I called down to tell them that a mistake had been made, and they asked to call me back. They did so within ten minutes, and basically said, yes, a mistake had been made, but there were no deluxe rooms available but they would give us a \"better\" standard room and breakfast thrown in for free. This wasn't good enough. I went down to the desk and emphasised that I had booked this directly through them and expected to be upgraded, or worst case scenario, found a superior room in a partner hotel. I have to say that the people I dealt with were extremely polite and courteous, and once they realised that I wasn't going to accept their original offer - which took some stressing - they said they would make every effort to accommodate us. We went for lunch and they said they would call me. I got a call within the hour saying that we would be upgraded to the next level above Deluxe, the Junior Suite - result! We continued our lunch, very happy. On return to the hotel, I was told that they weren't giving us a Junior Suite, but a Deluxe was available and they had moved us there. At this point, I didn't really want to argue the toss anymore, as it would otherwise spoil what was meant to be a romantic getaway. We had what we had booked, after a bit of an argument, and I feel that many other hotels just wouldn't have made this much of an effort to sort it out. The Deluxe room was great, nice modern layout and feel, and the manager had had the good sense to leave a bottle of champagne on ice to await us. The staff on the whole were exemplary, the cleaning service great. The one complaint about the rooms is that the doors are not soundproofed, so if there is a connecting door between your room and the one next door, then you can hear what's going on there. The location is good, ten minutes from Las Ramblas and less than five to the La Ravel, everywhere is eminently walkable. Without the rather negative experience at the start of the trip, I would have recommended this hotel without hesitation.

I booked the hotel via their on-line website. I had informed them that we would be arriving very late on Friday evening and to hold the room for us upon arrival. Previous comments on Tripadvisor were quite true. Modern hotel, very good location near Universitat Metro station and 10 minute walk (past Starbucks for the morning java) to La Rambla. Very noisy bar scene on the main floor on weekend nights so be sure to ask for a room higher up. The room was, indeed, very dark -- but that's the decor of the hotel room. Black / brown walls and not much lighting around the room. As noted on Trip Advisor, I think the shower pressure was the best I've ever found in a European hotel. We did, however, experience a few issues for which the hotel did attempt to resolve. We came back to our room late on Sunday evening and found the hotel room door propped open by the door bolt. Needless to say, we weren't amused. We contacted the hotel front desk and asked for someone to come up to the room to explain. The head housekeeper did come up and profusely apologize for the mistake -- she had done it herself as a reminder to another maid to do something in the room -- and had forgotten to close and lock the door. She was very embarrassed and apologized again and again, but with all the petty crime issues one reads about in Barcelona, you can only imagine our concern. Luckily, I had locked up everything of value in the hotel room safe. The hotel did, in fact, send up a bottle of champagne as a token of apology. When checking out, I was informed that the hotel accepts euro-denominated travellers' cheques subject to a 3% service charge. I never recall having seen anything on the check-in form or on the on-line booking form or on the website. This is hotel policy and may, in fact, be a policy for all Barcelona hotels -- but shouldn't they advise the client ahead of time? I chose to purchase travellers' cheques (in euros) in advance of the trip because of the petty crime / theft concerns and didn't experience any problems using them in Paris a few days earlier. Had I known in advance, I would have arranged other means to settle my account as using my credit card proved very costly with double conversion charges from euros to U.S. dollars and then to Canadian dollars (the currency of my card). Anyways, the clerk was very apologetic again but I had to use my cc. Thirdly, I noted that the fee I was charged was higher than that which was quoted on the on-line site. I did email the hotel upon my arrival home, pointed out the discrepancy in charges and they did reverse the difference very promptly. As for internet connection, the hotel is wired for wireless connection and will even lend you a laptop computer to take up to your room for two yours to use and check your emails / browse the web. All in all, a very modern, well located, hotel with dark rooms and great shower pressure. My only complaint is that they should have advised us of the 3% euro travellers cheque surcharge in advance.

The hotel is quite new, built in 2006. It's very stylish and modern and in the evening the giant sized candles that line the foyer are lit and give a nice ambiance. The room we had was again stylish and comfortable and i particularly liked the large walk in wet room type shower with mini bath and giant shower head! The room was a little on the small side but very comfortable and spotlessly clean and very nicely decorated if you like an ultra modern style. The only minor complaint i had about our particular room was that it was a little dark with not a great deal of natural light due to the fact that the long narrow window faced into an interior type court yard of the hotel, this probably works well in summer helping to keep the room cool, although the room has air conditioning. They have taken care to make the view from the window pleasant and positioned giant sized planters with colourful flowers just outside the window and these planters light up at night! I managed to glance into other rooms and noted that these were not as dark and had much larger windows. We took a room at the rear of the hotel as i had seen on this site that there may be a problem with noise. We had no problems and it was very quiet at night. Thought that the cocktails in the bar were a little overpriced at 9.50 for a small marguerita. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant and the food was fresh and well cooked.

The bar is quite stylish but the drinks can be lethal depending on who is serving them.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Location, Good staff, Poor Restaurant\u201d", "Author": "RossCornwall", "ReviewID": "UR17311309", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 3 Nights, and Location was Very Good and we where able to vist many different attractions.

The bed was massive with well appointed rooms in general. Some observations: the rooms to the rear of the hotel are quite dark and have no view, it\u2019s a 10 minute walk to the top of the Rambla and 20 minutes to the central area. I would recommend this hotel however if your after a really central location I would pick Hotel 1898 or one of the hotel on the Rambla as it quite a stagger back last thing at night. Few Points on Barcelona, taxi is the easiest way to get from the Airport its around 20 euros and worth it with big suitcases, the underground system is brilliant, cheap efficient trains run every five minutes and walk along the Rambla but don\u2019t eat there, its expensive and there are far better restaurants a few blocks away.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, Surrey", "Title": "\u201cThe Great Times...\u201d", "Author": "Balliolensis", "ReviewID": "UR16943897", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading several positive reviews on TripAdvisor. We can confirm that the hotel is very stylish, relatively inexpensive, the staff helpful and the location ideal for seeing the sights of the city.

The bathroom was clean, modern and well-fitted; large shower head and clean bath in a wet room. The bedroom itself was not particularly spacious but was comfortable, the air-conditioning worked efficiently, the bed was large; in short, it was exactly what we wanted after a long day of sightseeing.

Comfort, decor and size of the room is above average and the bed a joy to sleep in. I stayed on a room only basis and found the cost of eating in the hotel prohibitive ( 20 euros each for a continental breakfast ?) and found god option for a cheap breakfast directly opposite the hotel.

The hotel is very conveniently located on Gran Via, about a 10 minute walk from the school and Plaza Catalunya. Barcelona has a well-deserved reputation for stylish hotels, shops and restaurants - and the Rafael Casanova lives up to the city's high standards. The hotel boasts a very funky and comfortable lobby/bar that is perfect for lounging at the end of a long day of shopping or sightseeing. The staff are friendly, particularly the regular doorman. I had asked for a quiet room because I would be studying, so I was given a room on the 3rd floor facing the courtyard. This limited exposure to noise from the street, but unfortunately the sound insulation between rooms and between the rooms and the corridor is poor. When people came back to the hotel late at night, it sounded like they were talking (loudly) right beside my bed. Overall, the noise levels didn't bother me, but if you noise bothers you be wary of booking here. The room itself was great - very comfortable and stylish. While the desk was small, the room came equipped with side tables you could pull over the bed - perfect for bedside reading or computing. I appreciated the fact that broadband internet access, if you connected to the network via a cable loaned by the front desk, was free. It cut out a few times for brief periods but overall it worked very well, as I needed it to, for work purposes (because I had to stay connected to the office even while on holiday). The best feature of the room was the bathroom. Again, the decor was great and it was of a good size. It came stocked with robes, good quality towels and toiletries from \"The White Company\" - the only minor disappointment is that the hotel provides only a combination shampoo/conditioner, which I dislike. The best feature of the bathroom was the bath/shower arrangement. It took up half the bathroom and was enclosed in glass. There was a large comfortable bathtub and beside it, a tiled shower area with a powerful shower equipped with a rain showerhead. I loved that shower - and regretted the fact that my husband wasn't in Barcelona to enjoy it with me. Aside from the minor irritant of the lack of sound insulation, the only other negative aspect of my experience at this hotel was the reservation process. I tried to book directly on the hotel's internet website but balked at doing so when I realized that the hotel wanted me to provide my passport number (and to do so on a page that wasn't secure - before moving to a secure page). So I called the 1-800 reservation number and was faced with the same request for a passport number. The booking agent stated that it was part of a policy, a \"legal requirement\", to ensure that foreign visitors didn't leave the country without paying their bills. Yeah, right. I'm willing to provide a passport number, only on check-in, when I stay in a foreign country as part of the hotel's obligation to register foreign guests with the local police. It is, however, contrary to a hotel's merchant agreements with credit card companies to require such identification as part of a credit card payment process - and I'm certainly not going to provide it as part of a hotel booking process. So I declined to do so and proceeded to book the hotel through Expedia (for a slightly better price and in US dollars, thereby avoiding the charges my bank levies for foreign currency transactions on my credit card). On balance, I'd certainly stay at the hotel again because it's such a stylish and convenient hotel, but I'm very disappointed with the hotel's reservation policy. I plan to raise the hotel's booking policy with my credit card company.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStylish boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Naraloo", "ReviewID": "UR14862347", "Content": "Very stylish hotel in a good location in Barcelona close to the University.
