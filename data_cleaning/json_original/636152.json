{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantatstic Locations and Value The apartment was very centrally located, very clean, and well maintained. The picture of it on the web matched the reality, and the bottle of wine and fruit as a welcoming gesture were appreciated. It had a lift for arrival and departure (the rest of the time it was faster to use the stairs). Great views overlooking the church, and around the corner from El Born, and the Gothic area. However, it is fair to say that the area itself is noisy, so if you are not a sound sleeper earplugs would be essential in any accommodation near here. The service was excellent - one problem was dealt with quickly and efficiently.I'm not sure what the corporate relationships are - although I booked through this company various other names appeared on pieces of literature and the bill. Highly recommended as a central, comfortable, and secure location.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714609381", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gwilliams"}, {"Content": "An excellent apartment... We booked this hotel through easytobook.com which worked out well: easy to navigate and quick responses.We had a late check in due to ryanair's lack of punctual flights and had to pay a late charge of about \u9227?7. I would highly suggest calling the reception when you are getting into the cab at the airport and then passing the phone over to the cab driver: it took a couple of minutes conversation in rapid Spanish for the cab driver to figure out where the apartments were. Traveling as a group of 3 young women, we waited in the cab for one of the staff to meet us at the office. The apartments are located just off La Ramblas; if arriving late at night be wary of the odd person stumbling around and keep your money hidden. First impressions of the entrance to the apartments does not reflect the state of the actual apartments: the entrance way was very dilapidated but I doubt that it is within BCN Daily apartment's jurisdiction to make any changes. The security measures (3 sets of keys to open 3 sets of doors) put us at ease. The apartment itself was lovely. We rented a triple room and it worked perfectly. Although the hot water tank was small, it was certainly do-able for 3 women to take showers in the mornings. Bathroom was tiny (knees touching the door) but fully functional. The fridge and stovetop (with cutlery etc.) was a welcome addition to the room as eating out can get expensive when on a restricted budget.Overall, an excellent accommodation experience that I would suggest highly.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479255956", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "elissa_riddell"}, {"Content": "Nice Great location for a start, dont be fooled by the looks of the entrance, the smell and the state of the building entrance will put you of but the apartments will compensate that, even though small they are brand new, well equiped and most important clean!

When we first arrvied at the location of the hotel it took us about 30mins trying to find the reception. What wasn't mentioned to us was that it is around the corner. But the locals were helpful to some point, to show us the right direction.Once we got our keys, I was shocked to see the state of the enterance. It looked like a crackhouse. The staircase was crumbling and ready to collapse and it had a weird smell as well.The room itself was ok, but the shower was appaling. You only get hot water for about 20minutes and there were some engineers outside trying to fix the air-conditioner in the next apartment who kept on looking in the bathroom window. Which was very worrying.The hotel is located in the back streets and I would strongly recommend that you walk fast and be very vigilant about people hanging around the enterance. Overall, I would not go back to this hotel at all. Try to book something on the La Rambla strip or in a built up area.", "Date": "Apr 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR622603661", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "deepak420"}, {"Content": "BCN Apartments ok We enjoyed our stay here. Good points: Location in relation to the Ramblas  Gothic Quarter. Clean, modern and comfortable apartments, good price and friendly staff. There are also some great little restaurants  taverns in the next street. Bad points: The street where the actual apartments are located is not the best, with some people hanging around outside  the entrance/hallway to the building smells  is in need of updating. We would probably stay here again. If you are staying here, remember to phone before you arrive  you check in around the corner, not at the address of the actual apartments.

My friend and I arrived on 11/14/2006 at approximately 1600 hours. After we arrived at the airport, we called the hotel to inform them that we were on our way to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, which was diffiuclt to find, no one was at the hotel to let us in. The hotel doors were locked. We waited for someone to show up, since we had informed them when we were to arrive. As we waited, we were told by employees at a local pub that the hotel was a bad place to stay. After waiting a half hour and noticing it was going to get dark, we looked for another hotel to stay at. The next day we went back to the hotel. We noticed the hotel, which had a small sign on the front door, was on another street covered in graffiti. The address was not the correct address given. The hotel's exterior looked dirty, old, and honestly, quite scary. The place looked like a crack house. We spoke to the manager the next day regarding the hotel being locked when we arrived. He was unprofessional, rude, and a liar. He acted like a slum lord and bully over the phone. At first, he would not refund the money for the reservations, but we were able to get the money from hotelclub.net. He also told us that we were supposed to contact him down the street at a certain address. When we looked for the address to verify his statements, we discovered he had lied. The address was non existent. The street it was supposed to be on was dirty and frightening and that was during the day. As two women traveling, I wanted to let other travelers know that it is not safe to stay at BCN Houses Daily Apartments. The hotel may have been affordable, it was not worth your safety and health.
