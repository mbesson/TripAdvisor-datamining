Rooms are reasonably priced but they are pretty tired and basic. Beds are very small (booked a double) and bathrooms are a bit too much like airplane toilets. Would benefit from a refit for sure. Downstairs bar is lively and decent plus the food is good. A touch on the noisy side at night.. even on the 3rd floor.

We walk in to find it very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed a few cold beers then decided to have something to eat, well that was the best. They are very accommodating and friendly, the prices are also very reasonable. I would recommend the Nachos they are the best I have ever tasted. It is also fun watching everyone walking in the street and coming back from the beach.

My first time in Sidney I stayed downtown so this time I wanted to stay at Bondi Beach. I could not have chosen a better location! The hotel itself sits above a bar so at night it was quite loud but I was so exhausted from traveling and siteseeing that it did not bother me. The room was very simple...nothing fancy by any means but still clean and comfortable. The location was directly across from Bondi Beach and my room had a great view and balcony. The staff was very friendly and helpful and taught me how to utilize the buses and also arranged for my transportation to the airport.

It was very reasonably priced, right on the beach clean and comfortable. I was concerned when I booked that the room did not have airconditioning however our room was at the front of the hotel , on the third floor and had its own balcony. This let us keep the doors open and enjoy the cool sea breezes. Air conditioning was not needed. I noticed whenever we went down the street level it was much hotter. The location was awesome - opposite the beach and walking distance to everything needed. A local bus stopped right outside the hotel that took us to all the Sydney sights.The ground floor of this hotel was like any ordinary pub - it had a bistro, beer garden, bottle shop and pokies venue. One street away was the local IGA. The negative to this hotel was that traffic noise from the street did invade our room. Also because our balcony faced the beach sitting outside in the morning attracted sun glare. So my advice would be to request a room at the back of the hotel. If it is summer time make sure it has its own opening to the communal balcony. We did not have one negative experience from any of the staff members.

We were going to walk the coastal walk to Bronte while the 'Sculptures By the Sea' exhibition was on. The room offerred during the booking process was at the front of the building with own section of balcony, but we asked for a quiet room at the back and got a deluxe queen which was 2 weeks old. They had turned 3 rooms into 2 with the middle room turned into 2 very nice private bathrooms. The brand new TV didn't work so we got a $20 refund the next morning. We bought a bottle of wine and sat on the communal part of the balcony and watched the passing parade of Halloween costumes, more entertaining than the TV anyway! Options for accommodation right in Bondi are few, so this was a good find. Ask for the deluxe queen at the back of the building and you should sleep well. We'd go back.

The walks were great to Bondi to Bronte is a heavenly one.Of coarse the best thing was the beach and being able to walk to Bondi Junction for great shopping.

Our stay was riddled with inconsistencies and the hotel reception staff,whom were extremely rude and had no idea what they were doing, with the exception of maybe two. Time after time my friends and I were left frustrated and in awe at the incompetencies we witnessed. Something as simple as getting a receipt proved a chore and we were even charged twice on one card, this, as you can imagine, threw the staff into total dissaray. The rooms themselves were very basic for the money paid and air conditioning seemed to be the luck of the draw, some rooms had newer machines that kept the rooms cool whilst others had more dated air conditioners that did little more than push the hot air that already made the rooms so uncomfortable around the room. For a hotel located right on Bondi beach, in the height of the Sydney summer, this was highly unnacceptable. The only pluses with the hotel were the convenient location for meeting friends for a few drinks or getting to the beach, literally across the road. Other than that, it had nothing going for it, the food was over priced and you could get the same dish yards down the street for a few dollars cheaper. If location is your only concern and being able to fall in and out of bed to the bar in a sweaty heap appeals, then this is the place for you.
