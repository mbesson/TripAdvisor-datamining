The only issue with the hotel at large is that you could not take your breakfast to your room and there wasn't enough seating even on a weekday.

My biggest complaint is that housekeeping didn't arrive to clean our room until late afternoon on the first day..okay, we were in and out, so no problem. The second day, however, we were gone from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Arrived back to put little one down for nap and room still not clean. When I went to the office to request that housekeeping wait to clean our room till very late in the day when we would be leaving for shows, I was informed that housekeepers left at 4 p.m. and they offered to just give me a towel exchange. Basically, since they hadn't cleaned the room during the 5 hours I was out, either my room wouldn't get cleaned or the kiddo wouldn't get a nap - my choice! It is a great location, beds a bit too mushy soft for my taste, an adequate room but definitely no luxuries, doors open to the exterior so you do get some outside noise and if someone is on the sidewalk smoking, it comes in your a/c vent.

Ha! Who uses an ironing board any more? I can bet, though, if you really need one those nice people at the front desk could round one up. We chose the \"value double queen\" on the second floor. For our less than $60 we got a 25\" tv with 64 channels, microwave, fridge (large by motel standards!, includes small freezer area and 3 shelves plus triple levels of storage in door), solid wood luggage holder (vs those tv table types that fall down as soon as you put your luggage on top), two pillow top queen beds, a vanity/sink with coffee maker, and bath with extended round shower rod that makes the shower/tub feel much larger. I had read a review that no soaps were included, but our room had a tiny soap for the sink and a hair/body/face wash dispenser in the shower. Bring your own name brand, but this works in a pinch. The room was spacious! It comes with a small wooden \"card\" table which is perfect for eating take-out (don't you hate having to eat in bed??), working on your laptop with the free wifi, or, of course, playing cards. :-) There is a nice sized rack on the wall for hanging clothes; the hangers are not removable so you don't have to worry about the last guest walking off with them. There are three large storage drawers under the tv. The a/c unit is not as loud as some, but if you are a very light sleeper it might bother you a bit. With all there is to do in walking distance, though, you should be able to come home and pass out. The AmazInn is across the street from a craft mall, which has a lot of touristy junk, and the IMAX theater which also shows first run movies on a regular sized screen. The IMAX mall includes clothing, leather, and souvenir shops, a fudgery, a food court, and live music. You are also in walking distance to Red Lobster, Golden Corral, a hot dog/ice cream stand, and I think I saw a Taco Bell.

In my last minute search for the best deal I came upon Amazinn Inn. It is conveniently right off of the busy strip, which is what we liked the most about it. They had a good promo price online so we booked it. Upon arrival we submitted our AAA membership card because they offered discounts for AAA members. We were told that since we got the best rate possible that they could not give us our AAA discount. I mentioned that we signed the guest book online, which offered a discount for doing, and requested that discount to be accounted for. Apparently if you sign the guest book AFTER you have made the reservation online the discount is not valid until your next stay. We are not overly frugal by any means, but a discount is a discount. We could have stayed anywhere in Branson, believe me they have hundreds of places to choose from, I think this hotel has lost sight of that. Besides lack of customer service the staff surprisingly didn't know anything about Branson. We talked to both clerks at the from desk and asked about best shows, best restaurants, best attractions, etc. Neither of them could suggest anything except for a steakhouse down the road that usually has a lot of cars in the parking lot. They gave us some brochures and wished us the best of luck. (Thank God for Trip Advisor, we got on our iPads and found the best of everything in Branson!) We went to our room, without our discount, and found it to be clean. The room decor is outdated, but the bed was very comfy. Beware of the description of the size of the beds. We supposedly had double queens in our room, They were more like glorified twin beds. The mini fridge kept all of our perishables and beverages cold. The coffee maker is one of those \"one cup at a time\" types. The pool is small, but it was clean. Pool could use a couple of more lounge chairs. We did not eat the free breakfast that was offered. We went down one morning to check it out. The staff was scrambling to keep up with the hungry patrons. They couldn't refill the food fast enough and people were waiting so we went out for breakfast both mornings. All in all the place is clean and inexpensive.

The next couple of days we would head back to the hotel from our day of activities and people would be sitting outside in the chairs out of their room smoking and make lots of noise.

One of the downsides of these types of rooms is the exterior entrance and the cement walkway from the stairs to the rooms. I was put in a room right at the stairs - so I heard every person who came and went including every rolling suitcase and running child. I'd recommend asking for a room at the far end where no one walks past you. The AmazInn isalso quite removed from most anything and everything that I planned to do while in town.

Sorry for the long review, but I try to remember to put in all the things I\u2019d like to know about. Booking: We pre-booked our room online through their website directly. If you book through their website and want to save a few dollars on the room\u2026make sure to register online for their e-mail/newsletter thing prior to booking and you get a cheaper rate. We paid $252 for three nights. I have yet to get any e-mails from them\u2026not that I particularly want any. Location: The location was on the red route. It is, as many others are, within a 5-10 minute drive of things to do. This route is definitely not as busy as the main strip of Hwy 76. The location was good. Check-in: The front desk was very friendly and helpful upon check in. The only thing was our reservation was under someone else\u2019s first name and not mine\u2026.happily there was no problem with getting our room. Just weird where did that name came from? Room: We booked the family deluxe (first floor with microwave, mini-fridge, coffee pot and hairdryer), which has three beds but no sofa. The beds were some of the most comfortable beds we\u2019ve stayed in. I\u2019m sure it is due to the newer pillow-top mattresses that were had been told that were recently put in. The room was pretty clean. No obvious gross stuff such as mold, stained comforters, dust, or funky smell, etc. Thank goodness as cleanliness is tops at my hotel want list\u2026not that I haven\u2019t ended up staying in a crappy dirty hotel before. My daughter did however find some items like a baby doll bottle and cup, that weren\u2019t ours, under our two beds when we were checking for items we may have left behind before checking out. TV and A/C worked fine. We did have a little trouble with the satellite clock but the front desk promptly switched it for us. We did require additional towels the last evening we were at the hotel. This turned out to be a small issue. I went to the desk and low and behold they had not an extra towel available. I was standing there with a dumb look on my face thinking how nasty it would be to use the towels we had just thrown in a heap, in the bathtub, to dry off with again in the morning!? Yuck! A light bulb went off in my head and I asked if we could get some from another empty room next to us. Well thankfully they obliged and I was allowed to get a key and go get towels from another empty room. I did this myself they did not offer to do it. So no over the top service\u2026which, I guess, I didn\u2019t mind, thinking of the clean towel I\u2019d be able to use, was worth it! LOL Also, they allow pets. The room next to us had a barking dog. It barked everytime we'd walk by. I was thinking... oh jeez...we'll have to listen to that all night. Thank goodness the owners were either back in the evening or the walls were pretty thick as it's barking did not bother us at night. Pool/Hot tub: The day we checked it the hotel was extremely full and so was the pool. The pool is a nice size, but no frills. It appeared clean. I did not swim in it but our girls did daily. They said the pool temperature was a little warmer than a typical refreshing swim during the day, but still felt good\u2026but said was wonderful in the evening after a day full of events. There was a hot tub and it was functioning properly during our stay. No lifeguard on duty\u2026which is normal for hotels and it closed at 11pm, although I don\u2019t believe they strictly enforce it. Laundry: The hotel has a self-laundry that has two washing machines and two dryers. They have no washing products to buy in the laundry room. You can buy a one-load powder tide or a 2 sheet per box dryer sheets from the front desk. No Clorox is available there. The products were $1 a box. My husband took me to Walgreens (5-10 min away) and we purchased a small bottle of soap and Clorox. This was much more economical for our multiple loads of laundry\u2026two loads a day! Hey I have two girls! LOL Internet: I did not use the Internet but they had a computer in the lobby that could be used by adults over 18. It seemed to work fine as there seemed to be someone using it all the time. Continental Breakfast: Unfortunately, my dear husband is the only early bird. The three mornings he got there and ate before us girls got up he said the breakfast was just what other reviewers said. Just average. There was cereal, bagels, muffins, boiled eggs, biscuits, and gravy and fruit salad. Us girls managed to go to breakfast two mornings. The first morning we got there pretty late. The breakfast ends at 9:30. And when they say 9:30 they mean it. Things are being put away before that very time. At about 9:20, no fault to them, we walked in and there was hardly anything left to eat. No biscuits or anything but some eggs, cereal\u2026but no milk, and maybe a couple muffins. So defiantly go at a decent time if you actually want to eat. The lady in charge of breakfast is just what other reviewers stated too. She seemed very put out to be wiping tables and when something ran out\u2026well tough luck. She\u2019d roll her eyes when people would ask if there was any more biscuits and gravy. She\u2019d say that it would take twenty minutes to get some ready so they weren\u2019t doing anymore. Some people were pretty upset with her. She told us that she couldn\u2019t believe people were just so messy and she wouldn\u2019t put up with it in her home! She scared me a little! LOL Could be she was having a bad couple of days. Either way, we made sure to hand wipe the table before we got up to leave! I guess the included continental breakfast is just that\u2026very continental, very bland but also very free. Overall: It was a pretty clean hotel for a decent price. It was very comfortable. Front desk service was pretty good but the breakfast lady gave, I wouldn\u2019t say poor service as kind of crabby service. We have been to Branson four times and stayed at Twelve Oaks Inn, Lynina Inn, Amazinn & Suites, and one other so long ago I don\u2019t recall the name. I\u2019m not sure if I would stay there again as we like to try out different locations, but would keep it in mind. Other info: This trip we also went to Hollywood Wax Museum, Titanic Museum, Go Kart tracks (Lumberjack & Wild-Woody), Silver Dollar City, Haygood\u2019s Concert, Montana Mike Restaurant and Fall Creek Restaurant.

The staff was very friendly. The free breakfast won't win any awards, but it's free. Bagels, biscuits with gravy, hard boiled eggs, cereals, juices, donuts, etc. A fruit salad that looked so-so. So not the best, but not the worst either. When we first checked in, the room smelled very bad. Not sure if it was a chemical they used for cleaning, or to cover up someone smoking (in a non smoking room). Couldn't really identify it, only that it was very unpleasant. We did not tell the front desk. By the next day it finally went away. We were on a tight budget, so this one of the hotels we found affordable and it was a good choice.

Oh, don't forget to get an after show ice cream at the ice cream shop (Dremi Creams) right in the parking lot!", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "rural oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cOdor was terrible\u201d", "Author": "spruce52", "ReviewID": "UR21308950", "Content": "The hotel looked clean, lady at the desk was nice, but when we got to our rooms, the odor was nauseating. Both rooms had a strong odor like body odor. Another person staying there said their room smelled also, but they were going to try to stay. We opened the doors for a bit, hoping the fresh air would take away the smell, but it didn't improve. My mother, 2 sisters, grandson and 2 nephews and I agreed that even though we would lose the money we paid for two rooms, we couldn't bear to stay there. We checked out after 1/2 hour and went to another hotel.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Springs Missouri", "Title": "\u201cStaff was very Prompt\u201d", "Author": "kadmonkey75", "ReviewID": "UR19678816", "Content": "II was expecting a lot less when I arrived we stayed for 4 days and had no major issues the room was clean the shower the bathroom was clean looked like nice heavy duty carpet the pool was nice (older pool but kept clean could use a better paint job around edge to make it look nicer) and the hot tub was working but Staff was needed to be called to clean it from the previous night @ 10:am when the pool opened up no biggy was cleaned within 5 mins. we had some unruley kids in the pool and the staff jumped on the problem and took care of it the room was a double queen it was clean and basic but the staff was helpful and kind we traveled with two small yorkies and had no problems they are a pet friendly hotel which is nice to have the beds where not that great (but I wasn't expecting the world's greatest mattress) but all in for the price I got I can not complain it is off the main strip on sheperd of the hills expressway so isnt to bad to get out and about the pool and hot tub stay open late so that you can enjoy it after a show or round of mini golf they have 2 floors per building with good access with stairs. I will go back and stay there the staff was kind helpful the front desk fixed any problem quickly and the only problem I had was the unruly Teenagers in the pool and the hot tub not being cleaned yet before the pool opened but I am sure that was just because I arrived there @ 10:am the cleaning staff made sure we had plenty of towels and TP paper", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "phil1963", "Title": "\u201cVery nice \"no frills\" place with a nice, clean pool\u201d", "Author": "63vettegal", "ReviewID": "UR17919260", "Content": "This was a very nice, inexpensive place to stay while seeing the sights of Branson. Centrally located and close to music, shows and great restaurants, this place was very clean and tidy and had a GREAT, clean pool. rooms were above average CLEAN and very nice for the $50 per night we paid. We will definitely stay there again. And the hot tub WAS working when we were there and very enjoyable after the sun went down! The pool was fantastic and very cool during the day and my son enjoyed it immensely. i highly recommend this as a no frills place to stay.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "AmazInn & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d1084013-Reviews-AmazInn_Suites-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$62 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3311 Shepherd of the Hills Expressway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1084013", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d8/36/d836ffb110025ed962f0be83afa3279f1large.jpg"}}
