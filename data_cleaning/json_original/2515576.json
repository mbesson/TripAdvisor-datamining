It used to be part of the Inn-Suites chain. It's located along El Cajon Blvd. between North Park and Normal Heights. It's a short drive from Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo, and not too far from the beach. They've been renovating the place over the last couple of years, and I question some of the decisions they've made. They've removed refrigerators and microwaves from many of the rooms, they removed the hot tub, and some of the decor is a bit stark, but the new beds are very comfortable, and the rooms now come with a flat screen TV and a clock-radios that has an iPod dock. I had an extended email conversation with the manager on some of the decisions. They are still (as of March, 2012) renovating the restaurant/bar/breakfast room, so they serve the breakfast in the very large lobby. It is very interesting--more like a European continental breakfast--with cheese and fruit and little muffins and croissants. There's an Olympic sized swimming pool in the center courtyard. It's a large, historic hotel that occupies an entire city block. Each room in the main building is named after a celebrity (mostly movie stars) from the past. They have free parking in two outdoor lots and an indoor lot in the basement. Room rates seem to have gone up recently, as the renovation progressed, but it's still a good value compared to other hotels in the area. In the northeast corner of the building is The Red Fox restaurant and bar. It is truly something out of the past, with a wooden interior allegedly brought over from England. The restaurant specialized in steaks, but they also have other entrees, and the prices are not outrageous. The adjacent bar has live music every night, sort of an amateur open-mike Karaoke, with most of the performers being old-time regulars. The music is mostly old standards from the 30s through the 50s. The Red Fox is worth a visit. There are also other restaurants in the area, especially in Hillcrest (near 6th & University) and in North Park (near 30th & University).", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cA San Diego classic\u201d", "Author": "Massimo1", "ReviewID": "UR128497474", "Content": "As I know San Diego quite well, I chose the Lafayette for the reasons of price, location, free parking and free wifi.

Nevertheless, freeway access is close by. The price was moderate for a small but comfy room with a large bathroom, plenty of electrical outlets, and flat screen TV.

In 2011 several friends and I stayed at the Lafayette based on recommendations from the promoter of a swap meet we attended. I booked a room beside the pool and we had a great time. It was warm, the sun was shining, and the beer flowed like water from a faucet. Security kept a close presence and we did have some complaints called on us but that was expected and we complied easily enough (no one wanted to be kicked out). The room/ suite that I occupied had a microwave, mini-fridge, 42-inch flat screen television, 2 queen beds, a couch, and a spacious shower. It was clean and comfy. Last year was awesome. This year (April 2012) I visited the Lafayette yet again. It was a good experience the first time around so seeing as how the live show my girlfriend and I were attending was only a mile or so away, we figured why not stay there again. The room was clean and tidy. We had a king size bed and the 42-inch flat screen was there. There were several comfy chairs and plenty of space for the two of us even though the room was half the size of the one I had by the pool.The bathroom had a hair dryer, plenty of towels, and was clean. The shower temperature was never static so one minute the water was lukewarm and the next scalding hot. I was always having to adjust. The bed was INCREDIBLY comfortable with large, soft pillows. I know neither one of us wanted to get up after lying in comfort for only a few minutes. And then suddenly it happened. There was a loud SCREECH and the room vibrated. We thought it was another earthquake (living in California, it's something you get used to) but then the same loud SCREECH and the room vibrated again. I looked out the window and saw that our room was directly over the parking garage beneath the hotel. As people drove in and out, the gates would raise and lower depending if cars were arriving or leaving. That drove me bonkers later that night and into the early morning hours. Also we seemed to be on the side of the hotel where every garbage truck in the city drove as well as hearing homeless people digging through the large garbage bins (placed conveniently beside the parking garage gates) throwing bottles and cans around, cursing at the top of their lungs. What I should have done the first time I heard it was ask for another room but at that time, we were in a rush to get to the venue and forgot about it until later in the early morning. Embarrassingly, the walls were a bit thin as well as my girlfriend and I listened in horror as the couple next door to us were being very loud and uh...intimate. And no, hearing them wasn't the horrifying part. The horrifying part was that we were uh...intimate that night and morning as well so it dawned on us that strangers were listening in on us as well!! Okay, so my second stay at the Lafayette wasn't as good as the first stay. I still give it 4 stars based on the first time around and now know better than to stay in that particular wing of the hotel. I'm not sure what that particular wing is called, but if you find yourself near or over the parking garage, you'll know you're in for a weird night. PS: I should add, price-wise, I paid about $100 for one night.

I spent a girls weekend here prior to their recent renovation. The hotel has that throwback vibe to the 40s, where you could imaging people wandering out of their poolside rooms to lounge and socialize at the pool. That was my first visit experience. Despite the rundown condition of the hotel, prison-style toilet, and far from fresh breakfast, I considered coming back. Our recent trip (last weekend), I booked my family and my sister's there, due to the great rate on Hotwire. It was a chance booking, but when I realized where I will be staying, I didn't mind at all. Finding out that they also have family style suites with bunk beds was a bonus. My family stayed poolside while I upgraded my sister to a family suite. Since my last trip, the hotel has a fresh coat of paint, decorator service, better bedding, carpeting, more outdoor furniture, flat screen tv, updated lobby, among other nice touches. I was excited to see all the efforts to freshen up the hotel without losing its mid-century charm. I was willing to overlook the condition of the bathroom (still prison style toilet), most power outlets not working, having to walk past a smelly gutter to get to my room, and dragging luggage up stairs. All was fine and dandy until I went out to pick up dinner for both our families on our last night and brought it back to my sister's suite. While we were eating, I saw an enormous cockroach crawled up the wall. The kids shrieked and my brother-in-law had to get up and dispose of it. To my horror, the kids said that it was not the first cockroach that crawled around in their room. My appetite was ruined and I was pretty upset. I didn't see any in my room, but my mind started to wonder if there are worse things crawling on our beds and floors. For all the money that they took to renovate the hotel, investing in exterminator service should be part of the investment. I really wanted to like this hotel and was willing to overlook most things, but I just couldn't overlook sanitary issues. I don't think I could bring myself to stay here again.

The Red Fox Steak House is indeed next door, but it looked tired and haggard. The biggest turn off really was the area surrounding the hotel. There were some seedy looking establishments replete with homeless people hanging out at a liquor store nearby. We ended up canceling our reservation and stayed elsewhere.

The remodeling is clean and the hotel is able to present clean, fresh and visually appealing rooms. For the price these rooms are hard to beat. That said, many little conveniences are lacking. Our room lacked a functioning heating unit. Not a great problem for us since it wasn't too cold and a space heater was provided. Only one waste basket. We asked for and received an extra one for the bathroom. Water from the shower was a little stingy and control was difficult. The bathroom was very small. Most serious deficiency for my wife, was the lack of a large mirror to put on makeup. The only mirror was a small one in the small bathroom which is fogged up after your shower. Ok, these are small inconveniences and for the price you do not expect luxury. The rooms are quite presentable and hard to beat for the price. Pool side rooms are larger I understand.

I liked that. Price - reasonable. $265 total for the three nights. The Bad - on both Friday and Saturday, there was a lot of noise from \"party people\" - young people who seemed to use the hotel as a gathering place for parties - very noisy. Also, on Sat. night there was a live band somewhere near my room that blasted away until 11 PM.

As we went past her...there were some decrepit beachy plastic chairs with some men sitting on them staring into space. It was exactly like being on hollywood blvd in the bad areas. They call the building 'hollywood style' but it is the same as i said, as those halfway houses or other places on hollywood blvd..that you would never go near. yes..maybe the main architecture is there..a giant pillar ot two...wider staircase...but thats about it. my room was wthe 'gary cooper room'! wow...unbelievable. ------------- my husband is the kind of guy who occasionaly eats at mcdonalds or gets a doughnut at ampm . I went with him to the 'breakfast' room. he then said he wasn't going to stay but would leave for work. 'why don't you eat here?\" i asked. he said, the food looked sick and he'd pick up a doughnut somewhere. wow! when he said that...it was my triple confirmation that it was not jsut ME who thought the 'breakfast' was horrendous. its basically a basement storage type room, that has the infamous plasticy 'waffle maker' , a vat of waffle 'dough'...dperessing bagels sitting in a plastic case, a bowl of waxy apples. i took one thinking..well if wash it..but the wax was so thick. it jsut grossed me out. when we arrived, and there was no parking, the guys tried there best to find one. (in vain) i felt sorry that they had to deal with things that were not their fault. they really tried though. you could tell they cared. one of the workers helped me bring a suitcase down from my room..so these guys were jsut doing their job.. so, there you have it, unlike the comfort suite inn i had stayed in that had a nice room but horrendous staff, this one had a horrendous hotel with one or two hard-working guys. basically , even if a hotel room had hairs or whatver and the palce was decent,,well things happen...but this place is decrepit....just falling apart,...literally,. hyou could tell they tried to cldean up the sofa in the waiting room...it was a thrift store type couch...but so gross even with the intended clean up...and the table was 70's brown completely chipped formica. as i said these things in and of themselves dlon't make the hotel bad or good..but jsut trying to paint you a picture that if you are looking for a decent 2 and a half star hotel...this isn't it. this is just plain gross and depressing. oh one more thing! prior to coming i read the reviews and a lot of people said, it was sort of a party place. i was worried about that...but when i called they assured me that it only meant that once in a while you could hear some sound...that the walls were not 100% sound proof but in general you could only maybe hear a sound from the cars or whatever. i could hear the suitcases and the conversation up and down the hall so this wasn't true. oh god! forgot this! my rrom had NO VENTILATION! The windows were patsed shut and the bathroom door facing the bed had a big giant square with slats in it. so basically No sound privacy at all when you use the bathroom..since there was no air outlet..they had that giant square in the door so the steam and smells from the bathroom could have a place to go. which is right into your room. that was one of the worst parts of the experience. i've never seen anything like that before.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, California", "Title": "\u201cFind a Motel 6, pay 3 times their rate, and it is still a better experience!\u201d", "Author": "yellow56", "ReviewID": "UR115942719", "Content": "without a doubt the worst hotel experience in decades, musky room smell, staff looking and acting as if they worked in auto parts house, quoted one rate then charged another, told there would be breakfast, then told there wasnt.

My boyfriend and I stayed here 1 night when we extended our vacation and the hotel we originally booked for was completely booked and it was one of the worst nights in a hotel we've spent. THE HOTEL: The hotel is located on a main street with parking around and underground. The parking seems kind of sketchy and i was really skeptical about leaving my car during our stay, but we found a parking spot right outside of our room so that made me feel a little better. The inside of the lobby is nice, but as soon as you walk out to the patio/pool area it is not all that great and i'm hoping they are planning on renovating that as well. When we booked our room we booked a king bedroom, when we checked-in they didn't tell us that the king bedroom wasn't available and that they had changed our room. The pool area is okay, looks kind of dirty though. THE ROOM: We got a non-renovated room and it was horrible!!!!!!!! Like I said, they had switched our room because the one we booked had a broken toilet so they checked us into a two bedroom suite with what i believe was two FULL beds. I sleep on a queen bed every night at home and the beds in this room were definitely NOT queen. The beds were really uncomfortable and the room was just disgusting. I felt dirty just sitting on the bed. The pictures I saw on another travel website didn't show any pictures of the rooms and the pictures on the website only showed pictures of the renovated rooms. so misleading and I had no idea what we were booking. The carpet was dirty, the paint on the walls were chipping, and the door looked like it was too small for the door frame. FREE BREAKFAST: Breakfast was bad, their breakfast room is in a conference type room with tables and chairs. The lights are low and the only things you have to choose from are bagels and DIY waffles.

They also helped us with finding interesting places to go around the city. Location: The location in the city is great because you are really close to absolutely anywhere you wanna be in san deigo. (we recommend old town, its great) its 3miles from old town, 4 from gaslamp, its really convenient. The surrounding of the hotel is not bad really. its actually got some cute little places. and its not scary or loud or anything like that. The breakfast is not bad. they had coffee, hot tea, cold water, and orange juice. they had bagels with cream cheese, butter, jelly. They also had some cereal and milk. and also waffles which were very good. best part were the waffles. We didnt use the pool or the gym but both looked really nice. The FREE PARKING is actually great. its underground parking with key entry. so very safe and close by. and of course free.

Like another reviewer stated, I wanted to like this historical hotel. However, when we drove up I wanted to cry. I can't name just one thing wrong with it, because there are so many!! I've heard it is under construction to update, but it is still horrible (plus, the only signs of work being done are some orange cones in the lobby, a couple of flyers regarding the work, and a plastic runner going up a stairway....on very very old carpet). The hall leading to our room went passed two offices where you couldn't help but look through the windows into rooms with messy desks. Next, when we opened the door to our room I was in shock! Depressing green walls, smelled bad, the bed was as hard as a rock (harder than the beds I've slept on in China, where they like their beds hard). I couldn't even sleep on it and spent two days with a sore back just from laying on it. Looking out the window from our room we were sickened to see an open concrete area with nothing but windows looking out on it. The only other things to see were a ladder and a maid/room service cart. The windows looked like they hadn't been cleaned in 50 years, with cracked glass and a totally messed up lock. There was hair on the bathroom wall, no counter space...only a small poorly place glass shelf directly above the sink (watch out when you wash your face or you'll hit your head!). After the shock of the room settled in we decided to check out the pool area. It looked NOTHING like the website, which boasted a beautiful setting. The first thing to see was the sign on the gate going in stating that people that are not staying there must pay $5. Does that mean anyone can come and use the pool? In short, the pool was as gross as the rest of the place. I wouldn't set foot in the pool and was totally overwhelmed with how depressing and filty everything looked. I've seen low income housing that looked better! After the first night we couldn't take anymore and checked out. At first one desk clerk told my husband that we would have to be out by 11:00. He told her we needed time to find another place and couldn't be out by noon. That appeared ok. However, when we went to check out another clerk indicated that it didn't matter when we were checking out. Hmm? I prefer hotels that are truthful upfront. Overall, even if they are fixing things up, there appears to be no pride in the condition of the entire hotel. They should be ashamed! At least they should take their pictures off the website, since they are nothing like what it really looks like.

If you stay there, be ready for an instant party in the pool from noon to six or eight pm and grab a lounge chair early because they will be gone quick. This is obviously an attempt to increase revenue, which I am sure does occur but for the management to take the last piece of goodwill left from the actual customers paying the high rates for a hotel in San Diego on the weekend is very short sighted and can only eliminate return customers.

That should have been my cue to leave. It was finally my turn to speak with the solo receptionist, a young lady that was very sweet.

I asked to be on the first floor as I have problems with my knee and didnt want to injure myself more.

None of the light switches worked and I was blind walking in, reaching for a light switch. The first spot with a light switch was the bathroom. I gagged when I saw it. Miss matched tiles, black grout...just plain dirty. When I made my way to the living area and was able to turn on the lamp, I was horrified. The bed was hold with a comforter boasting cigarette burns, the television was teeny tiny and there was a sofa with huge stains on it. I was in the room that is pictured on the Lafayette Hotel's website that is pictured overlooking the pool with a cute little table and flower overlooking the pool. There was no table on the balcony as pictured. Just two plastic broken chairs, overlooking a FILTHY pool!

However, I looked this hotel up on the web and went directly to their website. It is VERY deceiving. On their site, the hotel looks very elegant and beautiful with a colonial look. The rack rate for this hotel was listed as $149-$189 per night! So...we thought we were getting a real deal for around $80 per night. When we followed their directions, we came concerned when we started driving into a rather bad part of town, very commerical. the \"colonial\" hotel sets right on the street with a narrow circle drive in the front. The hotel was built in the 1040's and it looks like it has not been painted or updated in about 20 years. The front desk is very un-appealing - very institutional for lack of a better description. The front desk clerk told me that they were sold out the night before (surprise!!) and we could not check in before the 3pm checkin time. When we arrived around noon, they did however, allow us to use their restrooms to change clothes and then stored our luggage for us. When we came back, I wanted to see the room. He told me that since we were staying with them for a week, he could upgrade me to a 2-room suite! I said that was very nice, but could I see the room? Another gentleman took me to see this suite which ended up being 2 rooms, one with 2 beds in it and one with a worn out couch, curtains falling off the windows and a torn up table and chairs in the middle of the room! He took me to another \"suite\" and it looked the same. We had paid for the room in advance in total, so I ended up taking the standard room with 2 beds - it was the \"best\" of the three rooms I looked. The bedspreads were faded, bedskirts wrinkled and dirty and the carpet was soiled. So.....let this be a warning, don't always trust a hotel's website - they are not always correct! I would not recommend this hotel even to someone just staying overnight. It is worth about $30-$40 per night and is not as advertised. I feel confident that in it's heyday, it was a beautiful hotel.

After finding out what hotel we would be staying at, I have to say I was very concerned. The Lafayette has not done well on the review side as you will see if you scroll down. That being said, my expectations were pretty low as we pulled up Saturday afternoon. We intentionally came after getting signed in downtown at the Marathon, as we had read about problems relating to the Lafayette and early check-ins. We arrived about 2:30 (check in is at 3:00) and were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who quickly, upon learning we'd like the quietest room possible since we'd need our rest and have to get up very early on Sunday, upgraded us to a presidential suite. Now granted, I can't imagine a president stepping foot in this hotel but...it was clean, twice the size of what we paid for (a discounted room at about $65/night) and as promised, was in the quietest part of the hotel complex. Being a Southern California resident and fairly well acquainted with San Diego, I really think your like or dislike of this place will depend on your level of expectation, as well as doing the reading on sites like this in terms of what to expect. With that in mind, here are a few observations that I would put high on the list of things to note if you are thinking of staying here: 1) As you've probably read, this is an old building that apparently was going to be condo'd a while back and by the looks of the permit request signs on the front windows, is in the midst of being sold or having new management come in. As such, the rooms are not terribly modern. There are cracks in the walls. Fixtures in our bathroom were drooping a bit and it just had the feel of a very worn place. From what I could tell, most of the place sort of falls into that category. 2) With most of the rooms surrounding the pool area, this hotel is catering mostly to young people (or very care-free families). There is piped in music all day around the pool and while I almost have to laugh when typing this, the vibe is sort of a very wannabe Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas. Lots of 20 somethings taking in the sun and drinking/laughing/partying. 3) There has been a lot written about the neighborhood. Again, it is all about what you expect or perceive but frankly, I was very surprised after arriving there because I found it to simply be a middle class, albeit old, neighborhood. I went out both nights and never felt the least bit concerned for my safety. All this being said, would I recommend the place? For the third or fourth time, it would depend on what that person was expecting for their money. If I was flying the family out from Green Bay for a week in sunny Southern California for our big vacation would I want to stay here: absolutely not. For a family vacation I would do the research and find a moderately priced (if money was a big concern) chain hotel around Hotel Circle where I would know exactly what to expect and which was close to all the attractions. If it was a couple I knew who were also coming down to SD for a weekend to see a ball game or run the Rock N Roll Marathon, I would have no problem suggesting it. My expectations may be lower than some. Unless I am specifically looking for a fancy, upscale place, I can deal with an old and outdated place if it is clean and the price is right. This isn't too say that some of the nightmare's you're reading about didn't happen but I cannot say they happened to me. I was far enough away from the circus at the pool that my wife and I both slept well before the marathon (something that, given the high stress level, could be tough at any hotel). I even used our free drink tickets Saturday afternoon and hung out on the patio overlooking the pool for a bit. So...at the end of the day, my suggestion is simple: If any of the things you've read, really worry you (noise, location, old rooms, etc), you should probably just find a Holiday Inn rather than risk being disappointed. If you want a fun place to cut loose at the pool and hang out with your friends on the cheap, you'll probably love it. I am in neither group and for me, the negative hype did not live up what I was expecting (thankfully!!!) and although it's far from the nicest place I've ever been, it is not even in the ballpark with the motel (national chain even) that I stayed at when I ran the marathon here in 2002 (but that is a horrible rant for another time!).

The pictures looked great and when we first arrived at the hotel, it seemed to live up to its image. However, upon first entering the hotel we got a wiff of what smelled like raw sewage. Bad first impression. Check-in went smoothly and we were in our room quickly. We had a king suite which over looked the pool area, which is the best feature of the hotel, so again we were pleased and ready to disregard the bad smell of the lobby. The room was a little shabby, but clean. It was also nice having free internet access for my computer guru husband. That night, however, the problems began. First thing we discovered was that the heater in the room didn't work (which wouldn't be a problem any other time of the year, as it IS San Diego, but at Christmas time the weater at night gets down into the 40s and with a single-paned set of French Doors seperating us from the pool area, it got quite cold). I called the front desk and told them my room number (514) and explained that our heater didn't work and was a nice customer and didn't demand that someone come out and fix it like I should have, but instead just asked for extra blankets. It was only later that we learned that they had a list of rooms in which the heaters weren't working and ours wasn't even on the list! Which means that they were aware of the problem else where in the hotel and should have sent someone out when I called, even though I didn't ask them too. But that's just my impression of good customer service. On the second night we were too cold even with all the extra blankets that we learned that they couldn't 1) fix the heater nor 2) move us to another room as they were all booked out . Finally, I asked (they weren't doing a great job problem solving) if they might have a space heater they could lend us. And \"oh! what a good idea!\" was the response. So much for customer service again. So then in the morning of the third day, we received a notice under our door that at noon that day they were going to have shut off the water to the entire hotel to do plumbing work. After the water was turned back on we heard pipes banging all night long. We should have called that night to report the banging, but didn't want to be known as the \"trouble customers\" and hoped the noise might disappear on its own by morning. Unfortunately, it didn't. We received a phone call on the fourth morning letting us know that they were going to have to turn off the water AGAIN at noon. I reported the noises we heard and they said that that was why they were turning off the water again. We returned to the hotel that afternoon to discover that the banging hadn't stopped. We went to the front desk to ask for some sort of compensation. We had had to tolerate a freezing cold room, bad customer service, no water, and banging noises all night long. They said they couldn't give us any monetary compensation because we'd pre-paid through Orbitz, but that they could move us to another room. We went to look at the room and, wow!, it must have been the emergency back-up room, because although the heater worked, it was very loud when turned on, the view was of the roof of the floor below, and it was even more shabby then the one we had. So we decided to wait and see if the plumbing issue would clear up (as the front desk reassured us would happen). The front desk told us to call and have someone come over if we did hear anything. The noise did not clear up and when we called to have someone come over we were told that it was a \"temporary situation\" and that it would definitely clear up that night, but that they couldn't move us to another room because they were booked up again (so what would they have done with the guests who were currently in the room we had looked at that afternoon?). Anyway, all in all, the hotel looks nice from the outside and the staff, although nice, are unhelpful. It seems to me that they should definitely do some maintainance if they want customers to return.

We had booked second-floor poolside rooms for two families from August 19-25. We spent two nights at the Lafayette, then moved to the Westin downtown. The only reason we stayed the second night is because we missed the checkout deadline that day (because we were out looking for a new hotel). The \"public\" areas of the hotel appear to have been renovated, and the lobby is lovely. However, the renovation seems to have come to a standstill - not sure if they have changed plans, or run out of money, or maybe they have decided to tear it all down. There is no evidence that the renovation will resume, other than some reno plans hanging on the lobby wall. Whatever their plans are for the future, they have totally neglected necessary repairs and maintainance in the present. We had a number of small issues within the room - TV remote stuck on channel 3, lid on coffee pot broken, which meant the \"drip stop\" couldn't open and the coffee couldn't flow out (which I discovered after the basket overflowed!), tiny dirty bathroom, balcony door wouldn't lock, and so on. If we had decided to stay the whole week, I would have mentioned these things to management, but I just didn't care enough at that point. Another small thing - but a big thing to 5 children - they don't really have the popcorn and soda \"happy hour\" they claim to have. We asked the bartender about it, and he said they stopped that over a year ago. Another complaint from the children - the pool was filthy and full of hair. I didn't go in, so I have to take their word for it, but I did notice that the pool water was so murky that you couldn't see the lines on the bottom. The most puzzling thing about this place was the balcony floor - it was gravel! I don't know if it was an old surface that was crumbling, or if they actually sprinkled sand and gravel on the deck, but you could not go on the balcony in bare feet. And of course the gravel ended up on the carpet in the room, but again, we didn't care anymore. The area of town isn't any worse than any other area - you can find used condoms and needles on the streets downtown too. The problem we had with the area is that it's not within walking distance of anything. There aren't many restaurants in the area - we had Domino's pizza the first night because we got tired of looking for a place to eat. The second night we ate at In-N-Out Burger because it was near the mall we went to by bus. Denny's was the busiest restaurant in the area, which tells you something. We tried going to the Red Fox in the hotel, but it truly scared us. Sleazy doesn't begin to describe this place. \"Smoke-filled honky-tonk\" comes to mind. When I first chose this hotel, one of the deciding factors was that it is supposedly a non-smoking property. Not quite - the rooms are non-smoking, so people smoke by the pool, in the outdoor eating area, or on their balconies. We had smokers in the room next to us, so they did their smoking on our shared balcony. We couldn't even have our balcony doors open because of all the cigarette smoke. There were a couple of positive things, but not enough. The room was a good size, and it had queen beds which we found comfortable. This would be a beautiful property if the owners would either finish the renovation or take care of the little repairs. If they aren't willing to do that, a bulldozer is the only answer.

They told us to call back in a couple of hours, we did and they promptly replied no. We had a sick family member with us. We got to the lobby and were told, we can have a room available in 20 min, great, it was better than nothing. 30 min passed and another couple walked in from the street and they were checked in, in no time. More time passed and eventually we were checked into both rooms, they upgraded us both to suites, we were satisfied. The room was old, we expected that. They had new carpet installed and some nice queen sized beds. The ceilings have major water damage and there are some nails sticking out of the ground due to the new flooring installed. The bathrooms were small, but cute. The shower itself was possessed; you either had really, really hot water, or really cold water. The drain didn't work; it would fill up as you showered. Then the next morning we found a roach. Yup on the side of the drapes, there it was a huge one. My mother in law caught it, they offered to have it taken out of the room and were told by maintenance that it was due to the flooring being put in. They offered us to switch rooms, but we figured hey, it's the flooring, it makes sense. We stayed.

My partner and I wanted to stay there for PRIDE weekend, but we're better off staying at an overpriced motel that at least will keep bugs out.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solingen", "Title": "\u201cJust a dump\u201d", "Author": "mwprivat", "ReviewID": "UR7636879", "Content": "Just stayed at this dump last year.

We booked a poolside room which was old but very clean. The beds were comfy and everything worked. We had plenty of hot water (family of 4) and never ran out. The air conditioning was extremely noisy. The front desk staff are polite but unfriendly - none of them ever cracked a smile once in the whole week we were there! Bar staff and maids were nice and requests for things such as fresh towels were brought to your room almost straight away. Our kids enjoyed the pool but parents should be aware that it is a public pool and quite a few of the locals use it and the bar in the afternoons. Breakfast provided was good with a waffle maker and cereal/toast etc. It was quieter in the breakfast room on weekdays but from Friday onwards it was crowded and hard to get a table - eat early! The Lafayette is in walking distance to quite a few diners/restaurants and we never felt unsafe walking at night back to the hotel after a meal. Coco's Bakery Restaurant is probably the best to get a good meal at a reasonable price. Overall our stay at the Lafayette was good and it provided a good base with all we needed for our family holiday. We stayed there for one more night at the end of our holiday in a different poolside room and it was just the same as our first one - old but very clean and comfortable. We would stay there again.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel sucked!\u201d", "Author": "chiil23", "ReviewID": "UR7481238", "Content": "This was the worst hotel i've ever stayed at. I wish i would have visited tripadvisor prior to going. The hotel is very old and worn out. The room was filthy. The hotel staff looked as miserable working there as i did staying there. They were very unfriendly and in serious need of etiquette training. It's bad enough to stay in a dump like this, but to have a staff as uncaring as they were made it even worse. The pictures online are very deceiving. This hotel should be condemned. There was not one single thing pleasant about this hotel that i can think of. My advice to all who may be considering a stay at this hotel...stay away! Proceed at your own risk. You could not pay me to stay at that decrepit dump again!!!", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cHated it!\u201d", "Author": "rosieb45", "ReviewID": "UR7414864", "Content": "The staff at the Lafayette Hotel was not friendly or professional in any way. If you do not need hot water, air conditioning, that works, and a staff that actually tries to control their rowdy guests then this is the place for you. The room next to ours was rented to at least 8 Spring Breakers. They screamed and yelled all night until around 3AM. Between banging on the walls, trying to get into our room via the pass door and other assorted nonsense we didn't get a night's sleep. At one point we were thinking of calling the police. The screams sounded more like an attack in progress than partying. We were there on business which made it worse. I called the front desk the next morning and no apologies were offered. I called Orbitz for a refund which I was promptly given and found a beautiful professionally run hotel in downtown San Diego. This hotel may have been something in it's day but it needs a complete make-over and a new staff! The only decent thing there was the \"Red Foxx Room\" Great steaks and very nice wait staff.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lafayette Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80618-Reviews-Lafayette_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$89 - $203*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2223 El Cajon Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92104</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515576", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/56/1f/b6/lafayette-hotel.jpg"}}
