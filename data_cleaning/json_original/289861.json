It looks nice, the rooms are comfortable, it has a seasonal pool, etc. I would consider it like a Hyatt Place, in the US. However this hotel is only a good choice if you have your own vehicle and want to stay outside (15+ km) the city center. Otherwise, think about it very carefully! If you don't have your own vehicle, you need to know: 1) that their shuttle only runs seasonally 2) that there is a nearby train stop (La Rustica UIR) into town but that station does not have a place to purchase tickets. 3) that this train station is useless if you are checking out on a Sunday (the next train comes around 2:30pm) and 4) that to reach the train station you must walk for 10-15 minutes on a path that seemed treacherous, especially in the dark. As you exit the train station, you walk for several minutes on a sidewalk right alongside a highway with speeding cars. Then you get to a junction where you must cross the highway, but there is no crosswalk and cars come around the corner in both directions. We had to wait for several minutes; cars didn't stop for us. In the photo, note the damaged guardrail! Once you wait long enough for a car to stop for you, you then go down the road leading to the hotel, which doesn't have a sidewalk and is unlit for the second half. It is near high brush and there were a couple card parked off the road in the dark. Ultimately if you are agile and maybe a bit risky, it should be fine. But if you are not comfortable walking for that long, crossing a difficult road, and walking on a dark street, this is not for you. We checked out on Sunday and since their shuttle doesn't run in the winter and trains don't run until 2:30pm, we had to pay about 25 euros for a taxi to the nearest train station. I believe the hotel websites list the wifi has having a fee, but it did not. They use one of those \"free hotspot\" type sites.. It was called \"guglielmo.\" We were given a card with a username and password to enter for 13 hours of wifi. We got those for both of our laptops, and though my wife's worked perfectly, mine worked very poorly (DNS errors....) but I guess that is due to my computer, and not the hotel's fault. You must note the cost of breakfast! We booked our room as a Hotwire hot rate. When we ere notified of the hotel, it listed the price per night, and amenities like pool, restaurant, etc. At check in, the man noted our room was pre-paid and told us the breakfast hours, which happened to vary each day we were there. So we ate breakfast each day. At checkout we were told our rate didn't include breakfast, and that breakfast is 14 euros (!!!) per person, per day. After I complained that 1) Hotwire didn't say the rate was without breakfast 2) we were told the times at checkin 3) the in-room hotel FAQ guide didn't mention a charge for breakfast and 4) there was no reference to a fee in the breakfast room, he thankfully removed the charges. The group next to us was complaining about the same thing, but the woman handling their checkout wasn't removing their charge. So be aware! And if you are a traveler without a car, don't bother. It really isn't worth the trouble!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel - No problems\u201d", "Author": "paulpowell3540", "ReviewID": "UR120415178", "Content": "Yes it is a distance from Rome however the hotel runs a cheap shuttle bus/coach several times each day into the centre of Rome.

As usual, in Noveotel, the room was overheated to a constant 26\u00b0 and turning off the heating made no difference. The mosquitoes in the zone made it unwise to open the window, so we suffered extreme discomfort in the heat.

But the major down fall is that it is way out of town in a paddock in the middle of the commercial zone. They provide a shuttle for a minimal cost but it does not run frequently and the last one leaves the city at 8.30pm. A taxi fare was quite expensive at least 40-50 euros. What we found the problem was that if you caught the shuttle into Rome during the day, you either had to come back late after dinner, so you had to eat dinner in the same clothes you have been all day , or catch the shuttle back late afternoon after your sight seeing and then you are trapped into eating at their resturant, as there is nothing else around. The food was not to our taste, very bland and often they didnt have what was on the menu. The staff try to be helpful but the communication is very bad, the hotel seems to attract bus loads of tour groups and all the mornings we were there, the buffet was cleaned out before we got there at 7.30 am.

The Novotel La Rustica hotel in Rome is situated just outside the ring road, and to bring guests to and from the center they have a free shuttle service to the Termini station. This worked like a charm for us, every day we had breakfast at the hotel before leaving for the city with the 10:30 shuttle. (there's also one in the morning at 8 am, but we're never up that early during our holidays) The return shuttle is at 18:30 or 20:30. The shuttle worked great for us, as we were there to see the sights of Rome. I can imagine that for people wanting to see Rome by night, or return later than 20:30, the shuttle won't work that well, but for us that was not the case. The hotel in itself is normal Novotel standard, nice and clean, and with friendly and helpful staff who speak several languages - we tried both French and English - both worked very well :-) The hotel has a nice swimmingpool outdoors, though not very large, it's more than good enough for the kids, or for a refreshing swim during the day. Since the hotel is outside of the city center, it's quite calm and nice to sit outside in the evening. On going home, we asked at the reception how to get to Fiumicino airport, and they got us a car with a driver for 47 euros, who drove us all the way from the hotel to the airport. (that's only 3 euros more than we would have had to pay with the airport train) This was very nice and comfortable, and got us to the airport in time - even with a few trafficproblems on the way. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone going to Rome who are planning to spend the days in the city, and the evenings at the hotel. If you're planning on nightlife or staying in town late, I do not know how well the public transports would work, or how much a taxi would cost. But this was never an issue to us, as we always used the shuttle.

I was on so many conferences worldwide and conference means lots of business and meetings and working environment. Not to mention that this was a conference with members ad CEO`s from more than 60 countries. People you communicate on a daily bases electronically and this is your only chance to meet them for real and discuss business.. What a terrible choice this hotel,was.. First things first. The hotel has nothing with Rome. Its 45 - 70 minutes from the transporting center in Rome. There is a shuttle bus but only one at 10-30 in the morning and 17:30 afternoon and 19:30 going to Rome. Last shuttle that takes you back to Rome is 20:30! Thats all... They do state every hour but they state a lots of things. After that its taxi that will ocst you 40 - 50Euros. Get a lots of money for taxi if you are tourist. I have been on lots of conferences and mostly they were high class and business oriented hotels with a business friendly atmosphere. I'm not taking my laptop on those trips anymore, because all hotels have business centers that will help you to download your files print and do everything else you need. Those people here have only ONE PC on internet and printer without a toner next to the electronic poker machine! And they charge you a Euro for a 3 minute !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You must register at the reception for using a god damn PC!!!! And they claim the organize good business conferences? Food. Its average, nothing special. Don't even think to stay for diner there... Pool. Yes, there is a pool but I would not recommend anyone to swim in that concrete hole on the suburbs of Rome. The hotel is in industrial complex. When you go to a conference you have a chance to meet and socialize with the people you work with. That's our only chance in a year! This is where hotel should help you with creating a friendly atmosphere to socialize with your colleagues. After all day work inside the hotel, (Rome is one hour drive from the hotel ) you expect that you can have some nice time at the hotel bar. Guess what!. You wont. There are two barmen's, that will starting to create \"we are about to close the bar-atmosphere\" since 21:30 . They are starting to fix things, slam and mess with the bottles wipe mirrors and windows and create stupid faces... Every single night the same scenario! They close the bar very dramatically. There are aluminum blinds that are closed at 11:45 and lights are off... Yes it should be open untill 0100... Forget that. The barman is telling you they will leave us to sit inside the bar so that we don't worry about that. ( And you own him a beer for that! ) This is how I ended up with CEO`s from other countries playing Foosball outside, near the pool after midnight and wondering what we are doing. Foosball is actually the only sport and leisure that you can have there. I tried to outsmart them by ordering from a room service and when I did that they asked me for what time coz are opening at 09:00 ??!!! Receptionist are acting like your ex-girlfriends. They have Polite - bitchy - smart ass attitude to everyone in the hotel. They will at the end finish their job. . And my god, this hotel is soo overpriced!!!! If you pick your self a hotel , don't make the same mistake my company did. This is their first mistake and after reading emails from my colleagues that were there with me for 7 days I decided to post this review. All those bad things will be forgiven when you visit Rome. Places that you must visit. Vatican - St Peter and Sistine Chapell. Get your self a pro - guide! 20euro per person. Its worth every euro! The Ancient Centre , The Coloseum, The Forum, The Capitoline, The Pantheon, Spanish steps - the shopping area. If you found this review you ll find all the info very fast. So you were warned. :) Novotel Roma La Rustica - Forget this place . And Im not a person that does this for fun.

The hotel itself is better than most Novotels. Very clean & modern, but still a typical part of this chain. The room decor was better than many, but the bathroom still retains that single-piece moulded bath designed for customers under five feet high. Good breakfast selection. Dinner also moderate/good if you stick to the sensibly priced options. Swimining pool small & overlooked from the restaurant. To be clear, unless you have a car, you are stranded here. There is a small bus which shuttles down to the main railway station but it only departs the hotel at roughly 1.5 - 2 hour intervals (08:00 & then 10:30 onwards in the morning; 20:30 latest departure from Rome). There is nothing around within walking distance. There is a small railway station close by but I have no idea of train times and some other reports suggest it might be 'dodgy' at night. Get advice from the hotel before relying on this means of transport. If you have a car it is a much better option. Free parking (altho' outside & unguarded) & minutes away from the motorway network. A good option if planning a tour to Tivoli or Ostia. Also not bad if you have the nerves to drive into the centre & park in the huge underground carpark beneath Villa Borghese (there is also another massive underground carpark near the Vatican). If you are looking for a real Roman holiday forget this place. It is a business hotel in a commercial zone near a motorway junction. However, if you have a car it's not such a bad option, altho' totally lacking in character. My best piece of advice is to be very careful of valuables if riding on the metro.

Breakfast is fantastic; buffet with hot / cold / numerous breads + pastries, cereals etc. over-looking outdoor pool area (only open in summer). We communicated with the hotel via e-mail prior to our stay with certain questions and they were pleased to respond back. Nothing was a problem.

It was very convenient because you can hop-on/hop-off at all the main sites, however the quality of the English commentary via headphones was very, very poor indeed.
