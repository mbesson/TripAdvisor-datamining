We talked to numerous tourist who stayed at other hotels in the area, paying double what we did having horrible experiences. The staff at the California were polite, helpful and very kind. The breakfast was typical Turkish, bread, boiled eggs and some vegtables. The location was absolutely amazing- we took the metro from the airport for under $5 US as it was only a block from the Cemberitas station. We walked to all the historic sights and even visited the Grand Bazaar the morning we checked out- yes it was only a few blocks away.

It's a new hotel and you can notice it easily - new furniture, tiles on walls in a bathroom, doors etc.The rooms are cleaned every day, inlcuding the change of towels. My room was small and without a window which was a minus. I felt weird after waking up in the morning . I didn't know that I would get a dark room and I was very surprised on my coming to the hotel. When I was booking a room on the internet, the manager offered me a discount (it was nice) but he did not inform me that the room would be without a window. I'd rather have known about such a disadvantage beforehand. The breakfast was basic, the same every day. The dining room was small but neat and clean. The staff was very nice and helpful, always smiling and communicative. The hotel is located 10 minutes away from the main sights and just a few steps from the tram stop. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet, you can walk there without fear at night. To sum up: a decent hotel for this price, simply for people who don't want to spend too much (travelleres on a tight budget) and who treat a hotel just like a place to sleep.

We arrived at the hotel around 11 AM after a LONG overnight ride bus ride from Cappadocia. We were told that they were waiting for the guests in our room to check out and that it shouldn't be a long wait. They were gracious enough at that point to at least serve breakfast to us even though it was after the normal time. After waiting for about two hours we asked them if it was possible to get into our room again and they said they were still waiting for the check out. Then one of the front desk workers came over and told us that it would just be a few more minutes - that the guests in our room had finally checked out and they needed to clean the room. Cut to about 20 minutes later and they still were working on it and they were now trying to fix a problem with the hair dryer. My friend and I told them that the hair dryer wasn't important to us we just wanted to get into our room and shower at this point! We pushed and they finally took us up to our room. Two gentleman were still working on the hair dryer and we urged them to hurry and finish - which they quickly did. After they left I wanted to use the toilet and opened the lid to see urine splashed all over the seat. I freaked out a little and then opened the door and asked the housekeeper (who didn't speak English) to clean it up. She came in quickly wiped down the toiled and quickly mopped the floor (there was hair from the previous guests on the floor). Afterwards I took a shower and noticed that it hadn't been cleaned yet either. Again hair from the previous guests and their old shower gel bottle was still on the top. When we left the hotel after our showers we asked them to have the cleaning lady to re-clean our bathroom. We arrived that evening and our bathrooms had NOT been re-cleaned. We mentioned again twice to the front desk workers and they offered no real apologies and just sort of shrugged their shoulders about the matter. I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN - it was one of the worst hotel experiences I've had on this trip - so dirty! If it weren't for the whole dirty bathroom issue and their lack of response my stay at this hotel would have been ok.
