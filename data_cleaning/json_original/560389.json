In July 2007 our family stayed two times at the Palazzo Gamba. The only problem we encountered was the noise level from the first floor apartment we were given during our 2nd stay. We did not have a problem at all during our 1st stay as the 1st apartment was higher up and faced the street on side of Duomo, plus it had one inner bedroom that was not on any street. The 1st flor apartment we had during our 2nd stay was directly over a busy street (Via Martelli) and did not have sound proof windows. This led to 2 nights of no sleep due to noise of buses, street cleaners, cars, vespas, all night long. Although we asked to be moved to a different apartment, there were no vacancies. So only word of caution - ask for an apartment on high floor, not facing Via Martelli and with sound proof windows.

Two-bedrooms on the 3rd floor with frescoed ceilings and a view of the duomo and baptistry. There was a small kitchen area, two of the four burners worked on the stove and a large refrigerator. There is a grocery store close by, which we took advantage of. The bus stop is across the street as is the ATM machine. Negatives, the noise level is extremely high - young people hang out of the steps of the church til at least 2 a.m. each night singing and drinking. Four ambulances are stationed across the street and are constantly on the go, sirens wailing at all hours. The beds are extremely hard and fairly uncomfortable. The bathrooms (2) were both very small with leaky showers that drained very slowly.Positives: Location, location, location. It couldn't be beat. In several minutes you could be at the Ponte Vecchio, The Uffizi, Accademia, Boboli Gardens, Piazza della Signora, The Pitti Palace, or just strolling along the Arno. Cristiano and Jessica were very helpful at the check-in. But as has been pointed out, the hours of 12 noon to 8 p.m. are not convenience if you have a late flight from the United States and arrive in Florence at 9 a.m. It is a 15 minutes taxi ride from the airport to the hotel. Cost about 25 Euros plus an additional 1 euro for each bag. We needed two taxis. The weather was extremely warm for October. It was in the 80's every day and no rain. The city was more crowded than I expected it to be. The tour books tell you October is quieter, but it wasn't true. Shop owners we talked with said September and October are becoming as busy as June and July.

The small number of reviews made me a bit apprehensive to book (2) two-bedroom apartments at the Palazzo Gamba for our family\u9225\u6a9a 4-night stay in Florence, but as it turns out, I\u9225\u6a93 so glad I did and I\u9225\u6a93 delighted to share information on this fantastic find!The apartment building is in the historic center of Florence, about 40+ feet from the Duomo. It\u9225\u6a9a within a 10 minute walking radius to all the major sights: Piazza della Signoria, Accademia, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, Santa Croce, San Lorenzo market, Medici Chapels, etc. The start of the pedonale - pedestrian zone - is across the street from the apartment.We had the Raffaello and the Leonardo apartments on the 2nd floor. These are the only ones with balconies overlooking the Duomo and Battistero. Both apartments were VERY spacious and clean. In addition to the beds, each apartment had a sleeper sofa. Having a small kitchen fully supplied with kitchenware was an added convenience. We didn\u9225\u6a9b use it for cooking as there were so many great restaurant options nearby, but we did make good use of the fridge for our drinks and the kettle and cups for tea.The relatively minor shortcomings are: the lobby is small and unimpressive (I was initially worried about the place when we walked into the lobby, but it\u9225\u6a9a not a good indicator of what\u9225\u6a9a to come); the elevator is small and can accommodate about 3 people (you might have to make a couple trips if you have lots of luggage); and the surrounding area is not exactly quiet at night as it\u9225\u6a9a in the historic, well-visited section of town (for those bothered by noise in the evening, ear plugs should do the trick!). With these things aside, everything else is top notch. A few things to know about: \u9225\ue53ahe reception desk is only available between 12noon \u9225?7:30pm, so if you need front desk help, you must check in or make inquiries during these hours. \u9225\ue53aowels are changed every few days unless you request a set of fresh towels daily (for a flat fee of 10 euro) which will cover the entire stay, not per day.\u9225\ue52aanielle and Cristiano at the reception desk were very helpful during the booking process and throughout our stay. They can also book tours. \u9225\ue53fou\u9225\u6a92l only have one (large) key set for each apartment; included is a key for the building and one for the safe. \u9225\ue538ooms can be rung up from outside the building as there are door bells labeled with the room name; a video cam allows you to see who is ringing your room from outside.\u9225\ue53ahere\u9225\u6a9a a cafeteria style deli next to the apartment that serves sandwiches and salads. \u9225\ue529lose by is the wonderful pasticceria, Robiglio\u9225\u6a9a \u9225?a great place to have your morning pastry and cappuccino. \u9225\ue53ahe bus stop is across the street.Palazzo Gamba was such a great find!

From our apartment named aptly Leonardo we could see the Duomo and the Baptistry. The wonderful thing about that is you could check on the queues for both places without leaving your loungeroom and plan a quick visit when the queue is short. The bells, well yes they can be a bit irritating, but i prefer to think of them as charming, and they definitely didn't spoil my experience or that of my 18 month old or 4 year old. Florence is very noisy, sirens are also a problem, but we all slept soundly (we got used to the noise and kept windows and doors closed at night). The airconditioning functioned very well, as did the dishwasher. The bathroom/shower had a flood problem, due to the tiny shower pan and inappropriate material shower curtains. For couples travelling with children, excellent location as you don't waste time on public transport and the Carregi hospital is a 15 minute bus ride (hospital is very good there by the way!). Lack of bath is a big problem for kids especially with such a problematic and small shower. I actually bathed my 18 month old in the kitchen sink!! Lack of toaster and kettle and decent sized mugs was the thing which really annoyed us. The lift could also be a problem as it was so small I had to fold my pram to fit it in, which meant obviously I had to remove my small child from it. The doorman would watch me impassively as I struggled to hold my child and fold the pram at the same time, never once offering to help me. These gripes aside the image I take away of Florence is the view from the Leonardo apartment and that thought always brings a smile to my face. Some tips travelling with small child/children you CANNOT travel without a pram! The kids will love the double decker red Florence sighseeing bus, even my 18 month old loved it and we found it worth the 20 euro, my kids 4 yrs and 18 months were free and you get another trip to Fiesole (in the nearby hills) included. The Uffizi lines are crazy, I got there at 9am and still had to wait 1hr and a half. I DID NOT bring the kids, small children will not appreciate the queue nor the artworks!

First, let me say something I've never read anywhere about Firenze. Not in guide books, not online, not in trip reviews from friends. If you stay anywhere near the Duomo, be advised that the Duomo bells start ringing - loudly - at 7 am and ring every 15 minutes for the next hour. And I'm not talking charming just married, happy, sing-songy church bells. These are serious Repent, Ye Sinners type church bells. No sleeping after 7. Especially at Palazzo Gamba. I booked Palazzo Gamba based on reader reviews on this and other travel sites at the last minute after a problem with a reservation at another property. It was easy to find and literally in the shadow of the Duomo. Friendly, wonderful Catarina showed us to the 1-bedroom apartment we booked. It was small and smelled strongly of cleaning products, but okay. Great view of the San Lorenzo dome! The bathroom was tiny and had one of the showers that would inevitably flood the floor. Our travel companions wanted to see if there was a larger apartment and Catarina obliged and showed us the available 2 bedroom apartment - Giambiatta (I think that's the name - it's the only one on the 4th floor). The second apartment was much larger and had 2 bedrooms with 1-1/2 baths. The down-side was that it offered no view. But, we weren't spending a ton of time during the day in the apartment, so we sacrificed the view and took the bigger apartment. This apartment had no air conditioning and four windows. The two large windows opened onto what I can only describe as an air shaft in the middle of the building. No big deal - we didn't care about the view - except that if you wanted ventilation, you had to listen to the very loud water pump clanking on and off constantly. The air shaft also had some standing water at the bottom which created a bit of a mosquito problem too. Italy has some crazy mosquitos. So, we had to sleep with the windows closed. The front windows opened to the street. A night club a few doors down was pretty happening, so people partying and loud music kept our friends awake along with the traffic noises and sirens of a big city. The full bath was enormous, but poorly designed. A glass shelf above the sink was the only storage. It was too wide to wash one's face without hitting one's head. The shower was a tiny pan with a fabric curtain too short to reach the edge of the pan. Once soaked, the water dripped all over the floor and flooded the room. The beds were hard. The closet was giant - great storage for an extended stay. Linen service is only every 4th day, so either pay for extra linen service or ration your towel usage. Catarina at the desk was delightful! She was only there the first day. The man who was there the rest of our stay was pretty cold and didn't speak great English. I tried in Italian, but I think that made things worse. Desk staff is there from noon to 8 pm. If you need something earlier, you're out of luck. Because Palazzo Gamba is in the limited traffic zone. If you have a car, you'll need to register your car at the desk so they can notify the police not to ticket you.I don't think I'd stay here again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. At \u9227?20 a night, I think I could have found something better. Maybe if you get one of the apartments with the fresco ceilings and full-sized windows, you'd enjoy it more.
