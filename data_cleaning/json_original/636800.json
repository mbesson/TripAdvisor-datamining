I stayed there with a mate in Oct 2007 for 3 nights. I had stayed at this hotel in the past back in 99 and 2001, both of those times were great, always alot of people to meet at the bar and a good pool bar to come back to after the pub and get a toasty and a few more drinks, no matter what time you got back.This time there was about 5 other people staying in the whole hotel, and they didn't really speak english. It was empty. I went to were the pool bar was and no pool bar!! Just a hole of were it use to be, i'd say they just don't get the people there to buy from it.One night before going out we decided to get a drink from the main bar, we were the only people there, except for the 6 locals working, it felt really strange. The rooms are just like when i was there last time, have not changed 1 bit. They were a bit dirty then and are dirty now, except the bathroom has got alot worse. The only good thing about it was it was cheap!! But it wasn't what me and my mate were looking for, thank god we were booked into the Bounty hotel for a week after that. I hate to be one of these people complaining but i still kind of expected it to be like it was before the bomb, but i suppose alot has changed since then.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR188288588", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Farris123"}, {"Content": "Budget resort in Kuta", "Date": "Dec 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR787640885", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "WazzaTroy"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d636800-r20159713-Troppo_Zone_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "636800", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
