So it was with slight trepidation that I booked a one night stay in a King Executive suite at The Bayswater. First point is its ideal location, just off Darlinghurst Rd. Despite its proximity to this busy road, the hotel itself is situated well away from the hubbub but still close enough (just a few minutes stroll) from the subway station around the corner. The building itself is an older one which which has been converted into a hotel. The lobby/hallway decor is sparse but chic, with subdued modern colour tones to match. There's no mistaking straight away that this is a new establishment. Check in was quick and easy. Since I had pre-paid, there was nothing much to do except step into the lift to my second floor street-facing suite. The suite itself matched the prevailing decor (i.e. smart modern) with a large bed, wall-mounted LCD TV, sofa, coffee table and cupboard with tea/coffee and ironing board inside. Now there were two things which most most impressed me: the very tall ceiling and the huge street-facing windows - both had a real 'wow' factor about them! The bathroom was very near the bed and at first I assumed it was a cupboard until I opened it. It was small but very clean and adequate. The in-house brand toiletries were of excellent quality and probably better than the branded labels I've used in more expensive establishments. I surprised myself that night by sleeping for 13 straight hours on that very comfortable bed. Which is something I haven't been able to do before. Considering my flight from Brisbane that morning was only about 1.5 hours, that long comfortable snooze was certainly not due to jet lag. Noise was not an issue, except for the sound of the street cleaning truck the next morning which woke me. Don't know what its like on weekends (possibly noisy due to party crowds), but on the weekdays at least noise should not be a problem. Now for some very minor negatives. Its a new-ish establishment - only about a year old - but I could spot a stain on the carpet and the wall had a small bump/crack where someone probably banged their suitcase. Its a combination of these little maintenance issues which can quickly age a hotel. Management should have these fixed to maintain the look of the place. Next morning when checking out at 10:00AM I was invited to use their lounge, just opposite front desk to relax if I wanted to. Its well appointed with tea/coffee, free internet and TV and plenty of comfortable seating on sofas. They also stowed my baggage until I actually left. Overall, this is a quality product compared to the other hotels further down Potts Point at very competitive rates. Would recommend this establishment, since I will definitely be using them again in future.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bathurst", "Title": "\u201cShort visit\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR126814761", "Content": "We had two nights here, and will definitely stay again.

The furnishings are quite pretty and the quality goes past what you would expect from a budget type hotel. It is Kings Cross and if you expect the room to be totally silent you should stay in the country. Honestly the loudest noise was from the rain, which was quite heavy for the weekend I was there. I had one maintainence issue during my stay where the curtain chain broke. This was fixed in a flash. All other furnishings including the bathroom are near new and are in good condition. The highlight of my stay was when one of my friends needed an IPad charger. Not at all expecting the front desk to have one, I gave them a call anyway.

Rooms come with a little fridge, plates and cutlery, and there's a microwave (and more plates etc) in the dining area just off the lobby. Also in that same area is a computer and printer you can use for free. To get to your room there's a lift (so you don't have to carry everything up the stairs!), but it's super slow. No big deal. Staff are friendly and very helpful with everything. Don't bother with the $10 \"hotel breakfast\" available next door, you can do better if you walk down the street towards King's Cross.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFine but would be nice to have free wifi\u201d", "Author": "Pippag", "ReviewID": "UR124220683", "Content": "Hotel was fine. we just wanted somewhere convenient to crash which was affordable.

I live in China with my partner at the moment and we wanted a bit of luxury for our two weeks away from the back and beyond of China which can often be a bit noisy. I had read that The Bayswater was noisy and it really was, but as it is in the heart of Kings Cross (which I found out the week before is the prostitution and bar capital of Australia), you expect the noise and my partner and I found it easy to sleep through. We had originally booked in to a compact double at around 116 dollars a night but (luckily) we found an offer on the hotel's website that made a King suite 99 dollars and boy were we glad we upgraded. Having read the other reviews, I understand that the compact doubles are small and the petite size of the King suite suggested that we might have struggled to fit our suitcases into a compact double. The room itself is akin to a Travelodge or Holiday Inn; it's neat, tidy and has an easy to clean carpet. The hotel provides free tea and coffee and free shampoo and conditioner (the conditioner is really really good) and soap. The size of the shower is a bit difficult to get over as you have to turn the shower off if you want to have any chance of using shower gel before it washes off of your hands. I can't complain about the quality of the rain shower itself though. It was disappointing that Wifi was not free and was quite expensive at 10 dollars for a day, but there is a desktop computer in the lounge downstairs that is free to use for you to check the internet if you fancy waiting around a lot (people are often quite selfish and stay on for hours). If they are offering a desktop computer, why could they not offer wifi for that area? Kings Cross can get a bit hectic and seemed a lot like a club strip in a holiday resort with lots of drunk people, lots of touting and a few fights, but heavy police presence and a bouncer on the door on Fridays and Saturdays meant that you never felt threatened. The hotel is also only 10 minutes away from the centre if you walk. One thing that we had heard about Sydney is that the transport costs are really high and we can certainly agree with that, but if you're only 10 minutes from the city centre by foot, your expenses go down a lot and it was a really good location for us. You can go the city centre in 10 minutes in one direction, onto Oxford street in another 10 and down to the Entertainment Quarter (lots of bars, restaurants, an IMAX and 3 cinemas) in about 25-30 minutes walking. If you don't like walking too much, the hotel is a three minute walk in a straight line to the Kings Cross metro station and it costs 16 dollars each (single) to get there from the airport. In response to some people complaining of unfriendly staff, I found that the men that were on reception everyday were really friendly and really helpful in every sense and even helped us with our luggage when we had to leave it for storage and suggested which airport shuttle to catch. The female cleaner was also wonderfully friendly. All in all, this hotel is an upmarket hostel if you like. It is comfortable, the rooms are small, but they are homely, everything is exceptionally clean and the atmosphere is nice. Don't stay there if you want a big room or if you can't stand noise, but if you're easy going and you want a little bit of comfort at a less absurd price than those of the central hotels, stay here.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bathurst, Australia", "Title": "\u201cStylish and Clean\u201d", "Author": "kellyg27", "ReviewID": "UR123637094", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Bayswater and we're completely impressed with the hotel, service and rooms.

There is even a huge underground supermarket right next door. And of course there are plenty of adult attractions King's Cross is famous for. The room was clean & modern. The bed was excellent. My only beef was the dimly lit bathroom. If you tend to crash early request a room in the back as the street does get loud on weekends. The lobby had fridge, micro, tables & chairs, couches, TV, free internet workstation. On various occasions I picked up food or prepared resturaunt overage at the Hotel as the room had a fridge & eating utensils but the lobby was like a small cafe. There is an excellent coffee & sandwich shop out front that will bring your breakfast to you and they are very reasonably priced. There is a well stocked beverage store directly across the street and a small smoke shop out front also. The staff was outstanding; friendly, helpful & knowledgeable of Sydney area.

However, this just proved that the hotel was very central (2 minutes walk from Kings Cross train station) and yet once inside, the noise wasn't heard plus our room was at the back of the property. Everything was clean, the room a good size with the boutique theme continuing and plates, bowls and cutlery provided and even wineglasses - very civilised! The concierge staff were friendly especially the gentleman who checked us in and out. The cleaners were great, and when we did use any crockery, if we left it in the bathroom they would clean it for us. The only things of note were a slight drain smell from the bathroom, which disappeared once we had used it a bit, and the fact that the room was a bit dark as one window faced a wall.

I had a small amount of trepidation, as it had been a year since my first visit, and I was worried that the fittings would have deteriorated. However, I need not have worried - other than some of the black slate tiles in the bathroom, and a couple of marks on the carpet, the King Deluxe room was pristine. In brief, the pros were price and location - walking distance to the city, Darlinghurst (especially the restaurant strip), Surry Hills, and even Paddington, but still just far enough from the 'dodgy' bit of Kings Cross to be comfortable. The bed was comfortable if not exceptional, the shower was awesome, there was sufficient cupboard space, and a nice writing desk (albeit with a lamp that didn't work). The bathroom was big enough, though the towels were small, and we only got two. There was no separate light over the bathroom sink, so I had to shave in the shadows, which was a pain. There is an all-night Coles close by, as well as Guzman y Gomez, and really excellent coffee at Ulivetto. The one frustration, which nearly cost them my booking, is that all the rooms were blacked out on the website and Wotif.com for the Saturday night until about a week before I booked. I very nearly went elsewhere, but then they were magically restored and at the same rate as weeknights. I can understand that some hotels want to get a premium for the Saturday, but this isn't the way to go about it. Another curiosity - there was a $99/night room rate for a King Deluxe room on the hotel's own website, that never made it to Wotif. As this is usually the first, and frequently the last, port of call for many travellers, this seemed a bit strange. Final, and minor gripes: the hotel has an internal lift which helps with luggage, but there's still a flight of stairs from the street to the reception area. I ended up helping some nice Canadian girls with their bags, as no assistance from the staff appeared to be forthcoming. I thought that this was not only a bit shabby, but potentially a safety risk as well. Also, the iron and ironing board were tiny and pretty crappy. It simply cannot cost that much to give us grown-up sized versions, instead of toys.

Everything was spotless, though, and furnished nicely. The hotel is literally steps from a train station, supermarket, and a host of restaurants, and has an in-house laundry, so it is incredibly convenient - it would be nice if the washer and dryer accepted coins rather than the odd tokens you have to purchase from reception, but it's still really handy. It is right in the centre of a nightclub/party district, so be prepared for some noise - it wasn't a problem at all in our room, but the streets are really noisy after nightfall, and you will probably get at least one drunken partygoer staggering in at 4AM. :p The business/lounge area was excellent, with internet and printer access, good tea/coffee facilities and a nice sitting area where one could wait for the bus or a taxi pickup. Be warned, the lift is incredibly slow - unless you've got a lot of baggage, take the stairs. The main thing that let this hotel down was the information/service - the day receptionist was excellent, friendly and helpful, however we were surprised by a request for a $150 deposit on check-in, as were other guests, because there was no mention of this made when we booked. We were assured that this would be returned when we checked out. When we went to do this, we were told that actually, it would be 5 business days - it ended up being 15. This was the only real issue in what was otherwise a pleasant and comfortable stay.

Will definitely stay here again if spending a weekend in the cross.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cHard to find fault, especially at the price\u201d", "Author": "DiscerningGentleman2", "ReviewID": "UR97762603", "Content": "I booked a King Room the Bayswater after finding that my first choice, the Springfield Lodge, was pretty much full. They're both in the same group, called 'Sydney Lodges', although the Bayswater is by far the most upmarket. The cost was only a little more, and certainly cheaper than the other better hotels in the area such as the Quest and Regents Court, which are in turn cheaper than just about anywhere in the CBD. The room featured fairly standard modern hotel decor, but the colour palette was tasteful, and the matching woodgrain finish on the desk, cupboard, and side tables looked great. The number of throw pillows on the bed was quite absurd, however, especially as they all had to end up littering the floor when I wanted to sleep. Not a complaint as such, though. The (tiny) bathroom was done in a dark slate, which looked excellent but I suspect will not age all that well. The shower was large, and powerful. Annoyingly, there was no shower cap, and the reception were unable to furnish me with one. Speaking of reception, they were predominately foreign, pleasant and professional, and pretty relaxed in keeping with the establishment and neighbourhood. I have stayed around Kings Cross when in Sydney for years, and honestly never feel unsafe. The area is simply so busy, 24 hours a day, that you are always surrounded by people. Guzman y Gomez, a cheap but excellent Mexican place, is almost next door, and some great cafes and restaurants are down Macleay St - Fratelli Paradiso, Blanco, and Toby's Estate, just of the top of my head. Also some good stores for fashion and design, such as Macleay on Manning, and Arida. I was on the fourth floor, but at the very back, and there was some morning noise from the street behind. This, and the tiny shower cap-less bathroom are the only complaints I can muster, and they are minor. Although, I agree with the previous poster - it really isn't in Potts Point!", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cit's Kings Cross, not quite Potts Point\u201d", "Author": "aurorasev", "ReviewID": "UR96096663", "Content": "very well located for getting around opened only for a few weeks so everything bright and sharp The address is supposed to be in Potts Point which is a lovely leafy inner city suburb with nice little shops, however, the hotel is about 3 minutes walk from Kings Cross station with the attendant activities such as nightclubbing, bar hopping, soliciting, etc. There was no violence on the streets that I could see, however, wouldn't like to go around alone in evenings. A couple of problems: 1. reception (and lift) is on first floor of building which means carrying luggage upstairs by yourself (not a dorrman in sight) 2. found a panty in the room, obviously left by previous tenant 3. wireless did not work the whole time I was at the hotel 4. hotel has only 4 floors so for peace and quiet, go for the higher floors.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cNice new addition to Potts Point\u201d", "Author": "NickBrodie", "ReviewID": "UR95821414", "Content": "Stayed there for 2 nights - Thursday and Friday recently. The hotel had been open 2 weeks but beyond the phones not working there were no teething problems. This is an older building (formerly Barclay Hotel) that has been comprehensively rennovtaed. Not just a soft refurb but gutted and started again. The results is modern, funky and comfortable. Go for the largest room your budget allows - King size bed, lounge, desk, etc. Nice decor touches, great bathrooms of a decent size (tolietries selection is limited to shampoo, condition and soap) Great location right in the middle of the nightlife. Walking distance to everything. Open windows let the noise in but are quite effective at keeping it out when shut so it's surprisingly quiet.
