While I can't say it was peaceful, I can't imagine any hotel being quiet in S.D.--it's a city that's got a lot going on, starting with traffic.

And comes with a full kitchen complete with a closet full of kitchen utensils and supplies. While my room only had a king, I felt as though with the right beds, you could comfortably sleep 4-5 people easily. The bathroom was nice and clean with a good amount of counter space. The hotel has a pool and hottub. I did not get the chance to go in, but I walked around it and saw people in there enjoying it. It has a good amount of parking underneath the hotel. The hotel served a wonderful breakfast with freshly made waffles, eggs, cereal, etc. The hotel staff was so wonderful and friendly. They were quick to help me when I got locked out of my room and had great recommendations for food and fun local places.

We booked a suite on-line and prepaid to get a discount. This was a painless process and prepaying saved us about $120 USD. We were concerned by some of the negative reviews here on TA, however, all I can say is that some people must have extremely high standards for the price bracket this hotel falls into. At $135 per night for 4 people, we could not fault this hotel at all. Sure it's a bit dated, but having stayed at other hotels of this vintage, let me say that I have stayed in MUCH worse for the same price. Everything is clean, the bathroom relatively modern and the main bedroom had a huge king size bed. Our kids slept on the pull out sofa which would have been big enough for 2 but they are at that age where they have to sleep separately, so one used an air-bed we brought on the floor. Ample room in the separate lounge area for this. The kitchen had most things you require to cook a meal, which we did being our first home cooked meal for 2 weeks (much needed after lots of burgers and take out). There weren't enough knives and forks for all of us but we made do with some plastic ones we take along for this very need. Noise was only a problem when we had the door onto the balcony open. Being next door to an ER there was lots of ambulances coming and going. The windows must be double-glazed because closing them blocked out all this noise. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable and slept very well (I'm a slight insomniac so this is a positive), The staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially at breakfast time. The included continental breakfast is FANTASTIC. Location is good, it only took us 5-10 minutes to get to most places by car (Downtown, Balboa Park, Midway, SeaWorld). Parking was provided on-premises (though I don't know why they don't just build the $7 charge into the room rate). There are several restaraunts and cafe's on Washington Street and an Albertson's supermarket about a 10-15 minute walk down the street.

We wanted a convenient location, close to restaurants, shopping and attractions, with a pool and preferably a full breakfast. I was on the verge of booking two seperate rooms in a budget hotel when I ran across Sommerset Suites. This hotel had everything we were looking for, and all for a little over $100. This would be a great deal in any major city but in San Diego this is an incredible bargain. Our fourth floor room included a full kitchen, sofabed, and bedroom with two full beds, ideal for our situation. The room and the entire property were clean and the staff were all friendly and efficient. The breakfast was great, with waffles and all the usual items. The location in Hillcrest is great if you like fine dining - there are dozens of great restaurants within walking distance.

But this was just a fabulous experience. I should first say that I am a fan of Pacifica Hotels and look for them when I stay on the coast of California. But what a little gem the Sommerset Suites turned out to be. From the very first moment we walked into the lobby, we KNEW it was going to be a good stay. The front desk was very pleasant, and pointed us to the good (and away from the mediocre) restaurants right around the hotel ... and there are an abundance of them in all types and colors within walking distance of a couple of blocks.. The suite itself was spacious, clean, and way more appointed than the price would indicate. Really nice linens, more than enough high quality towels and product in the bathroom, and comfortable sitting in the living room. I'm not much of a TV watcher, so the older tube TVs didn't bother me much ... but I did appreciate the breadth of channels, including Speed (so I could watch the F1 race!). But having an efficiency kitchen and dining table are much appreciated. Of course, during our short visit there we didn't use it besides making coffee because the hotel had a tremendous free BBQ by the pool on the evening we were there, with really good, high-quality food. It was the real deal, not just some lame burgers and weiners ... but a really nice spread of a variety of food and free beer, wine and margaritas. The staff that were working that evening all participated, and acted as though we were guests in their home and visited with everyone and made sure everything was perfect. They succeeded. And then the free breakfast the next morning was more of the same ... with arm boiled eggs, beautiful fresh fruit, nice granola and yogurt, juices, great coffee, toast and pastries. Plus the fresh Belgian waffles ... and the staff that was on hand were helping everyone with the waffle machines to make sure that the normal screw-ups that happen all the time at other hotels were NOT going to make for a disaster at the Sommerset. Can you tell that I was impressed? Way more than I EVER expected, even though I have come to expect nothing short of excellent from Pacifica Hotels. So I have already booked for three days later this month when I need to be back in San Diego.

Our main need was a kitchen since we were bringing homemade baby food with us, and were on a budget. The property is a bit dated, so don't expect luxury in terms of room, bathroom or kitchen amenities. However, we found everything to be clean and met our needs. The staff were great - we needed a few things for our son (extra sheets after he got sick one night, extra trash cans for diapers, etc.) and every request was met within minutes. This past trip, all of the self-serve luggage carts were gone from downstairs - my husband informed the front desk and a cart was quickly to our door. Overall, we felt it was a good choice.

While we were here we met other couples who also come for long-term (one month plus) stays. We sit with each other at breakfast and catch up on the previous days' activities and chat about the plans for the day, comparing notes on where to go, where the bargains are, and what's going on -- opera, concerts, newborns at the zoo.

First off, the suite was huge and laid out in a way that made it feel more like an apartment. The bed was big and plush and extremely comfortable, the closet was HUGE, the sofa was just right for snuggling in front of the tv, and the kitchen had all the cooking stuff we needed. The little patios were a cute idea, but ours loooked out over the parking lot of the building next door and wasn't as private as it could have been with better design. The free breakfast every morning was a nice touch, and the lady manning the breakfast room (who makes extra thick, yummy waffles) was very nice.

Although downtown is about 3 miles, on a nice day (which most are in San Diego) it would be a really easy walk! There is plenty of public transportation (bus) as well. 2. Physical property.

The rooms are all suites with a full kitchen and a sep. bedrroom. Very spacious! It appears all rooms have a patio with furniture - which is awesome! 4. Very clean! 5. Free Wifi that worked very well! The negatives: 1. Although I loved the location and physical layout, the hotel is a bit outdated. Certain things are fairly up-to-date (like the bedding) but other things (like the kitchen) could use a little modernism. In any case, it's all comfortable and worked for us.. 2. The bathroom shower was probably the worst hotel shower head I've had in a while. Maybe it was just bad luck in this room?! It was a cheap fiberglass tub and a THIN shower curtain and didn't hold the water back. 3. At check-in, the clerk was a little surly. However, the other staff I ineracted with seemed a bit friendlier. 4. They charge $6/day for parking, which I thought was a bit ridiculous. 5 There is no workout room!

Since I am a diabetic and have some food issues, I prefer to cook most of my own food. However, there are dozens of restaurants within minimal walking distance and food shops like Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Ralphs, Vons, etc.etc.The room itself while a little dated decor-wise was spotlessly clean and had everything I needed including a full-sized 'fridge, microwave, oven and cooktop, toaster and all necessary pans and utensils. Anything I lacked, the friendly, accommodating Mexican staff brought in, including immediate fixing of wayward plumbing (a toilet that ran). Aron the manager was extremely friendly, helpful and solved an internet problem while I was there. It's true that the building is situated across from a hospital because it was former accommodation for student nurses and doctors, but any complaints about that like in a former review should be modified. If you need a quiet place, you don't park yourself next to a hospital no matter how much double glazing there is. I also booked this motel because of the heated swimming pool and jacuzzi which I needed to workout torn shoulders. The only thing that can be improved in this regard is that there should be a sign--and it made clear when registering--that after hours--or dinner at least--that the small jacuzzi area should be child free and a place to relax since it is very small. Even though I booked the corner room I'd had previiously, at one time a family moved in above me with apparently two small children running and stamping around. But all it took from me was a polite visit upstairs to let the mother know and the problem was solved. My unit had a nice balcony with a view of a freeway, but at least it was a place to sit out and enjoy fresh air. It's true that the breakfast could be improved because there is not much for a diabetic. However, that is certainly a special need and I don't expect every hotel/motel to accommodate this which is why I shop for myself. I did find it a bit annoying that unless I got quickly to breakfast (not always possible with my business appointments) that the newspapers had run out.

Stale cereal and flavorless waffles. The parking is very tight especially if you have an SUV of any sort. I do have some positives about our experience. Good sized room, fairly comfortable beds and a very nice staff. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. Overall I think this is a standard motel which is trying to be a lot fancier than it really is. Wouldn't stay here again.

Others here have complained about the noise: be advised, the hotel is next to a hospital, so there is the occasional ambulance going by, and is on a main street in a business district. These things did not bother us, but are good to note. The only other caveat I would note is that we booked our stay only 24 hours in advance and on the hotel's website. When we got there, reception did not have a record of our reservation and the agent at the desk said it must not have come through yet.

The front desk staff was very cheerful, the continental breakfast room staff was also friendly, but the real test was when our daughter had an accident in the bathtub during a bath and when we phoned to get cleaner to clean it up, we got a very quick response (although no offer to clean it up themselves which I wouldn't have expected :).

There was a discount for a 4 day stay. The 1 bedroom suite we were in is quite spacious, and there was a sofa bed in the living room too. It housed my family of 4 comfortably.

Our room was serviced everyday, the rubbish in the kitchen was cleared, our towel changed and our bed made everyday. Well done, the housekeeping staff of the hotel. One improvement that I would like to suggest to the hotel is to change the shelf by the doorway. Apparently, it was a shelf once upon a time, but the door have now been removed, and the several levels of wooden planks now hang loosely on the wall. I only dare to put light things on it. Perhaps it is time to either remove it or install a new shelf. The bathroom has a bathtub, and bath robes were provided. There is pay TV and TV Games in the living room. My son had a good time indulging himself in the games, which comes up to about US$60. Anyway, it is not often that he has such opportunities. Breakfast was provided in the breakfast room, which is beside the pool. This was the highlight of our stay here. The staff in the breakfast room were prompt in replenishing the food, courteous in their interaction with the hotel guests, and very accomodating. There is a variety of food, including the favourite of most guests, self-made waffle. There is also a restroom and TV in the room. The front desk was prompt in checking us in and out, but unfortunately the hotel shuttle was down when we need it to go to the airport. We took a taxi instead, which doesn't cost too much. The hotel is also quite near to the train station. We took a train from Anaheim to San Diego, the costal scenery along the way was great. There were plenty of taxi outside the station. We took a taxi too from the zoo back to the hotel, which cost less than $10. There are also buses passing nearby the hotel. We took bus 10 from the bus stop near the hotel to the old town interchange, and change to bus 9 to go to the Sea World. There is a Vons supermarket less than 1 mile away from the hotel, and also a cheap Chinese restaurant, Panda Express, less than half a mile from the hotel.

This is an older hotel in the quaint, safe, uptown area of San Diego called Hillcrest. It is located directly across the street from a hospital but we only heard ambulances 3 times during our stay and never at night. We stayed on the 2nd floor and only heard walking from above twice in the bathroom. We had a one bedroom suite which had 2 queen beds in the bedroom and a queen pullout sofa in the livingroom. We fit 3 adults and 3 children comfortably. There was a full kitchen with pots, dishes and utensils, a coffee maker and microwave. There was plenty of closet space and hangers to my surprise. There was a balcony off the livingroom that did have a safety bar lock for the children but the bedroom window did not have any lock or screen so if the kids opened it, out they could go. So my husband wedged something between the wall and the window for their safety. There is a laundry room on the 4th floor wich was convenient but you must bring detergent with you or you can buy it at the front desk for $1. There is no change machine in the laundry room so bring that too. The washer is $1 and the dryer is 75 cents. There is a nice pool area with a hot tub, both were very clean and the hot tub nice and hot. Even though it is an older hotel, everything was kept very clean. From the room to the grounds I was very pleased with the cleanliness. There is a complimentary breakfast that was a great start for a busy day. It included bagels, english muffins, toast, 3 types of cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, make your own waffles (great for the kids), apple, orange, and cranberry juice, muffins, coffee, tea and milk. This was a great breakfast with plenty to choose from and something for everyone. Martha was one of the breakfast hosts and she was the BEST!!. She was friendly, helpful with the kids making their waffles and making sure we had everything we needed. She was happy and smiling and we looked forward to seeing her at breakfast each morning. Our last day there Martha was off and breakfast just wasn't the same. We would go back just to see Martha. On our first night at the hotel I noticed the air conditioning unit was leaking water so at midnight I called the front desk and let them know we needed this fixed. The next day when we came home from Legoland, there was a new, updated digital unit installed and in perfect working condition. I also called housekeeping the next night to let them know we needed more shampoo and soap and coffee creamer because we had 6 people in our suite and the next day and every day after there was plenty of everything. I was very pleased with the response I received when I needed something from the hotel, this showed great customer service. This hotel is 30 min. to Legoland, 10 minutes to Sea World and 5 minutes to Balboa Park. They did give us directions at the front desk which was helpful. No matter what time of day we got back to the hotel there was always parking and spots close to the door. We never had a problem parking and the hotel was sold out when we were there. I was a little nervous reading the negative reviews about the parking and ambulance noise and bugs but I did not find any of this to be true.

Quite disappointing for our much anticipated holiday in San Diego!", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Albert, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cOutdated and disappointing\u201d", "Author": "AlbertaKennyBoy", "ReviewID": "UR6540965", "Content": "After a great 3 nights at the Embassy Suites in LA, we were rather disappointed with how outdated and in need of refurbishing this hotel was. Our first room wasn't all that clean on checking in, so we asked for another suite. The staff were accommodating, but the second suite, although cleaner, had the surface of the shower stall flaking off and some mould. The most disappointing aspect though was the fold-out sofa bed. Very hard to sleep when you have metal rails or whatever sticking into your back all night long. We cut our stay short at this hotel, and wouldn't go back there. The one positive was ample parking.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sommerset Suites Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d112279-Reviews-Sommerset_Suites_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$137 - $239*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">606 Washington St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92103</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515608", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e8/64/e864c502ac23c78fb38dccbcbd6d55b21large.jpg"}}
