Its situation near the Termini station means it is central for airport and port connections, and also for all public transport round Rome itself. However, it is also ideal for explorers on foot. There are many fascinating sights right on the doorstep, including the Diocletian Baths; a short stroll away is the Quirinale and 5 minutes further the Trevi area. The Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Colosseum, the Forum area....all the classics this side of the river are enjoyably walkable.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen some of the best we've seen (we are well travelled and not easy to please about comfortable beds)! Breakfast is indeed expensive as others have said but there are many other places for that within close proximity (lovely deli / coffee shop straight across the road in a covered arcade). One niggle common among hotels: bottled water in the room - well done St Regis for providing any complimentary water at all (2 small bottles a day), but it is much more impressive to be left a couple of litre bottles and find them replaced morning and night...costs hotels next to nothing; but so appreciated by the thirsty sightseer! However, full marks secured for this hotel by the spot on approach to our late check out request on the last day (3pm instead of 12 noon) - a quick check by the front desk to see there were no guests checking in, and we were told we could check out when we wished, free of charge.

The room itself was incredibly decorated with a giant Murano glass chandelier. 3. Even though we were there in March, the room was very hot. We could open the windows to cool things down, but the front of the hotel is on a main road with sirens and traffic going by all night. This didn't bother us (since we could probably sleep through a nuclear bomb), but I could see this really bothering a light sleeper. 4. We had the hotel arrange for a sedan transfer to/from FCO, and everything went smoothly. When we arrived, the driver was waiting with a sign, and the return transfer went just as smoothly. 5.

Why can't more places do that?! I was really disappointed to find out we were a half hour late to the champagne sabering, but our server actually offered to do it again for us. Even better, he let me saber the bottle with him! The staff really went out of their way to make our experience memorable. Room: Our room was like a museum; there were murals on the walls and framed artwork that looked like something from the Vatican, columns that separated the entry way from the room. The room itself was very spacious and clean, and the bed was by far the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in. The pillows...ahhh, the pillows. Divine. This hotel was a splurge, but worth every penny.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cUltra-Stylish Grand Dame Hotel\u201d", "Author": "drewLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR125143903", "Content": "I had a four day visit to Rome in Mid-February, and had four wonderful days at this hotel. You have to appreciate (when booking) the sheer history of this building, and that every square inch of it may not be as ultra-pristine as say the George V in Paris, but, this is reflected in the fact that it's not E800/night like the Cinq!!!! When I walked into the Main Lobby with sunken marble floor, it reminded me of the Ritz in London, therefore low and behold I later learnt that it was in fact Ceszar Ritz that originally designed the commissioned build of the Hotel in the late 1800's, so this came as no great surprise. The service in the hotel is amazing, and the staff have a genuine warm sincerity which lacks in some 5*Deluxe establishments, unless you are a celeb of course!!!! The rooms were typically in-keeping with what you would expect from a Grand Dame Hotel, and all 5*Deluxe \"in-room\" amenities as standard. The concierge Staff bent over backwards to help with Restaurant bookings, Opera Tickets, Transport etc., and housekeeping responded like lightening to urgent Laundry and pressing requests. Our Room typically \"Gold and Red Romanesque/Empire\" decorated was beautiful and immaculately \"shabby chic\", and looked onto some neo-classical side buildings, which on a night were illuminated and added a romantic feel to the room. The bar is very attractive, and whilst the drinks/food are expensive, they are no dearer than neighboring top-flight Bars, clubs and Restaurants. My general overview is that this hotel represents excellent value, is highly respected in Rome as being one of \"thee\" addresses, (whilst we were in the Bar we overheard a Royal Ambassadors' Representative planning an event), and its locality to exclusive V.Veneto is very central to everything that happening. If this Hotel always bore the \"Crown\", its certainly not slipped yet!!!

Unfortunately my wife was set on staying at the St. Regis so I disregarded the low rating on Tripadvisor and booked our stay. In short, the hotel was once a grand hotel but has since seen it's prime. The rooms were large but old. The service was non-existant and everything you touch cost double of what you would pay on the street, this is what I like to call movie theater pricing. Our bad experience started when we checked in. The desk told me that it would be an additional $100 euro per night because I reserved as a single occupancy and was with my wife. I fully understand that this is a policy and the guy at the desk couldn't really do anything about it but I've travelled all over the world and have never had to pay extra for when my wife travels with me. It's not like they are providing any additional service (or any service at all). We couldn't just walk out so we went to the room and immediatly started looking for another room. Luckily for me there were rooms available at the Albergo Del Senato (the second best hotel in Rome as per Tripadvisor at the time of this review). We immediatley reserved those rooms and checked out of the St. Regis. Some other points to note: 1. the new hotel was twice as nice, better location and half the price; 2. the St. Regis charged for everything including $25 for internet service, the new hotel was free; 3. The location of the St. Regis is not so nice, you are near the train station and it feels very industrial; 4. Price: I know I said this but even with the \"special\" rate that the St. Regis was giving me the new hotel was less than half of the price. We paid over $500 for one night at the St. Regis (with taxes and internet charges) and only $230 per night at the Albergo del Senato with free internet and amazing service. I did recieve an email from one of the managers after my stay where he appologized and referred to their pricing policy. My response to that is that I really don't care about your policy. If you have an inferior product at an unreasonable price you will not remain in business.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a complete renovation\u201d", "Author": "kate0614", "ReviewID": "UR125006611", "Content": "I had a nice stay at the St. Regis, thanks to the lovely staff and decent accommodations. However, I'm sorry to say that overall, this hotel is not worthy of the St. Regis brand. They should downgrade it to a Sheraton or something until they can renovate. Now for the good and the bad... The good: the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, as you would expect. Great bartenders who actually know how to make a good cocktail. We were welcomed warmly by the bellmen and front desk staff, who were all lovely. The concierge was very sweet and helpful and generally quite knowledgeable, although we noticed they are not a great authority on restaurants (told us a fish restaurant was for meat and pasta, not fish, and also that it was closed on Sunday, when in fact it is one of the few restaurants open on Sunday). The property is fairly grand, and you can tell it was once a very fine hotel. The not-so-good: I experienced two small glitches in the service. First, on the morning we checked in, I was told I could relax in the lobby while my room was being prepared. No problem: I went and settled down in the lobby restaurant to have some breakfast and check my email while I waited. I found I couldn't sign on to the internet because I had not yet been assigned a room number, but when I approached the hostess, she was not helpful and told me I had to speak to the front desk. This was awkward since I had just sat down to eat and had sort of settled down at my table with my things. I had to abandon my belongings at the table and go over to the front desk, where they kindly gave me a card with a code that I could use to sign on. It wasn't a big deal, but not really something that should happen at a St. Regis. The hostess should have given me a card or sent someone to get one from the front desk. They were not at all busy, so there is no reason someone could not have helped with this. The second issue was the housekeeping staff. While they did an adequate job cleaning, there was no attention to detail. They cleaned and replaced the towels and made the bed, but didn't retie the robes, organize our toiletries, or straighten up the room much -- it seemed like they kind of just blew through. They left water and fruit for us on the first day, but not after that. Very inconsistent. The bad(ish): The hotel has really seen better days. Nothing about this hotel gleams, and the furnishings in the lobby are really quite worn and faded. The paint on the walls is scuffed and chipped in places, the carpet looks old and kind of dingy, etc. The hotel is just badly in need of a complete renovation. We also found the bed to be not very comfortable. Having stayed at other St. Regis properties and been suitably impressed, I found this one to be quite a contrast. If you are expecting a typical modern luxury hotel, I recommend you adjust your expectations. This property may have met that description many years ago, but it does not today. While I truly had a wonderful trip and appreciate the kind staff at the St. Regis, I probably would not go back until they renovate.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "jungonzales", "ReviewID": "UR124767323", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last January of 2012 and I have nothing to say but all praises.

I kept remembering it as one of the nicest hotels I had ever stayed in. When I decided to take a spur of the moment trip to Rome last week with my 2 children (ages 11 and 12) I was quickly reminded of why I had such a nice memory, The only thing that was off was the size of the entrance. For some reason I had a grand circular drop off in my mind. In fact it was a very small, just enough space for a small car to enter and circle around. The location is very good. There are other nice hotels (Westin) that I think have a little better location because where the Regis is, it's a little tight. The small one way street makes it feel closed in. The Regis is walking distance to everything. The staff greeted us in an over the top, glad to have you type fashion. We were upgraded to an imperial room as platinum members which was large, very pretty, very elegant, large windowed space with all the amenities. The view was a courtyard view but we wanted quietness to get over our jet lag. Views might be limited there. Not sure about that. The products (Remede, my favorite) are the same as in New York and Atlanta. The showers are fantastic! The bath is small, typical of europe. The best thing about the room was the bed. MUCH better than NYC Regis. We had a little trouble with the television and within 15 min, he had it fixed. Service was the best! Nothing to complain about, and I'm picky! If I had to write anything that I didn't find outstanding, it would have to be not having a traditional restaurant to go to. The eating space was in the grand room just after the reception. It's a lobby type room with tables around and massive ceilings. Not a specific room to eat in. This hotel is wonderful but expensive. 3 hot chocolates one night before bed, 45 euro. Not complaining, we had the best darn hot chocolates that side of the pond. I recommend this hotel to all. We stayed at the Westin Excelsior also to see what it was like. It was very nice as well. Both had it's qualities. The Regis is the better hotel, the Westin had the better open location. They were only a couple of blocks apart.

Imperial room I think which was great because we traveled with an 11 month old and it gave her lots of room to crawl around. The decor in the room very similar to the website pics. Not modern, but Roman decor. Our room faced the main street outside and when window was close it was very quiet. The rooms seem very soundproof as we did not here anything next door or in the halls all trip. The one complaint is I think this hotel turns off the AC in the fall sometime and our room did not have it. When it got hot at all in the room we had to open the window to outside. Kind of annoying.

Rooms- I was given a 'junior suite' and while smallish, had all the trappings- B&O tv in room, Bose sound dock in sitting area, nicely and classically decorated- a great way to start the Rome vibe on your first day in Rome. Bathroom facilities and provisions were high quality. Gym- enough for a 'vacation workout' and free isotonics provided. Internal area- very classy and old school and I recommend you walk around, walk down the main stairway, use the old school lifts, observe the furniture and different names of rooms. Location, metro just around the corner and less than ten minutes to Termini so no complaints, with at least one decent and friendly Italian restaurant very near the hotel ('Target'). My only gripe would be having to ask twice and still nobody came to get the Bose to work on day one, and despite eventually getting it to work on day two, no one apologized for the lapse.... An example of the lack of touch general feeling I got. Another being a rather impersonal (albeit effective) concierge assistance on Rome eats.

We checked into the beautiful hotel, the woman at the front apologized for the bellman but also stated since it was an Italian Holiday the Cab drivers charge more. Room was very nice, we were sleeping when the cleaning lady came to clean our room and we asked that she come back. We called the front desk on our way out so the room would be freshened up. The room was never cleaned and we had to call the front desk three times to get clean towels. We used the gym; the staffs at the spa/gym were not friendly. The water in the cooler was warm and the air conditioning was off, the gym experience was not pleasant. Especially when its hard enough making yourself go to the gym while on vacation, once you get there it should be a pleasant experience. That evening we went to the concierge to get a recommendation for dinner. It was a woman; I do not remember her name. I can not remember the name of the restaurant she sent us to ( I wish I could remember). We got to this really cute restaurant. We asked the waiter for suggestions; he suggested only the highest priced items on the menu which was very disappointing. We told him we were not going to try his suggestions and ordered our food. A few minutes later the waiter brought out several appetizers that we did not order. We were confused and said the waiter we didn't order this, at the same time two American woman were walking out from the restaurant and told us to be careful that they had just done the same thing to them and when the bill came they were charged for a lot of things they did not order. Immediately we asked for the manager, told him to remove these items from our table and give us our bill for our drinks. We told the manager about the American tourist that they had done this to and luckily told us on their way out or this same thing would have happened to them. We got our bill and left. I'm EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED that a STARWOOD hotel, ST. REGIS Concierge would send American Tourists to a place that pulls scams on their guests. I called the concierge immediately after we left the restaurant very upset. We checked out the next morning as we were so upset with this hotel, on our way out we asked to speak to a manager. The front desk person said that the manager was in meetings and asked what happened and if he could help. We told him all of what happened to us and our experience and still have yet to hear from any manager.

We were travelling with our 2 teenage children. I used SPG points (Many!) to accomodate us in a Jr. Suite that connected to a Deluxe Room. Here are my thoughts.... Check-in: We arrived around 7PM local time after our overseas flight. The bellman and doormen were very gracious with their welcome to some very weary travellers. The gentleman at the front desk was attentive and efficient with our registration and was able to confirm our connecting rooms. This was very much appreciated as not all properties are as receptive to accomodating families. After we were checked in, the gentleman came around and personally showed us to our suite which was on the third floor (read 2nd floor). On the way, he provided and infomative narrative of where things were located in this grand hotel. Upon reaching our rooms, he informed us that our baggage would follow us up shortly..... Rooms: We found the rooms very clean and well maintained.....which is the first critieria of any property. Then the WOW factor. The Deluxe Room was beautiful. Very ornate and spcaious. The marble bathroom was lovely and well laid out. The bed linens were sumptous. There was a nice seating area in front of the bed. We noticed that the bed in the room was made up as a king even though we had requested 2 beds. No problem. A quick call and a maid quickly appeared to rectify the situation. All in all, the deluxe room category was fantastic. Now, the Junior suite. Again, beautiful but not as well laid out. as the previous connecting room. The marble bathroom was definitely a step down from the deluxe room. It was as if they retrofiited the space and had a check list to make sure that all the parts were there.....but just did not fit! The sitting area in the suite was comfy with a small desk and an armoir with a flat screen TV. From the sitting area of the suite, one could past the french doors into the master bedroom. Again, lovely linens, wonderful mastress, but a very small room! For any interested readers out there, I guess that I am mentioning all of this, in that if it was just my husband and myself travelling I would most certainly opt for the Deluxe Room over the JR. suite.....points or cash!! And here is the clincher. We were under the impression that the Jr. Suite came with butler service. ( I should preface to say that we have stayed at properties with bulter service and the minimum service we have received is a quick courtesy call to see if we needed assistance with unpacking, clothes pressed, anything to make our stay more comfortable, etc.) We were not contacted at all except as we were leaving and a gentleman knocked and asked my husband if we enjoyed our stay......We were not sure if this was the butler or not. In the end, it really did not matter, as we did not want anything unpacked as we were moving on to the cruise in 2 days. In hindsight, we would have been a very easy client for Mr. Butler....because we really required nothing...perhaps a shoe shine....but no worries, his tip stayed securely in my husband's wallet.....So, dear readers......perhaps rethink if you want to pay for non-existent butler service because the suite itself does not merit the differnce in price from the deluxe room. Oh, and I want to mention that we were given a total non-view rooms. We had the pleasure of looking out at an aging roof.....but the flip side is that it was very quiet and lent itself to some very good sleeps. (Rome is a very noisy city....so this proved to be a good thing for a short stay!) Concierge: We found the concierge team to be very friendly, engaging and helpful. Our arrival night, we wanted to dine at a casual, easy walking distance restaurant with of course, great food! The recommendation did not disappoint. Target restaurant! For a quick, easy, delicious dinner, this establishment was a hit! The concierge was also excellant at routing out a map of some lesser known attractions ( we have been to Rome previously). As an aside, there is a church \"of the bones\" that is within walking distance. Our kids were fascinated with this for some reason.....check it out and you will understand. Restaurants & Bars: We did not have the pleasure of dining at any of the hotel's establishments. I should mention that if the opportunity would have presented itself, I would have most certainly enjoyed a glass of champagne in the bar listening to the excellant pianist....ahhhhhh the ambience! Check-out: We had a bellman knock at our door at the appointed time to help us with our luggage. WE proceeded on to the front desk to depart. Everything was in order and our private driver was there and we left for the port. Conclusion: Would I stay here again? The million dollar question that all hoteliers want to know of their guests......The answer is PROBABLY....IF... I used points or if I was able to have a great negotiated rate. The hotel is in an OK location. We found it easy to walk to all the big sites minus Vatican City. However, it is not surrounded by the ambience that many other hotels are enxconed within. The personel were fine but certainly not as gracious as some of the other finer luxury establishments such as the Four Seasons. Also, I was disappointed that the butler did not greet us. Perhaps there was a mix-up in our suite category. I am not sure and it really did not matter. But I think it prudent for me to mention that my husband and I had previously stayed at the St. REgis Bora Bora. Again, our suite was to include butler services. It was non-existant, as well. Perhaps the St. REgis butler service is of the adage.....\"wait until they call you.!\" Again, I am not sure. (I should also mention that in Bora Bora, we used $$ not SPG to settle our account. So, I cannot conclude that in Rome it was a snub against our points.) Regardless, I personally feel that to give a property an excellant rating, they have to deliver what they advertise. To be a 5-star property, I think an establisment must be pro-active and not reactive in their guests needs. For me, the St. REgis Grand fell short. Having said that, it is most certainly a beautiful, clean hotel that suited our needs for our short stay.

The beautiful hotel, recently redone, is full of marble floors, frescoed ceilings and lovely moldings throughout. Even the stairway and hallways are sights to see. We both agreed that this hotel is perhaps nicer than the St. Regis in NYC, which I believe is the flagship St. Regis. As soon as we walked to the front door, our luggage was taken and later brought to our room. Doormen were always there to open the door. Check-in and check-out were easy. Staff was friendly. The concierge was great and showed us that most Rome sights are within walking distance of the hotel (except the Vatican) and made a dinner reservation for us. We had limited contact with the staff but found them to be excellent. Also, maid service was good, with towels and toiletries replaced and the bed turned down while we were at dinner. There is a fairly large business center, though prices were high. I would have loved an airline check-in kiosk to print our tickets. The room was outstanding, even though we were in their most modest room since we had used Starpoints to pay. The ceilings were soooo high, and the doors had hand-stenciling. There was a chandelier above the bed and hand painted fresco above the bed. Our room had two floor-to-ceiling windows with large drapes and a window seat. I only wish I had time to curl up and read a book there. There were slippers and robes, plenty of Remede toiletries, and bottled water. We also had a large flatscreen TV with channels in multiple languages, including English, and DVD. The butler service was slightly stripped down from the butler service at other St. Regis hotels (suites have full service), but this suited us fine since I'm not used to having a butler anyway! There was a card outlining the normal services -- shoe shine, pressing, concierge, etc. The gym was small and you had to go through the spa to access it. It had brand new equipment. The hotel was quiet and the bed was divine -- finally a good night's sleep! Our experience was 5-star in every way, and I do believe that the furnishings and decor were nicer than at the St. Regis in New York. The hotel is a quick walk to the train station Termini, also.

The hotel itself is beautiful and is convenient to most attractions in Rome. We were able to walk everywhere other than the Vatican. The rooms are nicely appointed and in very good condition. The service is, with some exception, not top notch. When my husband and I arrived, our room was not yet ready. We were shown inside and offered tea and coffee while we waited (20 minutes or so) for our room. This is the way guests should be treated at hotels, though this is rarely the case. From here, the service level decreased. Upon returning from dinner, my husband called the front desk to let them know that he would like his shoes shined. He left the shoes outside the room and retrieved them in the morning. They had not been shined. The maid then neglected to give us washcloths on our second day. We called the front desk to have them brought to our room, but we instead received long towels. Upon checkout we asked to leave our bags at the hotel for a few hours. The man at the front desk merely pointed in the direction we should head in to have our bags checked rather than offering to help. When we went to the other side of the lobby, the men actually walked past us and ignored us rather than handling our bags. These are all small things, but it is the small things that really count at what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. My greatest annoyance was with a tour we booked through the concierge- a private Vatican tour- we were quoted a price of \u20ac230 for 3 hours. What we were not told was what the price did NOT include. First, transportation- after meeting our guide, we had to hail a cab and pay an additional \u20ac10 to get to the Vatican. Second, our tickets- at the end of the tour our tour guide informed us that in addition to the \u20ac230 for the 3 hours and the \u20ac10 we spent on the cab, we had to pay \u20ac50 for the tickets she had purchased for us. In addition, the clock started running the moment we were introduced to our guide at the hotel. So approximately 25% of our 3 hour tour was taken up with travel time to the Vatican, standing in line for security and gathering our tickets for entry. I think this is VERY expensive, and I also believe that it was very underhanded to not have been told that the quoted price of \u20ac230 was only for the 'time' of the guide, nothing else. The guide was informative, but she should be. I do hope that a member of the St. Regis responds to this post.

I was very excited and had very high expectations from the jewel in the Starwood hotel chains crown (www.spg.com). We arrived at the St Regis by taxi and had to lug our bags out of the taxi ourselves until the bell desk finally realized that we were checking in and then came running to our service. Maybe they there not used to a pair of Aussies turning up in shorts and a t-shirt? We were welcomed by one of the front desk staff and were promptly checked in. Very efficient but not overly friendly as I would have expected. We were then escorted to our room by the front desk member and welcomed to the St Regis. So far so good. After arriving to our room I wanted to iron a shirt for dinner. To my surprise there was no iron and then found out they were not permitted in the rooms. Apparently this is due to a fire regulation, but I'm not sure about this as the regulation was quickly followed by details of how the hotel can iron our clothes (for a fee of course). After spending \u20ac60 on pressing I was not impressed. We called the front desk to advise them to collect the ironing. After and hour they had not appeared so we went out for dinner expecting someone to have collected them by the time we returned... 2 1/2 hours later we return to find our un ironed clothes!!! After a quick call to the front desk....all sorted. I would have expected flawless service when we were paying > \u20ac500 a night. Breakfast was fantastic. You can have the buffet with freshly cooked eggs or you can order from the menu. One of the better hotel buffets I have seen but I'm glad the cost was included in our room. The overall service at this hotel was not online with the \u20ac500+ a night we were spending and this left me feeling a little disappointed in the St Regis brand as I probably would have got better service at the Westin hotel. The room and bathroom were extremely large and there was plenty of space. There was plenty of towels and band name amenities on hand. The hotel maids also ensured we had plenty of everything and refreshed our towels and amenities during nightly turndown service. On our final nite the complimentary bottle of wine and cheese was a good gesture and one I've not seen many hotels offer.

Very beautiful, charming and plush. The room had antique style furniture, artwork, etc. The room was huge, the bathroom was huge. It had lovely double windows that opened up with a little bench to watch the street below. The paint on the windows and bathroom is old and chipped but that is Italy and adds to the ambience. We had a superior king room with the extra butler service-which was awesome. The butler was so nice and helpful. Getting complimentary coffee and tea in the afternoon was the best little extra after a long morning touring Rome. We had fruit, a bottle of wine and cheese sent to our room as an extra perk also. It was so nice. The quality of the food was very good also. The downsides would be that this hotel sits on top of one of the hills of Rome and is a bit out of the way, and a bit isolated from attractions. (of course this is no fault of the hotel) The walk down the hill into Rome is lovely-5-10 mins to the Spanish Steps. But up the hill after a long day is pretty tiring. Taxi service is Rome is excellent though. We never had a problem getting one. The mattress was very uncomfortable-not the worst we've had. But from our experience in all of Italy, hard mattresses seem to be the thing. An extra pillow or two and we slept fine. The only real \"complaint\" I can give is that an extremely important piece of luggage for my medical equipment was \"taken\" from my room. I travel with a very delicate medical machine and when I fly it needs to be packed in a special case. That case was taken from our room. I can't believe someone would steal it, because I don't know how someone would even know what it is or what they'd use it for. But I have NO clue how a maid could think it was trash when it is clearly marked. I don't know which is worse! We found out it was gone when we were packing to leave. We had a train to catch in 40 mins. Management came, they were very apologetic and within 10 minutes they brought up a small bag for me to fit the machine into. I'm sure this is a freak thing. And although there is no excuse for this happening, they tried to fix it very quickly. So other than that we had a wonderful stay.

We were told that our suite came with a butler and he was truly wonderful to us during our stay. One of the many things he would do for us was the wake up service. Instead of waking up to an alarm or phone call, Francesco (our butler) would open up our curtains allowing the sun light to come in. He would then set up our tea/coffee/juice and leave a newspaper for us, all without being intrusive. When it came time to start our day & see the city with its many attractions (close to the vatican, coloseum, trevi fountain, spanish steps, etc.), Francesco would advise us to either walk, talk a cab or use the metro. Breakfast at the hotel was great. Again, not your usual toast, bagel & juice. They set up a full breakfast buffet, complete with an omelet station & mimosas. The chef & waitstaff were very friendly and endearing, so much so that they would remeber where we had visited and recommended other places to see. By the time we got back to the hotel after our excursions, Francesco would be well on his way to setting up tea time in our room. After relaxing a bit, we would head down stairs and speak with the helpful concierge who would recommed places for dinner. They made reservations for us each time & ensured a great table. Their recommendations were exquisite! After walking off dinner and desert around town, we would head back to the room to get some sleep on one of the most amazing beds ever.

The property is one of the best Starwood properties worldwide and I have visited over 200 of them. This property is close to Piazza Esedra or the Repubblica metro line on Linea A (Red line one stop from Terminitowards the Vatican). It is also next door to S Maria Della Vittoria where you can go Inside and attend Mass, light a candle or just sit and gaze upon Bernini's the Ectascy of St Teresa. The hotel is very quiet. This is good since you are next to a church and on a piazza with three churches. I like hearing the bells in the morning and evening. I know about il pane di Genzano but do not know a Hermes scarf from a 3euros scarf on the street. The hotel has a personal shopper service and I think my wife will like her scarf and Bottega Veneta handbag. There are 168 rooms and each have a hand painted fresco of a famous church, fountain, or site in Rome. Everything works as if new. This hotel was one of the first Starwood properties to be renovated. The cooling or AC is great and I have kept my room like a meat locker.....this works since my wife likes to cuttlefish and play :) to keep warm. I recommend this tactic and blame it on the Italian AC system. The towels are huge and you also have linen towels and the bathrooms are all marble and complete with a magazine holder. My wife says that the magazine holder is a bidet and I have yet to figure out if you sit in it or straddle it or if you are supposed to insert the family jewels into the water. There are no instructions and glad we had a shower. I would love to know do you sit facing the water knob or away from it? Has anyone ever invented one of these so called bidets with a hand held hose to direct the water? My wife says enough on this topic. Last year, the toiletries in the hotel were exclusive scent by Laura Tonnatto and this year they are even better with toiletries by Laboratorie Remede and are so much better than il Pino di Sylvestre and has a mint or menthol scent. It is quite refreshing. The TV has many channels to choose from other than RAI Uno, Due, TRE. :). There are sky movie channels, sports, news and even Arabic channels. You can choose to watch CNN, BBC, EuroNews or Al Jazeera. All TVs are flat panel and are on swivel bases. I highly recommend that you get the butler service. The butler service is a feature of the St. Regis and there's nothing like getting a nightcap drink or wakeup call with hot pastries and cappuccino delivered by your personal butler. My butler was Gianni and he is the best one ever. I think he has established the standard and I love the long coat tails, bow tie, white gloves and silver traythateverything is delivered on. The bell desk and consierge staffs are also great. When I arrived, one of the other reception clerks recognized me and welcomed us bAck to the hotel. Monika (di Firenze) checked us in and our room was not ready and offered us a drink in the lobby (coffee or cappuccino). I ordered caffe freddo which is now ordered by the name caffe shakerato. The hotel does turndown service and refreshes towels which is a plus.

I had imagined that the hotel would be in some lovely square surrounded by beautiful buildings - boy was this not the case! The front of the hotel is so unassuming, I think that we would have just walked by it. The buildings around it are not pleasant but it is quite close to the main train station, right near a tube stop, la repubblica, which is a good location for accessing the train station etc. but the area felt incredibly unsafe. There were so many beggars in the area and at night we felt like we had to take a taxi everywhere. I appreciate that this is outside the control of the hotel but I feel it is worth mentioning, especially for single ladies travelling to this area. Furthermore, the hotel is really far from the main sights. You will certainly end up either using public transport or taking a taxi. The hotel is not worth the money that I spent. Check-in was a nightmare - unlike in most hotels, where you sign a sheet of paper etc., the St Regis has chosen to go high-tech and have an electronic pad that you complete check-in on. Sadly, it just didn't seem to work and the front desk agent admitted that they were having problems with this system. Get rid of it then! Anyways, what felt like hours later, check-in was completed and we were walked to our room. The room was a complete disappointment. Scuff marks all over the walls, a tiny room and the view was of an office block - charming! The minibar had not been replenished and when we called the front desk, we were told that the issue would be remedied. This never happened throughout our stay. The laundry form had already been filled out and when we asked for a new one, this request was also ignored. On the plus side, the room was very quiet and the amenities in the bathroom were lovely and of a very high quality. In one of the common areas of the hotel, we spotted a half eaten apple left on a table. Hours later when we walked by this area again, it was still there. The concierge was friendly but totally useless. We asked where we should go for an aperitif and he and his colleague couldn't recommend anywhere! Unbelievable! Also, we asked for help with the public transport system and were told that we should just take a taxi. The lobby area of the hotel is beautiful and we did eat there and were very impressed.

We are talking details here but still: What is up with receptionists not asking how your stay was, when you check out? Are they afraid you will complain? It makes you feel like it is all about the hotel and now that you are checking out, you are no longer part of it anymore.

We walked to the Westin Excelsior on our 4th day in Rome to see what it looked like. The area that the Westin is located in is so much better than the St. Regis location. If I would have known this before we booked I would have chosen the Westin hands down over the St. Regis. The Westin is as grand as the St. Regis, and you have a much nicer location. The street is way less busy and a lot wider and prettier. You have lots of restaurants to choose from near the Westin and none to choose from near the St. Regis. The only real restaurant close to the St. Regis is the one in the hotel and the prices are outrageous. Also just down the street from the Westin is the most beautiful park we have ever been in, there are water fountains and statues galore. The park was the best part of the Westin's location.

Everything was organized flawlessly and it was one of the most memorable NYE hotel-parties we've experienced to date (previously having celebrated at La Tour d'Argent, Hotel de Crillon, Eiffel Tower's Jules Verne & Bahamas' Ocean Club to name a few) but we were most impressed with the service and how staff made us feel as if we were the only, and the most important, guests of the hotel that week. On a spontaneous trip to Rome in August of 2007 we decided to spend another 3 nights at this hotel and felt like we were back at home. When deciding where to celebrate NYE 2009, fondest memories of St Regis's Ritz Ballroom came to mind and we booked another 7 nights. Nothing changed from our previous visits. Attentive service, old world atmosphere and the ever-present feeling that no one else but us matters prevailed. Our most recent stay was in August of 2009. We spent another two nights at St. Regis before heading down to Amalfi Coast. Imperial Guest room is rather spacious and has such a comfortable bed that you'll definitely have a hard time rolling out of it in the morning. Junior Suite is obviously much bigger in size and offers a separate living room & powder room. All four stays our room was facing the courtyard and it was very quiet. Breakfast is delicious and I suggest going for it every morning. If you plan on splurging on at least one restaurant while in Rome, make sure it's Le Grand's own Vivendo, which is known for its food (#1 restaurant in Rome) AND its contemporary decor, which takes you into another world as soon as you walk in from a completely different (in a good way) feel of the hotel. The location is very convenient. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to Via Veneto & Termini station, another 5 to Piazza di Spagna.

We chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site and also due to it's location. Originally we had planned to stay in the Westin but the reviews persuaded us to try the St Regis. On arrival the hotel looked very impressive, but the reception staff were less than welcoming initially, until a different receptionist took over half way through which did improve things slightly. The room on the 4th floor was lovely and overlooked the courtyard (so was very quiet). The air conditioning worked brilliantly and kept the room nice and cool during what was a very hot week. Before heading out sightseeing we thought it woud be a good idea to get advice from the concierge on tours of the Vatican. This proved to be a waste of time as they only seemed interested in selling extortionately priced tours. Do not be fooled into paying their prices. We used one of the open top tour buses to get to the Vatican and after a couple of minutes getting our bearings found a licenced tour company, down a side street off the right hand side of the Piazza in front of St Peters, who charged us 45 Euros each for a tour lasting two and half hours led by a History of Art graduate that took in the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel and then led us to St Peters all without any queues. On returning to the hotel we went for a drink in the bar. Sadly it has absolutely no atmosphere and was almost silent. Maybe it is the high bar prices that keep people away. It is a shame as the pianist playing there is very good. There are a couple of very good barmen there though who make great cocktails and proved vastly more helpful than the concierge when trying to make arrangements for transport to a concert on the outskirts of the city later in our stay. Again the concierge only offered a very expensive solution of the hotel car that came with a minimum 3 hour booking period and a cost approaching EUR 300.00! When asked for any other solutions he just shrugged. If you need transport in Rome and don't want to rely on the local taxis I would strongly reccomend Romecabs. Stefano who runs it is incredibly helpful as are his drivers. www.romecabs.com. They are also great for airport runs. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed, irrespective of star rating, that has refused to provide an iron and ironing board. They insist on you using their ironing service which again is ridiculously expensive (10 Euros for a tie and from memory around 20 Euros for a shirt). We opted to stay creased! We travel quite extensively and stay in either 4 or 5 star hotels and this is by the far the most dissapointed I have been left feeling by a hotel. It certainly does not live up to the standard we have come to expect from the Starwood group.

Flight was to arrive in Rome at 8AM and requested an early check-in. Called Starwood customer service day before departure to confirm booking. Review: My wife and I were greeted by the Head Bellman at the door, who took our luggage and directed us to the front desk. We were very warmly received and were told that we could check-in early and that we were being upgraded to a Deluxe room. We were then led to the beautiful hotel lobby for welcome drinks and a tray of small bites. Shortly, we were escorted up to our room, which was very spacious and well appointed, and looked very similar to the pictures on the hotel website. Our bags were brought up soon after. The bed was quite comfortable, and had a marble shelf behind it--a nice place to keep a glass of water (2 free bottles at turndown), cell phone/alarm clock, etc. The bathroom was very large, with separate shower and tub, as well as a large sink with lots of counter space. The only \"negatives\" about the room were the high price of internet (4E for 1 hour and up, but symptomatic of larger hotels everywhere since it is an easy way to make money), and the toiletries that we did not love. Otherwise, the room was great. The service at the hotel was also very high quality. Everyone smiled and said hello. The concierge was quite helpful in making dinner reservations and in giving us great directions. The doormen always helped to get the giant revolving door moving when we were entering or leaving the hotel, and had umbrellas ready if it was raining (they let us keep one at checkout). Part of the reason for booking was the location close to the metro in Piazza della Repubblica and to the Termini station (we took a train to Florence from Rome). To be fair, the hotel is not centralized, and despite the presence of a metro you will do alot of walking in Rome, so keep that in mind if you are considering the St Regis. Two final notes about the location -- first, there are a few cafes near the hotel for you to grab a morning espresso and a pastry (don't spend you money on hotel breakfast, nor the stomach space on breakfast foods); second, immediately after settling in you should walk around the corner to the tourism office and purchase a 20E Roma Pass (which provides you with 3 days of unlimited metro rides, free entrance to 2 museums (Vatican not included so buy online before you go), 50% off entrance to additional museums, and most importantly, the ability to blow past every line at every sight (again except the Vatican))", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cNot the standard of st.

This is not the best hotel I have stayed at, but very nice with excellent staff. And this means all staff from housekeeping to the Vivendo restaurant. I found it difficult to decide on the hotel, all 5*s in Rome have their pros and cons. Some don't even seem to have twin beds at all! St Regis is an old Grand hotel and we knew what we were going to get. At home I\u00b4m an Alvar Aalto kind of woman, but I also like the grand hotels, which make a nice change and that's what holidays are all about. The hall with the many chandeliers is really something to see. The room was beautiful in the same style, good beds. Our room was facing an inner courtyard, so it was very quiet and we slept well. Also, no noise was heard from the corridor. The check-in and check-out were quite efficient. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, which was very nice. The room was normal size (to a 5*) and the marble bathroom was quite big with a bath tub and a separate shower stall. Bathroom amenities were not quite to my best liking, I think Bulgari would be more suitable for this hotel. But this is nothing important. The bathrobes, towels and sheets were of an excellent quality. My only real complaint about the hotel is the glass partition of the shower stall. No matter how tight you tried to close it, there was water on the floor after a shower. We had several meals at the hotel, all were good (or even better) and the service always excellent. The Vivendo, where we had prebooked a table, was a really nice experience. Both restaurants have options for vegetarians, which I appreciate a lot. The Bar, which is also a less formal restaurant, served excellent pasta, sandwiches etc. Breakfast was 32,-, which is a reasonable price. The breakfast is normal, nothing spectacular. We had also booked a Mercedes with a driver to take us to the airport. He was at the hotel early and everything went smoothly. I recommend this service as it was not a nice experience to take the train into the city. All in all, I'm happy to recommend the St Regis. Last, a word of caution. Not at all about the hotel, but about the Roman taxis. Most of the drivers are nice and honest, but unfortunately not all. If they ask you if they can leave you not at the hotels' entrance, but somewhere near because of \"the traffic,\" just say no.

It was closed for a major rennovation when it became a member of the St. Regis Group and it was reopened in December 1999. Eight years later, this place looks a little run-down to us. They need to repaint some walls in the public areas as the colour is already fading. We also noticed burnt light bulbs in more than one chandelier at the lobby. The most unacceptable of all, there was cobweb at one corner of the high ceiling. We did not see flower arrangement which we consider a must for a luxurious hotel. The place just gave us an impression that they are low on maintenance budget. Althought we were not happy with the hardware, we were more than satisfied with the software.

When we first arrived, they upgraded us to a deluxe room, gave us complimentary breakfast and snacks at their bar and had the room ready for us in a jiffy (we came in at 10am). Location - its not smack in the middle of the tourist attractions but all major destinations (Spanish steps, Pantheon, Colosseum) are about a 20 minute walk or about 6 Euros by taxi. So quite convenient and it feels good to get away from the tourist throngs at the end of the day. Dont trust the distance estimates on the hotel website especially if you have a kid on a stroller. Rome was not built in a day but in the days of yore and it shows. The kid rattled and we hrrumphed and took taxis. There is a taxi stand right outside so it was easy. And its very very safe. Room - Even though we prefer minimalist balinese decor and not the opulent 19th century European style, the room was quite nicely done up. The 34 inch flat panel TV compensated. And they had a DVD player - useful for the kid. But the icing on the cake was an amazing bathroom - trust me in Europe, bathrooms are an afterthought. It had a separate walk-in shower so no half shower doors separaing the bathtub and and bathroom from imminent flooding. Food - did not eat at their restaurant; Their bar is great to sit but the food is average. Service was excellent. Breakfast and room service is expensive but there are multiple cafes just outside and you can say cappuccino to go without attracting puzzlement as in Paris. Finding fresh milk for the kid was hard - room service charges 7 euros which was way too steep. The first day when we asked for milk they sent it up for free; the rest of the days we got charged. So we trudged to the nearest supermarket which is about 5 blocks away. They should have a \"infants drink milk free\" program and parents would arrive in droves. Concierge and service - Mario and Omar were amazing; they have great maps, they made reservations for all the places so we managed to skip queues, and gave us excellent restaurant recommendations. However, the restaurants we went to were sometimes stuffy and not kid-friendly. (Aside: We did find perhaps the most kid friendly restaurant in all of Rome - called Life on Via della Vite near Spanish steps. The servers were the most kind and pleasant that we have encountered in all of Italy - they entertained our kid while we had a great dinner.) The hotel arranged a pricey private tour of the Vatican (at 230 Euros) but it was worth every cent. Our guide Fabio Luciani was very good (www.arslongatour.com) - pleasant, knowledgeable and well versed in European history. We cannot recommend him more strongly. Finally, service standards at the hotel was amazing - only the Aman resorts and some select 4 seasons are comparable. Overall, the best European hotel we have experienced - unfair of course, to compare it to Asian hospitality and service but they can give it a run for our money.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get better than this\u201d", "Author": "laabis", "ReviewID": "UR17600457", "Content": "When I booked this hotel, I didn't realize that this is the old Grand Hotel of Rome.

We then started our stay there in the deluxe room for 9 days. Overall the experience was very good. The help did seem a bit Stoic at times which I can understand and it wasn't always consistent. At times we arrived back from being out and were greeted warmly, other times no one was there. Also we ran into problems with the front desk deducting money for a charity whicih we had not authorized (only $1 but we like to be asked anyway) and with co-ordinating services for us. They also failed to mail out our postcards on time (they were received by everyone almost 3 weeks after we gave them to the front desk) and messed up one of our day trips. We did notice that the service did seem to deterioate over time due to what we thought might be that we were in a lesser room. But when the hotel upgraded us to the top floor villa suite overlooking the city on our last night there coming back from Naples, most complaints were forgotten. I had one problem with the hotel after we got back to the States when they wanted to charge me 90 Euros (about $170.00) to ship a pair of expensive shoes I had left in the room back to me. Naturally I balked at the fee and after some emails back and forth they relented and ended up shipping tthe shoes for free. I had to resort to threatening to dispute the hotel bill if they didn't lower the shipping fee. Mind you I would have paid something to have them shipped but 90 Euros was ridiculous especially since we had just stayed there for 10 days total. Any other 5 star hotel would have handled this with more tact and consideration. Do yourself a favor and don't leave anything behind. there. The food at the hotel was very good although very expensive. We hardly ate in the hotel because of the outrageous prices they charged for everything including snacks and water. We ended up going out for most of our meals and extras and to be honest it did somewhat diminish our experience there. We only did the breakfast twice.. I expect to pay more at a 5 star hotel but certainly not the prices we saw. Really outrageous. That aside, the hotel is very beautiful and elegant and everything you would expect a hotel of this caliber to depict. It has recetnly undergone a huge restoraton and they did a great job.

The smell must have been coming from the pipes or the ventilation I am not sure but we were there for 4 nights and it smelled all the time.

But the wonderfully comfortable bed and the huge accomodations (including double vanities, stand-up shower, soaking tub, and two TVs and two DVD players make strong arguments for why leaving the room is hardly necessary. When we did leave we enjoyed the (included) breakfast buffet--with wonderfully attentive service from every staff person and good food in a great location to boot. Daily treats from our personal butler were a nice addition and service calls were met with exceptionally prompt and especially attentive service. The concierge was helpful before and during our stay arranging hard to get reservations and train tickets in advance and graciously helping with new dinner ideas when our self-made plans fell through. One word of warning: staying at a high-end hotel apparently guarantees that the cost of the place they'll recommend for dinner, for tours, etc. will also be on the high end. Be prepared to be specific if you are not interested in paying top dollar for every meal. Gym facilitiies are limited, but you don't come here for the gym. Outside of that, we had no complaints and no quibbles. The St. Regis Rome was a fantastic way to start our honeymoon and (for the money) makes for a worthwhile and special experience.

Our stay was exceptional in every way. I travel relatively frequently for business, and can honestly say that I have never stayed in a more luxurious hotel. The St. Regis is sumptuously decorated, but compared to US hotels of this caliber the rooms are on the small size and thus there are no rooms with 2 queen beds. Accordingly, we had to book 2 rooms for our family of 4 (thus making an already expensive hotel 2x the price). Given the ages of our children, it was important to me that the rooms be connected -- when Starwood central reservations said they could not guarantee the rooms would be adjoining, I contacted the hotel directly who arranged for adjoining rooms. Service was above and beyond. We arrived by rental car on Saturday afternoon. I had been told by the rental car company that their offices closed at noon on Saturday and we would not be able to return the car until Sunday morning. So when we arrived at the hotel, I fully expected to pay for overnight parking and then dealing with the rental return the next day. Instead, when I pulled up to the front door, the bellman noticed that we had a rental car, and told us that he thought he would be able to arrange with the rental car company to come pick up the car from the hotel that afternoon, thereby saving us the overnight parking fees that the hassle of the return. 30 minutes later we received a call in our room informing us that Hertz was there to get our car. My only complaint is that the cost of breakfast was ridiculously high. While I expect the hotel to charge a premium for eating in the hotel, their buffet at EUR 47 per person was about 10x what we spent on breakfast out of the house.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved, the hotel, only like the location\u201d", "Author": "Valerie C", "ReviewID": "UR8704242", "Content": "We had a funny experience. Although I had lived in Italy for 4 years in the 80s, in Milan, I had only been to Rome once. I speak fluent Italian, so when we got off the train in the center of Rome, I asked the taxi driver to take us to the St. Regis. He pointed and said in Italian, \"Why do you need me to take you there? It's only 2 blocks away?\" (from the train station). So off my husband, me, and 2 high school boys walk towards where he pointed. We've gone a LONG 4 blocks from the train station, carrying our luggage, no one has EVER heard of the St. Regis that i ask, and we finally hail another taxi to take us in a big circle. Turns out no one knows the place as the St. Regis yet (they put that in very small letters); only still as the Grand. Remember that! Anyway, it was a wonderful hotel, probably not quite worth the price, to be honest, but the breakfast was fabulous. I had tried to decide between the Westin Excelsior and this hotel; walking down the via Veneto several times, I wish I'd done the Westin. It's in a much better location. Although, I must admit, being so close to the subway/train station did have its advantages. The rooms are small but elegant; I 'd have love to have seen the Westin's. Rome is a fabulous city--I was there 25 years ago and nothing compares to its history. Use the subway as much as you can--it's really safe and clean. I didn't like one restaurant we ate at near this hotel, to be honest. We had much better luck in the center of the city, near the Piazza Navona. And if you want to buy art work, absolutely do it there too! We got 4 incredible pieces of original artwork at about 1/4 the price of home. The concierge is very helpful at the hotel, he helped us get a fabulous private tour of the Vatican to skip the 4 hr. line. I did love this hotel, but I would also check out the Westin first.

Being farther on the East side of Rome's Centro Storico, most of your touring will likely require a Metro ride, but at only 1 euro each way, it's a safe, quick and easy way to get around to the Vatican, Forum, and Spanish Steps.

The hermes bath products were a very nice touch and were replinished regularly. The bathroom was probably the best hotel bathrooms that I can recall---roomy, but not absurdly so: two sinks and a separate tub and shower and a separate toilet room. So often, older grand hotels have small, small bathrooms which always disappoints my wife. Not the case with the St Regis. The hotel was renovated sometime in 2000 (I think) and they clearly spent time on updating the size of the bathrooms. We stayed in a deluxe king room and it was well suited for two people. A roll-away bed would be possible but would make the room snug. I would definately have breakfast included in the room rate--if purchased separately it would have been quite expensive. It is served in the lobby (a grand setting for breakfast) and is almost enough to carry you through to dinner.

Wherever you stay in Rome, be sure to cross the river and check out what's on the other side of it, especially Trastevere. In general, the neighborhoods on the other side of the river felt much less touristy and, as a result, more relaxed and, well, special. The staff was wonderful. We had a couple of minor issues with the air conditioning, but otherwise we were very happy with everything. The concierge arranged all our travel to the Amalfi Coast from Rome, including purchasing our train tickets for us and contacting our hotel on the Amalfi Coast so they would send a driver to pick us up at the train station. That was very helpful. The lounge and restaurant are beautiful and you feel like royalty sitting in either. The only snooty people at the hotel were some of the guests.

I almost felt overstimulated by the excessive decorations and embellishments everywhere. Just about every single thing in the room was multi-colored with gold accents and tassels. The wallpaper was textured and multi-colored. To top it all off, there was a giant, slightly bizarre painting on the wall opposite our bed that was incredibly distracting and just downright weird. It was a painting of two naked men and a basset hound. It was painted in a pseudo-Renaissance way, but just seemed like bizarre motel art. The hotel's undergone a $60-70 million renovation, but, honestly, it seemed like every cent of that money went to the ground floor (restaurant, lobby, etc.) and the bathrooms -- which were gorgeous and stocked to the gills with Hermes products. (Weird that it wasn't Acqua di Parma or something, but Hermes isn't bad.) The rooms themselves seem slightly old - or maybe just really old-fashioned. I know that's some people's cup of tea, but if it's not yours, you should consider staying somewhere else. That said, our room -- which was a double -- was HUGE. It was all one room, but there was a sitting area, a separate desk station, a giant bed, a little vanity, a large armoire for the TV, and a giant closet.

Location is good. It's next to the Piazza de Republica and within walking distance of the bus terminal. The hotel lobby was amazing with a huge chandelier and elegant sofas and chairs with little tables to meet and talk. The bar was off to the side of lobby which was very nicely decorated. They also give you a series of little treats to eat while you have a drink or two--which is somewhat appreciated considering a glass of wine is about $15. The door guy opens up your door with the whole tuxedo and top hat on. They give you Hermes bath products in your room and replenish almost daily. If you have long hair like me, you should opt to bring your own shampoo and conditioner because it doesn't lather--maybe they have hard water?? There's a fresh fruit platter in the room, which I recommend you try the orange (blood orange). Different from home, very sweet and good. Beds: The bed which are called Heavenly beds are just that, heavenly. Crisp white linens and fluffy pillows with down comforters--I loved sleeping in that bed. We were on the 4th floor which was hot all the time, so we slept with the windows open and it was fine. I actually felt like I was sleeping in a dining room. It was strange to sleep under a chandelier with a painted fresco with track lighting behind you on the wall, but was very elegant and nice. There's also a hair dryer in the room in the desk drawer. (took me awhile to find) and if you bring your curling iron, just call guest servies and they'll bring you a plug adapter. Tips: *Don't buy a bus ticket. None of the locals do. Get on at the back door and off where you want, no one notices or says anything. *McDonald's is terrible. Very salty and overpriced, go to a Gastronomia and get a sandwich instead. *Try the ice cream. *The cabs will scam you. Make sure you know where you are going in Italian or have someone write it down for you.

Cheaper, but a nice big room with a good view over the square and far fewer golden nicknacks. Then as my husband was off for a meeting, I ordered a roomservice Napolitano pizza. Threequarters of an hour later, the waiter came saying here is your Margarita pizza. I said no I ordered the Napolitano with the anchovis. The fellow said, oh excuse me, your Naolitano pizza and took of the cover to a completely plain tomato and a bit of cheese pizza and said: The anchovis are in there. That it was a lie was plain, but after he left I took a bite and called room service and asked for the Napolitano. Fifteen minutes later the waiter brought a bowl of anchovis right out of the can! I expressed my surprise that for 18 euros it was not possible to get a baked Naolitano pizza in Rome. The waiter finally laughed and said that the cook was crazy and from Napoli. Another half hour, and I had the pizza I ordered with anchovis, oregano and a one inch burn all the way around. The pizza incident describes our experience. The bathroom had a terrible smell from the zink that did not get unclogged while we were there. The room was still not made up when we returned after six hours of sightseeing.

We paid 60 euros for 2 diet cokes, a club sandwich and a ham and cheese sandwich. The diet cokes were 8 euros alone. The portions were large though and we could have easily shared 1 club sandwich. The other must mention is the complimentary candies they restock daily in the room. The are called Perugina gelees candies and once you try them you will be hooked.

I got a pretty good rate at 320 Euros (corporate rate), expecting it to be star quality when I arrive. Truth is, I was not, really. Okay, there should be guest reporting some fine services and awesome rooms. (there were good rooms and not so good rooms mind you). I stayed at what I thoguht was not such a good room. okay, I'm going into some detail here...first off: the lights were too white and bright -- for the halls and the rooms. I heard there was some renovation, but, I'm sure for the normal rate, they could afford to install flat screens in the rooms (and maybe even the bathrooms). It may not help by a mile, but it sure does impress; and satisfy. Next off, the carpet. Old-ish, weak design, dusty. The room I stayed in (202), was not such a good room, but I'm sure there are quite a few like mine. (I simply cannot wonder how they make the rooms looks so good and nice...hmm...). Anyways, I'm sure there are bettter rooms, but some detail must not be overlooked at hand. The bathrooms, on the other hand, were good. period. Good bath products (interesting orange scent) and a pretty deep soaking tub (if not long enough), and beautiful large gold framed mirors adjourn the walls. One complaint though, when showering, the water turns cold then hot or vice versa, even if you fix it at a specific temp.; this happens quite a lot. Service at the St. Regis was not too bad, for Italy (dont compare it with top hotels in Paris though). They seem helpful at times, and the restaurants they recommend us to were not entirely the best (some good ones albeit), and I did rely on the Michelin guide for the best in Rome. However, unless you're not a gastronomic gourmet, those recommendations are not that bad; sometimes pretty good. Because of the taxi strike in Rome, I had to walk to the restaurants nearby. It happend 2 days after my trip, and luckily i tasted some of Rome's supposed best before then. The nearby recommendations were not bad though. If there is a taxi strike for some reason, you should avoid limousine service (very pricey) unless you can afford it; but still, I found it to be slightly over the reasonable limit. The location of the St. Regis is okay; its a long walk to the Spanish Steps and the tourist places, as well as major shops (about 20-30 mins walk to the Steps); the concierge kept assuring me it was only a 10 min walk, -.- .

Their guides are $80 Euro per hour and you definitely do not want to do a walking tour, so they can arrange a Mercedes w/driver for another$40 Euro/hour In either event, get a guide that can get you into the Vatican and the Collusium without waiting in lines or you will regret it.

My sister got the flu during the trip, and they went out and got us medicine for her, and would ask her everytime she left the hotel how she was feeling. We also left our phone chargers back home, and they promptly got one for us. Also, the day we were leaving, it was my sister's birthday, and for breakfast they baked her a cake, and sang her happy birthday. They were so warm, and hospitable, they really made us part of the family. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. When we had tours, they would arrange for the busses to pick us up at the hotel, and check the times, and make sure everything was in place.

I'll break up my review into 4 parts: 1. Room Quality 2. Location 3. Service 4. Context - what our hotels do we judge our experience against I. ROOM QUALITY We stayed in a deluxe room on the 3rd floor (unfortunately not facing the Piazza). The room, by our experience in European hotels was large with a good, firm king size bed as well as a good size sitting area with a couch, coffee table, and a large writing desk. Bed linens were very nice (according to my wife). Decor was a bit ostentatious for our taste, but seemed to fit the period and style of the hotel. Lighting was a bit dim in the room, but wasn't a big deal. We received fresh fruit each day as well as Italian chocolates. The bathroom was large, again in the context of our European experiences. The shower was a bit small, but the bathtub was a good size. Water pressure was good, but during a long shower the water temp would begin to alternate between hot and cold rather than a steady flow of warm. Again, in the context of our European hotel experiences, not a big deal. II. LOCATION The hotel is close to the main train station. Having read some concern about safety, etc. in the area, from our perspective, we did not feel unsafe at all at any time of the day around the hotel. On our first day, we explored the area around the hotel, including the area around the train station and, while crowded, didn't seem to be any different than other major metropolitan areas. Taxis were plentiful and had no problem understanding our poor attempts at Italian when we wanted to go back to the hotel (many know it as the Grand Hotel rather than the St. Regis or St. Regis Grand). Distance to major attractions (within Rome and ex-The Vatican) were 10-15 minutes of leisurely walking. III. SERVICE This is where I feel (in contrast to the reviews I read which led me to book the hotel) a bit let down. The service started off mixed with the attempt to get a hotel car to pick us up from the airport. It was easier to call the St. Regis reservation line in the US (which I did) than to book the car directly with the hotel concierge (First they insisted I had to fax them a request before they could act on it. Then they said they would settle for an email as they needed written confirmation of the request). When we arrived, there was no doorman to help us or the driver with the luggage until the luggage was out of the car (despite our 6-7 am arrival time and no visible guests out front or in the lobby). Similarly, each morning we left the hotel, on occassions we needed a cab (e.g. to the Vatican), the doorman neither acknowledged us, nor offered to help us get a cab, nor offered to ensure that the cab driver understood where we wanted to go (which on occassion was a problem). This changed a bit when we finally got to the check-in desk where Helena checked us in and cheerfully and generously offered us the room early (we arrived at 7 am on a Sunday). In addition, she pointed out some places that we might want to go on a Sunday morning to people watch, have a coffee and have a good view of the city (which we did and thoroughly enjoyed). Each morning she was on duty and when we needed assistance from the front desk, she would greet me by name and appeared enthusiastic to help. Unfortunately, the service seemed to stop there. My dealings with the concierge were broadly disappointing. From my initial attempts to book a car pickup from the airport to my departure where the concierge called me, hurrying me up to come down to check out (at 10 am!), interactions lacked any sense of interest in my needs as a guest. (Admittedly, the manager tried to explain that the call was really just to check up on me rather than to hurry me up, but both the tone and the language certainly didn't contain any indications of concern and rather seemed to encourage me to make my way downstairs.) Most disappointing was a request which I called into the concierge for \"something special\" upon arrival as this was both our first trip to Rome and our 10th wedding anniversary which I reminded them again in my email requesting the car pick-up. To my disappointment, there was nothing special (unless a bowl of fruit each day is considered special) when we arrived and nothing special during the trip. Perhaps, it was presumptuous of me to have asked for it. However, it would have been nice to be told that it wasn't something they do so that I could arrange something myself. IV. CONTEXT Our judgements about rooms and service in particular were judged against our experiences of the same at our favorite hotels (below). We've also tried to take into account that rooms and room sizes/styles differ from country-to-country and region-to-region. ASIA Four Seasons Hotel (Singapore) Four Seasons Hotel (Tokyo-Marunouchi) Mandarin Oriental (Hong Kong) Park Hyatt (Sydney) US St. Regis Hotel (New York) Four Seasons Hotel (San Francisco) UK/EUROPE Dukes Hotel (London) Four Seasons Hotel (Paris - Georges V) OVERALL I will forever remember our stays at the St. Regis Hotel in New York, not because the rooms are the best (they're not), nor because of its great location (which it has). Rather, I'll remember our stays there (and at all of our favorites) because each time, the staff seems to go out of their way when they don't need to to make us feel like we're the only guests in the hotel. Unfortunately, I expected this from the St. Regis Grand in Rome. Instead, I received a good room and a decent location with little of the warmth and thoughtfulness that characterizes our favorite hotels around the world.", "Date": "March 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham City, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExceptionally High Standard\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4590170", "Content": "Although it is now some time since we stayed at the Grand, reading some of the reviews posted here brought back very good memories.

It's probably pointless talking about upgraded rooms and special gifts because I am a Platinum SPG Member. You might not be a cardholder or the hotel might be very full when you visit and an upgrade isn't available. What you need to know is that the location is good, the standard of the public areas is exceptional, the staff are gracious but discreet, the decor in the guest rooms is opulent, the beds are extremely comfortable, the toiletries are top-notch and the hotel's restaurant (rated #1 in Rome by Zagat) is worthy of global recognition. All in all, the hotel really is a perfect example of what a good, traditional-style city hotel should be. The fact that so many are so poor elevates this one from good to great however! Finally, if you don't otherwise get the chance, do ask one of the staff to let you have a look at the 'Salone Ritz' - the hotel's main function room. I can't think of many other hotels I would recommend you inspecting the function rooms at - but this one really is beautiful.

Upon early arrival at around 11.00am we received a complementary upgrade to an Imperial Room. We were led to our room immediately, and happily discovered that it was very large, superbly furnished and with a very beautiful view of Piazza de la Republica and a grand all-marble bathroom. Considering we had booked a Superior room for only 350 Euro per night including breakfast, we thought what we got was well worth the money. 2. The hotel is very well located, 1 minute walk to the metro stop and about 10-15 minutes walk to Trevi-Spanish steps. 3. The hotel is also very well staffed, with friendly and professional personnel. I never managed to count the doormen or the waiters in the breakfast area. Housekeeping also does a very good job, and our room and all public areas were super clean. 4. Breakfast is very good, with a good selection of fresh and very good quality hot and cold goodies. It is served in the bar, an area which stands on a higher level of the grand lobby. 5. The hotel's restaurant 'Vivendo' was very good (Try the Lobster!). We also got a great restaurant recommendation from the hotel's concierge: the Al Moro, near the Trevi fountain. Great REAL Italian food! 6. We are a couple in our early thirties, and it was nice to find that the hotel, despite its very classical setting, had many guests of our age group. We felt very comfortable. 7. Piazza de la Republica is busy with traffic all the time, but the rooms are double glazed and with heavy curtains, so we had no noise problems. 8. The area around the hotel is safe. In fact all Rome feels very safe, apart perhaps from the area immediately next to the Termini Station late at night, which still is not all that bad. Overall, the St Regis Grand is a top-of the-top hotel, and we would gladly recommend it to even the most demanding traveller. Two final notes. First, Rome is a woderful place and upon leaving we were really hoping we would be able to return there on day soon. Second, for our transport from and to the airport we were very happy to have booked with Stefano Constantini (Romecabs), who is very punctual, talkative and pleasant.

After many visits to Tripadvisor and reviews of other hotels, we chose the St. Regis because of its beauty, service and location. We're a thirty-something couple and wanted our trip to the Eternal City to be just right. First, the St. Regis is truly a 5-star hotel. The service is unparalled. Even though we arrived early, the front desk immediately accommodated us by serving us espressos and cookies in their grand and opulent lounge while we waited for our room. Best we ever tasted. After about an hour later, the front desk manager escorted us to our room. Even by American standards, this room was huge! We had a king size bed the biggest we've ever seen (and I'm 6'4), dual sinks in the bathroom and separate bathtub and shower. The mattress is extremely comfortable - Be careful, you might find yourself sleeping more than you wish. The Hermes bathroom products are nice. And the turn down service is wonderful touch (classical music is played from the TV and slippers are placed beside). A quick comment: Make sure to always keep your \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. It's not really a sign, but a button by the door handle. Early on, we were intruded upon when staff buzzed and quickly entered to either clean the room or check the mini-bar. A bit annoying when taking a nap... Problem was solved with the \"do not disturb\" sign. Second, the St. Regis likes to spoil its guests. The front desk sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne with chocolate dipped strawberries our first night; in fact, through out our week, we received complimentary fruit bowls, desserts, and other goodies. The concierge is the best. We used them to book tickets for a day trip to Florence, museum passes to the Villa Borghese and reservations at local restaurants. No charge! In fact, we never felt pressed to tip, however, we did show our gratitude with a few Euros here and there. It rained there too, so they had plenty of umbrellas for us to use (a little thing, but very important for a hotel of this quality). The breakfast buffet is awesome - fresh fruit, juice, and lots and lots of espresso. Don't forget to hit the omelet bar. Delicious. Breakfast was included in our rate. We also had Christmas dinner at their restaurant, the Vivendo. Absolutely delicious. Expensive, yes, but about the same price you would pay for a night out on the town in Los Angeles or New York. Make sure to ask for Luca. He is the manager and was always ready and willing to start your meal with a complimentary glass of champagne. We ate there twice. And finally, the hotel can't be better situated. We were less than 100 yards from Piazza Repubblica Metro. Very convenient. Across the street was the Museo Nazionale Romano. Two churches were also located about 50 yards from the front entrance of the Hotel worth a visit. The St. Regis is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon -our favorite neighborhoods. We also walked from the Coliseum, Spanish Steps, Via Veneto and the Vatican to the hotel. Again, all very convenient and very safe. Now a word about Rome... For those going to Rome the first time, you'll find it's a very small city and extremely compact. Expect to walk. It's truly the best way to enjoy this beautiful city, and can also help the digestion after a heavy meal. Be prepared, they like their food and you'll like their food (they serve huge portions). We NEVER had a bad meal. Too many restaurants to recommend. By the way, Rome is a very safe city. Some of the reviews posted here suggested that the St. Regis is in un-safe neighborhood. Couldn't be any further from the truth - we never felt threatened or afraid. Just use some common sense and you'll be all right. Bottom line: the St. Regis was the perfect base camp for us to launch our visit to Rome. The city is both an indoor and outdoor museum.

I will absolutely stay here next time I'm in Rome and plan to stay longer than one night!", "Date": "November 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable\u201d", "Author": "ScottieC", "ReviewID": "UR4084518", "Content": "We stayed at the St. Regis for two nights last week. It was absolute heaven. The service was fantastic. Everyone was very polite and very helpful. They all spoke very good English. We asked for restaurant recommendations and they jumped to not only make the recommendations but make reservations for us. We asked about a tour guide for the Vatican Museum and they jumped to take care of that for us. The room was gorgeous and the huge marble bathroom luxurious. We had a very nice view of a church across the street and heard no street noise. As far as location is concerned - we thought it was fantastic. Easy walk to several sites; quick 5 euro taxi ride to the Colesium and the Forum. Love the Hermes bath products - actually went to the Hermes store in Rome to purchase their cologne and lotion. Wonderful hotel - absolutely recommend.

We wanted to see Rome before heading out on a 12 day cruise. The hotel met all of our expectations, luxurious, super service and good food. Concerning the service, I never would have expected this. Before leaving for an afternon of sight seeing, I mentioned to housekeeping that I thought the bed was a liitle hard. You can imagine how surprised I was when we returned to find that the mattress had been replaced with one that was just right. My wife and I were pleased with everything, the hotel staff was very pleasant and accomoodating. This is truly a 5 star hotel. This is also a superior location, easy walking distance to the Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain. Another pleasant experience that happened was the doorman for the St. Regis introduced us to a car service that took us on a fabulous tour of Rome. We saw all the sites with our driver, Bob Agoslinelli. Bob speaks good english and knows the town. We went to many places that we would have never seen or know about Bob is a native of Rome and has a car service that is affiliated with the St. Regis. Bob also took us to the cruise terminal.

Loved the bathroom. All marble. The hotel was extremely quiet. I felt like I had the hotel to myself most of the time. The housekeeping staff never woke me up. The restaurant was really enjoyable. The waiter very friendly and helpful. The desserts were beautiful and delicious. Definitely a hotel to stay at. I don't think anyone would be disappointed. The only negative was the location. It's a little far from the sites but most can be reached by bus (the Termini is only 10 minutes away by foot) or cab. There are a lot of great churches literally all around the St. Regis. Also lots of cafes.

It was the first hotel in Rome to have electricty so it dates from the late 1800s. From the time we arrived to the moment we left we had stellar service. Our room was not ready upon arrival (and I didn't expect it to be as it was 11 a.m.) but they kindly served us complimentary beverages in the waiting area and informed us 45 mins later it was ready. I was shocked at their attention to concern for travelers after a long, overnight journey! We celebrated our 15th anniversary at this hotel and a bottle of nice bubbly was in our room upon coming home the 1st night along with fresh fruit. This room has everything you'd need and turndown service is excellent and truly a 5 star. The breakfast buffet in the a.m. has every want, need and desire for anyone! I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and they knew it was a special occassion via my booking form but I doubt that they'd treat anyone less differently if they weren't one. I got the impression here that EVERY guest mattered. What shocked me after having stayed in a number of large cities around the world is to how quiet this hotel was. We heard no noises, talking, etc except for a few birds outside our window that faced a courtyard. Truly a relaxing retreat after a long and busy day. The restaurant has a talented chef and is well worth visiting along with a knowledgeable wine steward. You won't be disappointed with your stay here and truly will be transported back in time without loosing the modern comforts of the future.

Very hospitable staff, courteous and accommodating. All the staff that we were in contact with spoke fluent English. Delivered clementines to our room upon check-in. Also delivered Easter bread courtesy of the hotel on Easter. Room had sitting area with loveseat, desk, armoire with tv and minibar. Large bathroom especially for European hotels. Comfortable bedroom with second tv (great bonus since I was with my 16-year old daughter and did not wish to watch MTV whenever we were in the room). Wonderful blackout curtains for mornings when you need to sleep in. Hotel missed opportunity to remind guests with a card in the room or message on telephone of the time change in Italy which took place on March 27 (Easter). Our breakfast arrived an hour earlier than we thought we had requested it that day. If breakfast is not included in your stay, it can become pricey eating at the hotel each morning, and there is not much else in the area. Only complaint is the location. While it is near the Metro and Termini station (avoid area at night), I would have preferred being closer to either the Piazza Navona or the Spanish Steps. After walking all day while sightseeing, a short stroll would have been preferable to jumping in a cab or walking a good distance.
