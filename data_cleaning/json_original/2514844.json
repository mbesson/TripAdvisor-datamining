My fifth or sixth trip to Paris, this was the first time I stayed this far east, outside of the more touristy areas of the centre. I'm reluctant to share this glowing review because I want Le Citizen to be a well-kept secret. Its current #4 standing amongst thousands of reviewed Paris hotels is very well-deserved and I hope their growing popularity doesn't change their values. Le Citizen's motto,\"run by a team whose ultimate goal is that guests enjoy every moment of their visit,\" is absolutely genuine. They cater to your every question, satisfy every request, and make your stay effortless and enjoyable. Basically everything is free: the wifi, the use of a personal well-equipped iPad during your stay, all the snacks and drinks in your room, the sensational breakfasts with homemade yogurts, preserves, local breads, strong espresso, and freshly pressed juices made to order. They happily printed my documents. They happily answered all my questions. I stayed in the smaller City Room. Like most Paris hotels, room space is limited, but I admired the clever space-saving design, the high-quality finishings, the exceptional bedding and shower, and the bright airiness that comes from three west-facing openable windows overlooking Canal St Martin. A secret if you have more than one suitcase: place one in the clever space beneath the bathroom sink. If I had to fault anything: perhaps the loud revellers hanging out on the canal late into Friday night. But this wasn't the hotel's fault, just a gritty character of this magical, untouristy part of the city. Having stayed here on a business trip, I'm eagerly looking forward to staying here again for a holiday with my partner.

So we have seen our fair share of hotels and resorts throughout the world. If you love Paris and prefer to stay somewhere off the beaten path yet immersed in the Parisian culture, then LE CITIZEN will be ideal for you. First and foremost, the hospitality is amazing. We bonded with the staff immediately. Pierre, Laure, John, Mario, and Fatu took great care of us from check in to check out. We stayed in Room no. 66 which is on the top floor offering a gorgeous western view of the city. You\u2019ll be enchanted by the Parisian rooftops and you can just make out the Eiffel Tower\u2019s rotating light at night. The room itself is a nice size. Very clean, minimal with a modern Ikea design which I prefer to overly ornate. We travel with not only our suitcases but also our TV production equipment and we found the room to be quite spacious. The all-important bed is king sized and you will melt right to sleep because it\u2019s too comfortable. Zero neck or back pain. There\u2019s plenty of natural light. A clean bathroom with ample hot water and good water pressure. You have a small desk to work on. The hotel even lends you an iPad which is tricked out with newspapers, magazines, and apps to help you enjoy the neighborhood as well as Paris in general. What I love too is the little dining area where there is always a baked treat and sparking water waiting for you when you return home each day. I also read reviews complaining about the noise outside. I live in NYC so I am accustomed to the fact that the city will never be as quietly serene as the countryside. Outside sounds goes with the territory when visiting a major city like Paris. The lobby is an intimate modern caf\u00e9 offering plenty of nice reading material, a view of the canal, and the breakfast (which comes with the room rate) is just perfect. The staff fresh squeezes juice, makes eye opening espressos, and offers a good selection of sweet and savory bites which they are happy to warm up for you if you ask. I read one review that wasn\u2019t very positive about the breakfast. But being a discerning foodie from Manhattan, I found it to be delectable. There\u2019s a bakery nearby but I was completely satisfied dining on the many choices in the hotel. It\u2019s situated next to a lovely tree-lined canal making you feel as if you are in the movie, Amelie. There are nice (and authentic) restaurants and boutique shops all within walking distance. And plenty of taxis along with a train station that\u2019s close by. We used the subway quite a lot, taking us to all the major sights. If you\u2019ve been to Paris before and want an alternative, charming experience, then I highly recommend LE CITIZEN.

He started to chat with us like an old friend while checking us in. His relaxing manner put us at ease and made us feel at home right away. Our room was on the top floor. We were initially surprised and a bit disappointed by the tiny space. We did not expect the room to be that small. After a day here, we found out that actually size did not matter. Everything needed was at your fingertip, compact and right where you needed. Nice shower, all the toiletry necessities, reusable bottles of drinking water, small snacks, phone calls, everything a traveler may need was available, all free of charge! The room was simply decorated, but with quality. The floor window was draped with beautiful cotton curtains. The bed linens were of the best quality, clean, soft, fresh and new. So comfortable that it felt like a shower room in IKEA. As we were new to Paris, we had questions about navigating the area and planning for meals. The staff was always so extremely patient recommending places and restaurants to us, like a family friend. Sometimes in doubt, they would go online, google for us and print out the map for us. We were offered an IPAD, which we thought was a great idea, but we had our laptops with us which was enough. I did not think free breakfast was included as we never had breakfast here. After 3 days here, we felt almost attached to this little cozy hotel. What a little haven this tiny hotel is! It is home away from home for any travelers!

Overall the design is smart, except for the slightly peculiar, modular, window banquette, which is uncomfortable and can get in the way of closing the curtains. There were lots of windows. It's worth bearing in mind that the hotel is located near a crossroads and that the traffic can be noisy, meaning you don't actually want to open the room windows if you want some quiet. (Perhaps this is less of a problem on higher floors.) The only real disappointment was the included breakfast, but we might be pickier than most people -- in our opinion, since there are many great bakeries in Paris, a hotel could offer really good, fresh pastries and bread.

But staying at the Le Citizen made it all better. The key thing that made a difference were the receptionists Pierre and Fatoumata, who were both friendly and welcoming to an extent that I found quite rare. They were efficient when seeing to my needs and yet were happy to chat and warmly share their views and experiences about Paris as locals when there was time between seeing to the needs of other guests. Some of their views were refreshingly frank and unvarnished, without being overbearing. I found it gratifying to be able to look forward to seeing a friendly face before leaving to explore the city and after a long day walking the streets and seeing the sights. Having seen my share of indifferent faces and grudging service in other (even much more expensive) establishments, this is not something that I take for granted. The hotel itself is spotless. My room was very clean and it was quite bright, with that soft temperate climate light coming in from its bank of five windows (Zen suite fourth floor). There was also quite an atmospheric view of the canal and the ironwork bridges. In terms of facilities and toiletries, it had everything I needed, from decent storage space, a safe, a large bathtub and separate WC area, moisturising oil etc. There was some traffic noise at night as the hotel is just by the street, but it didn't bother me and I slept quite soundly. In fact, I rather enjoyed watching the goings on around the canal banks from the room. This was because Le Citizen isn't in a very touristy neighbourhood, which I liked, because it allows a more intimate observation of the day to day life of the actual daily lives of people who live in Paris. This however, may not be to the taste of others who are averse to a city's more mundane intrusions while on holiday, and who want the major sights and conveniences right at their doorstep. On that point, Paris appears to be a town that lends itself to walking, and it should be accepted that one should be prepared to do so. In that context, I found Le Citizen to be quite convenient to the sights, with the Marais, Place des Vosges etc within easy walkable distance. The Place de Republique station, which is an important interchange between several metro lines, was even nearer (10 mins brisk walk or so). I never felt cut off or put off by distance in visiting the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower etc. The hotel's lounge and breakfast was airy and welcoming and I enjoyed the continental breakfast that the hotel offered, which included several different types of jams, cakes, yoghurt, fruits, pastries etc. But those who need a hearty and hot American style breakfast with bacon, sausages etc may have to look elsewhere in the neighbourhood, which thankfully has a decent number of nearby cafes and bistros etc. Oh yes, there is a lot of reading material in the breakfast lounge, including lots of up-to-date Paris guide books. You may not even need to bring your own. All in all, I was pleased with the hotel. If you need business amenities, a pool and gym, i.e., a full service hotel, then Le Citizen may not meet your needs. But I would unreservedly recommend it to anyone who wants a small, clean, well designed place with warm service, just a bit off the beaten path. I certainly look forward to going back myself. Oh yes, if you have substantial luggage, and are part of a group, do yourself a favour - avail yourself of the hotel's airport transfer. The convenience and avoidance of hassle is well worth the 50 euro cost.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAn outstanding boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mark S", "ReviewID": "UR121237180", "Content": "Rarely am I moved to write positive reviews but Le Citizen just gets everything right.

We had the Zen suite, which was perfect for us. We loved the interior design and especially the large windows with a beautiful view of Canal St Martin. The room had a super comfy double bed (we slept like babies every night!), and a third bed was made up for our daughter in front of a window, she really liked that. The bathroom was clean and spacious. We liked that the hotel owner tries in every way to be environmental conscious, meaning that shampoo and conditioner did not come in small bottles but from large dispensers in the shower. The location suited us very well - we are not into the boulevards and shopping in Place Vendome is not our thing. We really liked all the lovely small shops and cafes, wine bars and restaurants that surrounded the hotel - this is true Paris to us. Metro station close by and walking distance to Marais. The staff are all very nice and friendly and made a restaurant booking at VIVANT for us (go there, you will not regret it!!). We did not ask for much advice, but I am sure that if we had asked they would do their absolute best to answer any question about Paris that we might have. We had breakfast in the dining room every day, very delicious and reasonably priced. I cannot praise this hotel enough. Small, friendly, personal, great location, beautiful interiors - what more can you wish for? We can honestly say that we will never consider staying anywhere else on future trips to Paris! Thanks, Sophie and staff, for 6 wonderful days! PS: Lots of great places to eat and drink around the hotel. We LOVED Verre Volee right across the canal.

He was kind to us as we attempted to speak what little French we could, all the while conversing with us in English, without any negative attitude. The hotel arranged for us to be picked up at the airport, which helped ease our way into our 2-week French vacation. On our check-out day, I walked to pick up our rental car for exploring the rest of France while my wife stayed behind. Pierre kept her company with coffee in the lobby for the very long time I was delayed at the car rental location. I can't say enough about the service. We booked the largest room, and still it was quite small. The entire hotel is small. But our room was clean, interesting, and more than acceptable. The location was great, in a relatively quiet neighborhood. The walk to the nearest metro stop was 5 minutes down basically one street of restaurants and small shops - very convenient. The only negative comment we might have is that while the web site says everyone gets use of an iPad, when we arrived, one was not ready for us, and we were promised it later. We never really needed it, so we never asked, and it was never offered. Very small quibble. We would not hesitate to stay here if in Paris again.

The location of the hotel was a problem for us, having previously stayed in the Opera District. The canal looks very beautiful in the photos on the website but in reality it is covered with graffiti. The area attracts young people who sit on the edge of the canal on warm nights and have a quiet drink. All good. But late at night the canal is a meeting place for the homeless. The restaurant close by along the canal was excellent but despite extensive searching we didn't find any other restaurant or cafe close by that was acceptable.

There are several little things that the hotel does which really made it stand out to my mind... - The staff were very good in terms of their general service and friendliness (Pierre was exceptional). - The staff provided excellent advice about local places to eat, which considering my wife and I are foodies, was very important. Also importantly, they were honest about comparing their own food options to surrounding ones, even if it meant that they might not get our custom downstairs as regularly as they may have done if they plugged their own eatery to us more aggressively. - The FREE wireless is something which can be rare in European hotels. Here it's not just free \"in the lobby\", it's in the rooms as well. - The complimentary iPad on request? Good move. Not only does it provide an extra service for the customer, it allows a great opportunity to flog partner's goods and services via Apps, allow referential trade etc. Good extra touch in terms of service provided to guests, but also a very canny marketing/business move as well. - Free calls to landlines anywhere in the world. These guys are obviously utilising VoIP. Really surprised more hotels don't do this. In regards to the Rooms... - The rooms are small, but they are very clean, well maintained, and the IKEA style furnishings make for a stylish (if somewhat unorthodox) decor that is comfortable if it requires an allowance for something a bit different from the usual. - The bathrooms are again something a bit different. Drainage of water due to the bathroom design is something that, to be honest, may bother other guests, although it certainly didn't bother us. The requirement to leave linen on the floor if it requires changing was another small difference, but this was clearly communicated by the staff. - I've read a review saying the bed was small? We actually found the bed to be comfortable, large enough for both my wife and myself (My wife is a small/medium framed woman by Western Standards... I'm not a small guy by anyone's :) ) - I'd suggest that someone unused to urban sounds may be disturbed at night if they sleep with the windows open. It was the tail end of winter, so we had the windows closed at night, and slept quite peacefully... - The decor seems to suggest an emphasis on style and modernity rather than traditional luxury/comfort. This means the rooms may not be to your taste, so bear this in mind. Having said that, we were never uncomfortable. - My wife does not drink tap water as a rule, so the filtered water which was replenished daily allowed us to keep out water bottles topped up whilst out and about which was nice. I didn't care for the mineral water provided, but this is a more of a personal taste thing on my part as I'm not into Mineral water - nothing to do with the hotel there... Overall a very pleasant if simple hotel.... as I said one gets the sense of it having a niche more as a business hotel than a traditional couples or leisure hotel, but the friendliness of the staff, good location well covered by the Metro network, nearby cafes, restaurants and patisseries, and some of the little extras they provide make it a good choice for a leisure type hotel regardless... especially given some of the horror stories floating around about Parisian hotels not being worth the money.

As others have commented, Le Citizen is located in what is still a transitional neighborhood, with few tourists and places catering to them. There was a resident homeless man who habituated the curb right below our window, cursing strangers and being visited by neighborhood pals. My daughter found him intriguing and amusing (from a distance), while I found him annoying. This is not the Rue Cler but a (lower) middle class Paris neighborhood, which is a bit out of the way. That said, the Gare de l'Est is an easy 10 minute walk and the closest single line Metro station about the same. We had breakfast one AM at the hotel, and it was very nice at 12.5 Euros each.

Le Citizen is located in an up and coming \"cool\" neighborhood, but it is not central to most sights and attractions. I would not recommend this hotel to someone going to Paris for the first time due to its location. if you have been to Paris a few times and want to explore another neighborhood, then yes, this is a great place to stay. It has a hip, young feel, and if you are older, or need to be coddled by hotel staff, I would not recommend this hotel. Though I liked spending a coupe of days in this area, it would not be my preferred location, in general. There are a lot of cool restaurants, bars, and cafes in the area, and the canals are an interesting part of Paris that I had never experienced. The owner has done a fantastic job designing the rooms, and the management, Pierre and the owner specifically, really make this a special place. My \"junior suite\" was beautifully and intelligently designed; I really credit the owner with originality and smart, thoughtful design touches and very good use of space. Additionally, the technology and electronics were wonderfully designed and perfectly functional. On the downside, my room was noisy during the day due to street noise, but at night, there was no problem at all. The AC was great (which is a huge deal to me), and the bed and bedding fantastic.

Here are 2 of the many incidents we experienced: INCIDENT 1. Prior our stay, we asked them to make a restaurant reservation. They response and made the reservation for us, and we confirmed over email with the date and time. When we arrive to the restaurant 30 mins before our reservation, we realized our table are given to another couple who also stay in Le Citizen. You can imagined how upset my wife and I were as it was our 10th wedding anniversary. We went to the hotel and see what was going on. The owner/manager, Sophie, explained that they called us 45 mins ago, but we didn't response, so they give it to someone else. Seriously 45 mins before dinner?! what logic is that? INCIDENT 2. We have a 7am flight to leave Paris at the last day. We asked Sophie to book a taxi. She recommended us to use their hotel car service to the airport for 50 euro over using a taxi since we are leaving so early in the morning. We agreed and the morning before, we confirmed with the morning staff, Pierre to make sure a car is reserved for the the next morning. He said to us he hasn't order a car because he didn't know where the destination is. After we told him, he said he is going to call the driver. We also requested a morning call for 4am. We assume that is taking care of and we went off to enjoy our last day in Paris. The day we leave, there was no morning call @ 4am, and when we check out the night staff has no clue we had a reserved car. He called the driver and the driver told him that he didn't want to drive so too early in the morning. Long story short, we ended up pay more to order a taxi. So for any future guest, BE AWARED!! the hotel may seem diligent prior to your arrival and offer concierge service... they don't understand the meaning of making a reservation or holding one. You may encounter the very careless service and with plenty of excuses about why your requests cannot be met.

We've tried small hotels and the chain hotels. Le Citizen is a small hotel of just 12 rooms and a small restaurant area. The hotel is wonderfully location on Canal St Martin, right next to one of the swing bridges and lock gates. You have a great view of the boats going up and down which was exciting for the children. This area is very residential so you won't see many other tourists. The nearest station is Jacques Bonsergent (L5) or its only a 10 minute walk (with children) to Republique one of the best connected metro stations in Paris. From Gare du Nord it was a comfortable 15 minute walk with luggage in tow. Form the moment you arrive you are made to feel at home. We mainly dealt with Pierre during our stay, one of the most friendly Parisiens we have ever met. However, all the staff at this hotel were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room itself was lovely. We had a citizen apartment - which is basically an adjoining room and suite. This gave us two bathrooms. In the suite there were some large cushions for customisable seating - or for making dens if you are a child! Great fun - see the video on the hotel website. Like most hotels in Paris, the room was not huge, but it was more than adequate for our needs and felt large due to the brilliant way in which it had been laid out. Sound proofing was ideal. We heard no street noise other than the occasional siren. This was great given the number of locals sitting canal side with guitars etc until the early hours. We slept well with no noise disturbance. The ipads (there is one per room) are a great touch! Really helpful in helping you to plan your day as well as find out all you need to know about the hotel. We only ate breakfast once at the hotel. The service was great and the croissants were wonderful. A slight mix up over the eggs was dealt with promptly and efficiently and was actually quite funny! Pierre had even made the thoughtful touch to order some pain au chocolat for our children. Le Citizen felt unique. Nice touches, welcome homely feel, picturesque location and great service. After many trips, we've finally found a hotel we'd gladly return too and we can't wait to book our next trip.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cKindness, like a boomerang, always returns. ~Author Unknown\u201d", "Author": "TessMcCarthy1", "ReviewID": "UR105498893", "Content": "Kindness, like a boomerang, always returns. ~Author Unknown I heard this quote in yoga class a few days I got back from Europe and I think it's appropriate of the treatment we received at Le Citizen. I can't begin to tell you all the kindness we got...so much so, I've re-written this review a few times. At any rate, Le Citizen rates one of the best deals in Paris in terms of price, value, service, convenience and style! Location Le Citizen is located in the 10th arrondissement of Paris which is right above Le Marais (3rd arrondissement) on the Right Bank and east side of the city. The hotel rests along the Canal St. Martin and it's so nice to wake up and peek out the hotel window and watch the world unfold in front of your eyes. At various times of the day, the Canal is quiet, alive, chatty and festive. We were exhausted our first night and rested in our loft like Zen Suite bed and fell asleep to the sounds locals engaging in conversation and drink. It was as if I were in one of Renoir\u2019s paintings, \"Luncheon of the Boating Party.\" Next time we go, we'll pack more energy and chill along the canal like the locals do. I felt as if we were missing out on a lot of fun. It took me a little over 25 minutes to get from the Louvre (1st arrondissement) to Quai Jemmappes. That being said, it is very accessible. It's close to a Metro station and just right outside the door is a Velib station--where you can rent bikes for the day/week. We thought that Velib wouldn't accept our American credit card [because we read an article that European credit cards have a chip (ICC integrated chip) and use a pin] but the owner of the hotel told me it took American cards and viola! It did! :) Room Le Citizen comes equipped with a purposeful iPad which you may or may not find helpful. It was packed with recommendations, apps and of course, the guide to the hotel. Very green! Speaking of green: you use your hotel key to activate the wattage/lighting in the room near the front. That way you only fire up electricity when you are there or really need it. Our room was tidied up every day and the bed--so comfy. I loved the bottled water, the body lotion (that I accidentally used on my hair) and the small things that just made everything so neat. We stayed in one of the Zen suites and it was really felt as if you were staying at your very cool Aunt and Uncle's Paris apartment: with it comes a great view, a well stocked mini bar, a cozy nest-like bed and, lots of respect for the people who help you along the way. That being said, everyone was VERY NICE! One day, my partner and I got separated in the Louvre and I talked to the information kiosk and asked if my partner made her way to the hotel (Le Citizen). I called a second time because I couldn't find her and the proprietress got on the phone with me and asked if I wanted the car service to pick me up! I felt very taken care of. And, the car service, by the way, is the way to go (if you want to get to the hotel). The driver was sweet and waited for us (even though our train was delayed from Brussels). Food We didn't get a chance to try out the Japanese food there, but, I have to pinch myself for not smuggling the hotel owner's homemade raspberry jam! She casually said she hoped we liked it--LOVED IT! Incredible woman! Very down to earth, humble, classy. Advice So, the only advice I have for you is to be nice to these people! They have been nothing but the best and I'd hate to come across a review that was off-handedly rude. It would break my heart.

We stayed for 7 nights in \"La City L\" room during April 2011. We really enjoyed the hotel, the staff and the area. The hotel is beautifully decorated, with simplicity without ever venturing into boring (it has lots of style, and it has been featured in many architecture & design magazines). It is quite small, it has only 12 rooms; but the room we were in was a perfect size (Not small at all for European standards). We fitted comfortably with our 4 large suitcases. The bed is a really comfortable large double, with a plush duve. The bathroom is quite spacious and 2 people can easily maneuver in it (the bathroom amenities are quite a delight as well!). The hotel sits right beside the canal, so you get canal views from the windows. If that's not enough you also get an IPAD to use in your room with high speed internet! Canal St. Martin is a very relaxed neighborhood, filled with lots of artsy and trendy locals. You hardly see any tourists at all (after been in Paris for a while you will be VERY grateful of this). Around the hotel you have various cafes, bars and restaurants (Hotel du Nord, Chez Prune). There are also trendy shops like Agnes B, Maje, A.P.C. just up the street. There are a couple of supermarkets really close by and 2 metro stations a couple blocks away. The highlight of the stay here though has to be the staff! They were incredibly attentive and lovely.

The bathroom had the added benefit of having a rain shower with good water pressure and plenty of hot water, which had been hit or miss on stays in other French hotels. Overall our room was well designed with a good size, for Europe, seating area, plenty of space for storage and a relaxing atmosphere. The hotel is very well located, being about a 5 minute walk from the Jacques Bonsergent and 7-10 minute walk from the Republique metro stops. From these it is a short ride to any of the major sites within in Paris. There are numerous cafes within walking distance and a great little bakery down Rue Lancry which is fantastic for a morning snack before hopping on the Metro. My wife and I thought the iPads were a good addition, keeping us minimally connected to the world and providing an Angry Bird fix if needed.
