Location was great (almost right off the freeway = convenient). Parking was plentiful and free, although can get a bit crowded on weekend evenings since it shared the lot with Denny's. Upon arrival, we were greeted by warm & friendly staff at the front desk. Breakfast area was small, but it has pretty good selection at the buffet (just not a fan of their scrambled egg). The room itself was spacious and clean. Loved the mini fridge. Furniture (sofa) seems a bit outdated but that didn't bother me. What bothered me was - you guessed it - the bed itself. It had no support whatsoever. It's either an extremely old spring mattress or an extremely cheap quality mattress (like those advertised for $200-300 at Macy's sale events). It was mildly supportive on the edges but as I moved closer towards the center I started sinking in. I didn't want to fall off the bed by sleeping so close to the edge. I felt tortured, waking up with back ache every morning (thankfully I only stayed there for 2 nights). The couch was a bit too short for me, so I almost had to choose between a neck pain and a back pain. Internet connection: wireless is available for a fee, but it's such a pain to stay connected. Every short period of time it kicked me out of the session, even when I was staying active. It was very annoying to keep on having to supply password and renew session every 10-15 minutes when you're working, especially while using a VPN (then you'd have to reconnect your VPN session, even worse when you're using a remote desktop, that's another connection that needed to be reestablished). Some apps on my iPad doesn't even work because it couldn't see the verification page. Another thing: I know this is not a 5 star hotel & nor did I pay a 5 star rate, but it ticked me a bit when the housekeeping staff seemed to threw my PJ shirt off the bed side table. I didn't expect it to be folded crisp at even edges, but I didn't expect to see my shirt bundled like a ball on the side table either. I would think the least they could've done is to have placed it on the bed. I regret leaving tips, so I didn't even bother to leave another tip the next evening.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oceanside, California", "Title": "\u201cRIP OFF, HIDING CHARGES.

Basically, if they're full, which they were when we were there, there is not sufficient parking for all of thier customers. This was not helped by the presence of about 4 shipping containers using up a dozen or so parking spaces. I ended up parking next to the Denny's restaurant - made me a little nervous because I did not want to get towed. Also, this place is tricky to get to/from the airport.

I really needed a clean, quiet, comfortable room for the night and I didn't get it. First, the good: the room was immaculate, with comfortable bed linens. The hotel is well-situated in Mira Mesa, pretty much in the middle of San Diego. I personally would rather stay a little off the beaten path, if it means a quieter, more accessible stay. Now, the bad: The first thing I noticed was that there was only one person, a college-aged guy, working in the hotel. This was a problem, for in a hotel of that size (four stories), one that's completely booked, you're going to need more help than that. The hotel was *noisy*. I mean *noisy* As in cheaply-constructed garbage. It sounded like people were doing jumping jacks in the room upstairs. I spoke to the (overwhelmed) front desk person who implied that because I'd checked in using Orbitz (and prepaid), he didn't want to do anything about it. He refused to give me a room on the top floor, and only put me in a different room after I threatened to call his manager. Fortunately, the next room was OK, but I feel sorry for whomever had to sleep in the one I gave up. The next morning I woke up and called down to the front desk guy (who was clearly not happy with being bothered) and asked for more coffee packets. He told me there weren't any. I asked him if his manager would agree with that assessment when I spoke to her the next day. Magically, he found more coffee. It didn't matter, though--there was no hot water to shower and I was too ticked off at the place to stay another minute. I then arrived in the parking lot to find someone had stolen my hubcaps. Maybe I was a little too hard on the desk clerk. Or maybe one of the dozen or so college-aged kids staying unsupervised in the hotel, drinking and carrying on, thought I deserved it for runing their good mood.
