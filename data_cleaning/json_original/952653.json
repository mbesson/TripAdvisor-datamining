I am very surprised by all of the positive reviews. Walking in to the reception area I thought maybe the hotel was under renovation, but it appeared not to be after all. There was hair in the bed. There was hair in the shower. The AC would not cool down the room, which might not have been a problem with a room on a lower floor or the window actually opened. We asked twice to have the AC examined, both times the problem appeared to be fixed but was not. Was too warm to sleep, and in addition to the very thin walls, which even allowed you to hear the person next room using the bathroom and blowing his or her nose. Wifi connection did not work for our iPhones, and it is only offered in the common area. Location clearly is what you pay for and it is quiet convenient, right in the Puerta del Sol 1 min from the metro. The receptionists were nice and helpful. However, would not recommend this area to stay in unless you enjoy being amongst masses of tourist. Was not happy paying the price upon departure though was happy to get out ASAP in the morning.

We went to the reception to report that our backgage is missing but the receptionist spoke only Spanish not English at all. When we told him to go on Internet on Google translate He pretended that Internet wasn't working. We came more angrier and took the mouse from the computer and the Internet started to work. So he wanted to make full of us. The next day, We reported the robbery to the manager but he didn't do anything only couple of polite words although our bags were stolen from the hotel room. So if you traveling to Madrid don't be fooled by the shining room interior in Eden Paraiso Neptuno. Find another place to stay.

As noted in other reviews, the beds are not too comfortable but other than that I was pleased with the hotel. The room had a small refrigerator, and the location made up for a lot. The palace, Prado and Plaza Mayor was within walking distance. The hotel was close to two metro stops, one very close to the hotel and the other all the way down Montera (There were some \"street walkers\" in the evening near that metro stop, which made for some interesting people watching by the McDonalds and we did not feel threatened). Most staff spoke English. Considering the cost of other hotels in the area, I did feel it was a good deal. Even with the construction going on at Plaza del Sol we were not bothered by noise.

However...Spanish mattresses are like bricks and this was the worst. Breakfast buffet okay value for five euros only if you like cocoa puffs and factory produced pastries in celaphane. We stayed in other two-star hotels on our trip and they were MUCH better than this one. I would give this hotel a one star. Also note that the Puerto del Sol plaza is in the middle of a messy, noisy, multi-year construction project, and it is not pretty.

Fantastic location right in the middle of Plaza del Sol and steps away from the Metro. Makes getting everywhere so easy. We were afraid it would be really noise, since it is in the middle of everything, but it was not. A few spirited people on the street briefly after bars close. Nothing major. The front desk staff were the friendliest people we met in Madrid. In fact, they may have been the most friendly front desk staff I have come across anywhere. They were incredibly helpful, friendly and kind. Went out of their way to assist us in every way. They readily used their computer to find out just about everything we asked--how to get somewhere, the telephone number for an airline, cost of tickets, etc. It was almost like having a research librarian at the front desk. Even let us check in before noon upon arriving from our overnight flight. The rooms are clean and completely sufficient for those wanting to explore and not stay in their room all day.

The breakfast isn't much to write home about - a very basic continental with instant tea and coffee but it's only 5E per person. The rooms were cleaned (very well) each day.

The location is very good though I did experience some street noise as my room (upgraded by the girl at check-in from single to double at no extra charge - nice start to my stay) was at the front. I bought some ear-plugs and that solved it. It is just a 5 minute walk to Gran Via and all the shops thereon. Bearing in mind the star rating, this is just perfect for a visit to Madrid. I got a very reasonable r/o rate of \u20ac224 for four nights on Booking.com. Breakfast is \u20ac5 extra. There was no bar but there are several in the vicinity. Puerta Del Sol is a very busy area and I felt safe there. (The Police station is four doors from the hotel). The 3 receptionists I dealt with during my stay could not be more helpful. I would not hesitate in staying here if visiting Madrid again. It was good to be able to store my luggage at the hotel until it was time to go to the airport.

The staff were helpful and friendly and there was always someone on reception. The bathroom was another positive - the power shower was a great feature! The only negative was that we could hear the people in the room next door quite clearly, but from what I've read about other hotels in Madrid, you usually have to put up with a lot of street noise and this wasn't the case for us so I suppose a bit of noise from our neighbours was a fair compromise.
