If you are coming on Eurostar Gare Du Nord I recommend getting the RER B to St Michael Notre Dame then just walk up Blvd St Michael.

There were workmen on site painting, drilling, sanding from before 0900 to about 1700 each day. We think any hotel should give prior notice or a price reduction for the disruption. Loss of one star. The key to our door failed to work, resulting in us having to chase up a member of staff to lock and unlock our door every time we left/entered the room. It took 24 hours to get it working and during that time we had to explain the problem to each new person on the front desk. It got really tedious and no real apology or alternative was offered. Poor customer service - loss of one star. Bathroom so small as to be barely functional - loss of one star. We know that the rooms in Paris tend to be small, particularly in the Latin Quarter, but this was too small. As you see from the photo you can\u2019t stretch out your arms inside the room. A 5\u201911/180cm person could just about sit on the toilet \u2013 even then it became tricky when they turned the radiators on full; scalded knees a severe risk. Any larger would be sitting sideways at all times. Bedroom so cramped there is barely room to navigate between bed and chair. My wife and I had to take it in turns to do anything in the room - loss of one star. All the staff at the hotel were pleasant and polite \u2013 but I find this normal at most, if not all, Best Western Hotels. Basically there are loads of Best Western hotels in Paris that offer better value. We stayed at 3 others in the same area that were allegedly only 3 star but the only difference we noticed between this 4 star hotel and them \u2026 was in the price. This hotel was 40% more expensive and not noticeably better. The management will probably claim that small rooms are normal for this region of Paris \u2013 so go with the cheaper hotels \u2013 you might as well save the money. They\u2019re just the same quality. Otherwise \u2013 if you are not familiar with Paris you might be surprised how small it is. A carnet costs (Dec 2011) under 13\u20ac for 10 journeys \u2013 and it takes about 15 minutes to go from even the edge of the periphery to the center.

The Luxembourg RER/Metro station is a pleasant 8 minute stroll away next to the delightful Jardin de Luxembourg. The location is perfect if you are visiting the Parc des Expositions, as I was, but want to stay in central Paris. The RER journey is approximately 35 minutes and no train changes are needed. A 5 minute walk in the opposite direction along Boulevard Saint Michel takes you to the Seine, the Pantheon, the Isle de la Cit\u00e9 and Notre Dame cathedral. Or turn left along Boulevard Saint Germain and reach the heart of the Latin Quarter and experience the real Paris. Rue Racine is narrow and often blocked by traffic. Bear this in mind if you are waiting for a taxi as access to the hotel entrance is often restricted. The hotel is cosy with a small reception area and a lift (elevator) to all floors, including the basement where breakfast is served. My wife and I stayed at the Belloy for two nights, 29th/30th November. We had booked a de-luxe room and were reasonably satisfied with the accommodation on the 3rd floor. The rooms are small, typical for Paris, but well furnished. The Queen sized bed was very comfortable with a firm mattress, which we both prefer. The small toilet was separate and next to the bathroom, which contained both bath and shower and a hairdryer, one of those items you often forget to bring with you. A flat screen TV was provided, which could receive BBC1 and BBC2 channels (English). Our welcome at the hotel was warm enough and the receptionist offered us a glass of champagne, advised that breakfast was included in our room rate (Euros 210 per night) - I was aware of this at the time of booking - and that a free afternoon tea was served between 5:30 and 7:00pm. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a wholesome variety of cereals, fruit, breads and rolls, boiled eggs, croissants, pastries, cheeses, cold meats, tea and coffee. The waiting staff however were somewhat surly... Overall I've rated the hotel 4/5. There were little niggles, which I don't expect when I'm spending this kind of money. On arrival we found no bath towels in the bathroom, just hand towels and I had to ask reception to send some up. The carpet in our room was badly stained and in need of replacement. Although we had tea/coffee making facilities in the room they were not replenished on day two. Small irritations that are so easily avoided if management and staff are more attentive. Overall however we enjoyed our stay here. The location is perfect to experience Paris. Would I stay at the Belloy again? Yes, I would.

It didn't bother us, it's actually very cosy. If large rooms and elevators are important, you must double the price and book a room in one of the big hotels in the more expensive part of Paris.

The location in the Latin Quarter is good if you like a lot of action. The car horns (and the French seem to love their horns) are plentiful along with the general sounds of masses of people on St. Michel Blvd. Its proximity to the colleges makes it quite the hangout area so could be fun all through the night if you don't mind the noise. I had to wear ear plugs. There are some pros to the place. It is clean (I checked for bed bugs), has free WiFi along with a guest computer, beverages stocked in the mini-fridge and includes a minimal breakfast (which was served in what seemed like a dungeon -- two small basement rooms encased by rock). There is complimentary happy-hour wine in the lobby. It seems like a very safe area although there was an incident on the last morning when a very aggressive bag lady came into the lobby and was stuffing the hotel's snack items into her cargo pants. When she was asked to leave, she caused quite a scene complete with cussing and spitting. The desk clerk (didn't get his name but he was the nicer one) tried to lock her out but the front doors weren't working, which leads me to the elevator. When we arrived, the elevator worked but is small beyond belief. It fit two suitcases and the two of us and THAT IS IT. If we had a small child with us, he would have had to be held or put on top of the luggage. The rest of the time, the elevator worked intermittently so we walked several trips to/from the 4th floor. We were offered the service elevator which is a cylinder in a dark cage that can only fit one to two people. We chose the stairs. Upon arrival, I took one look at the room and went back to the desk and asked if that was what we were supposed to get. I was informed that my travel agent booked a standard room (at the mere price of $276/night US dollars). This room looked nothing like the picture on Best Western's site. NOTHING. I measured because it was so ridiculous. I know that rooms in Paris can be tight but I had never seen a hotel room this small in my life, and I've traveled a lot. Give or take an inch, here are the sizes: bedroom 9'x10', bathroom 4'9\"x5'7\" including a shower of 29\"x29\". Every time I turned around in the shower, I turned the water off because I couldn't help but hit the handle. The closet is actually laughable, 16\"x19\". There is no dresser, just some small shelves next to the closet. Because there was no counter space in the bathroom, I used the bedroom radiator to hold my hair curler. In order to open a suitcase, the entry door had to be blocked. We each had one suitcase and only one bag at a time could be horizontal unless you wanted to sleep in the bed with it. And I use the word \"sleep\" loosely. The double bed was hard as a rock and had there been floor space, I might have opted for it because it might have been cooler. They advertise air conditioning which didn't cool at all. There is a mounted unit at the ceiling in the corner of the room and it gives off a little whiff of air, not cool, not hot, just air. The french doors (no balcony) couldn't be left open because of the noise. The room came with two bath towels and two plastic cups; there was a hand towel or two in there also. I needed an extra towel which shouldn't have had to be explained. On our way back in, my husband asked the desk clerk for another towel and perhaps a pillow (because our three were like pancakes). The clerk asked if we already had two towels and I explained that I needed to wash my hair so needed an extra. None of his business why I needed one but I offered the justification. The clerk showed his dissatisfaction but came back with a towel a couple of minutes later. My husband then asked again about getting another pillow. The clerk got pretty snippy telling my husband that he should have asked for it when he requested the towel. Hubby did! We hiked up the stairs (elevator not working) and passed a maid in the hallway with an open closet door with several pillows lined up. We asked if we could have one and she obliged. I should mention here that the hotel book in our room states that \"if you need anything, just ask.\" Really?? We had another instance with this same clerk but enough about him. I doubt that all Latin Quarter rooms are like this so I would look harder if you are set on staying there. Saint-Germain-des-Pres is the next neighborhood over. It seems a bit quieter and in just as good of location. On the west side, at the end of the Metro lines, you can get 4-star hotels for decent prices (Paris decent prices anyways).

We hoped being a Best Western we could expect a certain standard. We previously stayed in 2 other hotels in Paris and this was by far the best.I let my husband open the door to the room while I waited in the hall for his verdict as I was nervous it was going to be a tiny cramped room but....relief, it was really lovely.The room was nicely spacious,obviously newly decorated which was very tasteful. The bed was very big but a bit too firm. Also the sheets were very hard which made for an uncomfortable sleep.Maybe fabric conditioner hasn't reached this hotel yet. We were pleased to find tea and coffee making faciliites in the room. Also they gave us a card on arrival which entitled us to a glass of champagne we thought this was a little something for our anniversary but everyone could have one.It was quite nice actually, not rocket fuel.There was a new flat screen tv on the wall, a well stocked fridge, an extra pillow and towels in the cupboard and the air con worked very efficiently, and it wasn't noisy as in other hotels. There was also free wi-fi if I remember correctly. As mentioned on this website, there are 2 lifts, one is so small my husband had to squash himself tightly behind me in order for both of us to fit in, and we aren't tall people, so that was fun. It was expected from paris hotels were space is at a premium, it was very cute. But there was another lift which was much bigger, though that wouldn't have been hard, which with the 2 of us and our 2 cases was full.But it was fine. The double glazing definately kept the noise out from the Boulevard Saint Michel, which is a busy busy main road.Speaking of the windows,when I was having a shower I left the door open to talk to my husband and noticed the hotel accross the road could see straight into the bathroom! Was quite funny!Me with my shower hat on looking awful! The breakfast would have been nice if we could've found somewhere to sit down, its downstairs in what is like a couple of caves, very nice, if a bit dimly lit, so bring your torch. It was utter chaos!! Worse than Butlins. It was so busy it wasn't funny, actually you just had to laugh and then turn around and leave! When the food was gone it really was gone, it wasn't replenished. The tables were not cleared, so people had to sit at tables with piles of used plates etc on them, which isn't nice, especially first thing in the morning.The 2nd morning I didn't even bother to venture down, my husband ended up eating a few spoonfulls of cereal, as that was all that was left, standing up in a corner! We weren't late to breakfast, about 9am ish.Who wants to get up at 7.30am when you're away on holiday?? There is a monoprix, kind of a small M & S, a few steps away where you could pick up a sandwich or salad and water.so don't panic. The hotel provided a small buffet about 5.30pm which was a nice surprise, we found bread, cheeses, tea &coffee,things like salmon terine, italian ham so we were very happy and as it was empty, we could sit wherever we liked. Most of the reception staff were nice apart from a young lady, who's english was nearly non-existent. Apart the bed being too hard and the chaos at breakfast, I would recommend this hotel without a doubt.The location of this hotel was probably its best selling point, it was close to the RER We flew in to CDG airport, hoped on line B (blue), no changes which was a relief as the train was packed at times and stayed on till Cluny La Sorbonne and walked about 6-7 mins to the hotel.Voila.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "TK1956", "ReviewID": "UR42980510", "Content": "Small room by our standards but ok for our purposes, being tourists.

And BW Belloy Saint-Germain will top the list of the entire continent. And sadly enough they dont charge you any less, infact it was one of the most expensive hotels that I stayed during my 3 weeks summer vaccation in Europe. I stayed there for 4 nights and regret for that. I will advice my fellow travelers not to fall for the trap by looking at the beautiful hotel room pictures that you see on their advertisements. You will be surprised to see how small the rooms are and somewhow they appear bigger on their advertisements. After puttting two mid sized bags there was no space in the room to walk. You will have to jump to the bed from the door as there will be no room for you to put a step anywhere. And I am not exaggerating a bit! The corridors are so tiny that two people won't be able to pass each other. One has to give room to the other to pass. They have one elevator which can accommodate three person at a time and it takes 5 minutes to get down from 3rd floor to the ground floor - that is also if you are lucky enough to catch it after 15 minutes of wait. I used to take the stairs and never minded about the elevator. Now, the management of BW Belloy Saint-Germain came up with a brilliant idea of offering value by bundling in free breakfast, free WiFI, free mini bar (replenshied every 4 days - can't laugh enough), one glass of champagne and tea-time buffet (which we did not find anywhere) on top of their tiny rooms. In my humble opinion, inclusive of all these extra frills, the room price should not be more that half of what they charge. Moreover, the breakfast was very basic - comprises of only bread, butter and jelly. And the tiny breakfast room can accommodate only 12-15 people at a time, so you have to be very to get a seat. The only good thing about this hotel is free internet. If you are not carrying your laptop they have a computer where you get 1 hour internet free. The location of the hotel is not that great. we had a nightmare to reach the hotel from Gare du Lyon Train station. You will not find a clear direction how to reach the hotel in their website. There is one metro station nearby - but you have to walk a lot to change lines. The metro is also not that clean in Paris. I found Paris to be dirty and filthy.

The hotel is located close to trains in a safe central busy area in walking distance of Notre-Dame. We ate at the local restaurants in the latin quarter and shopped at the Monoprix supermarkets for fruit and essentials. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a coin operated laundromat around the corner. This hotel is close to everything and is a great place to stay to see all the Paris attactions by foot or public transport. The breakfast in the cosy restaurant is a terrific way to start the day. The daily lunch packs was a nice bonus. Free wireless internet in the room allowed you allowed you to keep in touch with family and friends and plan the next part of your holiday.

The hotel has had a facelift in most rooms. During our stay we enjoyed a clean and comfortable room. We had a room on the 5th floor facing the street. The room was completely surrounded on the outside by a balcony and so we heard no other guests in the hotel. The bathtub was a nice size and the little soaps were a nice touch. This was our 10th anniversary and it was such a good location to start our vacation with. Later we moved to the Le Meridian in another part of town, and found that it wasn't half as nice as the Best Western, but was more expensive. This hotel is so close to everything, that you really don't need to take the metros but if you do there are 2 lines plus ther RER very close. I would stay here again. By the way, we paid extra for the \"superior room\" instead of the regular room - it was worth it.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia Area)", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "owlyn", "ReviewID": "UR23145607", "Content": "This was our first trip to Paris, and we were surprised at how small the room was (9x12, plus bathroom with a 30\"x30\" shower stall).

Not much room to walk around. We were contstantly moving items to get at another item. However, the room was in very good condition, and very clean. The maid service was a bit erratic, but any problems were solved within minutes by the very helpful, multi-lingual front desk staff. Don't use their public internet service in the lobby- it is e18/hour, and no smaller increments. there is a 24 hour internet cafe one blovk away, where 15 minutes is e1.80. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is walking distance to Notre dame, and is only one block from a Metro/RER station with several lines.

It is near both the St. Germain and Latin Quarter areas. There are several metro and RER stops within short walking distance of the hotel. Notre Dame is a short 3-5 minute walk.

Breakfast was included (croissants, coffee, juice, and toast). The hotel is air-conditioned and the room included a mini-bar/fridge with beer, wine, soda, etc. There is a small elevator.

There was a large window which went out onto a (very) small balcony which we weren't really keen to go out on, but the view from the window was lovely. The lifts are tiny, but my husband and I had a great giggle squishing into the teeeeeeeny lift in the stairwell (the main one is a bit bigger!) It's in a great position, so close to the metro, and across the road there are some fantastic shops and a huge range of restaurants, which were mainly quite inexpensive.
