They had a portable crib for us to use (not in the best condition, but they had one!) and it worked perfectly in our room.

In fact, some of the reviews for the top hotels are evidence of frighteningly poor value-for-money. So the trick is to find a not TOO expensive hotel, in a good location, with useful extras (eg. spa, free WiFi), with the least poor reviews. This paid off for us at the Acropol. OK, so it's not cheap, but the location is brilliant - the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia are a few minutes walk away, and the Sultanahmet tram stop (on the T1 line) a few minutes further on from there. If you happen to be at the Eminonu end of the Galata bridge another way back to this hotel is from Sirkeci station: one stop down the B1 electric train line to Cankurturan station, which is close by the hotel. We were made very welcome, and all the staff are friendly and helpful and speak English. I e-mailed the hotel with my requirements and had a prompt and detailed reply. On the top floor, room 501 was spacious and comfortable, which I chose because it had a view across the Sea of Marmara/Bosphorus to the Asian side, meaning the sunrise streamed in through our window at first light. You can see the Selimiye Barracks where Florence Nightingale operated on the far shore. The alternative is to choose a city view, in which case I gather you can see the Blue Mosque or Aya Sofia, and at least one of these rooms apparently has a balcony, which would be nice in summer. I took advantage of the free WiFi, which worked fine. They have a spa in the basement, which includes a very nice Hamam, or Turkish bath. This was very relaxing, all the more so because it is included in the room rate. You can opt for a massage, but this is extra. We chose to eat dinner at the hotel (it was dark and raining) and this was very pleasant, although the wine was VERY expensive. Breakfast made few concessions to Western tastes and was a bit strange, but great if you've got a very sweet tooth, and don't aspire to Turkish or espresso coffee. We opted for their door-to-door private van transfer to the airport (18km, 30 euros) which was ultra-efficient and fast, rather than be at the mercy of the predatory Istanbul taxi drivers - who all wanted 20 euros to bring us the 5km from the cruise terminal behind Istanbul Modern.

When we booked on the Best Western web site we selected to pay for this service as we knew we would be tired after all night on the plane. The drive to the hotel took about 20 minutes. When we checked in, we were offered a complimentary breakfast and the use of the shower and spa to freshen up before our day of exploring. Our room was not available so early, but our bags were stored safely and we went off to explore When we got back to the hotel about 2pm, our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a family suite. Our suite was beautifully furnished with a polished wood floor, high quality furniture and a comfortable bed. The room overlooked the old street of Sultanahmet and it was lovely to watch daily life go on below us. The hotel is small - about 24 suites in all I think. All rooms are now suites after a recent renovation of the hotel. Our booking included breakfast every day - a European/ continental style buffet with fruit and cold meats and you could order eggs any way you liked them. We ate outside on the wrap around balcony and watched the street wake up - no one hassled you at the table The staff was most pleasant and helpful. They were very knowledgeable of the area and the transport systems and were able to tell us how to get where we wanted to go. Location wise we were a 5-8 minute walk from Sultanahmet Square where you catch the trams to other areas of Istanbul. We were about -7 minutes from the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque and maybe 12 minutes from the wonderful Topkapi palace. We wanted to stay in Sultanahmet as we figured on our first day in Istanbul after the flight we could wander round and see the Basilica Cistern and explore the old streets but be close enough to walk back to our hotel if we were tired. On our third morning I saw there were no \"Simits\" on the buffet - like a pretzel made from soft bread with sesame seeds - they are sold on the streets and I thought they were delicious. I mentioned it to the waiter who said \"I will buy for you\" and 5 minutes later he arrived back at our table with a bag of fresh simits - great service After we left the hotel and went on to Venice, I noticed I had left a face cream at the Acropol Hotel. I emailed the manager who replied that they had found my cream and were happy to forward it on for me - great service again.

The breakfast buffet was very good and included Turkish items as well as cold meats, cheeses, breads, fresh fruit, and cereal. They will also cook you eggs to order (omelet, fried, scrambled, etc.).

At the last minute before departing on my trip to Istanbul I learned that the hotel I booked was right next to active train tracks and very noisy. I immediately did a quick search and found this under-reviewed, Best Western boutique hotel in the Sultanahmet. Before I continue with the review I want to mention that American consumers should not be put off by the average hotel brand of Best Western we envision here in the US. I have stayed at 4 Best Western properties in Europe and they all exceeded US equalivant standards. What this means is that there are great Best Western hotel values available in European travel - just a tip from an experienced traveler. Now the review of the Acropol. This hotel was completely renovated about 4 or 5 months ago and it shows. The small lobby, dining area, Turkish bath/Spa/Gym, and particularly the rooms all sparkle with newness. Really, really nice. We were upgraded, no charge, to top floor, first class rooms with balconies and views of the Blue Mosque and Hogie Sophia - Oh my! The mattresses and linens were new and very comfortable. I could go on and on about the rooms. The breakfast was extensive and quite delicious. You eat while sitting outside enjoying the morning and watching the street come alive. The location of the property is beyond compare. It is located on a very, very happening ave. with many street cafes, restaurants and local bars. In fact the hotel is located across the street from the #1 rated TA restaurant in Istanbul. I walked and saw many places in the Sultanahment, which is the distict you want to be located in as a tourist, and the street where this hotel is located is absolutely the nicest and most active. Perfect! The staff was very, very friendly and quite helpful but could use a little more seasoning regarding the typical needs of tourists in Istanbul (eg - where is the roodtop bar with the nicest view of the city, things like that). We met the owner and current President of the Turkey boutique hotel owners association. He was a very charming, helpful man concerned about our comfort and enjoyment during our stay in Istanbul. Classy guy. OK, Ok I'll stop gushing all these wonderful words of praise and just say that if you plan a trip to Istanbul in the near future this is where you want to stay.
