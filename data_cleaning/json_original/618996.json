This should include the conversion of the building to a hotel, as the orginal infrastructure and features are clearly visable. Friendly staff, good if not large spa (thankfully with a policy of no children after 18:00) and a decent breakfast menu. The only suggested improvement is the service at breakfast. In most other five star hotels, you are asked for tea or coffee when you are sitting at the table. Here you either have to ask, or serve yourself and have a waitress run over and insist on pouring the tea or coffee (you then convey the pot back to your table). The staff are very welcoming when you arrive, but a little slow at clearing tables, and will not necessarily clear items off your table once finished with, preferring to wait until you have left (and then at their own leisure, so you could be sitting next to a table of dirty plates and glasses if the other guests depart whilst your eating). To be fair, our stay could have coincided with staff being absent - but it was over four days. Despite this would stay again and would recommend others stay.

We were travelling with our 2 young kids - 4 and 2 years old. Firstly, we took the junior suite. It was a big room and could fit in 2 extra single beds. That's a plus. But the bathroom was really small for a suite! There were no special amenities for the kids and breakfast is not included.

Upon arrival, the room was very clean but when housekeeping was suppose to clean the room, we found they did a shoddy job! My little one had chocolate finger-marks on his bedding and this was not changed. They left a couple of used towels on the room floor. The beds were not very well made and all in all the room lacked a freshly clean feel. this may sound fussy for some, but I was paying a full price for a suite! Yet, i didn't complain because i felt the service was really warm and welcoming. The staff are very helpful, the front desk, restaurant and concierge. The food at the hotel is superb! The hotel is in an excellent location and there are little places to eat nearby and to take the canal cruise etc. The deco is very Macintosh/Art Nouveau. You could feel like you stepped out of a 1920's Stephen King Horror film or if you're more optimistic then a Agatha Christie's Novel! I like a different look but found this hotel a bit too dark and faded.

I chose this hotel because of the location, the free internet, the free minibar, and got a great rate through Hotels.com. The location was exceptional, a few minutes walk to the Centraal Station. A little too far to walk with luggage though. I walked all over from the hotel and only on the last two days started taking the trams. The free wi fi was excellent, never lost signal. and the free minibar was, yes, really free and it was replenished daily. 2 small coke bottles; 2 coke lite; 2 sprite, 2 tonic waters, 2 waters, 2 orange juices. Beer, as well as 1 each small bottle of gin, scotch, vodka, whiskey, cognac, and wine. Plus 2 snacks. Not bad for being free. One of the few 5 star hotels to offer free internet and free minibar. My room had a huge floor to ceiling window but no view other than a wall with windows. Didn't realise I had a reservation with no view so if you want a view of the canal make sure to pay for the room with a view. The single room itself was on the small side but it wasn't the size that was the problem. My room layout wasn't very well-designed. The corner where the desk is is not big enough for the desk and chair. There was hardly room to pull the chair out and then it hit the closet. The bed was the star of the room, it was without doubt the most comfortable bed I've slept in. The mattress together with the pillows and comforter make this a true 5 star sleeping experience. The staff was all-around helpful with good attitudes especially the concierges. Had an excellent massage by Jose in the wellness spa. The only glitches I encountered were mostly having to do with housekeeping and the bathroom. On one occasion they forgot to empty the trash. Another time they forgot to replenish some of the amenities in the bathroom. Another day I left at 9 A.m. and returned at 3:30 to find the room not cleaned yet. The shower/tub has a 3-piece glass panel that you close to take a shower. I don't knoow if it was my particular room, but the third panel kept closing during the shower and I finally had to jam a face cloth between the bottom of the panel and the top of the tub to keep it from moving. Also, the drain is directly below the shower and where you would stand and unless you are very aware of this you keep stepping on it and before you know it you're standing n a couple of inches of water. The lighting above the sink is poor also. I tried the buffet breakfast onemorning even though it was expensive. It was advertised as 25 euros but I was only charged 19.50 but still it's not worth it for the money. All in all an excellent hotel. I would stay here again if I get the rate I got this time of less than 200 euros. I would not pay over 400 euros a night that I have seen advertised at certain times. I didn't encounter the problem a lot of reviewers had with the automatic curtains opening or closing on their own.

The location is great, a five minute walk from the railway startion, near to tram stops but close enough to walk to most tourist attractions. It is worth noting that to get to many of the tourist stops the quickest walk takes you across three streets of the red light district, however to be honest it was so amusing that it actually added to the experience!! The red light district is not particularly seedy or intimidating as you might think. The staff all spoke great English and were always happy to help with our requests such as booking a table at a nearby restaurant or finding a vase for some tulips we have bought for our room! The leisure facilities are good with a pool, sauna etc and small cardio room that are all clean and tidy. Each room has a free mini bar, re-stocked every day which was great and good quality wi-fi.

However, some small issues follow which I record only to provide the full picture: We had prepaid for our stay to include all taxes and charges but upon leaving, we were informed that an extra nightly tax still had to be paid. Tax is tax but it should really have been factored into the asking price and not recouped at the end. Most irritating. Although the food is very good in the hotel restaurant, the prices charged are, to my mind, excessive.

I had found a very good deal for a Superior Deluxe Double through Hotels4you. We opted for the room only option which I would say is the best value for money as Amsterdam hotels are renowned for overcharging on their breakfasts. Plus its rather nice to leave the hotel before the city starts to fill up with the other tourists, there are plenty of lovely cafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with waffles, pancakes everything you could possibly want nearby. The hotel itself is very impressive, you feel like you are walking onto a movie set with an impressive marble entrance hall and staircase and beautiful ironmongery everywhere, specifically tridents as I believe the hotel use to serve the sailors a long time ago! The room: I have stayed many times in Amsterdam (9x) and have experienced a variety of lodgings, but the floor space you get in the Amrath was the best by far. I had done some research on their website before we visited and I saw that there were a few 4 poster superior doubles. So just in case one might be available I emailed the hotel directly to ask if it was possible, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d very much appreciate one of the four posters. It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt to ask right! And it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt at all! The staff were very charming on arrival and we were indeed issued with a four poster room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most incredibly comfortable bed, which made it very hard to get up in the morning. The room came with a large en-suite bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be more specific the bath was enormous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to put it in prospective, my boyfriend is 6\u00e2\u20ac\u212210\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and it was the first time I have ever seen him be able to stretch out his legs in a bath tub! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c glorious for a long soak after trudging around the city. Not only did the bathroom have a huge deep bath it also had a fantastic power shower and double basin. The Amrath also provides a complimentary minibar in the room. This is a fantastic perk, it is well stocked with soft drinks and wine and beer and is replenished every day. The Staff: I must just mention the concierge guys, they were so helpful and charming. All the staff in the hotel are multi lingual it seems and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more helpful. There is a lovely bar on the ground floor where afternoon tea is served on Sundays, it is quite popular, so make sure you book. Location: We arrived by train from London and walked only 10 minutes max to get to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so easy! Even though you are not right in the centre of town the perks of the Amrath location is that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer from the noise from the late night life all around you in the centre. The hotel is well placed for the trams which take you everywhere or even walking, which we did allot of, it really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far from all the main attractions. Now it does sound too good to be true going from my comments above, but nowhere is perfect.... so I have to mention only one thing that annoyed me. The flat screen TV in the room was fixed on a bracket against the wall but could not be angled so you could watch from the bed. And the remote control itself was AWOL for the first 2 nights as the maid had made the bed over it from the previous tenants. But this certainly no reason not to stay here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had no time to really watch TV with all the exploring of the city!

Unfortunately the beauty and splendour of this art deco building is not matched by the poor standards for high tea.

The elegant architecture is ruined by the awful bar area with pink and green neon highlighting the liquor cabinet. Nothing like the pictures...we should have known 2 the prosecco. Ok. 2 We were promised a selection of tea. Instead we got the most awful blend of green tea imaginable. Tasted like water with trace amounts of 'something'. not brewed long enough or just really bad. The selection never came. Having said that, maybe they expected us to wait longer than 30 minutes. at that point, the quality proved to be so poor we decided to leave. 3 After the prosecco we were given a special treat: the chefs special fish soup served with a semi burnt kroket of shrimp. The latter was so salty, the shrimp could not be detected. Mine was vert oily. I'm not sure how this was going to complement the scones and clotted cream that were to come next. The 'special' fish soup was special indeed. It tasted of mushroom soup with an overwhelming flowery texture. The presentation in a cognac glass did not help either. A pathetic attempt at 'contemporary' cuisine. 4 The high tea. Served on very ugly tray. The finger sandwiches: The bread was a bit of a shock. It tasted of ( and I have feeling it actually was ) spongy processed factory baking. The cheese was not worthy of a country with such nice cheese. Again, low quality. The presentation is never the same as the pictures, that's life. But here, there wasn't even a trace of an effort to mimic the advertising pictures. Ugly and boring. The scones were fine. Two of them at least. Although they were both too sweat for my taste. They amrath chef had decided to put bits of chocolate in the dough. This might work sometimes, this time it didnt. Fruit salad. Just fruit salad, the fruit was not even cut up properly. Again, low quality ingredients. Tasteless fruit. Looks like something I would prepare and that's not a bad thing. again, cognac glasses, attempt at a new trend..?? 5 Bonbons, biscuits and odd bits of chunky pastry. I raelise I might sound overdramatic, but even this wasn't done right. OR should I say espescially this. The beautiful little tartles, mouse or loveyly cream filled little things were missing. Instead we were given prefab biscuits and bonbons that were crusty and cracked. 6 The price: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65 euros for 2. Not worth it. I would like to save anyone I can from wasting their money on this disappointing 'high tea'. The best thing was that are complaints were taken on board and we did not have to pay.

We opted for breakfast to be brought to our room each morning for a 7.50 euro surcharge. This was delicious and would be enough for lunch too. The bathroom was amazing, the heated slate floor was a pleasant bonus. The HUGE shower and HUGE bath were very enjoyable and we took advantage of having quite a few a day! The wellness centre was a true gem, the amazing starlit ceiling pool and jaccuzzi where heaven after a night in the Amsterdam bars! We were always the only ones down there so it felt like our own private domain! We indulged in a massage which was fantastic. Ian surely knows his stuff! The bar was quite pricey but so was the rest of the bars in Amsterdam. Fausto was very friendly and welcoming, and we loved the complimentary spicy nuts! The attention to detail and the artwork made this hotel one of the best we have stayed in and was the icing on the cake for our weekend away. Everything was clean and kept to a high level of excellence. From the toilets to the lifts. The staff were very polite and helpful and we would never stay anywhere else when returning to this amazing city. We look forward to the next trip!!

The mini bar gets stocked TWICE a day with branded mini-vodka, gin, whisky, white rum and brandy plus two beers,cokes, fresh orange juice and sprite - plus wine n red wine and still/sparkling water. We had the orange juice every morning when we got up and the vodka every night when we got in (great idea!). I used the swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna on 2 occasions and everything was sparkling clean and very enjoyable. The hotel is a converted merchant shipping building so dont expect an ultra-modern interior.....the lift was really quirky with wood panelling and old style buttons etc but I think that added character.

Instead they found that a great amount of soda was spilt on the carpet in the room.

The good - 1. It's very close to the central station, and lots of restaurants, but it's not actually IN the red light district, so you avoid all most of the really loud crowds. It's also on a fairly major street, so getting a taxi to get where you are going was really easy. 2. The Nepresso machine in the room was good, and it was refilled 2 times a day. Since I used it quite a bit we were happy with the quality. However, I had to filch milk from the office I was working in because I never saw the people who refilled and they only left 2 a day. 3. Free Mini bar and WiFi. Very nice for a working a working trip. And the mini bar is filled 1 time a day every day, not just 1 time during your visit. Lovely. 4. The room was a bit small, but well decorated, and the separate tub shower was really nice. Lots of counter space for everything, and a REAL hairdryer! The okay - 1. This hotel is right at the edge of the Red Light district, so to get anything to eat you have to walk into the coffee shops etc. If you are there are play this might be fun, but for a single person, the after a busy night was not too pleasant, and you are a hike from any shops that aren't absolutely geared for tourists. 2. The picture of the spa area looks fantastic. In reality it's quite small, and the workout room is small as well. I had to wait 20 minutes to get on a bike. Luckily it was nice enough most of my visit to just walk outside. 3. Breakfast is 30 Euros for the buffet, and you can't order off a separate menu, except through room service. However the buffet is nice, includes good latte's, and you can order your eggs how you like them, so no dry scrambled from the chafing dishes. The bad - 1. I got the cheapest room they had, which is interior to a court yard. The building is an odd triangle shape so there are windows onto a \"courtyard\". The thermostat was set to heat, and I could not make it cool down, and the room had 1 window that opened about 1 inch, and since the window wasn't outside there was 0 fresh air. The room ended up being REALLY stuffy. The last night the room was so hot it was almost unsleepable. If you stay here, make SURE you get a room on the exterior of the building. 2. My husband meet me for 2 nights on the way to work in Austria himself. He spent one afternoon in the bar, where he reported the food was bland and the service was slow. However, the beer was good. 3. The \"wardrobe\" is a joke. It has 2 tiny little sides to hang things with a few drawers. Barely enough for me, must less 2 of us. Basically this is a interesting old hotel. Don't bother if you can't upgrade to a nicer room.

Up close you're struck by the quality of the build - interesting bricks/tiles and lovingly-burnished wooden fittings. The staff are immensely friendly from outside the door, via reception to, well, just everyone. The interior layout is quirky - it feels like an interior from 1984 or Brazil that's been refurb'd, leaving the underlying inflexible oddness of the building untouched. As a result the room are utterly weirdly shaped. Mine (407) was a 'dog-leg' shape with a small bedroom area (large by Parisian standards ;) ) then a seating area then an immense and lovely bathroom. Odd, but charming. I really liked it. Some excellent touches deserve special credit: 1) free, good-quality wi-fi throughout. Bravo! 2) free mini-bar. Everything in the mini-bar is included within the room rate and it's replenished every day. Lovely touch, instead of being gouged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for water etc. So - wonderful so far. My only caveat is that this is not a 5-star hotel. It's a characterful, friendly 4-star in a memorable building. It's therefore at least 20% overpriced if you're paying rack rate.

It is in a stunning building and is in a perfect location, just round the corner from all the shops cafes attractions and transport links to other parts of Amsterdam. However, we had an upsetting experience there on check in as they could not find our booking. I showed them the confirmation from Lastminute.com of booking and full payment in advance, 4+ half months previously. They admitted that but asked us to wait in the bar while they sorted it out and told us we would be given a free drink to make up for the inconvenience. We were waiting 25 minutes and nobody from the bar came to us or knew about the free drink. My partner asked them again and they said that they had \"found us a room\" but did not appear to have found our original booking. I made sure this \"replacement\" room was the same grade as what we had already paid for. That was confirmed. However what we found most upsetting was the fact that they asked us for credit card details in order to pay for any extras we may spend at hotel as we were there on a room only basis. However we only have debit cards and they then said that they would not just take a \"print\" of the card + bill us at the end of our stay but would take out immediately EU400 ( about \u00c2\u00a3350 ) and refund any unspent money at check out. We thought that was very cheeky and unfair as if we were being penalised for \"only\" having debit cards. None of this was mentioned in any of the booking information or on the hotel's own website.

I also managed to hit the sauna area and that was nice as well. Steam didn't seem to be working, but 2 levels of dry saunas were roasting hot, and body temp pool was nice. Oh and internet worked great, signal very strong/fast and I was on the fourth floor. One nit-pick, they do something with the mattresses when people checkout, not sure what? But lots of times you will see mattresses stacked in the hall for most of the day. Maybe they are checking or preventing bedbugs? Dunno, but it was blocking doors a couple times = fire hazard.

It is a short walk from the Central Station and so very easy to get to, but if I were to stay in Amsterdam again, I might choose to stay on the other side of the city, as we found that most of the bars and restaurants that we wanted to go to were on the other side and we had to walk through busy shopping areas and the red light district to get to them!

However, we did make use of the Wellness Centre in the basement, which has a small pool, 4 person jacuzzi, large sauna and steam room (lacking hot steam). We had the facilities virtually to ourselves, but had there been more than a dozen people there, it could have felt busy. We had a standard double room on the fourth floor on the canal side - you could not really say that it had a canal view as it was so high up that it overlooked the building site on the other side of the canal. Nevertheless it suited us, as it was very quiet. I would not have considered paying the quoted room rate, but it seemed very good value for the deal we were on.

The mini-bar in the room is free and restocked every day, which is nice. The bed is comfortable. There is a safe on the rooms. The room does have english speaking TV -- which is nice. I paid for the city view -- beware of what this means. City View is simply defined as a room with a view that is not of the interior. As such our \"city view\" looked out over the city -- but the city bus station. In fact if your room is on a particular side they will all look out over the bus station. The other side looks out over a canal and has an excellent view. After the first night we asked to be changed and they did move us, to a slightly smaller room, but with a decent view. I could give up a little space for the canal view -- and you should too. Its worth it. The staff is helpful, but not \"out of your way helpful.\" They have helpful suggestions, but if you are an active traveler then you can easily find your way. It should be noted that upon arrival they charge $400 to your credit card as a \"deposit\" -- which they said they would credit back after we left if we did not have a bill. Also every day they continued to charge $100. So be aware of this and have plenty of \"space\" on your credit card for these charges. The only disaster was the suggestion by the hotel to go on a day excursion out of the city. Do not do this. It was a horrible experience. The buses are jammed with people, seats are way too small, my ear phone did not work and so I could not understand a word on the trip. Do NOT do the excursions. It is a waste of your money -- or as I like to think of it a creative way to steal your money. The wellness center -- pool etc. area is excellent. The water in the hot tub was a bit cold for me, but the pool is VERY nice. The steam room and sauna is large, spacious, and relaxing. It was not over crowded when we were there. The hotel is located near central station, which is helpful if you took the train from the airport, but we found we never went back again. In hind sight, I wished we had gotten a hotel in the middle of the city so we did not have to walk so much. However, if you like a hotel a little apart from the craziness of the inner city then you might like this one. The Red Light district is literally 2 blocks away -- so everything in the northern part of Amsterdam is very accessible. Was this room worth $300-350 US dollars? NO not at all. Maybe worth $200-250 a night if that. When I was at the hotel I saw a CNN report that said Amsterdam hotels are some of the most expensive in Europe. So there you go!

We stayed three nights in a larger room this time in which the bathroom is enclosed with glass in the middle of the next room. It is unusual and unique. The bedroom is beautiful with quality furniture, wood floors and heavy wood french doors covering the windows with beautiful lacy curtains hanging from the 14' (or more) ceiling. The solid wooden lacquered doors that lead to the room give you the feeling of a romantic European film or espionage novel. The ambiance is outstanding throughout the hotel. It's just SO beautiful and fine until..........you go into the hotel bar. We went into the bar briefly, three nights and three nights we saw mice. The first night one, then two and then three! They were scampering on the floor, sneaking from table to table! What really got me was that when we mentioned this to the staff they were unbelievably nonchalant about it! They just said \"oh yeah, the mice. We try to control them\" with a laugh. We were glad we did not eat in their attached restaurant this time. (We did not have this experience the first time.) There probably are issues with rodents due to the proximity of the canal to the hotel but at least the staff could pretend they care that their guests are offended (grossed out, actually) by the rodents and are serious about doing something with the mice or at least apologize! American guests do not like mice in there high priced 5 star hotels. The other issues we had were related to the room. Our phone did not work, the a/c wasn't working and there was no bar soap. We wanted to watch the US Open tennis tournament and the television didn't work. It appears the management philosophy is to do maintenance only when there are complaints. The issues took a day to resolve but the a/c issue never was. (The manager told us: \"You can't hear it, you can't see it move the curtains where the vents are, you can't feel the air on you......but it's working.\")?? Uh huh. Since our phone was not working we reported the TV problem directly to the desk when we went out. When we returned 5 hours later we went into the office again to inquire about our issues and were told the TV had been fixed. We tried the TV and found that it was still not working. We fiddled with it for a while and then discovered it was unplugged!!! Obviously it was never looked at and they lied about it. When we asked the front desk for bar soap for our room we were told that they were out!! (There was shampoo, bath gel and the like.) Later in our stay they brought us a box of Lanvin products which included a two inch bar of soap. We thought that perhaps the hotel would offer some gratuity for all of our trouble, but no. To top it off, when we were reviewing our bill we found a suspicious charge which we questioned. The \"computer\" charged us double for an item we were told. The COMPUTER charged us twice? Uh huh. Besides all of this, the concierge staff was absolutely outstanding. They were helpful beyond call, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, smartly dressed, and efficient.

The Red Light District is 5 minutes away, you can walk through it to get where you're going throughout the day and evening if you want, there are other ways to and from the hotel from restaurants, shopping etc. but we found it was the quickest. My first thought was 'well my husband is going to definitely enjoy this location'. But honestly, the Red Light DIstrict is no big deal. It seems well managed, clean, and no one is accosting you as you're walking through. So the fact that the hotel is so close is no issue.

We had a quick lunch there, it was tasty with big portions. We also went to the hotel bar for a nightcap, that was one good Spanish Coffee where the drink was actually hot, and you even received a little 'cookie' with it complimentary (again...love the extras). <p> The front entrance/lobby was a bit dark and austere, and wondered while waiting to check in, if this was a good choice, but turned out better than expected. The check-in process was a little weird, in that they took only two guests at a time in their 'check-in room'. But, they were friendly and attentive and check- in goes smoothly although you may have to wait a bit if a number of guests arrive at the same time, but it is worth it.

We had four rooms and the the other members of the group could not have afforded to have the money taken from their account. The hotel agreed to only take 500 euros from one card for the whole group. Thank you - it would have been their spending money, Also hotel offer to lend us a wheel chair for the 90 year old and after a couple of days we were struggling with one of the wheels catching on the frame. We didn't ask but next day another wheel chair appeared which was perfect. Don't know if this was a coincidence but if it wasn't thankyou to who ever noticed us outside the hotel trying to repair the original chair. In summary, staff were great, helpful and very friendly.

Interestingly, the hotel actively seek feedback from guests on trip adviser which is a first for me. One last thing, the curtains are controlled by remote control in your room. I don't know if hotel can override this but curtains would periodically open during the night and then close again. If this is not a computer control glitch then I think we had someone else in our room and given the history and age of the hotel maybe something spooky was taking place.

There is a lovely spa area but it's just (warm) pool, saunas, steam, and jacuzzi, all unisex and open 7a-11p. Unisex changing area, not much spa menu (they have a massage room). The attached gym is very anemic, with a few poor machines and a minimalist weight tower. They really need to spend a few $ on better gym equipment. Room furnishings are very nice, with a very modern bathroom, but classic hotel room decor. A large and well-furnished room, by European standards. It's around 1/2 mile along the road the Central Station is on, so not that close for people with lots of luggage. Check-in was one of those sit-down affairs, filling out forms with information they already have via the online reservation. Similarly, check-out, which is when the required city tax is paid, requires another trip to the front desk. This process could have been faster, and more automated. There is no self-service laundry, but they will send items out on a per-item cost for laundering or dry cleaning.

We went for a walk and when we came back the room had been entered and a cot was placed inside.

I asked for the manager, who happened to be standing next to hana... She was pretty rude again. They said it wasn't allowed anywhere in Amsterdam.

I visit Amsterdam at least twice a year and this hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed in. The rooms are, large clean, with every possible facility provided for your comfort. The complimentary mini bar is filled on a daily basis with a selection of wine, beer, spirits, mixers, fruit juice,water, mixers and soft drinks. It also has a selection of chocolate and nuts. The mini bar is so well stocked my husband and myself although we tried our best we could not keep up with it, they just kept refilling it! The bathroom was wonderful with both a bath and a shower cubicle which in my experience you usually get one or the other. All toiletries are provided except for toothpaste and this is also replenished twice a day. They also provde a good espresso machine and also a kettle if you prefer tea. I also liked the little extras like dressing gowns, sewing kit, umberellas and a trouser press. The widescreen tv provides a good choice of channels and the rooms have air conitioning. The housekeeping team also provde a turn down service if you require it. We had a fantastic view over the river and could see the boats from the canal parade from the room. The hotel is in a good position just to the left of centraal station and directly opposite Nemo and the floating chinese restraunt. It is 5 minutes walk to the red light area and china town and also close to some of the gay bars. If you prefer the other side of Amsterdam like Anne Franks house and Rembrants square it is a good 25mins walk from there. I would thouroughly recommend staying here the hotel architecture is amazing and the staff are very heplful. Now the bad points..... Not very much just a couple of little gripes, the hotel puts a charge of 100 euroes per night on your credit card for extras, I did not use any but do be prepared to be asked for this. I am hoping I do not have any problems having the charge removed. If you don't own a credit card you will be asked for the cash. Also the city tax is not included in the price you pay. This is not unusual in Amsterdam but you are usually informed of this at booking. We were charged 16 euroes for 3 nights. Breakfast was not included in our booking but I was told by another guest that it is wonderful, but at a cost of 25 euroes per person for a continetal breakfast and 27 euroes each for an english breakfast we chose to eat at one of the many other eating places in Amsterdam. Also we did not use the spa but it did look very good and a wide range of facials and massages are available.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGrand Hotel, Grand Location\u201d", "Author": "snayyar", "ReviewID": "UR116472386", "Content": "Stay here if you are a couple looking for a 4.5-star hotel and want to enjoy the city center with easy access to Central Station.

The rooms are spacious, but awkwardly designed (prob because of existing structures) and will be in need of an update soon. The staff are well-trained and friendly. Like other 'dam hotels, if you need something, you will need to ask for it. The beds are comfortable and fairly new, but a bit firm. The mini bar is included in the room-rate which is a nice perk! The location is a 5 minute walk from Central Station, 5-10 minutes to Dam Square/RLD. We took a few train trips, so this location was ideal. Also, if you take the train from Schipol to Central, your entire airport transfer will cost you 7 euro (r/t!). There is much to eat, but the center of amsterdam is mostly filled with tourist food aka great drinking grub (Broodjes, fried everything, FEBO, pizza...etc). Make sure you look outside of city center for finer dining (De Kas does wonders). The pool is located in the lower level and is a nice perk after a long day. The pool was well maintained, and not busy at all. I found the hotel overall to not be filled to capacity and there were few young children around. The hotel is overall quiet, and you will not bump into too many other guests. The corridors are small and can get confusing - chalk it up again to the older building design.

The room was gorgeous - high, high ceiling, plenty of floorspace, beautiful furniture, view over the canal. Ultra modern refurbishment, especially of the bathroom. Shame we didn't have a bath, but to be honest we hadn't asked for one and it wasn't really an issue. Bathrobes and slippers were included, there was free wi-fi, and there was also a free minibar - to the astonishment of one American guest who asked at reception - \"Even the liquor??\" There was also a Nespresso machine in the room - fast, delicious coffee at the touch of a button. The minibar had 2 x Cokes, 2 x Diet Cokes, 2 x Sprites, 2 x Tonic Waters, 2 x Orange Juices, and an assortment of miniatures, vodka, whisky etc, plus a free chocolate bar and peanuts. This was fully replenished every day. The staff were extremely polite, smiley and helpful - both reception and the concierge. Housekeeping was excellent - especially considering we had the Do Not Disturb sign up most mornings! Some hotels won't make up your room if you've slept in, but the Amrath staff just come back later. There's also a turn-down service in the evenings. We didn't bother with the breakfast, although the restaurant did look nice - we wanted to get our day started right in the city. We also didn't try out the spa, which was a shame but we were having such a great time in the city we basically forgot about it! I had a look round on our last day, it seemed pretty luxurious and welcoming. The Amrath is a quick 5 minute walk (with rolling suitcases) from Central Station, unless you've got very heavy luggage you really DON'T need a taxi. The canal boat stops are also handy - just near the station. You can walk right down to the Rijksmuseum in about 30-40 minutes, or catch a tram. Beware - the trams are NOT cheap, about 2.5 euros for a short ride, we paid 26 euros for a 24-hour canal boat ticket instead. If you buy the 24-hour option rather than the 'all day' option, it's 24 full hours from when you first board, and so you can hop on/hop off as much as you like. So we walked to the Rijksmuseum first, then bought a ticket, and didn't board till nearly 6pm for the ride home - so essentially we got 2 days' use out of it.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel overall\u201d", "Author": "seateacher", "ReviewID": "UR116308976", "Content": "Beautiful Hotel in a perfect location.

The biggest problem we had was trying to cross the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cars, cyclists and scooters appeared to have no qualms about trying to run you over (although I am sure that there is some logic to it, however alien it is to us). Be careful crossing the road and look in all directions before you step off the pavement! I would say that Amsterdam is probably not the place to bring your children, as the red light district and the tourist souvenirs may be offensive to some. In the larger areas of the city there are people who dress up in costumes, they then try and entice either you or your children to stand beside them to get their photographs taken. Once the child is beside the person they wrap an arm around them and are reluctant to part with the child until you have given them money for the photograph. There is a wide variety of restaurants and eating places in Amsterdam. Examples are Chinese, Mexican, Argentinian, Italian, burger bars etc. The food in the Chinese restaurants is not the same as the Chinese restaurants in the UK, this took some getting used to. This is a purely personal preference. Wherever you go there is a wide choice of eating available. There is a multiplicity of sights for the tourists to see. One of the most relaxing excursions that we had was the canal tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was very informative and calming after battling your way through the crowds of Amsterdam. To sum up, the hotel was excellent, the people were friendly and welcoming and the city had plenty to see and do in a period of one week.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLove the hotel's architecture.\u201d", "Author": "Sandeeeca", "ReviewID": "UR115549775", "Content": "Beautiful hotel.

The building the hotel is situated in is spectacular, a walk up all the stairs to see the glass roof is a must. This trip was to celebrate our anniversary so i did book a bigger room, we stayed in a Superior Deluxe with a city view, which was well worth the money. The room was spectacular and the views were beautiful. The room had a four poster bed (comfiest ever), which i had requested via e-mail at no extra cost and was the most special room we have ever stayed in, very romantic. We found the staff to be incredibly helpful, the concierge really know their stuff and are always happy to help you find a place to eat or give directions. The only thing I would say is that when we arrived check in was slow, they only had two of the three reception desks open so we had to wait some time before we were seen. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant on our last morning as a treat and because they were doing a special discount for the month of July. It had a standard selection but is definitely not worth the normal cost of 25 Euros, not when there are so many lovely little places to stop in close by. The swimming pool is a little hard to find, we got a bit lost in corridors, but once you find it it is well worth a dip. Not a huge pool but big enough for us to bob about and have a bit of a swim.

I expected this to some extent, but upon seeing the room service menu and seeing quite reasonable prices for items, I thought I had scored a coup.

Nonetheless I was warmly welcomed and invited to proceed to the check-in in a stylish wooden style room. The staff was nice and professional, it took a bit of time (5-10 min) to check in as it was the first day for the receptionist who was in charge of my case, but she was assisted by her colleagues and all of them were kind so it was no hassle. The hotel itself is decorated with warm colour which make you feel like being welcomed from home. At first, it might seem to be like a labyrinth but you quickly get used to the long curved corridors. There are a night club, a swimming-pool, a fitness center and a spa in the basement of the building. I only made use of the fitness center, I should rather say fitness room as there were only 5 or 6 training machines but I never saw anybody else than me using them during the few hours I was there (~2 hours a day) so I didn't feel constrained at all. There are also a bar and a restaurant on the ground floor but I didn't try any of them. Now, about the room itself, I stayed in a deluxe room on the 4th floor. It had very high ceiling and was of decent size (~25m2), with two armchairs a very big bed (210cm length) and all the usual features that an hotel of this category provides (a shower and a separate tub, nespresso machine, slippers, safety deposit box, umbrella, trouser press...) but one point important to mention is the mini bar which is already included in the room rate (refilled once a day). The room was really quiet, the mattress extremely comfortable, and the tub large enough to indulge yourself with a relaxing bath without feeling tight like in many other hotels I have been to. Compared to the Hilton and Marriott hotels in Amsterdam, I would say that the Grand Amr\u00c3\u00a2th is the most convenient one if you need to get to the airport of the train station and its architecture is far more charming than the others. Nonetheless it lacks the modernism of the Marriott (inside not the facade of the Marriott which seems like a council estate) and the luxurious facilities of the Hilton (lobby, private pier, bar with outside seats and garden, but not the rooms which I personally think would need some refurbishment, the Amr\u00c3\u00a2th ones have higher standards) . Then it is a question of what are your priorities. If you like authenticity, old-fashioned style, and want to be 5min walk away from the train station, the Grand Amr\u00c3\u00a2th is the hotel I would suggest you to pick up!

First of all, this is NOT a luxury hotel. From the small dismal lobby, to the primitive, carpet-stained halls, to the creepy mis-matched furniture and decor....the place had an eerie/gloomy vibe and was thoroughly depressing. After several hours waiting for check-in time, we were finally shown to our tiny room on the 4th floor. It was smelly and dark...you had to stand on a platform to see out the small window. The hotel room was quickly monikered, \"prison cell\". Most of the service staff was pleasant, and we appreciated the efforts of the hotel manager, but this was ineffectual where it mattered; Our rooms were inexplicably unmade on 2 of the 4 days and we had an uncomfortable incident in the restaurant when our server was unwelcoming and abrasive.

The building still feels very much much like the former offices that it was. I'm usual all for preserving fascinating architectural features that give character and charm, but this did neither for me. It felt slightly depressing, plodding along the bureaucratic-feeling dingy corridors, and this carried on into the many rooms that face into a tiny interior courtyard. Dim on even the sunniest of days, despite the very high ceilings. The room itself conforms to 'boutique norms': thick velvet curtains, good linen, nespresso machine, etc.. The bathroom was narrow and uncomfortable. The only departure from the norm was the \"free\" mini-bar. Not being a heavy drinker I don't value this highly, but it is welcome not to have an obscene itemised charge for orange juice - although of course it's not really \"free\", because it's priced into room rate. The pool and steam room were nice with only me in them (can imagine it's full with say 4-6 guests) and I dislike hotels that make you walk from your room in your swimming stuff because there aren't any changing rooms in the spa/pool area. Like many Amsterdam hotels, bikes and vespas are available. Perhaps I should have used these because the only test I put to the service team was to get me a taxi which was delayed by 15 then another 20 mins - annoying since I could have walked 5 minutes to the station and picked up a taxi easily if they had just been more honest/used better judgement.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fantastic location for touring the City.\u201d", "Author": "Hgrieves", "ReviewID": "UR106613065", "Content": "Couldn't ask for more from a hotel for a weekend break in Amsterdam.

The exterior of the building is beautiful and has some beautiful public areas. The interior architecture is odd, likely due to it's history as an office building, leading to disjointed spaces and poor room layout (e.g. TV unwatchable from either the bed or seating area). The one benefit is very high ceilings and large windows which lead to a light, spacious feeling. The rooms are generally comfortable with nice beds and furniture. I thought the towels felt cheap and threadbare, which is unacceptable for a five star property. Luxury should be the name of the game. The toiletries were Lanvin and were of a nice quality. The service is poor overall. The entrance is up a long flight of stairs thus you'd expect, especially in a 5 star hotel, a bellman positioned at the bottom of the stairs. Not the case here so I got to lug our bags and kids up the stairs and into the lobby. Of all our trips in and out of the hotel during our four day stay, only once were we offered help up or down the stairs. There just don't seem to be enough bellmen on duty. Not five star service by any stretch of the imagination. The housekeeping is atrocious. The first day our room was not made up at all. We returned to the hotel at 8pm, tired after a day of sightseeing and the room looked just as we left it. No clean dishes, no coffee for the morning, no clean towels, etc. I went to see the manager and they sent up housekeeping. Not much of a solution for a five star hotel. Other chains I've stayed with that do have true five star hotels would have been mortified. The second day the room was made up but there were no clean dishes left for us, so again, I had to call down to have fresh cups, etc delivered. Disappointing. I called down to the concierge on the 2nd morning to try to arrange tickets to Keukenhof via the package advertised on their website, due to the timing flexibility it offered. I was told that couldn't be done and I'd have to go with the company that the hotel used (and wait 2 hrs for the next departure). I just went to the business centre and booked it myself. I can't think of a time when I'd been told by a concierge I had to use a particular service for anything, anywhere. Sure a concierge will often recommend something but they've always got some flexibility if you desire another service. Not at the Amrath! Loctionwise, the hotel is very handy to Central Station. If you are looking to visit things to the west side of the centre (Anne Frank house for example) it's a bit of a walk and if you are offended by the Red Light District you'll have to be alert to circumnavigate that. For my situation, I'd look to stay a little more central next time to cut down walking a bit. We wandered into The Grand Sofitel while out exploring and it looks to be much more to my taste. A fountain in their entrance courtyard caught the eye of my toddler so we went over to look and a bellman came to greet us and he told us that they had a nice garden and maybe we'd like to have lunch there tomorrow so our child could play after we ate. That is how five star hotels are run, with attentive people who go out of their way to attend to your obvious needs, even if you are not resident at their property (next time we will be, thanks Sofitel).

So the room is on the larger size but without view which i think does not make any sense. The cheaper room is smaller but with view, mine is bigger and more expensive but no view, extra euro for view.

I wasnt sure when i bought it since it was a last minute thing, and this hotel was on sale, had good reviews surprisingly and they were smart enough to throw in complimentary wifi and mini bar. I think the pictures looked better than the reality. When i first walked into the lobby, i felt like walking into those old churches and museums in Rome. I know those Rome churches is much older but i felt like walking into a hundreds of years old of building, literally. The wood trims that has been painted over and over again, old fashioned red carpet, old wooden bedroom doors, ancient looking lobby, and suddenly you walk into this one modern elevator, or the swimming pool and fitness center. I think thats kinda odd. My room in my opinion made me feel claustrophobic. First of all, no view so i have to close the blue busy print looking curtain the whole time pretty much, red busy print carpet, red wall paper with some golden leave print or something, topped with dark color furniture everywhere. Claustrophobic and misty feeling. And the room was hot too. Its about 35F outside but hot inside the room. I cranked up the AC to high fan with the lowest tempatature it had, i was still sweating every night. Bed wasnt too bad though. Bathroom was not bad, shower pressure was nice, toiletries was Lanvin - very nice.

Good sized TVs (two in the accessable room), coffee maker and free minibar added to the comfort zone, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Our rooms were next to each other and on the ground floor so no breathtaking views, but to have the confidence in our friend's ability to manage for himself in his room it was well worth the trade off. One small criticism, the towels. A five star hotel should be providing the fluffiest top quality towels, not thread bare with ragged edges. Come on, sort this out Amrath. Breakfast is not our meal but we dinned in the hotel mid week, impressed by the small contemporary menu. The tasting menu was fine and they managed to cater for a shellfish and pork free guest, so full marks there. The wine was ok, if a little unadventurous. However, they really need to improve the knowledge of their waiting staff. The young woman serving us was surprisingly inarticulate and didn't seem to know much about the food or wine, simply quoting what was on the menu. Not good enough for a 5 star experience and easily rectified. Room service provided us with late night burgers, good quality served piping hot in 20 minutes, and the bread and butter pudding with bannana and chocolate hit the spot. Bar staff, concierge, porters, receptionists were super efficient, smiles galore and courteous at all times. Be aware, this is not a modern hotel, no massive glass and steel lobby with branded gift shops or extravagant art. But none the less, a beautiful historical space full of the original marble, wood and stained glass from another age, detailing the history, oppulence and might of the great Dutch shipping company that built it. Breathtakingly beautiful. Saddly, one event did annoy me and it's worth knowing: We wanted to weigh up taking a cab v's public transport back to the airport. The concierge quoted us a \"hotel agreed rate\" of E45 and on refelction we chose that option. We went back and asked for a car to be arranged, only this time it was the porter at the desk who said it would be E50, for a bigger vehicle to manage the wheelchair and cases - fair enough. Except that when we got to the airport the driver wanted E58 - \"for a larger vehicle\"... poor and cheap. If there is an agreed rate for this journey it should be adhered to. Needless to say, the driver lost any tip they might have deseved for loading and unloading the luggage and chair.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, perfect location.\u201d", "Author": "Jossick", "ReviewID": "UR98899506", "Content": "Had a great stay at the Amrath for 4 nights.

We had two bookings ( the first a very cheap Standard Room with breakfast via agoda ) for 3 nights, then another booking for 7 nights ( Superior Room City View via expedia) after a weekend trip to Berlin. We arrived at the hotel about 10.30 am from a long flight and were able to checkin early. I mentioned that I was celebrating my birthday and had two bookings. I was immediately offered an upgrade for my first stay and also the opportunity to have same room for our return. Room 107. ( smoking) It was an excellent choice for us as the room over looked the canal and was at the back of the hotel, VERY quiet. After some great shopping in Amsterdam we were able to leave one very full suitcase at the hotel while we were in Berlin. On return we were given the same room as promised. We experienced only one problem while staying the second time. Some very noisy guests in the room next door arrived on the Friday evening ( our quiet sanctuary had been disturbed). It became clear that these people were up for a big weekend which would have meant an end to our enjoyment of the room. I complained to the concierge who immediately dealt with the situation in a very robust manner which we were very grateful for. We had no further disturbances. As I have now stayed at this hotel multiple times here is my general review. The Staff are friendly, discreet and efficient. The rooms are fabulous with high ceilings and the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Large baths with plenty of room for two. There are differing reviews on whether this is a 5 star hotel. If you are after large pretentious foyers with giant chandeliers and staff the fuss over you like your royalty stay somewhere else. If however, like me, you book a hotel for its convenience, location and quality of rooms/beds there is no better in Amsterdam. The amrath has a unique style with welcoming unpretentious staff. It is the perfect room to get over jet lag. We ate breakfast at the hotel when it was included in the room rate and chose to eat elsewhere when it was not included as there is plenty of choice nearby.

Having searched for a suitable hotel, we were glad we chose the Grand Hotel Amrath. First of all, the location is great - being on the waterfront, close to Central Station and all the tram services, as well as ideal for exploring the canals. From here you can walk to a lot of the sights like the Royal Palace, Dam Square, Anne Frank house, etc. The Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum are further afield - walkable for the keen and able, but better to take the short tram ride across the city. The hotel has a good ambience and, being the former Shipping House, is full of character and original art-deco features. We chose a Superior Deluxe Room, which was on the 3rd floor and a good size with an enormous bath/wetroom. The room was very quiet and the bed was one of the best that we have ever slept in (maybe the best!) for comfort. The minibar was free and re-stocked each day (though they did run out of white wine). However, this has to be offset against the cost of breakfast - good though it was, a bit steep at 25 euro each! Only negatives with the room, were a lightbulb that needed replacing (swiftly replaced after reporting) and the drainage from the shower was a bit slow. We ate out every night so cant comment on the restaurant (other than breakfast), but the staff were really friendly so suspect they would take good care of you for a meal.

We decided to try the restaurant in the hotel on the first night and it was excellent. It was so reasonably priced we certainly didn't expect the standard of food that we got. I ordered several courses too many but it was difficult to choose. I would say the highlights were the scallops, the lentil soup with sweetbread, and the beef. My husband enjoyed the veal with sweetbreads, the ravioli and the sea bream. The service was also excellent with the very friendly and helpful restaurant manager. The bar area is also good for snacks, with again very efficient and friendly service. Room service also good and reasonably priced. The pool and the sauna area was the great bonus for me though.

I then received an email from the company that said \"sorry, the hotel would not accept your reservation! \" What? Apparently there was a large IT conference taking place and they knew they could sell the room much higher than I was paying. So I got proactive and after speaking to the horrible rep at the booking company (cannot remember the name) I wrote to the President of all the Amraths, not expecting to hear a word for little ole me . But I had to release my anger and I was seething. To my surprise he wrote me the next day apologizing and agreeing it was not the way for a 5* property to act. He reinstated my reservation and had the manager at the Amrath write in addition- with an apology and confirmation. After reading all the bad reviews, I was constantly worrying about our stay, however, went ahead knowing it was for only a short time. When we arrived, two young men were being checked in and this was at 7:30am...they were told their \"jr suites \" would not be available until 3 or 4pm.

Very good dinner in the bar area; friendly bartender. SO...if you have complaints I would take the time to write to the company; giving a bad review is helpful for prospective guests but taking it to the top of the company just might change some of the problems the Amrath faces.

The price for the room was fairly expensive but I was willing to pay a price for a nice hotel. My travel agent booked our room for our family requesting a rollaway bed for our 2 yr old. Upon arrival they stated that there was a charge for the rollaway bed. I told them i did not want the rollaway bed if they were going to charge me. They then spoke amongst each other and offered us an upgrade and free rollaway bed. When we go to the room it was fine. The decor was nice and there was a window that opened all the way. But the room was not cleaned properly before our arrival. There were opened bottles of wine and water with the mini bar, dirty cups, and hair in the bathroom. In my opinion, for a 5 star hotel, it should be much cleaner than that. The concierge was very unhelpful. He could make no recommendations on restaurants in the area which seemed strange to me. Upon check out we were charged 50 euros a night for the rollaway bed. When I spoke to a manager to remove the charges they refused saying our reservation stated it was only for 2 adults and that we made no mention of a child as part of the reservation. It did not matter that I was told otherwise at check in. I DO NOT LIKE SURPRISE CHARGES!! I thought their demeanor over the situation was unprofessional. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for 5-star service! The only good thing about this hotel is the pool. However, the area is not maintained throughout the day. Dirty towels left on chairs for several hours and water cups left around pool area. Again, not a 5-star hotel.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and really nice staff\u201d", "Author": "MrandMrsSmith2009", "ReviewID": "UR83308154", "Content": "We booked this hotel as part of a secretsales web-site promotion.

We were initially concerned since the hotel looked to be a little farther out from the city center on a map but since it was within walking distance to Grand Central station, we thought it would still be an ideal location. It absolutely was the best location. We were close enough to walk into the city center and also so close to the train station that we could get to anywhere in Amsterdam with no problems. Additionally, since it was a little farther out from the center of the city, we were shielded from a lot of the noise coming from the partying in the streets. We happened to be there during their Queen's Day celebration so people were out and about in the streets around the clock. The location of the hotel sells it on its own but the accommodations were also top notch. We got a room right next to one of the canals so the view was spectacular. We had their buffet breakfast every morning and it was by far one of the best we had during our trip around Europe. We never had time to use the spa facilities but I did walk around and it was definitely worth it, if time permitted. One of the BEST things about the hotel room was the unlimited and FREE drinks in the room's mini-bar. They restocked it every day and it had mini liquor bottles, beer, juice soda, and soda water. Plus they had an excellent cappaccino machine with a variety of flavors. All of this was included in our hotel stay, which was amazing. The room was just the perfect size for two travelers with a queen sized bed, sitting area, desk, bar, and gorgeous jetted tub and marble shower. We would absolutely reccommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be close to Amsterdam's city center but far enough away that you can get some rest without the noise.

I have stayed in the Royal Hotel Amrath once before with another friend. I was so impressed at the originality/history of the building, and the quality of the staff, service and comfort levels, that I booked for my partner and I, to see if she shared my feelings about the place. The hotel is a short walk away from Centraal Station, and easily accessible. It provides easy access to the trendy Neiumarket area (10 mins stroll), China Town (10 mins stroll), Waterlooplein (20 mins stroll), and of course, no visit would be complete without at least a quick walk through the Red Light area (10 mins stroll). The trendy Jordaan area is a little further away (20/25 mins stroll). Liedseplein, Vondellpark and the Museumplien are walkable with a couple of 'Heineken' stops on the way. For the more adventurous, trams are available to every area from Centraal Station (5 mins). We found that during our stay, the hotel was ideally situated for what we wanted to do. We were given a beautiful room in the Old Director's Office area of the hotel on the second floor. The bedroom was delightful with traditional high Dutch windows letting in loads of natural light, and the view of the adjacent canal and houses was very picturesque. A 32\" flat screen TV was provided for entertainment, with internet based radio stations for music. A four poster king sized bed with crisp sheets ensured that we slept or relaxed comfortably. A complementary chilled minibar is also provided with some great glasses and Amrath placemats, so we took our turns at being the best bar staff in Amsterdam. I must say that my Wife serves a great Vodka and fresh orange! A Nespresso machine provided us with really tasty coffee or espresso shots. The bathroom was nothing short of both amusing and spectacular. It was built in a glass surround, inside the fabric of the room itself (the building is listed, so they couldn't alter some of the structure of it), so you could actually walk all the way around the outside of it! It has to be seen really to be fully appreciated. The bathroom had lovely backlit mirrors, a two person sunken bath, and a wet room with a rainforest shower head, and several side shower heads. The views from the bathroom were simply wonderful - we were watching the sun go down over Amsterdam, with our minibar drinks, sitting on the side of the bath soaking our feet after some serious exploring! The staff were attentive and efficient, always stopping to say hello or good morning/afternoon. Our decision is already made for our accommodation when we return to Holland again. We didn't quite figure out the air-conditioning situation, and it was really humid when we stayed. We slept with the window open on the last night and got mosquitoed - first time ever in Amsterdam, and I have been to Amsterdam over a dozen times! This is no reflection on the Hotel though!

We stayed here once before in June 2009 and had a marvelous experience. The Amrath is an easy five-minute walk from Centraal Station, or you can hop on any one of three buses that leave from in front of the Station and be deposited right outside the front door. It is an historic building that has been retrofitted, so it isn't a cookie cutter chain. The rooms have been fitted to suit the building, rather than the other way around. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by friendly staff, and advised that we had been upgraded to the Oriental Suite. When we were shown the space, we couldn't believe our eyes! This suite is larger than my last apartment, and included a rooftop terrace with amazing views of the city. The free mini-bar was wonderfully stocked with cold drinks, and it included champagne, perfect for ringing in my birthday celebrations at midnight. The spa facilities are luxurious and restful. The swimming pool is modern and has a lane where you can swim against the current in order to get your exercise. Unfortunately, the jacuzzi ladder was not in operation and we aren't spry enough to climb in over the side, but since there was a large jacuzzi in the suite we weren't overly fussed about this. We did not use the massage or wellness services, so we cannot comment on those. The bed at the Amrath is like sleeping on a cloud. Since my last visit, I had been looking forward to that soft, decadent bed again, and was not disappointed. Air conditioning was minimal, as could be expected in a modernised building, but our room was comfortable and cool enough for a good night's sleep. It was also, just like last time, super-quiet, so much so that the only thing that woke me the next morning was when my husband turned on the television in the living area of the suite. My one quibble with the suite is that the toilet area of the bathroom is only separated by a marble partition, and is completely open on the sides. When \"enthroned,\" one can see into the seating area of the bedroom (which means one can also be seen). A simple retractable screen would eliminate this difficulty, and would not harm the look of the space. It's not such a big deal when traveling with your partner, as I was, but offering privacy is never a bad idea. I cannot comment on the restaurants, the wi-fi or the concierge services, as we didn't use any of these. Whenever my husband asks if I wish to take a mini-break in Amsterdam, I reply \"only if we can stay at the Amrath.\" This trip only entrenched my opinion of the stellar accommodations provided by this truly unique hotel.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel but avoid breakfast\u201d", "Author": "maryGalway_Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR72782316", "Content": "We stayed in his hotel from 23/7 to 26/7/2010.

We didnt get to use the spa area as we forgot our costumes, but other guests seemed to think it was fantastic. While this does fit into my previous experience of 5* Hotels in europe, i honestly feel that 5 stars are given too freely in europe in comparison with what you get in the US and South Africa at a 5* establishment. I would rate this hotel as an upper 4*, but still great. A few tips. - dont forget the bottle opener - seriously! - Trams are easy, get an Iamsterdam card and you can hop on the number 2 that leaves from centraal station right the way through the Dam, Leidseplein to vondelpark. - hire a canal pedal bike (25% discount with iamasterdam) its awesome! - stock up on your own snacks for those times of need ;) - sit in the park and bicycle watch!

I was really looking forward to staying here, based on the reviews. I guess, though, that I'm just not that big a fan of the architecture. Interesting building from the outside and in the lobby, bar and restaurant areas, but once you get into the hallways and the rooms themselves, nothing special. I personally thought the hallways looked a little depressing. Hard to find your way around, also. Rooms were average size for european hotels. Very nice bathrooms, except for the fact that there's not a real door between the room & bathroom, just a frosted glass panel, and no separate door for the toilet area. Not much on privacy :) Beds were o.k., but not great (not a \"heavenly\" mattress, if you know what i mean, but o.k.). I wasn't that impressed with the free mini-bar either. There were one or two bottles each of small wine, beer and water bottles. As far as snacks, forget it. They provide one bag of stale peanuts (really stale!), and one very hard nougat bar. They really shouldn't advertise that they offer snacks in the mini-bar, with a selection like that. Free internet, but complicated system to get it. We had to call the front desk, and for some reason, they wouldn't give us a code over the phone - we had to wait for someone to show up with the code in writing. Which they didn't do for a half hour - which was too long for it to be useful in looking up where we were going that evening. The bar area was nice and cozy. Expensive of course, and the drinks weren't very good (gin & tonics). We didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment. I will say, it was nice and quiet, so that was greatly appreciated. The staff was competent but not what I would call friendly (not unfriendly, either, just disinterested.) As far as location, it's only five minutes from the train station, but being off to the east, it makes for a few minutes longer walk to central amsterdam attractions than some of the other central hotels.

Booked into the Grand Hotel Amrath following other reviews on this site. Have to admit my first impression on arriving at the hotel was muted. There is no formal lobby, reception in a side office and no seats (as a result of the fact that the hotel used to be a shipping company's office and the building is beautifully preserved). However, first impressions were quickly dispelled after meeting with staff and the room we were provided (an upgrade) was fantastic with views over the canal. Bed was very comfortable; facilities in the room generally very good - although storage space could have been better; lots of space in the room with a separate seating area, the bathroom (with separate shower and upmarket branded products) was perfectly suitable. The hotel also provided free WIFI to all guests and to top it off, a mini-bar (restocked daily withalcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks) and free to use. Room cleaniness and service was more than acceptable and the staff always helpful. Spa facilities were adequate, if not spectacular, with one of the Sauna rooms out of use. Only reservations I have is 1) the lack of any open areas for guest seating, meaning that if we did want tostep outside our rooms, we had to take ourselves out of the hotel. However, the hotel is within easy walking or sailing distance of many tourist spots. 2) The hotel's dining restaurant is over priced for the quality of the meal (although this seems to be a common theme in Amsterdam).

A short walk from Central Station, RLD, Nemo etc. Check In: No wait. Confirmed room and tax prepaid. CC for incidentals. Was escorted to room by concierge regaling me with historical detail of the building. The building is architecturally unique. I won't go into detail. There are many descriptions from others. The room was an inside unit overlooking the central courtyard. Nicely appointed but small and cramped. Having arrived late, I just went to bed. Day two I asked for a larger room w/city view....generally these rooms are at the side or rear of the property overlooking the canals and RLD. Nice enough but again, too small and the presence of cigarette ash on the window ledge required I move again next day. Very poor housekeeping. 2/10 This time I was more forceful and specific in my requests...I asked for an upgraded high(er) floor, larger room. I asked for 2 choices, and went to look prior to moving my bags in. Bingo - room 3 was a nice largish room and a much larger bathroom. The rooms are furnished in a modern old fashioned way....textiles and funky wallpaper give an almost period feel. It's ok and comfortable enough but I prefer modern. The coffee machines are temperamental and I had issues with all of them. The first one leaked water everywhere, and the other two would work intermittently. However, the ability to make coffee in the room is a bonus these days, and I tracked down the provisioner on my floor, and obtained more of the single serve coffee pods the machines use. 7/10 Inclusive minibar - a nice feature for the alcohol drinkers, I was very happy with the 4 bottles of water and two soft drinks. Also there is room to stash your own fridge swag, rolls, cheese, Coffeemelk, fruit etc. I dined in. 7/10 Wifi: Free but somewhat unstable. The third room I was in worked fine. Kudos 7/10 Other amenities: Spa / Pool: Available but did not use. Bathroom: Modern, clean lines, nice large tube, very good rain shower, good personal care products towels etc. 8/10 Bedding: Comfortable king bed, quality pillows, sheets duvet etc. Actually managed some good sleep. 8/10 What's close by: Easy access to everything AMS has to offer. The excellent tram system terminal is right at the Central Station. Some of the best art and architecture in Europe. A delight indeed. Safety: Big city awareness required, but the central area is very safe. Tourists are targeted of course, but generally the worst that happens is you are overcharged. Conclusion: Overall an OK stay. I don't think they have any bad rooms, but politely asking for an upgraded location, or larger bathroom would probably bring a positive result. You never know what a polite request will bring. I have had good upgrade results in AMS. The location was quiet, and the staff were pleasant enough. Stay again? Maybe but rate dependent. AMS Hotel prices fluctuate..one week the NH chain is the better value, sometimes not. This property maybe an acquired taste and overall I prefer the 4* Movenpick.

We had a standard double room which was fully pre-paid (no refund, not something I normally do) and it cost approximately E180 a night, so not cheap. The hotel is well located, about a 7 minute walk from the main railway station and close to many of the bars and restaurants on the east side of the City. Amsterdam is a small city with excellent transport, so nothing is really too far away. Check in was pretty slow. The reception is in a tiny separate office off the small lobby and it was a bit like waiting to see the school principal in getting served - it was very quiet when I checked in, so I don't know how they would cater with a crowd. There is no doubt that the building is the star as others have commented. It really is wonderful and one of the few hotels I have actually spent time wandering around just to look at the architecture. The layout is like a rabbit warren and it is very easy to get lost. I went to use the business centre on one evening and got completely lost - there are no signs to it at all - and had to go ask the concierge for directions (it is actually hidden in the former walk in safe). The hotel room was very nice, with high ceilings, comfy beds and a very nice bathroom, with great shower and bath. We didn't eat in the hotel, although the restaurant looked quite pleasant it was very expensive and there are too many other options for eating nearby. The bar was pleasant and we did have a few drinks there! The staff were uniformly friendly and, being Amsterdam, everyone speaks very good English. The indoor pool was a bonus in the cold February weather. Overall, this place is worth the expense, although having been there once, I would probably stay somewhere cheaper next time. This was my third visit to Amsterdam and it remains one of my favourite cities. It is very laid back, very pretty and great to get around.

The room renovation was fabulous-bathroom is very modern, ceilings are high, the bed was reminiscent of the Westin's heavenly beds. We had a problem with the Wi-Fi access but they sent up a manager and somehow it got resolved. The concierge helped us find a restaurant that served rijstaffel and gave us a map showing us how to either walk or take a tram (get the one-day tram ticket if you're going to sightsee, it's well worth it). The concierge also was honest about the fact that renting bikes from the hotel cost a lot more than renting from the company a block away that provisions them. I wouldn't get breakfast there -- it's pretty pricey, and you'll do better to walk into town and find a bakery. The restaurant in general looked expensive so we only went to their bar for a cup of tea before we left (also expensive, but the setting was very elegant).

I mention this because I'm surprised that anyone would rate this less than four stars baring some glaring oversight on the part of the hotel staff. I've stayed in places from a Ritz Carltons to a hostel with shared rooms, so I have a pretty wide perspective here. First, a note to my fellow American travelers. Yes, you may find the rooms at the Grand Amrath a little small, but do realize that this is typical for Europe. Ergo, I recommend suspending some expectations that your stay in beautiful Amsterdam at the Grand Amrath will be just as it would be at a comparable hotel in America. I especially would like to point out the irony of a previous commenter from New York City complaining that the closets are too small. You cannot fault a hotel for being representative of a culture on the whole. Just . . . relax. So again I would like to say that this is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. My stay was in August, which I learned during my stay was the month that the majority of Amsterdam closes up shop and goes on holiday. Therefore the hotel therefore was very quiet. But no bother, my partner and I went with the flow and adjusted our plans according and still managed to have a wonderful time. My partner and I stayed on the ground floor just next to the bar and we had a view of the canal. Again, it was a quiet room. The heavy curtains, when pulled closed, blocked out any sunlight -- so well that in the absence of any sun, we accidentally slept in to 11 am. No worries, we were on vacation after all. The free minibar was a welcomed bonus and was restocked daily. Two other highlights were the bed and the shower. The first was incredibly plush and we had three relaxing nights worth of sleep. The second, the shower, was one of those rain shower heads, which is liken to taking a shower in a waterfall. Since Europe is not known for its showers with heavy water pressure, this was an unexpected extra frill. I went to bar one night for an after dinner drink, which was lovely, but did not eat any of the food at the Grand Amrath, so I cannot speak for that. But I should point out that if anyone would find fault with the food, do keep in mind that one doesn't usually go to a hotel for the food. And while I ate well in Amsterdam, it's a city that's not know for its cuisine either.

I was looking for bright lights and a grand reception with a sumptuous marble floor and a counter full of eager check in staff, but this as not to be. After going up the few steps to the hotel lobby walking on some red carpet that needs a clean I entered the lobby with my partner. The lobby was dark with lights which were dim, like you were taken back to the old days. On my right was a small desk for the concierge. After about 20 seconds, Roland the concierge emerged. He directed us to my left to another room where there was a desk where two ladies were sat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was check in. Roland supervised our check and advised us that we had been upgraded to a four poster room. He also advised us that he had prepared our tours and everything was ready. I had prearranged the tours with the concierge via e-mail from England as we only had two nights in Amsterdam. Roland took us to our room through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like corridors and up in a vintage elevator to the first floor where we were given a lovely 4 poster bedroom with a very nice bath room. My only negative comment about the bathroom would be that the shower door and tolilet were too close too each other as the door could not open fully as the toilet was opposite. In my e-mails I had asked Roland to arrange for a fresh cream sponge cake with fruit to be provided on arrival for our anniversary. It was in the room on arrival but turned out to be a fruit tart. I did comment on this the next day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c feeling very guilty about doing so as Roland had been brilliant. Roland noted our comments. About two hours later, a knock at the door said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153room service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I opened the door to find that Otto, the other concierge had bought a fantastic chocolate mouse cake to compensate for our disappointment. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, in any hotel. The concierge service was very caring and attentive. Breakfast was expensive at 25 Euros each. Dinner at the Seven Seas was lovely. I still maintain that the hotel is a bit dark overall and the doors are very heavy. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this hotel is suited to wheelchair users due to the heavy doors. Whether you like this hotel or not will depend on your taste, I like glamorous, bright and luxurious.

Could not have wished for a better hotel... immaculate, clean, sophisticated, comfortable. It's the little touches that makes the Amrath special. The welcome note from the manager, the welcome gift- a nice delftesque till of waffles, umbrella in the room, the complimentary mini-bar, the egyptian superb cotton for the bed sheets, the big windows looking over the harbour from your room, getting BBC World and Sky News in the room, the bathrobes, feather pillows of top quality. A hotel truly home from home when you want to go away, have work things to sort. Pure class. They had made a minor mistake on my bill, where I had been charged for breakfast when it was included in my booking this was swiftly dealt with. This was probably down to me forgetting my room number at breakfast as I memorised how to get to my room by route rather than number probably because I had a lot on my mind with work. The staff are friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. You are left in peace to go about your business but when you do need to ask or query something it is sorted right away. The bathroom was great, the Lanvin toiletries came in handy as I forgot to pack some. The bath was big and drench shower very refreshing. Plenty of towels all decent size, nice material and fresh. I forgot my security code for my in room safe, and one quick call to reception and a manager came up with a sophisticated PDA to reset the same. I nearly could not fly home as had locked my passport in safe! The internet connection in the room was tricky to set up but that was down to Windows 7 default settings not being geared to logon to their system. Not the Amrath's fault simply needed a tweak in System Settings on Encryption. If there had to be one negative it would be that no fresh real milk was in the room to go with the Nespresso machine and nearby shops do not seem to stock real milk. I only say this as normally UHT is common in all hotels, but when you have a fresh coffee machine in your room it would have just made all the difference to have real milk not the artificial stuff. Though this is not a criticism, simply this hotel is par excellence on everything and no other hotel in amsterdam can even come close.

They have some very small rooms, but also some big once in the same price range, so my advice is to try change your room if it's really small. If your room is on the busy street side, that could be a bit noisy. It's suppose to be a 5 star hotel but i would give it 4 \"real\" stars. Breakfast is very generous, fresh and good, but pricy (25 euro). The serving staff at breakfast has the unpleasant habit to stand in the middle of the area and speak loudly. Apparently the restaurant management haven't noticed in the last 2 years since my first stay in the Amrath. The hotel staff, except the receptionists seems to be lacking training about simple things. For instance, I was taking a shower when someone entered the room and started refilling the minibar despite the fact that the shower door was open and he could clearly hear the shower running i.e. someone was in the room. In my experience in other hotels in Amsterdam, service level is generally low and the Amrath is deffinitely not making an exception.

The decor is lavish (altho if you look closely u can tell some things are old and should be replaced). The hallways are red and winding, reminding me of that movie, The Shining. Anywho, the best things about the hotel: 1. Free mini bar - restocked daily 2. High ceilings in the rooms 3. The coffee maker is similar to the Keurig ones 4. It has a pool (one of the few hotels in AMS that have it and I somehow managed to NOT use it. Regret) 5. The room is non-smoking, but they provide an ashtray. I think when they say non-smoking, they only mean cigarettes.... Cons: 1. Cannot open windows by urself, must call and have someone do it with a long stick. (the windows are very high) 2.

We paid for a Junior Suite (approx \u00c2\u00a3250 per night). We arrived at the hotel after flying into Schipol. The train from the airport to Central Station is really easy, 13 Euros for 2 and takes about 10 minutes. It's then litterally a 5 minute walk from the station to the hotel. You can't miss the hotel, it's so grand and right on the corner of the road. We got checked in really quickly and were told we were upgraded to a City View Junior Suite (I double checked and these rooms were more expensive, just for the view). Staff were really friendly and the guy that took our bags to our room was really nice, told us about the hotel and where things were. The room was one of the biggest we have stayed in! The ceilings were almost the height of our house! So big that there is electric curtains in the rooms. We were right on a cornder so had large windows (that open) to the front and to the side of the hotel. An extremely comfy bed. Probably a little lacking in storage space, there was one cupboard but not much hangers, but it was fine. Large TV with various channels including BB1 and BB2. Free wireless internet, which could be quite slow at times. Nespresso coffee machine and kettle. I have to say, the free mini bar was great and it was re-stocked every day. Being in a Junior Suite you also get a half bottle of champagne to. Red and white wine, couple of chocolate bars, peanuts and pringles, plus beer, vodka, whiskey, bacardi, brandy & gin, fresh orange, water, coka/diet coke, tonic and red bull. This made up for the expensive drinks in the hotel bar. We had a vodka and lemonade and a jack daniels and coke and it was 19,50! Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate and one night we opted to get it delivered the next morning. Went for the full fry up and it cost 27,50 EACH plus a 7,50 tray charge. I think that's the most expensive breakfast we have ate and to be honest, it wasn't all that great. The hotel restaurant did always look quite and probably because of the price, but with so many options so close to the hotel there wasn't a need to eat there. You are just 5 minutes away from Chinatown/Red light area that is stacked full of bars/restaurants. Although we did get room service a couple of times, it's 24 hours with 2 different menus for the time of day and the food was really nice. The local bitterballen shrimp or veal are really tasty. The hotel's spa area is great. We went down 3 times, twice we were on the only ones there but on our last night it was a bit busier. The pool is quite small but nice for a relaxing swim, there's a jacuzzi, a steam room and 3 saunas - all great. There is also sun loungers for you just to relax and read a book. We didn't get any treatments but there are a lot of options, although quite expensive. There is also a gym that looked good. Apart from the breakfast cost, there is nothing I could say badly about this hotel, it really was great and worth paying the money for. Note that you have to pay a City tax charge when you depart, 5% I think it is.

A modern lovely bathroom with bath and shower, an extremely comfortable bed with top class linen and in all our travels we have never had a minibar that is complimentary and restocked every day. This small innovation - the cost of which may be hidden in the tariff is a marvelous innovation which makes one feel so much at home. The location of the hotel couldnt be better. It is a stones throw away from Central station, the hop on hop off canal boat, the commercial sector and the famous red light district. Everything of interest is within walking distance or public convenience to get you from point A to point B. The in-house restaurant offers outstanding food and is good value for money. Our meal there has to be one of the best meals we have had for a while. We have travelled widely and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone coming to Amsterdam. If we have to make any criticism, with difficulty - we would recommend that the dark wall colours in the passageways makes it appear a little oppressive and maybe should be a lighter colour, however this is really scratching the barrell for criticism.

Saved us a fortune - and its great just to be able to grab a coke and not have that annoying feeling that you are being totally ripped off. Same with the coffee. That in its self just makes you feel so much more relaxed :) Bed really was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Mini Bar was restocked daily - without fail, as was the Nespresso Coffee machine and the shampoo etc in the bathroom. Um water pressure in the shower wasnt that great for me - but other reviews have said otherwise so, probably just me. Oh and just a note the mini fridge is big enough to keep food in (ham, cheese, mayo or whatever) and leave a note and a couple of euros and the fridge will be stocked how you like :) Staff were super friendly (I find the Dutch the friendliest people I have met on my travels) and always greeted us with a smile. Our room was kept spottless, and at around 7pm there was a knock at the door to see if you wanted any refills or milk for the coffee machine (I don't think you can have your bar restocked again without paying). Or if they could do anything for you. If you don't want to be disturbed - just leave the 'do not disturb' sign out and you won't hear a peep. TV - for the English reading this then you have BBC1 and 2 (great for Match of the day) BBC World News, CNN, there were some film channels that had English movies on and MTV Germany the only music channel - I think. Hotel is about 5 walk from Centraal Station and all the Trams. You can walk everywhere in Amsterdam, but trams are just a stone throw away. Overall great hotel and great staff - In my experience.

The customer service was incredible, absolutely 5 star and on par with US 5 star hotels (Dutch customer service is horrendous at best, so never a base for comparison). For my grand entrance as a bride the concierge even vacated the lobby! Unfortunately, housekeeping does not keep up. I had forgotten to request synthetic bedding (I am allergic to down), and requested synthetic pillows and a duvet at 11pm when we got to the room. It took the front desk a while to locate them, which didn't bother me at all since it was 11pm and I knew nobody from housekeeping would be present at this time. Unfortunately no duvet covers could be located. The next day we got married and got back to our hotel room at 1.30am. What a surprise to see that the room was cleaned very carelessly, and there were still NO duvet covers! Now THAT I did mind! A lot. Interestingly enough, this time it took the front desk only 5 min. to locate duvet covers (where were they last night then?!?!?!). The next day I mentioned this to the front office manager who was extremely apologetic, and gave us a wonderful gesture of a bottle of prosecco, a fruit plate and a hand written note. Now that's great customer service! Unfortunately, housekeeping managed to screw up once again (by this time it was just plain funny) as they had taken my wet robe and hung it up in such a way that it was still wet the next morning (I had put it in the bath with the used towels to be changed for a fresh one. Apparantly I didn't deserve one!!!!). This is pretty incredible if you are a customer who had made a point of asking if the room could be cleaned with extreme care that day. Lastly, we had a connecting door (locked of course) and because of that we could hear the conversation of our next door neighbours literally. As we were on a late schedule and they on an early one, that was quite inconvenient. I want to finish with saying that I'd recommend the Amrath to anybody looking for a great experience and appreciates customer service and that we are already planning our return trip!

Very classy and a great location. First, the hotel's proximity to Central Station - a 5-minute - is a huge plus. You can take the train from the airport and save a lot of money upfront.. Every Tram (trolley car) and inter-city bus we wanted starts at Central Station. Second, the staff was consistently very friendly and very helpful. Third, we loved our canal-side room. It put the beautiful Waals/Eilandsgracht Canal right outside our window. Our room, with high ceilings, was very comfortable with the climate control. Fourth, the free mini-bar was kept well stocked and is a great money-saving extra that we've not seen elsewhere. Two caveats. During our stay outdoor temperatures did not go above the mid-80's (F). We don't know how comfortable the climate control would have made our room had it been really hot outside; it's not the air conditioning that Americans used to. Second, I found the mattresses very comfortable and slept very well. But my wife would have done better with a firmer mattress, which the hotel does not provide. Breakfast at the hotel is indeed expensive, but there are plenty of nearby alternatives that are reasonably priced. Things to Do: Get a 24-hour or multi-day tram/bus pass - great savings and gives you flexibility in seeing a great city. The Tourist Information Office (one is right across the street from Central Station) is a great source of information, suggestions and time-saving tickets; we thought the wait of 10 minutes or more to be serviced was worthwhile. Great , convenient day trips outside Amsterdam: Bus ride to Edam/Vollendam/Marken Island (rent a bike in Edam and pedal to the harbor (North Sea) and dike.

They were very accommodating and were able to allow us to our room by 10.30am, even though check in at 2.00pm. When we were leaving we also appreciated the booking out time of 12 noon. We were again able to leave our bags all day with them until our evening flight. Both these accommodations made our 5 day trip full and unhindered. Location is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the central station. Train ride was 13 minutes and only 3.80 euro....why take a taxi? Although on a main road in front of the port it was not noisy, and as you exit the entrance and turn left you are in a small road along a canal, great bar just over a bridge and in 3 minutes you are in the main canals/ shopping. There were simple touches in the hotel such as the free mini bar, free rental of DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the complimentary slippers and robes and the nepresso machine rather than sachets of coffee which made staying a pleasure. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms very clean, the bathroom sparkled. A nice touch was that there was a second knock on the door in the evening to enquire if you needed anything, like extra coffee and we found that when we weren't in at that point we would return to a tidied room. The spa and pool is beautiful and allow a sense of luxury. The pool has a power jet (I had not experienced this in any other hotel pool). It is a great addition to a small pool where most people are just relaxing. It allows you to have a swim if the pool is busy with guests or children playing, but also allows you to swim constantly rather than continuously turning even when alone in the pool. The gym is not big, but adequately equipped.

The breakfasts were too expensive for our wallets (25 euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) but to have coffee, orange juice and buying a croissant earlier was fine, or going out to the many places to eat for breakfast was easy. We found a good place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Pancake Bakery at Prinsenstraat, Along the Canal Belt, not far....doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look anything from the outside but they are busy.

We have put great value for money because we were able to book as a Top Secret hotel...so it was great value for money. The going room rate for superior deluxe is 450 euro's....out of our price bracket...but that was what they displayed in the room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure many people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay that.

We had a deluxe double - one level up from basic, can't remember exactly what it was called. Our room was totally beautiful with a great view of the canal. We didn't bring our toddler but if we had, the room had a nice feature of a wooden door between us and the large hallway to the bathroom. So, we would have put his crib in that hallway and it would have provided us with almost a suite with two rooms so we could put him to bed before us. Another small note to those sharing rooms - at least in our room there was that wooden door but the door to the bathroom itself was a very stylish frosted glass door that didn't seal. The bathroom was quite long so it may not be an issue, but if you are very uncomfortable with the potential of bathroom noises, you might want to ask whether your room will have a partition door between the bathroom and the bed section. I was traveling for business but brought my husband for some QT as well, and it fit the bill perfectly on both counts. Free wireless worked great in the room and the business center let me print something without a problem. Free minibar was a nice perk with plenty of water, chocolate bar etc. The hotel is unique - absolutely incredible architecture and rooms were very stylishly appointed. We agreed this was probably the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in, and we've stayed in some really nice ones around the world. It doesn't have the wonderful but bland look of a starwood, rather its the same modern style but using really interesting wall and curtain fabrics, very high ceilings, etc. The hotel is not for those who want the four seasons style hotel with a huge, elegant marble lobby, 7 high speed elevators and all that. Rather, it is luxury in a very special, boutique hotel style with a very small but personal lobby, one quaint yet very functional elevator, etc. The breakfast was wonderful with a nice assortment of pastries, cold cuts, eggs, cereals, juices, etc. Everything has wonderful style at this hotel, down to the modern nouveau white china. We even saw a celeb at breakfast! The location is good, with plenty of nice restaurants in easy walking distance. It is a bit across town from some of the museums but not too far, and the trams at the central station are very close so these make getting anywhere easy (they are located across a bridge so are just a touch far if you are handicapped or have trouble walking). Also if you take any day trips out of the city, which we did, this was very convenient. And I highly recommend taking the train from the airport to central station, which saves you about $75 in cab fare. When you walk to the hotel, take a left out of the train station, staying on that side of the street and then cross a later bridge, I think its the third bridge - don't cross the first bridge right away and then walk left because it is a longer diagonal.

One day it was down right cold. No screens on the window shouldn't stop you because I believe there has never been a bug in Amsterdam. In fact it is hard to find a negative thing to say about the city at all. As for comments on a rude staff; you must have been in a bad mood and projecting, because the Dutch are the nicest and most accommodating people on Earth. We didn't have any problems to complain about but we did have them find us new reservations on short notice (1 day) and cancel our old ones. We'd ask for help on routes through the city, purchasing tickets for several things, and their personal suggestions just about everyday and were always happy with the service. The free minibar was restocked fully everyday, no delays in cleaning or restocking. Housekeeping accidentally took the insurance card we used to keep the master suite power on (your power goes off when you take your rm key out of a holder, but any card will prevent this), but before we could call too complain,there was a knock and a very apologetic maid. I hate room service prices and theirs are on par for Europe, but the portion of the hamburger was huge and it was more like a large steak on a wonderful bun. Loved the espresso machine! The room was just the feeling we wanted to accompany our stay, and the hotel is a bit spooky in the best of ways. We stayed on the top floor canal side and it was the least spectacular room offered. It is hard for me to write that because it was very spectacular. The room, although one of their smallest, was huge and felt like a suit with sitting area that was never used because we had two large window ledges that became the preferred seating due to the beautiful view. We stayed at the Omni Chicago in a corner suite on the way home and payed more , but it felt no bigger and was much less attractive. Not to mention they left some of our luggage in a taxi and argued with us about our reservations. Comparing the two,the omni in chicago looks like a motel 6 and The Grand Amrath is in a class all it's own. I believe they live up to their name because everything was truly grand, much like the city itself. If you don't know, Amsterdam has so much culture and art to offer (Rembrandt and Van Gough's collections, Anne Frank and Rembrandt's homes, and Holland itself has a very rich and interesting history, not to mention I am a fan of the naughtier sides of the city ). In fact it is our favorite European city. We prefer the views, the people, and the art. It is much nicer to visit the personal collections of different artists than to try and cram the Louvre into a schedule. And, the smells are much more pleasant! I don't mean the smoke, which btw is not in your face and neither is the sex. If you aren't into those things, don't let their existence stop you from visiting. You can avoid those aspects easily as long as you don't go looking for them. Anyway, the city smells nice, unlike Paris.

We were offered a room on the canal side but were told it wouldn't be available until later in the afternoon, so we opted instead for a room facing the front of the hotel. We were on the top floor, and noise was not a problem at all, either from the street or from the corridor. In fact, this hotel was the quietest we have ever stayed in. We never heard any noise whatsoever from the hallways. Any problems we had were immediately taken care of. On Easter Sunday, for example, the room hadn't been cleaned when we returned at 5 p.m. We called to let them know, and the maid came up in about ten minutes, whereupon we went down to the pool and relaxed for about an hour or so. When we returned to the room, it had been cleaned. I'm writing this letter now, because I'm shocked at the negative reviews of this hotel.

Let me start by the good things about this hotel and I will then indicate why I feel this is not a 5 star hotel. First, they have the most comfortable beds. The hotel is near major sites (Ann Frank house, red light district, china town, etc..). The hotel has a lot of character to it and is one of the stays that will stay in your memory. The hotel looks and feels like a war castle. The rooms are very huge and almost feels like staying at a small apartment. The room has a huge walk in area with the bathroom door access and another door that leads in the room. And there is a complemetery mini bar in the room (soda, juice, alcohol). We did not use the pool/spa, but walked in and it really looks nice. Now, let me talk about the bad things and why I think this is not a 5 star hotel. This not a luxery hotel. The chair in the lobby are very old, doors, windows are old with no screens. It was really hot when we stayed there and the hotel does not have air conditioning. They brough us a small old fan in the room, but what kind of 5 star hotel does not have air conditioning? So, be prepared if you stay there in summer time. The other disapointing thing was the staff. Maybe this is a dutch culture, here is how I would describe them: they are nice to you, but not very friendly. They defenitly do not cater to you like 5 star hotels in U.S. Other dissapoinments, NO pay per view movies, you can get a DVD player for free at the lobby, but you have to bring your own movies :). I was also disapointed in the room service, I called around 9 PM and they had run out on all the 4 food items on the menu. I could only order salad. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel either. Lots of stains in the bathroom and furnuture in the room. Overall, I do not give them 5 stars for the negetive reasons I mentioned.

The hotel is in fact an old office building of Dutch maritim companies. The building is maintained in his original style (art deco), and is quite unique.

The pool is one of the best hotel pools I have used, ok it is small but there was rarely anyone in it. We made sure we used this after a days pounding the streets sightseeing.

The Dining Room looked very festive & retained much of the original architecture features. The other great feature is the hotel pool & health club. It was located deep in the basement but was fully modernised with good size swimming pools, 2 dry saunas & 2 steam rooms as well as a large chill out area.

Our only complaint would be on the last night they decided not to refill the bar. Not sure if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because they had early Christmas break or the fact that we were drinking their bar dry. Still it was nice while it lasted.

The two adjoining rooms did not have the beautiful wood paneling, but it was well decorated and had the same modern features. Coming from the US, you come to expect a 5 star hotel to have a grand spacious lobby. In Amsterdam, because the buildings are very narrower, the lobby/reception area is very small. Also, the hallways don't look spectacular and there are many doors to pass through to get to the elevator. These are not negative remarks about the hotel. It's just different and something to appreciate because it was once a Shipping House. The advantage of this Shipping House is that the walls are VERY well insulated. You won't hear your neighbor above, below or beside you. Some final points about the hotel: - Breakfast is 25 euros, but well worth it. They have a large selection of quality food - meats, cheeses, fruits, breads of different grains, hot and cold foods. - Wellness center is well equipped with everything you would expect. You have thick robes and slippers in every room. - Bathroom is spotless. The most spotless I have seen at any hotel. No signs of aging and not a trace of mold anywhere. - They use 4-ply toilet paper!

This being our first trip to Amsterdam choosing accommodation was a bit like sticking a tail on the donkey, but overall I felt pleased that we had decided to stay at the Grand Amrath. The booking was made through last minute .com. The whole reservation process was smooth and easy, payment made prior to arrival. There is a quirky reception room to check in on arrival, the staff were very cheerful friendly and helpful.I paid an extra \u00c2\u00a325 per night for a room upgrade; this gave us a queen size bed and a huge, fabulous bathroom. A priority for me when staying away from home is to equal the home comforts or better them if possible. Next on the list is to have peace and quiet and undisturbed sleep. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in. The room was immaculately cleaned and the maid service first class. One of the pleasures of staying was to have full use of the contents of the mini bar included, replenished each day free of charge.Use of the substantial room safe was also complimentary. We stayed on a room only basis leaving the hotel in the morning returning later in the evening. Breakfast is 25 euros each, an evening meal looked to be around the 40 euro each. Walk until you are opposite the railway station, staying on the same side of the road as the hotel and you come to an excellent breakfast bar. Double egg on toast with all the trimmings costs 7 euro. The only disappointment I had with the hotel was the actual location of the room. It was situated on the first floor in the middle of the building; the view from the window was of a wall and a flat roof with sky lights. Daylight entering the room was limited. I did request a high floor; quiet room with a view when booking with last minute.com. I also asked at reception if we could be moved to a room on a high floor with a canal view, only to be told that would only be possible after the first nights stay and if we chose to move rooms there would be an extra charge of 40 euros. I felt this was sharp practice and as we were only staying three nights using the hotel purely for a base it was not worth the hassle. Hence my rating of four stars not five. Viewing the exterior of the Hotel canal view rooms are obviously at a premium. There are a vast amount of rooms facing a busy main road, something to consider when making a reservation.

I arrived at the hotel for our four night stay, (a reunion with an old American friend), on March 19 and was greeted by a welcoming reception staff. I was guided to our room by a bellman who gave me a history of the building, formerly offices for a shipping company, it's an unusual piece of architecture both inside and out. The first thing I noticed about our room, #109, was the dramatically high ceiling and wonderfully large windows with long, extraordinarily long, floor length drapes. Unfortunately our view from these terrific windows, (which could have done with a good clean), looked out onto the back of the hotel and the rubbish bins. The room was stylishly decorated but unfortunately there was very little floor space. They managed to squeeze in a small table and two chairs along with the King-size bed but the room felt cramped. There was space to move about, but just. Even thought the room was small it was packed with lots of fun extras. The 'complimentary mini-bar' was a first for me. They restock it daily so we emptied it nightly. We stashed stuff away just so they would replenish the entire thing. Sounds cheeky, I know, but when we moved to a different hotel for the last three days of our holiday we had a boatload of complimentary supplies to take with us. The closet/wardrobe contained a safe, coffeemaker, kettle, plenty of glassware, cups and saucers, and an umbrella, (really useful, it rained or snowed every day we were there). The coffeemaker with its selection of espressos, cappuccinos and teas, also restocked daily, was a real treat. The bathroom was large with a ginormous tub and separate shower stall. There was ample counter space and dual sinks. The bathroom amenities were of good quality/assortment and the towels were large but unfortunately not very soft. The bathrobes are a nice touch, but again, not really comfortable... maybe it's the detergent they use. The service, across the board, was top notch... everyone was smiling and friendly at all times. The staff is the very best thing about this hotel. There was a superior level of service throughout the property. It may be the best hotel staff I've ever encountered. I can't comment on the food service because we didn't eat in the hotel, (nor did we drink at the bar), although there is a substantial room service menu available 24 hours. Breakfast was not included in our room rate and at $40/\u00c2\u00a320 per person we couldn't be bothered trying it. The hotel offers a gym and a pool. The pool is quite small and when we visited it was filled with children so I decided against swimming... I have a thing about kids and public pools, I mean, might as well just pee directly on me. I'm confident that room #109 is not the best accommodation at the Amrath but it was still an enjoyable stay all the same.

The rooms are lovely with beds to die for. Very large and comfortable. We had the free mini bar option which was very welcome.

Everything about the hotel was fantastic, it oozed understated glamour. I was the old shipping house and a lot of the original features are still there today. When we found the hotel, (5 mins from Centraal Station) we were very impressed, it's an impending building with flags flying! It has one of the revolving doors and as soon as you walk in the porter takes your bag and directs you to the reception room. I loved reception, you are asked to take a seat and it's very relaxing. We were then shown to our room which was totally sumptuous and gorgeous. I have stayed at the Barbizon Palace (just around the corner and also 5*) I have to say they have now got serious competition on their hands. It's the small touches that make all the difference. They have a modern Nespresso coffee machine which is so much better than the granulated stuff in other hotels. The mini-bar is complementary, its well stocked with 4 different spirits, a small bottle of red and white wine, plenty of soft drinks and water, a toblerone and a box of peanuts. The turn-down service is great, the maid restocks the coffee and any products from the bathroom and also delivers a weather report for the following day. It has a lovely looking restaurant which we never made because there are so many nice places to go in Amsterdam. We didn't try breakfast either as it seemed a bit pricey for what you got. I will definately book this hotel the next time we stop in Amsterdam.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, beatiful rooms, perfect for a long weekend\u201d", "Author": "Crispo1974", "ReviewID": "UR10530564", "Content": "I travelled with my girlfriend for my birthday on October 24th and had a great stay.

We were met by the concierge who imediately took our bags and the check-in was quick and easy. We stayed in room 408 which has a great view of the city. The room was stunning - king size bed, great bathroom, wireless, flat screen tv, english plug , free minibar, robes etc. Bed turned down at night with tomorrows weather report. The Spa part of the hotel was not open (Due Dec 07) but didn't notice any noise. Use the concierge service, they were very helpful and expect nothing in return ( they booked a river cruise, a restaurant and a taxi for us) (Taxi was Euro 55 to the airport - trains cancelled on our return date !!!) The main part of Amsterdam is no more than a 10 min walk and its a pleasant walk back after a long day wandering. They have a nice restaurant (we didn't eat in) and a good bar (lots of smokey wood) the only negative and i'm being picky here.. the waiter 'topped up' my girlfriends wine glass and we got charged for 2 glasses, like I said i'm being picky.

It was head and shoulders above any other hotel in Amsterdam (we visited quite a few of them, and have previously stayed in the Radisson). Even though we were, according to the hotel map, one of the smallest rooms, the room was beautiful, similar to the one shown in the picture on their website. There were large windows and very good quality fixtures and fittings, and floor to ceiling curtains that totally blacked out the light and meant the room was also nice and quiet, especially for a hotel situated within walking distance of everything in the city centre. The bed was particularly large and comfortable, with lots of pillows and crisp white linen replaced every day, and turned down in the evening, with a weather report. Everything else from wallpaper to curtains to stationary, used the same art nouveau design on subtle colours of gold and slate blue. The bathroom was modern and spacious, with white fittings, a white frosted glass door, black marble surfaces, and stylish red and gold mosaic panel in the wall. The building is utterly glorious, in the arts and crafts or art nouveau style, with amazing stairways with wrought ironwork, stained glass panels, marble, carved stone and bespoke period furniture. They also have the most amazing floral arrangements in all public areas, which are replaced 2 or 3 times per week (amarylis, protea, gladioli, orchids). The meeting rooms looked great also, with fully restored period grandeur. It says somethin that half of the 80 photographs we took during our trip were of aspects of the hotel! In terms of service, we didn't try the food, but the staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful (for example, they looked up a restaurant for us, to give us directions from the museum we were visiting before it). The porter insisted on taking our cases to the room for us, and they greeted us every time we came or left the building, and were keen for feedback about what we had enjoyed. They left fruit and fresh flowers in the room on arrival, and every day refreshed the (free of charge) mini-bar with 2 bottles each of: still and sparkling mineral water, coke and diet coke, lemonade, orange juice, beer, tonic water, and a bottle each of red wine, white wine, 5 types of miniature spirits, peanuts, toblerone, good quality tea and expresso/coffee. A few days we also got (free) a small bottle of champagne, fresh fruit and a snickers bar. They also provided good quality standard items like slippers, robes, umbrellas and lovely subtle scented bath products including a rather nice 'sparkling bath sugar'. In contrast to the previous reviewer, in the entire stay we never had a member of staff enter the room without knocking and waiting, even with no sign on the door (when the privacy sign was there we never heard even a single knock, even if we left it on all day). The one day the hot water was problematic, it was cooler for two hours in the middle of the day, yet they gave a bottle of nice French red wine to each room to apologise for this minor inconvenience. They also allowed us a free late checkout (6pm) because they were concerned that they wanted to give us great service (there was nothing special about us in this, as we hadn't spent any money in the hotel apart from the amount we paid inadvance for the room and the city tax). In terms of the building works, they laid a new wood floor in the dining room the day we arrived, and worked on the office adjacent to our room later in our stay. At no point was there any inconvenience and the noise was minor and after 10am only (and I had a few lie-ins after that time without interruption!) The bathroom was very comfortable (I'm 5 foot 2 and my husband is 6 foot 3 and neither of us found the layout or height of anything awkward at all). We always had plenty of towels of all sizes and the room was kept spotlessly clean; every glass, cup and surface sparkled. Zero noise from airconditioning. So, either we (and every other customer we spoke to) were lucky, or the other reviewer was either very very unlucky or very very hard to please! I could only think of two minor suggestions for improvement: a bathmat and an environmental policy card to ensure all those mini-bar bottles get recycled and the bath products not disposed of until empty (even if they wish to provide more each day). Location wise, the hotel is on the road along the harbour, with a canal/city view from the other side. It is an easy walk from the central station, even pulling a case, and within walking distance of a good variety of restaurants, cafes, shops, museums, the zoo and botanical gardens, canal boat tours, trams, and the nightlife and red light district, so you can see the breadth of what Amsterdam has to offer. Once they complete the swimming pool and spa, this hotel will be perfect. By comparison everywhere else looked either run down, like a cheap commercial clone hotel, or bland and boxy. We took a walking tour of the other hotels in case we should ever return, so for info: The Okura hotel staff were terribly rude after a long queue to even speak to reception, the Hilton was pleasant but like an office building in the suburbs, the Raddisson dark and compact, and nowhere else had the facilities that the Amrath will have when complete. In summary, if we go back to Amsterdam, we won't stay anywhere else.", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bern, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cReally nice hotel...will be in future\u201d", "Author": "euine", "ReviewID": "UR8885458", "Content": "As in my previous reports of Amsterdam's hotels I haven't stayed there myself but booked for other people.

We booked through the hotel website and enjoyed three nights including full breakfast and one three course dinner for a very competitive rate (better than other internet sites). On arrival we were upgraded to a superior room with city view. The building has been recently restored and is fascinating. Many original features have been kept including some beautiful stained glass. Our bedroom had an extremely high ceiling and full length electrically operated curtains. The bathroom was what you would expect from a new 5 star hotel. The mini bar is complimentary up to a daily quota i.e not bottomless! The bed was probably the most comfortable ever experienced with crisp white linen and marshmallow-like pillows! The decor will not be to everyone's taste (including mine) rather sobre and heavy but I imagine it has historic integrity. The artwork however, is truly awful (jellyfish on speed) and is the stuff of nightmares! Please comment I would love to know if I'm alone in that view. All the staff ,without exception, were charming and very friendly. Obviously proud of their hotel and well briefed on the building's historic importance. The dinner we had was from a set daily menu and was excellent. A la carte is also available. Breakfast was also without fault and served until 11am on Saturday and 12 mid day on Sunday. A real treat for a lazy weekend break. The location is good for most things but especially the station and the canal bus which are both minutes away. The new concert hall is also close by. There are many local restaurants and one night we went to a restaurant called 'Hemelse Modder' on Oud Waal which we thoroughly recommend for local interesting food in a crisp, clean unpretentious setting.
