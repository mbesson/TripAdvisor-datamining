East Hasting Street is a absolutly must see for every traveler and visitor of Vancouver. Everybody will find out by himself what East Hasting means and tells.Pure education! Without walking twice the East Hasting you can't even say you have been in Vancouver. Yes, there are some homeless people,a few women and so on.Some bodies look strange or funny. But it is safe to walk there any time and nobody trouble you or ask for change,what is happen more in the city center.During my 5 weeks stay I had no problem at all. Also is easy to walk the Pender Street in interesting China Town just 70 m from the Hotel and avoid the Hasting if you like. The Hotel got a nicely decorated big lobby and the staff is very friendly and can tell you about Vancouver all you wan't to know. Mr.Noordin(reception) always like to explain everyting with patience. Unbeatable location.Very closed to the center.Walking distance. The view from my room 502 fifth floor is gorgeous!Skyline,mountains and sea and the never boring unique street view is more than worth the little money extra.Room service is doing well always friendly with a smile.Police museum is near. The last week I was parking my car at the hotel's parking lot also without any problem. So really I don't understand the review' s of some guest's.Maby they are from countryside. This is Vancouver and not Johannesburg!So don't worry at all.I guess it is more dangerous in a barbershop then to walk the Hasting Street.

I relaly did not feel safe walking to downtown even in the day. There is one block where there must be a shelter or something and the street is just lined with these people. As for the hotel itself.... the interior is not that bad, the room has everything you need (and a few extra guests you don't), the bathroom was small but functional, there was a tv (which was rather old and about 30% of the screen was permenantly tinted green). There are towels etc provided which is a bonus. As for the bugs.....I have stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world (50+) and this is the first time I have EVER encountered bed bugs. On the 2nd day of my stay I was feeling a little itchy and uncomfortable but I thought that it may be from travelling or the change in weather and thought nothing further. On the third day I noticed some red \u2018bites\u2019 on my legs and back, I thought that they were caused by mosquitos or similar as I had been to Stanley Park. I am not from here so I thought that it was some local bug. Finally on the 5th and final night of my stay I was lying in the bed awake when I felt something crawling and to my horror saw a bug crawling across the bed. I have never been so disgusted in all my life. I googled what it was as as I said previously I had no idea what a bed bug even looked like and to my horror my research confirmed. As quickly as I could I packed my stuff and went to reception. The girl on reception did not seem shocked or bothered by what I was telling her and suggested it was my own fault?!

It was a great Hotel in one of the nicest cities i have ever visited. When i booked into the Hotel i asked the manager on duty what sights he could recommend for a first time visitor of Vancouver. Whilst he could have told me to take a look at the numerous brochures advertsing local tours in the hotel lobby he spent about 20 minutes writing down local places of interest for me to visit. These were great places off the normal tourist track. The hotel was extremely clean and was also nice and quiet. It is also only located about 1 km from the downtown area which meant that there was no need to use taxis. There was even a bar downstairs which was pretty cool. However whilst all staff members were particularly courteous, one particular staff member Lindsay stood out. Having left the hotel i discovered that i had left me camcorder behind. The camcorder contained all two weeks of my holiday footage. I had travelled from Ireland to see Killer whales in the wild and was pretty upset when i left my camcorder in the hotel. Well Lindsay located the camcorder and spent some time looking for the most competitive quote to get the camcorder returned to me in Ireland.

At $40 (ish) a night for one person, this hotel is actually better value than any hostel in the city, which charge around $25 for just a bed in a dorm or approximately $60 for a single room (and then you get to lug your belongings up and down flights of stairs). I spent about ten nights at the Budget Inn Patricia while I was in between other accommodations in Vancouver, which meant I had a lot of personal belongings: 3 suitcases full, actually. Upon arrival, I was immediately assisted by a gentleman who came out to the taxi to help me and my stuff inside. When she saw how much luggage I had, the front desk girl was lovely enough to upgrade me to a bigger room, free of charge. The room was small, but perfectly adequate for one person and three suitcases. It had a shower and toilet in a little ensuite, with the basin in the room. The TV worked and had a great selection of channels. The bedding and towels were clean and shampoo and soap were provided. There was a radiator to heat the room and there was a small pedistal fan that I imagine would be very helpful in summer. I never ate at the pub downstairs, prefering to walk to Gastown or China Town for meals, or just ate snacks in the room. The surrounding area is filled with homeless people, but I never felt scared, mostly sad or guilty. Because of this, I quickly learnt I could avoid the situation by walking along just one street parallel to East Hastings. Bus stops are so close that you don't have to walk far if you don't want to. I took advantage of the very cheap laundry during my stay. The laundry room was very clean and well maintained. Like the hotel itself, the cheapest I've seen anywhere.

The room on the 4th floor was perfectly reasonable, it lacked a separate table which would be awkward for those expecting to do some work, but I could forgive that given the price considering some of my colleagues were spending maybe 5x or more per night for alternative hotels. On the ground floor at the back & side they have their associated Pat\u2019s Pub, I sampled a fair bit of the food and they do very good burgers and fish and chips at a very good price, along with their own lager which was excellent.

The room was ok, not the biggest, not the cleanest, but ok given the price. The staff on reception weren't too friendly, or rather they looked like they would rather be anywhere else (understandable given the neighbourhood!). All in all, the price was the reason we stayed there and it turned out to be a bad choice for us. I think if you are not someone to feel vulnerable in a bad neighbourhood, you would be ok here. But being two younger travellers this neighbourhood was genuinely scary. We moved out after the first night and stayed at the Days Inn hotel at Vancouver Airport. Very out of the way compared to the Patricia, and about double the price, but we loved it, and they have excellent public transport to downtown Vancouver.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cCheap great value hotel for budget travellers!\u201d", "Author": "Kugsy", "ReviewID": "UR110446252", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights end of April beginning of May.

There was couple police cars there so we walked through them but we were invisible to them. No one spoke to us, no one asked us for anything which in our ignorance was what was gong through our minds. Anyway arrived at the hotel abit upset as thought where the hell have we booked. We only booked one night so thought just stay the night and leave next day. We booked the cheapest room they had, which is small and thin slide door to the bathroom so prob not best unless you are 'comfortable' with each other ;o) but at only $40 ish a night we were happy. We are travelling after all and we do not plan to stay ina room this was perfect for us. We decided to risk the pub next door and so glad we did. Really fab atmosphere,fantastic food, live music, one of the bests pub we have been to in a while. Anyway next day, the sun was shining, the street looked totally different we thought lets book the remainder of our 4 nights. So glad we stayed,We felt totally safe walking around, went to Gas town to eat which is only about 5-10min walk away, really nice. We never caught the bus even though it is outside, we walked everywhere. China town we gave a miss as just did not know where to go here.

We checked in and the front desk staff were very polite and helpful. We had bikes with us and they have secure bike storage available on site. Their lobby has a mini library which is cool. As we reserved their cheapest room category, we expected a small room, and small it was. The room was extremely clean, though, which is all I cared about.

We chose the Budget Inn because of proximity to the party (just three blocks away!) and the low cost. The room was decent. We got everything we were promised, the room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The in-room fridge proved very useful and the shower had good water pressure. All in all, an average experience. Here's what made the experience so much better: 1. Noor Din. This fellow, working the front desk, greeted us in a friendly manner every single time we came by with a question. He was a font of information, and provided us with countless insights into the local transit, entertainment, and cuisine. Noor Din went out of his way to make our visit more convenient and more enjoyable, and his efforts were very much appreciated. 2. The rate. While the website quoted significant rate increases for the paraolympics, a manager by the name of Chris not only gave us a decent room ( two queen beds) for a good price, he also offered us a 10% courtesy discount because we were all students (though this isn't policy and I doubt they'll repeat it, see below). Issues that Arose: 1. Our bill. The credit card machine didn't print out our receipt properly so they had to bill us a second time and assured me the first charge would be annulled at the end of the day. We won't know if the hold was effectively removed, or if the charge will be properly annulled, until we check out credit card bill next month. That's very annoying. I don't like having stressful tasks in my list. Additionally, there was no easy way to apply the 10% discount in the computer system and the manager on duty seemed (at first, at least) uncomfortable honoring it. While Noor Din made the stressful situation almost pleasant via his congenial nature and casual conversation, the manager on duty (not Chris) was aggressive both to his employee and to customers that tried to greet him. I don't know the situation (those clients might be problem cases, and/or the manager might have been having a stressful day) but it left me a little uncomfortable with leaving the bill correction to them. I will check online in a few days to make sure the charges are correct. 2. The location is a bit sketchy. Now, I'm a fairly laid-back individual and clearly something of socially uninhibited fellow (re: Workless Party) so I wasn't too bothered by the spattering of prostitutes and drug dealers every 10' down most of the side streets from the hotel. They didn't bother me, and I didn't bother them. A few blocks west on Hastings, however, is a more serious issue. We wanted to walk downtown and we didn't know the area so we progressed west along Hastings and found ourselves in sketch-town. Now, I want to be clear: no one accosted us, or even made any threatening gestures. Our anxiety was derived mostly from being outnumbered (50:1 at least) by people with values and priorities that do not align with ours (like obeying civil authority, and washing). We opted to move a block or two south and continue on Pender, which seemed to be a much cleaner and safer street. Oh, an aside, the Inn is connected to a pub that had live music. We didn't get a chance to check it out (we were only there one night), but it was convenient to have an indoor connection to a pub in case we did partake of the convenient boozing and wanted to come home late and wasted.

Now there's the infamous east Hastings St. location. Well, that's life. Vancouver city hall concentrated their help and service stations for the down and out folks in an area of about blocks and if one decides to walk down Hastings St. one gets a reminder that there's folks out there having all kinds of troubles. That's OK! We've never been once asked for money or were inconvenienced in any way! It's easy and fast to get to the airport. With the bus/skytrain combination (bus stop is half a block from the hotel) it takes not more than 45 minutes. The skytrain (Canada line) is awsome btw. and if you want to save some money, buy a 10 pack of tickets at the drugstore in the Domestic Terminal arrival hall level 1 - this way you'll save on the 5 dollar 'add-on' fee city hall cooked up!

If you want to save money, just buy a ticket to Canada Line, then you can use it on other public transporations too within 90 minutes.

To be fair, it would have been less cramped had we not chosen to bring all our motorcycle luggage into the room. The staff were friendly and helpful.

Pros: -Walking distance to Chinatown, Downtown, Ports and Transit. -Friendly and knowledgeable staff -Easy access to Public Transit (During 6am-2am) -Room service about 930am-10am in cases multilingual staff Cons: -If you have a window room, it will be 6-10 degrees colder -If you're business requires you to be on-call 24 hrs you'll have trouble getting around, or getting to an ATM - E.Hastings is notorious for having a high frequency of disadvantaged people (Prostitutes, Junkies, Homeless and so on) not Patricia's fault, but something to be aware of if you are not prepared. Background: I was in Vancouver for a couple days on business, very last minute due to economic shifts that affected my employer in Toronto. So out of the blue I booked with travelocity without incident, Patricia had everything on file and took a copy of credit card for incidentals. Price comparison is that of a backpackers hostel, considering that you get privacy, some amenities and such, the price is a steal. The Hotel: There is a single elevator that's a little older you may have to push the buttons twice or so. Once I got to my room i noticed that it was quite cold, I found a piece of wood propping the window open for some reason, once removed it did get warmer, but only slightly during my entire stay(3 days-2 nights). Budget room has a 2 piece bathroom with a pretty straight forward shower and toilet while the sink is in the main part of the room. Cable TV is pretty easy and free while phone is for pay (I run everything through my cell so i didn't really need it anyway). I noticed that a few local payphones have been vandalized beyond use either stripped for parts or just plain broken so if you need a phone I would suggest you get a disposable from 7-11 or use long distance phone cards with your cell phone. If you are the Business type bring a laptop there is no cybercafe in about a 2 km radius. From what I understand they have a wireless internet setup, since I haven't tested it I can't really say much more. I travel light and with as few electronics as possible and I learned this the hard way. Locale: There are really no attractions in the immediate area aside from Chinatown and the Ports, there's a waterfront park nearby and some others just south if you need a place to get some air, smoke or what not. Due to certain elements in the area, businesses close up shop rather early if you're comparing it to a 24 hr city like Toronto, Tokyo, LA, or New York this borough of Vancouver isn't up to snuff . Translink information is mostly online and in select bus shelters, if you're a tourist you will have trouble finding maps or finding out where you can get them considering the major lines are either automated or under equipped. Every map holder i saw while traveling on the Skytrain was empty, i had to draw a mini map in my padfolio from one encased in a bus shelter at one point. Okay, now on to what most of you have been griping about. Yes this area is not for the faint of heart, if drug dealers, hookers, and homeless people scare you then don't stay in this part of town. I use to be a youth worker so this is kind of my element, I can diffuse hostile situations if necessary, but remember if you show them respect they will too. Try not to judge them or tell them off, a simple no thanks or not right now can go a long way. Also, try to dress casual; I had to maintain a dress code for some parts of my trip and walking around at odd hours in business attire is a sure fire way to get propositioned by prostitutes and those looking for spare change. Police presence increases substantially after 2am, from what I gather there are 2 easily accessible stations, if by any chance you do meet with an aggressive panhandler or other persons facing barriers. Quite frankly you have better chances bribing the homeless for lost or stolen property they know more and act much quicker; helped fellow out of towner find lost keys in less than 10 min with homeless guys help. Conclusion: The only way I would stay in this Hotel again, is if my employer would agree to some concessions, including a rather sizable increase in pay. I know I have to go back to Vancouver for a progress report next year and I plan on staying closer to the Downtown core possible in a brand name hotel and renting a car to get around during the early hours. If you're a last minute traveler and value a half decent quiet environment without a lot of money this is definitely a place for you. Roadies, traveling artists, and temporary job seekers from out of province would probably benefit most.

Our family requested a non-smoking room when we reserved because our son has asthma . Despite the smoky stench in the lobby, we decided to look at our room anyhow because we were exhausted after a full day of traveling and hoped it would be clean. After taking our credit card number, the proprietor informed us that he\u2019d neglected to mention the elevator was broken \u2013 and our room was on the fourth floor! We lugged our heavy suitcases up four flights of stairs, only to discover that our room stank of smoke, was west-facing, had no air conditioning and was so hot as to be a virtual sweatbox. In short, it was simply not habitable. We hauled everything back down the stairs. I have a chronic disk problem in my neck from an old injury which was already hurting from dragging stuff up four flights. The manager insisted he would NOT return our money and that we would be charged for the room if we left. I pointed out that he had no right to keep our money since we\u2019d been misled about our room, and since nobody could expect someone with a neck/back condition to hike up and down four flights every time we wanted to leave the hotel. In the U.S., this would be a clear violation of access for the disabled laws. I had no free hands since I was carrying a heavy duffel bag downstairs. On the last level, I slipped on the too-slick polished stairs and fell down, wrenching my lower back. The manager/proprietor, who was right behind me, didn\u2019t even apologize or ask if I was alright, just kept insisting he wouldn\u2019t refund our money. We were furious and shocked at the callous and inconsiderate attitude. My son then opened up his laptop in the lobby, got online and booked us a room at a much-better hotel across town for less money. When the proprietor noticed what we were doing, the wireless Internet connection mysteriously went down. But fortunately we\u2019d already put down a deposit and reserved our new room. When we informed the proprietor of this rat hole that we were leaving and would definitely not accept the room offered, he again insisted that he would not refund our money. By this time my husband had loaded up all of our four family member\u2019s heavy suitcases in our rental vehicle. My back was hurting and we couldn\u2019t wait to leave. Then the proprietor informed us that the elevator was fixed, however both my son and I were affected by the smoky air in the lobby and we were all so offended by how we\u2019d been treated that I called our credit card company and told them about the abuse, asking to have charges removed. The card company representative offered to cancel our card before the charges were put through, but we couldn\u2019t as we needed it for the rest of our vacation. So I informed the representative that we would be challenging any charges from the Budget Patrician. I also asked a desk clerk to write down my complaints in their guest book. My back continued to bother me for the next week, but it wasn\u2019t until the last day of our vacation that I was able to book an appointment for a massage at the April Point Resort & Spa to relieve the pain.

Because of this, I have a long list of accommodations available to me throughout the province. But this Labour Day weekend, my plans changed suddenly, and I was forced to find a hotel in Vancouver for Saturday night with virtually no notice. None of my usual spots had rooms available. So I started researching possibilities. My usual accommodations, even though they're in lovely neighbourhoods like Kits, and have hot tubs, great breakfasts and safe, comfortable, clean rooms, usually run me $60-$80 nightly. So when other B&Bs and hotels in the core area were quoting $150+ nightly, I started expanding my scope. I checked out the TripAdvisor reviews for the Patricia, and was concerned that many were negative. But the provincial tourism agency told me that there were \"some\" homeless people in the area, and while I wouldn't want to hang out in that part of town, that I should be fine. That was the worst travel advice I have ever received. When I drove from Lion's Gate into Gastown, I expected to find the hotel soon, as it was advertised to be \"steps\" from Gastown. Not only was it not near Gastown, it was significantly east of Chinatown - in the one area of Vancouver that concerns me, an urban-dwelling journalist who has ventured with minimal worries, late at night, through tough areas of NYC, London, LA and Bangkok. Driving through the area where the Patricia is located requires constant attention to avoid running over crackheads and tweakers who stumble unexpectedly across the street. Regrettably, I did not recognize the neighbourhood from the address. When I pulled into the lot next door to the hotel, I prayed that they had another parking facility, as the parking had been advertised as \"secure\" with video cameras. Unfortunately, that was not the case. In reality, it was an open lot with sketchy individuals everywhere. As best as I can tell, the only benefit of the cameras would be for the police to review crimes that had already been committed. There is a huge difference between \"homeless\" individuals who may or may not be dangerous versus crack and meth addicts who are universally known as likely candidates to be thieves stealing to feed their habits. Furthermore, when I mentioned my concern about the parking and about the spotty locks on the rooms, the front desk clerk huffed at me that \"no one would break into my room.\" Well, given that he was in the back of the front desk area, out of sight of anyone entering the lobby or going up the elevator, I was not so confident. And I really didn't want to mention that I was concerned because I had $10K of very-portable camera gear with me. Beyond that, my \"non-smoking\" room reeked of smoke. Though, in fairness, it seemed clean if a bit ratty.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cYou can do better than this one...\u201d", "Author": "Ericka98125", "ReviewID": "UR5693683", "Content": "The price was okay...under $100/night but for the same price we could of stayed somewhere more centrally located.

I didn't see any cockroaches or vermin in the room which I guess is a bonus! The staff were really nice, friendly and helpful.
