I spent time at the bar and the steward was helpful and attentive, when he eventually arrived. I ate with a colleague in the restaurant and enjoyed a pleasant steak and some decent pasta well served by an hospitable waiter who was fluent in English. My nights sleep was spoiled by various factors. The bed was uncomfortable and low, and no clock was provided. Also the plumbing was very noisy whenever a neighbour used their facilities. After a transatlantic flight the ability to see the time easily when half awake is important to me. When I went to use the bathroom I was surprised to find that the shower cubicle, a minute dirty plastic device, was crawling with small black bugs 1-2mm long. They were not put off by the peeling paint obviously! I will be posting the video I shot of these bugs. Overall I think this hotel is poorly placed for a tourist, being 30mins by taxi from the centre, and is a bad deal for business travellers because of the sleep quality.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOk only if you play tennis\u201d", "Author": "EdoardoJames", "ReviewID": "UR123374879", "Content": "This hotel is the perfetc venue if you play tennis at the nearby club.

The hotel was about 500 metres from the train station but on a dual carriageway with no pavements. We managed to catch a bus which tokk us to 500 metres the other side of the hotel and had to walk back along the carriageway (with a pavement part of the way). As there was no restuarant open in the hotel in the evening - we had to walk along the carriageway again to find somewhere to eat. On the subject of food - breakfast was good and ample. We aslo found a small roadside cafe which serve amazing Pizza (walk away from Rome and cross over at the set of lights) Our biggest complaint would be that we decided to book a taxi to get to the airport in the morning. We booked this through reception who told us that it was 15 euros (which we thought was expensive for a 3 mile journey but were happy to pay), as it was our last night in the eurozone, we spend all our money and kept about 25 euros (15 for taxi and 10 for drinks at the airport). When we got the taxi, the driver demanded 20 euros and we argued a bit about it but couldn't stay ther for long as we had a flight to catch. So my advice is... Only stay here is you have a car and if you use a taxi, don't take the receptionists word for the price.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlothian VA", "Title": "\u201cClean but a shower curtain please\u201d", "Author": "OldTarheel", "ReviewID": "UR10609601", "Content": "I am writing this because I found travel advisor of some help in planning our trip. I start with the assumption that not everyone's expectations are the same and not every room is alike. The most important thing for my wife and me is that the room be clean and affordable. After all we are only there to sleep after a busy day sight seeing. We were at the Appia Park for three nights on a trip that took us and two other couples to Rome, Florence, Cinque Terre and Venice. The Appia is located on what appears to be a circumferential highway in the suburbs of Rome. There appears to be no zoning in the area with an automobile dealership, shopping center with a furniture store, Grocery Store and very nice houses surrounding it. They have a conference center and expensive restaurant. The included breakfast was great, in fact the best we had in Italy. It included several meats, pastries, croissants, cereals, fruit, juice, fruits, yogurts, coffee, etc. Major complaint was distance from sites in Rome. (But we were aware this would be a factor). We spent 15 + min waiting time on bus to the underground station and a 20 min ride into the city from there. Figure 45 + min during rush hours. On the positive it did allow us a glimpse of everyday life among the locals. Staff was formal and professional. My other concern was the lack of shower curtain. The other two couples did have one though. We have found this to be the case in other trips to Europe. I guess Europeans prefer tub baths to showers. Since there were six of us we arranged limousine service to the hotel prior to the trip and found this a blessing. The driver was very nice and they can be checked out at: [--].

We were directed to our room which was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The Hotel was extremely clean and must be commended on it's cleanliness and each morning our room was cleaned and fresh towels placed in our Bathroom. The hotel location is a bit of a trek for those unwilling to use public transport if you are in Rome to see the historical sites. When you leave the jotel entrance you take a left and walk to the second set of traffic lights and cross the road to the Bus stop from here you take the 664 Bus to \"Colli Albani\" (about a 15min ride depending on traffic conditions) where you go to the Metro Station which is located underground but clearly marked with a RED \"M\". From here you can take a subway train to \"Spagna\" which is the Spanish Steps Square. The whole journey once you leave your hotel should take no more than 45mins. WE walked everywhere in rome but we were caught on 2 occassions with the Metro Stations cloaing early...last train is due at 11pm but we found on two occassions that the station closed for maintenenace at 9pm where we had to resort to a taxi ride to the hotel which cost between 18-21euro. One gripe about the hotel was that the breakfast was poor...!! It is a continental breakfast and the quality of the food was poor.

We had looked at many hotels and could not believe how cheap this hotel was, especially as it was classed as a 4* hotel. When we arrived at Ciampino airport it was midnight and we were charged 53 euros to get to the hotel, which was quite expensive for such a short drive (15 euros on the return journey), but we had no choice that time of night. When we arrived at the hotel it looked very impressive. We were given two rooms both in one of the two annexes at the front of the hotel. One room was quite large, very pleasant, carpeted, had a very nice bathroom with bath and shower, but the other one was much smaller, uncarpeted and rather drab with only a shower. We went to the reception and asked for a change of room. The hotel was full that night but they said they would change the room the next day - which they did. The new room was in the main part of the hotel and it was very nice. The hotel looked as if it had been refurbished - new carpets etc. The breakfast was very good and you could eat as much as you wanted to (continental). The receptionists could have been more friendly - they seemed a little offhand, although the rest of the staff were very nice. There is a courtesy bus which took you to the metro. We caught it the first morning, but it did not run for the next 2 mornings. On these mornings we caught the local bus - the bus stop was a few minutes walk from the hotel. The surrounding district is not too great, although we felt quite safe. We would certainly stay at the Appia Park hotel again. We found the Italian people very friendly and very helpful when we required directions. A few tips when visiting Rome. We were there for 3 days and purchased a two-day open top bus ticket (on and off whenever you wanted to - great way to get around Rome). We also purchased a 3 day metro/public bus ticket. Both great value for money. At busy times the metro and public buses were very, very crowded so be prepared to be squashed, but it was quite fun. When visiting St Peters Church obtain a tour guide. We were asked to join a FREE tour which was excellent, and it was free, although we gave him a tip: it was well worth it. The Cistern Chapel is a \"must visit\" but so are the many other interesting sights in Rome. Try the cafes/restaurants in the back streets. We found a great little restaurant which was \"very Italian\": the food was excellent and the price very reasonable - 13 euros each for 2 courses (first course a variety of different dishes: also included was a bottle of wine and a bottle of water). Be prepared when visiting some of the public conveniences in Rome, even in the cafes and bars!!! Be very alert when crossing the roads especially on zebra crossings - crazy Visit the Popes blessing held every Wednesday and Sunday - it was a very moving experience. Instead of queuing for tickets (for seats), arrive between 9.00 - 9.30 am and stand at the barrier as near to St Peters as you can get. We had one of the best views of Pope Benedict ever: he passed in front of us to within about 6 - 7 feet.

However, it is only 7 Km from Ciampino Airport and the taxi drivers would prefer to take you into Rome 17Km. We were consequently charged 40 euros (\u00a329) for this journey. An absolute rip off, so beware. I also had my wallet stolen to make matters worse. I now know it was stolen by a gypsy girl from Sicily ( They operate in teams ). Many carry babies and some of them are dolls! I was on the Metro (tube) its their best area for pickings. They never get on the train, and have a diversionary tactic to stop you in the doorway, lift your wallet and be away as the doors are closing. Don't ever think that you are smarter than them. You can be as vigilant as imaginable, but they are so clever, well rehearsed, fast and un-noticeable. When I found out I was back at the hotel buying a drink and felt gutted. The hotel manager, Maximilliano was fantastic. Sympathetic and made all the phone calls for me. If you are a victim, save your time and go straight to the Questurdura in Rome city. We got through our stay on a tight budget and asked the hotel to arrange a taxi back to the airport with the instruction to advise the taxi company that I had 20 euros and no more.

We arrived around half eight at night. We bought two one euro tickets to get the bus to Anagnina undergorund. After buying another two one euro tickets at the underground we found out that the underground in Rome closes at 9.00pm -presumably in the winter months as we had thought it opened till 11.30pm-we got a bus-MA2-which took us to Colli Albani. From there we got the 664 to the hotel. Normaly you would buy one day (4 euro ) tickets however as it was late at night we managed to get to the hotel for 4 euros for the two of us. Taxis are reluctant to take you from the airport as it is too close a fare to take as well as the large queues you face when coming off the flight. There are not too many restaurants near the hotel however the receptionist told us about a restaurant nearby that was great value and good food. When you come out the hotel you turn left and walk down to the main set of traffic lights. Turn left and 100yrds on the left is the restuarant. On our return to the airport we got the underground to the Termini and found that the airline had an express bus which left close to the Termini. Worth checking to make it easier to get back to the airport.
