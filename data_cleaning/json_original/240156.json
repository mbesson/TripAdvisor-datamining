Saying that the room was \"newly remodeled\" was an over statement to say the least. The Room decor was gross, the room smelled funky like old cigarettes even though it was a non-smoking room. The carpet was disgusting. If I was visually imparied I'd have assumed the carpet was moss due to the dampness of it. The bed was stiff and I actually checked the room and bed for bed bugs. The curtain covering the only window had a hole in it, that I was convinced was a bullet hole. We should have drove away as soon as I noticed pulling into the parking lot 2 men whom were already handcuffed getting ready to be taken away by a police officer. The door key also didn't work. I had to walk the whole length of the motel 2 times to get new keys to 2 different rooms since neither key worked. The only thing good about this motel was the bathroom was clean (even though it only had 1 towel for 2 guests and no shampoo or conditioner bottles, I'm surprised there was some cheap bar soap), had good water pressure and they refunded my 2nd night stay which I was billed for but never ended up using quickly. The only thing missing from this disgusting motel room was a chalk line of a dead body on the floor. Also their pool drains aren't split which means I hope your child doesn't get sucked to the pool bottom never to surface again. Spend and extra $20 and go to the Comfort Inn Cockatoo near LAX its beautiful and soooo worth he extra $20.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lyford, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAn OK Motel 6\u201d", "Author": "Laura W", "ReviewID": "UR119450143", "Content": "I have stayed at this Motel 6 4 times this year and each time I have had no issues.

The desk clerk argued with me and actually said \"no, everybody is connected\" without checking the router. He suggested I was the problem.

The cable TV is low-tier satellite with fewer channels than HD broadcast. The dresser is missing a drawer. The shower drain is clogged. But the water is very warm, I'll give it that.

If you're a heavy sleeper, have a good set of earplugs or just don't mind that kind of noise, then it's not a terrible experience.
