The parking area is not tightly enclosed and is unguarded, so someone could climb over the fence and break into a car if desired. The hotel staff had told me when I called to book that there is a shuttle I could take to use to get to the convention center, where I had a conference. In fact, there is only one shuttle available and the priority is for picking people up from the airport, so it was usually unavailable. Had I known this in advance, I would've booked at a different hotel closer to the convention center. The carpet in the hallways was ridiculously old. The hotel is near a freeway but noise wasn't a problem. The workout room is actually inside the parking garage... The breakfast was awful and overpriced. the coffee was weak maxwell style (which is fine in a greasy spoon, but not for a $15+ breakfast), and I threw away the sausages, which were disgusting, after choking down some dry French bread. 2 pluses, and they're significant: the room inside was fine - nice new furnishings, nicely taken care of.

(we stayed at several hotels on our visit to the U.S and i shall be reviewing them all as i have benefited from other user's reviews so its time to give something back) The hotel also has a free printing service and 2 free pc's connected to the internet in the lobby area, which is handy if you dont tavel with a laptop or tablet and need to use a larger screen than your mobile device. The hotel has a small outdoor pool which is heated and my wife and son swam in it whilst i used the Gym, which albeit small was enough for some morning exercise, it has a selection of free weights, 2 running machines and 2 cycling machines if my memory serves me correctly. Parking at the hotel is piad but just outside the hotel there is free street parking available, just take notice of street signs as the street i parked on said that you couldnt park there on wednesday's between 2am and 6am due to street cleaning, otherwise completely legal to park there. The room was a nice size and had tea and cofee making facilities. One thing i would recommend to see in San Diego is a place called La Jolla, we drove there and stopped at a beach where there were sealions basking in the sun! our first time seeing these animals in the wild, also out at sea we saw two Dolphins swimmimg back and forth. We later found out that La Jolla is also a great spot to come if you want to see whales and there are boats that can take you out on dolphin and whale watching excursions. I almost forgot to mention that if you sign up for the Holiday in Loyalty scheme, you get a free gift, and also are more likely to get upgraded to a better room.

My room with a comfortable king-size bed was spacious and very clean, with a pleasant neutral decor (granite sinks!). And there were numerous other small details that I appreciated: an attentive, pleasant and responsive staff, plenty of towels, a good heating and cooling system that I controlled, good quality soaps and lotions, free wireless that worked perfectly with my Samsung Netbook, and plumbing in good order (e.g., wasn't faced with standing in a non-draining shower as so often happens). From this hotel location you CAN walk directly down First Avenue to the harbor if you wish. Again, as another poster commented the area is a bit sketchy, not horrible but a lot of parking lots and a nearby Motel 6 - a bit gritty.

There is also a pool that I did not use but plenty of other people seemed to. They also have a little cafe on the ground floor where you can obtain breakfast etc. For the hotel type and location in a very expensive city, gets 5 stars from me for being clean, safe, and pleasant, and I would stay here again if I were in the area.

This was a business trip for my DH and a leisure trip for me. On arrival we were greeted by Jose who was very pleasant and knowledgeable. When we expressed concern about noise and the location of our room, he mentioned the double pane windows and that noise would not be a problem. The noise was a problem and I\u2019m not a light sleeper! No matter the time of day, cars were flying by and you could hear them. The hotel is also in the flight path to the airport. Take a look at my pictures. We ate at the hotel\u2019s restaurant (First Avenue Grill) a couple times for breakfast and one dinner. Food was average, but service was always great. The restaurant had all the basics (yogurt, cold cereal, juices, coffee, tea, pastry etc.) Most of the time when we ate in, we ordered from Florencia\u2019s. An Italian restaurant that delivered. Food was tasty, arrived promptly and was hot! Our favorite restaurants were Hob Nob Hill (good food and lots of it) and Buster\u2019s at Seaport Village (definitely try the Tropical French Toast). We weren\u2019t really too fond of Edgewater Grill, which was a fave mentioned by a few TA members. If you want to go casual, we heartily recommend Yummy Buffet (off Rosecrans Avenue in the Loma Portal area). We happened upon it when I had to make a quick stop at a CVS Minute Clinic. Yummy used to be a Sizzler and was recently renovated. It was clean, staff were pleasant, and most of all, even picky eaters can find something on their large buffet. We ended up eating three lunches there during our 7 days in San Diego. In terms of activities beyond the basics (Zoo, Coronado, Embarcadero, etc), just hanging around the Seaport Village on a Saturday afternoon is cool, because you can people-watch and listen to the live music. Also, we recommend doing a Trolley Tour (early in your trip), and visiting Coronado for more than a few hours. We loved Balboa Park. Holiday Inn Pros - The staff are very helpful and pleasant - Good access off the Interstate - View out our window of the arriving planes was nice. We\u2019ve never stayed at any hotel that was as close to an airport as the Holiday Inn. - Staff were very responsive \u2013 on arrival in our room our fridge was missing in less than an hour a staff member brought it up. A bathroom issue was handled quickly and efficiently. - Free Internet that worked! Holiday Inn Cons - If you\u2019re a light sleeper the freeway noise and planes arriving could be a problem. The planes depart in the other direction from the hotel. - As someone mentioned the hallway lights shine under the room door. It was a bit annoying to have all the lights off and still have light shining under the door. - Parking is pricey and sometimes (for us, most of the time) the access card did not work. Luckily we had two key cards so if one didn't work, we used the other. Inserting several times usually worked eventually. We had a rental car, so we didn't walk around the area. There are areas close to the hotel where panhandlers frequent. As Holiday Inns go, this one was not horrible. That said our hotel selection was based on corporate policy (budget), since this was partly a business trip for one of us. If this was a true leisure trip I would likely have picked someplace different. Feel free to email me with any specific questions.

The shuttle ran on the weekends and even provided later hours for Friday and Saturday night. If you had to go to the airport that would take precedent over any other shuttle rides (they also provided shuttle drop offs at the zoo and Sea World). The rooms were nice and big. The bed was comfortable and easy to fall asleep in. The bathroom was spacious. We didn't eat down in the cafe they had on the lobby floor but all the food we saw other people order looked amazing! The prices for the food weren\u2019t that expensive and we would definitely eat there next time! This hotel is in a great location and not too far from downtown or the airport. We didn't walk around downtown at night but took the liberty of walking around during the day and didn't have a problem finding all the places we wanted to go.

We were assigned into a room with two twin beds at check in and when we asked if a queen bed was available, we were told that the hotel was not interested in providing a queen bed as they were only obligated to provide beds for two people. I am sure that the hotel obligations towards the hotwire booking are probably true but as a frequent traveler to San Diego and as well a loyalty club member, I would have thought the hotel would have been more interested helping a repeat Holiday Inn customer.

Complimentary shuttle service that can take you to the top San Diego area destinations. The staff was very nice. Cons: The parking facility is atrocious at best with spaces designed primarily for compact or subcompact cars. The hotel's location, while relatively close to downtown San Diego, is surrounded by a major freeway and airport. As such, noise level has a tendency to be high. Very limited (and unhealthy) dining options on the property. The Holiday Inn San Diego Downtown is one of those antique circular properties that are leftover from the 50's. I've always wondered what a stay in one of these hotels would be like, and now I know. Mostly, it is cramped, and confusing to maneuver. On the bright side, this Holiday Inn has gone through a complete remodel to modernize its look and amenities. What that means is that rooms are clean, functional and have everything you'd look for in a comfortable stay. Depending on your location in the hotel, your room could have a gorgeous view of the beaches or the dizzying interchange of the I-5 freeway. I had the latter, which meant that I also had the pleasure of car/truck noises and airplane take-offs to lull me to sleep (the hotel is adjacent to the airport). Also on the plus side, the complimentary shuttle service takes you to all the downtown hot spots, as well as the San Diego Zoo and Sea World. That is a very nice service, and might convince you to forego a rental car. Now, the hotel has a restaurant on the lobby level, but it is very off-putting. In fact, the first thing you smell upon entering the lobby is the odor of fried food and old oil. That alone makes one think that ordering from the little cafe could clog your arteries in less than a heartbeat. I did, indeed, eat there and while the service was very cheery, the food was woeful. This property also has a laundry room, exercise room and a pool. However, they were so difficult to find in the labyrinthine parking structure, that you might throw in the towel before ever arriving to them. Speaking of the parking structure, this is truly one of the worst I've ever encountered. The secured gates that prevent outsiders from entering did not work the entire time I was there, so you'd have to call the help line and the gate would go up automatically. So much for the security piece. Additionally, because the property is circular, spaces are odd shaped and very narrow. I saw cars that had 2 inches between them. Definitely not an ideal location to park, and if you do, just know you might leave with a few extra dents on your car. Overall, this hotel is average, and when compared to other Holiday Inns in the area, is probably slightly lower in value for the price. For better value nearby in a comparable price range, you might consider the Holiday Inn Express San Diego Downtown, which offers a free breakfast and slightly lower room rate.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNoisy, Drab\u201d", "Author": "Lily1230", "ReviewID": "UR81342567", "Content": "Hotel is situated on a motorway and on a flight path, so not a restful experience,Hotel is dark dreary and needs full renovation.

From the outside, the hotel is nicely located near the I-5 freeway for easy access, recently renovated, and property is well-kept. Easy arrival, the front desk even let us do an early check-in at 1000. There are two elevators that can get pretty busy at peak times, so we used the nearby stairs. Placed at the 6th floor 2 doubles room facing the back side of the hotel, outside noise was barely heard during the night. The beds were comfortable and clean, HDTV with HD channels a plus, desk with nightstand and chair, free wifi, coffeemaker, and very clean bathrooms are the highlights of the room. Housekeeping does a great job cleaning the rooms, and the condition of the furnishings are relatively new. Now for the downsides of the room, where there was no provided refrigerator (50 dollars/night to rent one) for perishable food, no dvd player, and the A/C unit can be quite loud when working, making sleep sometimes difficult. However, the room itself I feel is a good value for how much i paid (60/night through priceline). The onsite restaurant is small, very pricey, and we avoided eating there and went to other nearby affordable food places for meals. The food is nothing special and quite mediocre in taste. Parking is steep here which is 16/night, and spaces are narrower than average, making bigger size vehicles a bit difficult to park. The swimming pool is small and the fitness room consists of dumbbells, 1 treadmill, stairclimber, and elliptical. I used it every morning before venturing out and the equipment worked out just fine. The provided shuttle service only goes to Seaworld and San Diego Zoo for the attractions and airport and local downtown places based on availability of the driver. I didnt use this service because I had a rental car and the return flight was before 6am, which was when the shuttle service starts everyday. Laundry is at the ground level and there are only 2 washers and dryers each. Overall, polite employees and a clean room made this stay rewarding. I would stay here again if I could pay the same rate.

I know that when I think of the chain, it often comes with mixed reviews - which is precisely how I thought this stay was going to be. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. I'd drive by it a few times the last time I was in San Diego. Looking at it from the freeway it appeared a bit old and had the potential to have lots of traffic noise filter into the rooms. I was impressed to see that when we checked-in, we found ourselves in a newly renovated property with good sealing on the windows. We found this hotel on Priceline yet were given a high floor room that faced downtown. I am always happy when Priceline guests are treated the same as others - or at least, I got the feeling we were. The front desk employees were courteous and efficient, and I really enjoyed both the unique restaurant recommendations we got when we asked for help for somewhere to eat. The room itself was done up nicely - and slightly larger than normal. It was set up appropriately given the unusual circular shape of the building. Our room contained two double beds that were very comfortable, as well as the usual desk and TV unit. The one thing I did not like at all about the room was the bathroom - it had a sliding door instead of a normal one and allowed almost no privacy. My friend and I were not fond of this in the slightest. Other than that - the room was great. Location wise - this hotel is literally at the foot of the entrance to the 5 Freeway (both North and South entrances). I was concerned about noise but we never got any humming from the highway. This location is great to get anywhere in the city, but a little inconvenient if you are going downtown because you have to circle up past the freeway. Not a big deal, but you cannot turn right to go to the center of the city. The core is also walkable - but places such as the Gaslamp Quarter are not close by (maybe 20 minutes). In terms of amenities - there is free wireless in the rooms which is always greatly appreciated. We were charged $15.00 a night for parking which was a bit less than the last hotel I stayed at in San Diego. There is a pool (no jacuzzi) on the ground floor but to be honest, the cosmetic appearance of the pool area left little to be desired. There is also a small restaurant in the lobby which we didn't sample. Overall, I thought the value of this hotel was high when it came to the new rooms and items such as free internet. It'd be nice if the bathroom door was a regular locking door, and not a sliding piece of clouded glass. The location at the freeways was perfect for our trips to Coronado and MIssion Beach.

The food at the on-site restaurant was way better than we expected. The breakfasts were especially good. At $5, I had the blueberry pancakes(3 large ones) almost every day. Lasted me until we would have an early dinner. The one complaint I would have about this hotel was that it charged $6 for each 15 min. of internet use in the lobby(but printing out boarding passes was free). Also, a word of warning. When we first got to the hotel we were tired and hungry. Thinking the lobby restaurant was closed, we ordered the first thing we saw, which was a flier slipped under our door for Tahiti(and now possibly Abelina) Pizza. It took two hours to get there, was cold and terrible. Do not order from these places. I was going to write a seperate review, but these palces don't show up in any searches. As far as the on-sire restaurant goes, when you are in the lobby it looks like it is closed because of the way the wall is laid out, but it is open 'til 10 p.m. and takes last orders at 9:30. If you do not want to venture out, by all means eat here. They also have beer and a limited liquor selection. There is also Mixon Liquor and Deli one block south of the hotel on 1st Ave. if you want to make your own drinks, and the gas station across the street also sells beer and liquor.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton,Alberta", "Title": "\u201cNice older hotel- a liitle out of the way from downtown.\u201d", "Author": "Mindy53", "ReviewID": "UR54377295", "Content": "Clean, large room, friendly staff.

I booked through priceline and when I checked in I was given a room on the 4th floor. I went to bed early (9:30 pm) and as I was dozing off, I noticed something crawling on the wall...it was a cockroach! I killed it and called front desk; they told me they were full but we're going to look into transferring me hotel. 45 min later I had not heard anything and by then I was so tired (having been up for almost 24h travelling). I called again and they said they found a room on the 12th floor that they were cleaning for me. I went about 20 min later and the room was a downgrade (2 double beds instead of a king I had booked and smaller) and the toilet seat was dirty! Not a very good clean-up job even if it was rushed given the circumstances. I slept poorly that night and got up at 6 am to speak with the manager regarding a possible transfer to another hotel. She told me that they have no cockroaches and the one I saw must have come from a guest's luggage !!??!! [---] She told me I could not be transferred because I had booked with priceline and the hotel would not be reimbursed! She told me she could book me another hotel if I payed for it out of my own pocket! So basically, they did not want to take a loss for something that is their fault but I should instead! What great customer service! She offered me a room upgrade and two $10 vouchers for breakfast, as if I would eat at the likely source of infestation! She never called priceline in order to sort things out; I called but it was impossible to speak to anyone (you have to email your problem and they will get back to you). Finally, I accepted the room upgrade since by then it was 8 am and I had to go to my meeting. Two days later priceline got in touch with me and dealt with the regular manager; he offered me the possibility of early check-out and being reimbursed for the 2 nights I would not be staying with them I refused because by then , my stay was 2/3 over and it was unlikely I would find a hotel with a conference in town. They did give me free parking for 3 nights. Overall, a very bad experience that ruined my stay. I had to waste so much time dealing with this stupid issue during a business trip and I feel the 'extras' that were thrown my way were insufficient. I have a phobia about cockroaches and had to constantly worry they would get in my stuff and I might bring some home; I would have to put all my things in my suitcase when I left the room. Needless to say, I will never stay there again or deal with priceline since their attitude is that if you get a deal you are stuck with it, no matter what! Another reason for frustration was that a lot of the staff at the front desk (including the female manager) are not fluent in english and did not understand everything I told them. The general manager was fluent and it made it easier dealing with him at least but he was there only on weekdays. So to wrap up: AVOID at all costs!

Also, we found out that the fitness centre was only accessible via the pool so we never got there either. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the city, which we enjoyed in every way.

They insisted that we pay the full balance right there and then as they didn't just take cash as guests arrived. Our friend who booked the room said she had spoken to the hotel and that they had said it was fine for us to do that, and then the manager on duty tried to cover it by saying that she couldn't have spoken to anyone at reception at the hotel, when my friend most certainly did! It didn't get any better either, most of the restaurant staff didn't pay attention or understand when you ordered.

No mention was made of the sensor until I complained upon checkout when the clerk sheepishly tried to explain it. If you sleep heavy or like it hot (SD was in the 90s), no problem. For most of us, having a machine noisily turn on and off several times an hour while trying to sleep is unacceptable. The room would get hot, I'd get up to see what was wrong, and it would turn on again after I touched the dial on the old a/c machine. Very inadequate, especially considering the stifling heat. About 6:30 a.m. I finally tried switching to \"fan only\", moving around the 90 degree air in the room. At least it was quiet and I got a *couple* of hours of sleep, sweaty as it was. The hallways are not air conditioned either, so you step out of your partially air conditioned room into a sauna. I didn't book an eco-tourism vacation in a yurt; I paid for a moderately priced hotel room with the amenities that entails. I don't feel that I got it. The positive reviews are probably from winter-time guests.

Fortunately there was a USO within 6 blocks; otherwise, you're screwed. If you're going to the Civic Center, this is fairly close. It's too far to walk to the Convention Center, though. The trolley is about 6 blocks; the bus, 7. They have a shuttle (with a great driver) to/from the airport on the half hour. The room itself was very clean and well appointed, if a little small. We had a great city view. The bathroom was ample in size, with lovely decor. The only problem was the placement of the hall mirror with shoji-type doors. It offered very little privacy as your shadow/silhouette was reflected to anyone on the beds. The pool was old, but adequate. No spa, though. There is a small deli-style restaurant on-site. The staff we interacted with was pleasant. I would not recommend this hotel because of the terrible air conditioning. Paying for a hotel room to sleep in only to be kept awake all night to save a few pennies on the a/c is just wrong.

About two blocks away from the \"Little Italy\" area in town so it's very easy access to many restaurants and shops.

Consider that's how much the 2-star (or even 1-star) hotels will charge you in a popular city like San Diego, you simply can not beat this price! The only drawback of the hotel is it does charge quite a bit money for guest parking on premise and you pretty much need to have a car for this location as the public transportation is not really close by.

We got up had breakfast-which we thought was good and at a resonable price. Come to New Orleans if ya'll want overpriced -touristy stuff. Took the shuttle to the Zoo/Balboa Park area. Very nice! If you haven't been to the zoo, take the double decked bus first. It takes you all over the zoo, then you can go back to only the places you like. We loved the pandas. Then we went back to the hotel, changed and walked over to this area called \"Little Italy\". We had dinner at a great restaurant- again- very resonable prices. Then it was off to the hotel to rest for the next day. The second day, we awoke and went to breakfast. There was a lot of people, and we had to wait a tad, but it was fine. The General Manager bought us a couple cups of coffee whie we waited. He is a ragin cajun as well- from the bayous. Actually, I am from Kansas, but my partner is from Louisiana. The manager mentioned that they had completed a renovation. It looks like it, as it is very nice. We were then off to downtown. The shuttle dropped us off near the cruise ships, since we were going on the Hornblower. We spent the day on the ocean, then at the USS Midway and ate at Anthony's Fish grotto. Not so great! Anyway, back to the hotel (I forgot what I was reviewing). As i stated before, we slept in the hotel, but spent most of the days on the go. We liked the rooms and the staff- very nice! The shuttle drivers Cory and Eric were extremely nice and helpful. I liked the free wireless internet, or at least my partner did. That is all he did was plan the next day via the computer. The bathrooms had a make up mirror- I have never seen that at a hotel before. And the decor was more like a Westin. Just not the same price. If we go back to San Diego, I would stay again.

And the parking is nauseating, since the building is a circle!!! If you get there after 6 on Saturdays or anytime Sundays, try to save yourself $22, and park on the streets for that day! *There is virtually NO lobby! it is super small. A hotel that is 3 stars typically has a comfortable lobby with ample space to sit, converse and grab a drink and dinner, or to sit on a couch and talk to friends or make phone calls. This was not practical at the holiday inn. The lobby was about 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a typical limited service hotel such as courtyard inn or hampton inn. I am not sure why this is not a holiday inn express. *The restaurant is inexpensive however it is VERY embarrassing. Never at a 3 star type hotel (or a hotel that proclaims to be a full-service hotel) have I ever seen the main restaurant resemble a luncheonette. It was very embarrassing. However as ludicrous as it was, the people working there were very cordial. *The rooms are very small for a hotel in a small-medium sized city. *Pool is pathetic. Treat this as a Holiday Inn Express with a room similar to a 3.5 star hotel. If you are a walker, then this could be used as a great bargain spot while in SD, otherwise it is too far outta the main hub of activity.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Location\u201d", "Author": "jcarl11", "ReviewID": "UR31423604", "Content": "This hotel was close to all the major attractions.

In addition, the bathrooms in each room have been totally remodeled, as the flooring has been replaced. The bedding has more of a Sheraton look and feel with white duvets and very nice selection of pillows and quality sheets. There is even a card on the bed that states that if the pillows on your bed do not satisfy you, please call and request other types that are listed on the pillow selection card. Wow, who would ever expect such an option at a Holiday Inn? The carpeting is very nice and NEW, with a double ring style pattern on a dark green background. Once again, very nice quality of carpeting. I had to keep reminding myself I was in a Holiday Inn and not a Sheraton. It really did have a Sheraton feel.

I actually liked this hotel more than the Emerald Plaza. First, it was nearly just as nice in the rooms. The lobby lacks the luxury of the wyndam, but who really hangs out in the lobby. Second, FREE internet! 15 dollars a day at the wyndam adds up and is inconvient. So I was happy about that. They were also flexible about choosing the type of room, king bed, etc even though i bought it on priceline.

I still remember the night. Our party consisted of my 21 yr son, 22 yr old niece and myself. When booking the room we asked for a roll away as none of us were bedmates. We went out to dinner. Opened the rollaway around 11 pm. It stunk of smoke!!! Soon the odor filled the room. No one could any of us sleep on it. Called the front desk, they did send up another one...even smellier. Turns out (we figured this out, no one admitted this), all their help went into the room where the roll aways were stored to smoke. They obviously knew this. Even though we had gotten a no smoking room, this became a joke. We ended up putting this roll away out the door asap, and jerryrigged a rather uncomfortable sleeping arrangement. I complained in the morning but the staff could have cared less. Did absolutely nothing to try to fix the problem, either the night when I was complaining or during the morning check out process. I wrote a complaint form (the form that always seems to be in rooms these days) and to this day I've not gotten any reaction from the hotel or the chain. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels in my life, either for business or pleasure, and this was one of my most unsatisfying experiences. And the price for the room was (in 1999 $$) almost $200.
