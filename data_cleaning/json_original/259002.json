Each one stunk. I have never had such poor dinner meals in my life and I had seven years in boarding school. With two exceptions the staff were offhanded and disinterested. I have never sent a meal back in my life but did so at this joint. The young trainee I think guy was great as was the boss, the girl and guy on the desk rude and the guy in the bar could not have given a hoot. I was in hospitality and suggest most of the staff did not want to be there or did not like the job. Avoid this place and stay in others of far better quality for the same price.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAn \"experience\", just not a good one\u201d", "Author": "JayT_UK75", "ReviewID": "UR120021410", "Content": "We stayed there for a friends wedding and just one night, so location was more important than mixed reviews on Tripadvisor - I wish we had listened to the poor reviews. The hotel is right next to a rather noisy street and a petrol station (we had a room with a view exactly to that). If not enough the room was to put it mildly \"dated\", the bathroom literally dismantled itself in the process of using it (toilet came loose, shower door came off). Staff tried to be helpful if to no avail, ordering a cab an hour before the wedding which should have arrived in 5min ended up with us nearly missing the ceremony. Breakfast (included) can only be described as mediocre (even Cuban state owned hotels offer more variety, quality and choice). And all that for a not so cheap rate to start with which can not be justified by its location (the only plus). Overall, must be the worst place we have ever stayed in (luckily not for very long).", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for a Roman Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RoaminCatholic", "ReviewID": "UR118372649", "Content": "The Hotel Pacific was in a perfect area of the city for our needs. We stayed there prior to flying to Madrid for World Youth Day in August, 2011. With 80 pilgrims, the hotel staff could have understandably been less than helpful with our group. In fact,m the opposite was true. The staff was engaging with our teens and young adults and very helpful when it came to setting times for dinner, etc. Past reviews I had read of this hotel indicated a \"less than clean atmosphere,\" however we did not experience that at all. The rooms were clean and everything worked well. Many of the rooms have large balconies as well. The WiFi in the hotel was lacking, even with the codes that we received at the front desk. Really the only place the WiFi worked was in the lobby area. The staff in the dining area (contrary to other reviews) were wonderful to us. The self-serve breakfast was always a bit of a problem because we were usually out the door by 7am and that's when breakfast began. However, the staff was willing to open early for us and worked with our schedule well.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPretty awful...\u201d", "Author": "sherry_aulin", "ReviewID": "UR117194603", "Content": "This is my first bad review of a place - I am not that picky and rarely make a fuss about a mediocre place but I would say that for the price, this place really sucked. We only stayed for 2 nights, thank god. Things that were bad: - very rude staff. I called down to reception to ask for the wifi password. The person answering the phone didn't even say hello and then when I asked for the password, he yelled at me over the phone \"come down!\". - the free breakfast (although we really were not expecting much) was awful! They couldn't even get a simple glass of juice or cup of yogurt right - the juice was watered down and tasted more like bad kool-aid and the yogurt didn't even taste like real dairy. - there was a really gross white stain on the bed cover - right in the middle of the bed and was the first thing we noticed when we got to the room (shows just how obvious it was) - when we checked in they gave us a room that hadn't been cleaned yet so we had to go back down to ask for another room and then were made to feel like we were inconveniencing them - mold in the bathroom above the shower (lots of it) - we asked reception for a cab to the airport and he quoted us 60 euro. That seemed high and I got suspicious so looked it up online and was able to find several companies that charged a flat rate of 40 euros! Just goes to show how unhelpful they were. We wouldn't even dream of asking for food recommendations from these people. - we put up the 'do not disturb' sign when we left for the morning as we didnt really want their cleaning staff in our room (we had some valuables and they don't have safes in the rooms). When we came back, the sign was off our door and the room had been serviced - I don't even know what to say about this! Overall, one of the worst places ive stayed at for the price. The only positive I can think of what the free wifi. I've been backpacking through south-east Asia and stayed at nicer places for a tenth of the cost. I booked this place on hotwire.com and it will definitely be the last time I use that service! I would have much rather spent a few extra dollars to stay in a nicer place which is closer to the sites and I suggest you do the same!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cok, but not absolutely perfect\u201d", "Author": "teccyman", "ReviewID": "UR97067042", "Content": "There was mould on the ceiling above the shower, toilet seat was not cleaned properly. the staff were not always, but were sometimes friendly.

The one in our room was broken. The hall porter sent to inspect it was well meaning but so slow. Eventually I was given the key to an empty room. Our bedroom was small and gloomy, the bathroom very small despite the website promising 'spacious bathrooms'. The whole place had an air of being rundown. Breakfast was uninteresting and the coffee - from a machine - was terrible. The bar staff were efficient and pleasant but the bar area as gloomy as the rest. Worst - outside is a very busy road and on either side of the hotel are petrol stations - thus very noisy into the night.

The hotel seems to cater to travelling groups...there were several other tours there at the time. The location is somewhat away from the major tourists areas. The hotel gives you a nice map of the downtown Rome area. The beds are actually worn mattresses on cots. The room size is adequate. The bathroom smelled or mold and the plaster above the shower was peeling. It appeared that the entire bathroom was retrofitted. Our A/C was not working so we had to sleep with the windows open...or not sleep! The street noise was unbearable. There are not too many stores or restaurants in the area as the neighborhood is residential. The staff was great. The morning breakfast was good, basic with cereal, yogurt and croissant. I probably would not have chosen this hotel if I hadn't been with this group.
