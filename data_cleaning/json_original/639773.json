{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Love This Place!!!!!! My boyfriend and I found Ketut's place by accident and immediately fell in love with it. Ketut and Wayan are wonderful hosts and really take great care of you. We stayed in 2 of the more expensive rooms that overlook the river. They are a great deal for what you get----an entire floor to yourself that is built into the side of the cliff overlooking a river. The rooms are beautifully decorated with great views. They will bring breakfast to your patio....so relaxing and romantic. Ketut and Wayan also put on a great 15 course dinner as well as cooking classes. I can't recommend it enough!!", "Date": "Dec 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR158305206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "adventuregirlUsa"}, {"Content": "Average We enjoyed our stay here. It is quiet place. We liked ravine. I persoanally felt I paid more. It should have been cheaper instead. We stayed in Dlx room for 4 nights. Light was not much so mood goes down because of that. No television hence my son was sad. Swimming pool was ok. No telephone in home so everytime you have to order or something you have to goto counter.Drainage - wash basin was not working well for first 2 days. Finally he fixed it. Driver that was made available did not guide us well.+ the place is 10 min walk from main road. With a kid with us it was not a easy walk.We felt Ketut charged us more than what he could have been.

Every other place in Indonesia I stayed at allows you to have whatever you want for breakfast. Saying that, breakfast is delivered bang on time.There's a place called Gusti's which is very similar to this place, but I went to see what it was like and it didn't seem as nice as Ketut's.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR578694323", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OJW"}, {"Content": "Agree with other reviews - stay here! I agree with the other reviews here, so won't repeat anything unnecessarily. We stayed 2 nights in a Deluxe room on the river - I would definitely recommend this option if your budget allows (at our time it was around $50/nt). The rooms are huge and very private with an outdoor living area all to yourself along the [small] river. They are also very close to the pool. We also stayed 2 nights in a basic room, as we had decided once we arrived that we wanted to stay longer. Ketut did all he could to allow us to stay in the first room, but was gracious enough to the guests who had reserved the room not to kick them out for us :) The basic room was still pretty nice, just a little older, smaller, and not right on the river. The setting is a little closer to the family's part of the compound, so you definitely feel a lot closer to the action. There is a nice patio to each room in this area that allows you to read outside in the beautiful gardens, or take your breakfast there in the morning. (Get the banana or pineapple pancakes - they were the best we had while in Indo!) Massages there are nice also - open air facilities on the lowest levels near the river, so good sound effects during your treatment. Very reasonable rates and it's nice to get this done at your hotel rather than going somewhere else. Get the Balinese Massage, I wasn't super impressed with the Foot Reflexology massage, but just wanted to try something new. Ketut is such a nice guy and so helpful -- we felt like he was buddy-buddy with us, but after reading the reviews here, I guess he's like that with everyone :) He booked a river-rafting trip for us very last minute without any complaints. He came and sat with us after dinner and explained about the village ceremonies and his role in the community. It was sad to see other guests being hard on them for issues out of his control. It's out of the way from the village, but I think this is a good thing. It's very near to the start/end of a nice rice paddy walk outlined in Lonely Planet.

Ketut has a gem here, and he knows what it takes to keep people coming back. Staff (most of whom are Ketut's family) are generous, kind, helpful, and warm. Our room (a deluxe, overlooking the river) was stunning, private, and a wonderful place to recharge. Upon check-in we discovered we had no hot water, but Ketut saw to it that this was fixed as soon as possible, and it was. Ketut himself is a wonderful, open man who is eager to help you and provide advice on anything but not in an obtrusive way. He will book almost anything for you and is honest about what is possible and what is not. He is the leader of his village, and the reasons why are obvious. Two things not to be missed if you stay at this property, or anywhere in Ubud: 1) dinner at Ketut's Place, on one of the evenings during the week when he does the Balinese buffet -- not only is it very social and delicious (his family does all the home cooking), but it is also educational, as Ketut will tell you all you need to know about Balinese food, home life, and culture. 2) the Kecak dance, which Ketut will gladly book for you, and is nearby the property. Never before have I been so enthralled and engaged in a piece of theatre / dance / drama. It will take your breath away.I highly recommend Ketut's place -- it is slightly out-of-the way (about a 5-10 minute walk into the center), but definitely worthwhile.

Ketut is a member of a Kecak group and I always loved Indonesian dance and wanted to support it. 2. The feast sounded lovely. 3. The place seemed to be a really good distance from the main shops, far enough away to be peaceful but close enough to walk. I also wanted to stay somewhere that was really owned and run by Balinese people and as Ketut is head of the local banjar it seemed a good idea. All of these things turned out to be true and I had a wonderful time.I stayed for ten days in a deluxe room looking at the wonderful tangle of bamboo, vines, trees and ferns on the side of the ravine opposite. I saw squirrels several times including once from my bed through the window when I was resting in the day time. A beautiful bright blue kingfisher with a red beak flashed past occasionally. Sitting on the quiet, private balcony gave me the rest that I really needed after a very stressful year. The Balinese body massage (had three times) was the best I ever had in my life. On my last day before leaving for the airport for home and work I stayed in Ketut's place all day, relaxing, swimming in the beautiful pool surrounded by lovely plants and statues and having foot reflexology and the Balinese Boreh spice ritual and massage ending with a bath with floating balsam flowers. The bath in the massage area at the bottom of the ravine is private but has open views on the lush vegetation in the ravine. It is overlooked by a lovely stone mermaid.I enjoyed the fresh juices and breakfast omelettes and the Balinese feast was magnificent. As another reviewer has commented, I met very nice, interesting people at the dinners.Ketut and Wayan and all their family and staff were lovely to me. I felt really privileged to be invited to the ceremonies at the temple celebrating the temple's birthday where I saw four wonderful Barong arriving in the processions and the temple dancing of Rejeng and Baris. The older bungalow rooms upstairs looked very beautiful and peaceful but I liked my private balcony in the deluxe room. The gardens were very beautiful. It was lovely that the gods received offerings each day and the red hibiscus flowers were renewed at their feet. It has given me strength to go home and continue with life knowing that such a lovely place exists and that I can go back sometime.Nambijin, Kununurra", "Date": "Feb 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819980663", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nambijin"}, {"Content": "Wonderful oasis run by a lovely family       the view from our verandah (pool to the left)", "Date": "Feb 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR577143327", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bimdonesia"}, {"Content": "Fabulous family-runplace -ended up staying for 13 nights as I loved it so much       The pool", "Date": "Dec 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR411001189", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tcyokohama"}, {"Content": "Overrated-only fair Read in Lonely Planet about this B  B.
