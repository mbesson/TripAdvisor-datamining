We ended up having to stay extra nights due to Hurricane Isaac and all of the staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable & safe. There was even a complimentary breakfast & dinner on those days. All in all, Becky and all of the staff made us fall in love with New Orleans and with the Whitney Wyndham Hotel.

The front desk staff were excellent and very helpful. Very nice atmosphere in an old historic bank. On the flip side we were not happy with the housekeeping in our room. The first night we had stained and ripped sheets, although clean it was time to throw this set out. We put the card on our bed saying we would like them changed the next night. We got back late the next night and to our surprise we found the maid had put a small size fitted sheet on our queen bed so two corners did not even fit on the bed so we had to get the front desk to get us a sheet to fit at 11 pm. We changed the bed ourselves and then the next day the maid took away our top sheet. We even tipped a maid to get us an extra pillow and she never brought us one. There were also items on the floor that were never picked up when we got in the room (used kleenex, stir stick etc). Plus each day the disposable cups and coffee was not replaced daily. We stay at a lot of hotels and this is the first I have wrote a review on the housekeeping. A hotel like the Wyndham should have a higher standard. We ate once at the restaurant, the food was tasty but lukewarm at best. The lettuce was not washed well as there were big pieces of dirt stuck to the lettuce. Internet was available but difficult to get, it only really worked in their front salon. Enjoyed the jug of lemon water they always had available at the tour desk.

From the huge safe door that is displayed proudly in the open position so that you can see the inner working of the door and locks to the check in area which was once a tellers area.

The only good thing I can think of is maybe the location. This hotel is about 3 blocks from Canal Street and maybe 4 blocks from Bourbon Street and Harrah's casino. Of course there are hotels everywhere in that area, so it's not like this hotel has a lock on location. The bad started at checkin which was painfully slow with one of the clerks being downright surly. Four of us were staying in one room, but initially were given only two keys. After requesting 2 more keys we started a 3 day game of who's key doesn't work today. We actually had to get all 4 keys reprogrammed twice. Coming in late Saturday night (okay very early Sunday morning) the key didn't work. Went to front desk. No one there but another guest that had been waiting 45 minutes. A call from my phone to the hotel woke up the clerk sleeping in the back. They should really put a bell or buzzer at the desk. Next issue, every morning between 9:00 and 9:30 housekeeping knocked on the door. Seriously...who gets up that early in New Orleans over the weekend? I didn't particularly like hearing \"We leave at 11:30\" through the door. I felt like my relaxing weekend was being dictated by housekeeping staff. On no day were enough towels left by housekeeping. The first day we got 2 face cloths and 3 bath towels and the next no face cloths at all. The two double bed room was cramped. Barely accomodating the two beds, the chest that doubled as a TV stand and closet, a desk and 1 (ONE) chair. There was no actual closet. The only way to hang clothes was to take the ironing board out of the chest, but then there was nowhere to put the ironing board. It was a weekend of stepping over and on suitcases. The bathroom was a good size, but the door stuck so that it didn't close fully and made a loud annoying sound when being tugged (and I mean tugged hard) to open. The bathroom door really needed to be closed because it opened right into the sleeping area...well the whole room was the sleeping area. I believe the door stuck because there was absolutely no ventilation in the bathroom. That's the \"historic\" part again I guess. Our room was at the back of the hotel I guess because the building backs up to another building. That meant that our one small (historic) frosted window let in zero light. No we didn't actually spend a lot of time in the room, but the little time we did spend there was pretty stressful. The best thing about the hotel is the restaurant. The breakfast was the most reasonable we found in the area. The service was excellent and the food great. Frankly I'm pretty sure there are better choices in the area and I'll definitely find another hotel to try for my next visit.

I was unfamiliar with New Orleans and the reasons I booked the Whitney, besides location, was that (a)Parking was advertised as free on-site and (b) both my companion & I has some work to attend to, and free wi-fi was included. Unfortunately both these facilities were not available When I arrived at the Whitney, my reservation had not been received. I was asked to wait, and wait I did. I sat in the lobby for 50mins, being updated after 35mins to be told that the fax had been received. Then when I asked about parking I was told there was a fee. The receptionist would not uphold my booking.com invoice, which clearly states that there was free parking. She told me parking was premium in New Orleans - which I was aware of and was the reason I paid that bit extra for the Whitney as I though we were getting parking included. My contract was with booking.com, I felt that the hotel should have honoured that booking and the facilities that they had (falsely) advertised - I see this has been changed on the booking.com website since. This error did not lie with me, yet it was I who had to pay the additional $66 for parking across the street. There is free-WIFI in the hotel..... but not if you have Apple products! My Iphone & Mac would not connect. I asked the female receptionist about this and she said that my security settings were set too high. When I checked, my settings seemed fine. I could not amend the problem. Later that evening, I approached a male receptionist about this and he told me that the hotel has ALWAYS had that problem, that they had spent $16,000 on the system and no-one knows why it is not compatible with Apple. I was furious. I had spent over an hour of my afternoon trying & fix it. If she had been honest with me initially, I would not have minded as much. There is a PC just off the lobby but the software is so archaic. I could not access my documents, gmail was in HTML, hotmail would not open as no ActiveX. I ended up having to go down town to an internet cafe, spending $20 for 24h access. All in all, the hotel is very nice. Good location, nice rooms.

If we had only stayed two or three nights, I would have given it 4 stars, but I did keep noticing little things that brought down my overall opinion. The room was clean and comfortable. Bed was great. Fine mattress, nice bedding. Shower had plenty of hot water. Lots of granite, brass and crown molding to give the feel of an upscale place. No closet, but a spacious enough armoire. Room and bathroom weren't enormous, but both a little bigger than average. Had a nice desk, though no table when there was plenty of room for one. Ancient, smallish TV, I'd guess a 19 incher with a relatively limited channel selection, but we weren't there to watch TV. Can't beat the location, maybe a quarter to a third of a mile away from the French Quarter, Convention Center and the Superdome all. Staff were all pleasant enough. 6th floor ice machine was broken the whole stay. Cashier wouldn't break a bill for me so I could tip the housekeeper. They lost my check-in paperwork and I had to come back down and fill it out again. Our view was a fine enough city view, but I would have hated to have been on the other side of the building, which has a monstrous newer building six feet outside the window. No view from that side but a concrete wall. Old AC unit in our room gradually stopped working. Ice had accumulated inside it, blocking the flow. We endured one hot night to get it back working right. Housekeepers were mostly fine, but they never got there before midafternoon. No pool. Didn't use the restaurant or check to see if there's an exercise room. It was fine enough.

The check in and valet parking were swift and the staff were nice and efficient. Our room, a corner king suite, was enormous, quiet, beautifully appointed and a great deal at only $120 a night (other comparable hotels we usually stay at Easter weekend were considerably more during this period). There is a small restaurant on the first floor operated by a local chain, Lil' Dizzy's cafe. It was, however, always strangely empty the entire time we were there. The hotel's location is wonderful, right in the heart of the CBD and nestled right next to Poydras Center. It is a short walk to all the trendy restaurants in the CBD and also quite close to the Warehouse/Arts District and a relatively short walk to the French Quarter. The St. Charles streetcar line, which takes goes Uptown and all the way to Riverbend, is located cattycorner to the hotel. The hotel has a luxurious air, but people who like super-modern, up to date amenities might be disappointed to note that there aren't large-screen TVs in the rooms (at least there weren't in ours). One thing that did bother me was there was a set of side access doors on the ground floor right next to the guest room elevators and across from the deserted cafe that at least appeared to be well out of view of the front desk (perhaps they monitor it by hidden camera).

I'm sitting in a very comfortable bed in room 507 typing this review. Our room overlooks Poydras Street, and we are here during Mardi Gras. The parades were a little loud last night (they were within a 100 yards of our window), but after walking around town all day everyone was tired and we slept well. The bed was firm and very comfortable. I cannot comment in the Wi-Fi. I don't use it on my computer, I tether to my cell phone. Thus no need to access the service. The staff was wonderful. We were given wristbands for access to the property, but I never felt the need to wear them. The doorman Kevin took the time to get to know us, and he recognized us whenever we returned. The front desk provided a city map and recommendations for local restaurants. I met the manager Casey Callais, and found a man very interested in the hospitality his staff and property delivers to each guest. He was not distracted while talking to me as if I were an interruption, but an engaged and genuinely interested listener. I've read negative posts about the condition of the property, and did not share the experience. The motel is in a historic building renovated into a hotel. The furnishings are antique and appropriate for the decor. We had no closet, but the room did have a large armoire perfect for our clothes hanging needs and than some. As with any antique furniture there is visible evidence the furniture has history, but none of the furniture looked like it came from a thrift store. If one looks hard enough and nit-picks, flaws can be identified at any resort this one included. However, my experience was completely positive, and I would not hesitate to return to this property. For dinner yesterday we tried Mothers a few blocks down the street, and they are a must try for their delicious po'boy sandwiches. I had their \"Famous Ferdi Special (original) with ham, roast beef and debris gravy. There was a line outside the building, but it moves fast and you look at the menu while reading. We barely had time to decide on what to eat before it was time to order. Harrah's Casino was just a block or two past the restaurant. I can't comment further because we never went inside. Walking around outside in the local area I never felt we were in the \"wrong neighborhood\" even with my 11 year old granddaughter with us. Another restaurant for seafood lovers is Deanie's Seafood on Iberville Street in the French Quarter. I watched Adam on Man vs. Food rave about the shrimp and I have to agree the meal was awesome. My only regret, I got the appetizer size rather than the full meal.

Overall, I'd describe the quality as a 3.5 star, not as nice as the nearby Intercontinental, Sheraton, or Marriott, but a step above the Courtyard or Holiday Inns. The room was a bit on the small side, but clean (just a little mildew in the bath) and comfortable. The feel of the place is vintage/boutique, it's a smaller hotel located in a converted historic bank building. Internet is free if you sign up in advance for Wyndham's free \"By Request\" program. Unusual for New Orleans: no pool. Also unusual: there are no in-room safes. When we asked about using the safe at the front desk, we were told that would incur a $25 fee. That's exorbitant for a service that is usually free or maybe a buck or two a day at most hotels. The other negative was the attitude of the staff: not rude but somewhat indifferent. As a smaller property, there seemed to often be only one person working the desk, and they often were away from the desk area or locked in a back office. You shouldn't have to wait for 5 minutes to see a desk clerk, not midday when there's no other guests waiting. On the last morning, our water pressure dropped on our (top) floor, to the point that the shower wasn't working. Okay, that happens, especially in an older building. But when we called to inquire, they couldn't tell us when it would be resolved, didn't offer to call us when it was fixed, didn't offer to let us use a room on a lower floor with a working shower, didn't offer any compensation, and didn't even apologize.

The bed was very firm for my taste, but I may be an oddity. Parking was $28.00 a day (ouch!), but that's New Orleans. I could have parked across the street in a commercial lot, but the valet service was a splurge for me. My car was delivered promptly when I called for it.

When we entered the room we found garbage left from the previous guest, an uncleaned toilet, but we didn't find an alarm clock or working internet connection (neither wired nor wireless, and this situation existed dring our whole stay, for 3 days!!!) When I called the front desk they said they couldn't send up an alarm clock as they didn't have any more. Nice, huh? Next morning I talked to the manager on duty, who apologized and promised to separate us a different room. When we got back to the hotel we got the new room with a king size bed and a sofa which sounded good. Too bad, both of the cushions of the sofa had 2 holes on them and most of the rest of the furniture was almost collapsing (lamps, desk, the piece at the end of the bed) and it just added to our bad feelings. Despite the whole hotel interior, as an old design, originally looked good, by now, as the hotel is very shabby, it just looks poor and sad. Absolutely and most definitely NOT a 3.5-star hotel!!! Since internet was never available in the room, I needed to go downstairs to the lobby and catch another enterprise's wireless signal in order to be able to get online.

First, upon check in, we were told that they sold the last double room, and our reservation was for a double room. The front desk agent says for 50 dollars more a night, I can upgrade you to a suite and you can have a sleeper sofa. I request to speak to a manager on duty and she tells me there isn't one. I AM OUTRAGED and feel UNSAFE! I have never in my life seen a hotel that does not have a MANAGER on DUTY for weekend issues. We settle for a king size bed, 3 people in one bed, it was a HORRIBLE weekend. That was just the beginning, the next day, I check my account online, and see a 215 dollar charge from the hotel. The hotel was prepaid so I knew it should have no charge on it. I go to the front desk and ask why, and they said they made a mistake at check in. I said ok, lets fix the mistake. Front desk agent said she couldn't. I request to speak to a manager, and guess what? There is no manager on duty, the front desk agent calls someone and hands me the phone. The woman states she is a manager, and I tell her this needs to be fixed. She says she will call my bank whenever she gets a chance... I said you have got to be kidding me... I threaten to contact the police for credit card fraud and the \"manager\" hangs up on me. I call my bank and dispute the charge. This hotel is ran by UNTRAINED and UN-PROFESSIONAL personnel.

What a wonderful stay! We won this hotel on Priceline for a very reasonable rate. Yet, when I read the reviews on TripAdvisor I had second thoughts but boy am I glad I had a chance to see the hotel for myself. There are a lot of hotels in New Orleans and this one could not have been more convenient for the purpose of our trip. We were in town for the Celine Dion concert and wanted to be within walking distance. It turns out the Arena was only about 8 blocks from the hotel. With the high parking rates we decided not to rent a car and all worked out perfectly. We caught a taxi at the airport for $28 plus $2 fuel surcharge. So $60 RT wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad considering it would have cost $95 for a 3-day rental plus $75 in parking fees. We arrived at the hotel around 12:45 and the rooms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready yet. It was Friday and there appeared to be a large group of businessmen/women leaving that day. We asked the front desk to check our luggage and to notify us via cell phone once the rooms were ready. The hotel provided us with a mad and we headed out to do some sightseeing. Just over an hour later we received the call that our rooms were ready. We were in the Garden District when we received the call and decided to finish our tour before heading back to the hotel. After checking in we headed up to the 5th floor to see what the room consisted of. We were pleasantly surprised. I had called ahead and requested a non-smoking, double bed room with a view. Ok, so they only gave us two things we asked for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the double beds and non-smoking. The window turned out to be frosted glass and faced the tall executive building immediately behind the Wyndham. The beds looked very comfortable (the sheets were clean although the comforters showed some obvious signs of wear), the floor was clean and there was a nice desk area as well as a chaise lounge in the corner of the room which was also very comfortable. It was snug, particularly because the Armoire sat directly in front of one bed with about 18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of walkway. The bathroom was very large and had all of the amenities one could think of: shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit, shower cap, mouthwash, etc. If you needed anything additional, the front desk had this as well. It was well stocked with towels and soap and even had an extendable makeup mirror \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very nice for us ladies. There was a restaurant onsite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lil Dizzy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. I have added a copy of the menu in my photos. The menu consisted of your typical New Orleans dishes and desserts. On Sunday they serve brunch (buffet only for $19.99) until 2pm. Other posters have mentioned that there are no restaurants close to the hotel but that is not true. We ventured out and ate at Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one day (famous celebrity hangout) and the food was AWESOME! It is only 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks away and serves the biggest breakfast for $9 pp that I have ever seen. There is also a fine dining restaurant on the west end of the block that opens for dinner only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I believe it is by reservation only but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there. If you care to travel a bit, there are Starbucks, Shula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s McDonalds, Arby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, etc. all on Canal Street about 4 blocks north of the hotel. Checkout was a breeze. We were asked if we needed transportation but we declined, we had made arrangements with our driver to pick us up at a certain time. We were very pleased with the front desk staff who were very helpful as well as the waitstaff. The hotel is centrally located - only 4 blocks to the French Quarter, 8 blocks to the Superdome and the Arena and about 10 blocks to the Cruise Terminal. We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stayed at a Wyndham in years and will definitely be looking at them in the future. Tip: If you plan to use the Streetcars or bus to get around, there is a store called Unique Grocery on Royal Street that sells 1-day unlimited use passes for $5/day or for 3/days it is $12.

This was our 4th vacation trip to New Orleans, our favorite vacation spot, but only our first Mardi Gras. Because my arthritis has gotten progressive worse and I have a hard time walking, we decided to stay closer to the parade route on St Charles instead of in our usual B&B in the French Quarter. The Whiney is one short block away from St Charles and the perfect location. When we checked in, they gave us plastic arm bands so we could have easy access to the hotel. The staff checked for the armbands at the door and people without them did not get in to use the facilities. Our room was on the 7th floor and it was very elegant. I asked for non-smoking and the room was great (did not smell like smoke at all). The staff cleaned up the room everyday and left chocolates on the pillows. The bathroom was huge and had all luxurious extras. We ate breakfast everyday in the restaurant in the lobby. The food was great, the service was wonderful, and the restaurant was in what used to be the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobby with lots of marble columns and brass teller windows and the funniest mural of movie stars from the 40s standing in line at the bank. Since I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk very well, the doorman always flagged me down a cab which was hard to do during Mardi Gras with all the streets blocked off for the parades all day. All of the staff at this hotel was wonderful during our stay, very friendly and accommodating. During checkout, the clerk noticed a mistake on our bill (charge for parking and we had no car) and she corrected it immediately before mentioning it to us, we might not have even noticed. The only downside was that the Whitney is two blocks away from the main Police Station. Normally, this would not be a bad thing, but during Mardi Gras the police sirens were screaming all night long. Across from this hotel is a 10 story parking garage so the noise level from the street from those police car sirens echoed between the parking garage and the hotel so we would just fall asleep and there goes a police car with its sirens and lights again, echoing up to my room and waking me up again. We stayed an extra day after all the madness, Ash Wednesday, and the noise level was down to normal and we slept and relaxed and had a wonderful time.We had the time of our lives celebrating Mardi Gras in New Orleans. I find the people of Louisiana very friendly, helpful and caring, not only those working in the hotels, stores and restaurants, but the people along the parade route that shared their ladders and chairs with me so I could enjoy my first Mardi Gras.

Upon check-in, we were really hassled by the desk clerk who fought us for 15 minutes on honoring our government rate reservation saying that my wife's ID was insufficient to prove government employment, despite the fact that her co-workers had checked in and she was paying with a government check. She insisted on charging us a higher rate for the room and was clearly bothered when a supervisor approved the pricing. The girl even told us in front of other guests that she was going to have to \"run the check\" (presumably Telecheck) to assure that it was not a fake. We were upset and embarassed. When we finally got up to the room, neither room key worked and we had to go back to the front desk to get that problem fixed. The room was plenty big, but laid out in such a way that the foot of the bed is uncomfortably close to the dresser while the right side of the room is open and barely used. The bathroom was nice and had a coffee maker in it with real mugs and a \"grooming caddy\" with lotion, mouthwash, etc. The hair dryer was plenty strong. The bathroom was fairly spacious. Problem areas were that the toilet handle had a tendency to stick and one of our towels was very dirty. The shower had relatively low water pressure. The desk could have been bigger with all the space in the room, but it was adequate. The ergonomic chair was nice. No refrigerator or microwave, but the room did have a luggage stand and an iron and ironing board. The TV actually had a limiter on volume. The max volume was about half of the maximum of a TV at home. The building may have been a bank in older days and has a huge vault door by the front desk. This likely explains why the lower floor is not well designed for hotel purposes. The obvious way for us to get around the $10.00 per day internet charge was to use the free internet service in the lobby. However, the computer was a very big, very old model, the printer was an old $30 Lexmark, and, if memory serves me right, the monitor was an old 15\" CRT yellowed from age. The Internet was VERY slow and I don't know if it was the computer or the provider that caused this. It sure seems that a few hundred dollars could modernize this setup and why the Whitney hasn't spent that is a mystery. The bed was comfortable, the location was excellent and was within 6 blocks of the Mississippi River, The French Quarter, Canal Street, the casino, and Bourbon Street. About two blocks over, you could catch the trolley that services The French Quarter and ride for a bargain $1.25. The hotel food was limited and the small restaurant was leased out to an individual who offered Denny's like menus and fare.....at about double the price. It just did not look or smell anything other than average. The good news is that Mother's is about three blocks down which offers a pretty famous Cajun breakfast that you can get for less than $5.00 between 7-9 a.m. One nice hotel feature that we asked for and got was the checking of our luggage at the front desk upon checkout (noon), at no charge, so that we could sightsee without dragging our luggage around. Our flight was in the evening. It was easy to catch a cab from the hotel. Also, to be fair, our service issue was with one employee.....but it was a pretty big problem. Others were courteous. No problem with housekeeping. We won't go back simply because of the way we were treated by a very aggressive front desk clerk. It would be a harder call to scratch this hotel off our list if everything else was above average....but it's not.

The bartender passed over our drink order 3 times to help other people in the room.

Nor would I recommend it for families since it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a pool or a kid friendly restaurant.", "Date": "August 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dwoods1073", "ReviewID": "UR2111698", "Content": "The Whitney looks like a great hotel on the surface. The location is great and the common areas are clean and modern looking. However, the rooms are run-down. The rug was dirty, the bedspread looked threadbare and the rooms looked like they could use a good steam-cleaning. The rate was good but I expect more from a Wyndham property.

The hotel lobby and comon afreas are nice and the bank vault etc. is pretty cool. However, our rooms were not as nice. The carpet was stained, the bedspread was old and dirty and housekeeping was very poor. For instance, we used a blanket on our bed (instead of the bedspread). when housekeeping would make up our room the blanket would be thrown aside (not folded) and we even found pillows on the floor. Also, the walls were all dirty - definitely does not look like a newer hotel! I thnk they actually got the room furnishings from older Wyndham hotels. All in all, it was an okay stay at a good rate but I would not stay again.", "Date": "April 30, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Whitney Hotel - A Wyndham Historic Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d218544-Reviews-Whitney_Hotel_A_Wyndham_Historic_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$108 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">610 Poydras Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70130</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "218544", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/06/fa/06fa2969a3d7cacb1f151254bbe6e04a2large.jpg"}}
