The location is great because you dont have to take your car out to go down the poblado( just a short walk) The apartment had 2 bedrooms and a sofa bed,2 tv and the central air work great. I call my daugther and her husband and they came to stay with us with their 3 year old son. The place it was very clean and roomy. It has everything that you need to cook (pots and pans, glasses plates everything. The place doesnt have room service so dont expect to see anyone around you pleasing you. I will stay there in a heartbeat again. You can't beat it for the price.

The place was old, poorly maintained, dark and dingy, and way too far from the beach to be classed as a \"beach\" hotel. The telephone and the oven did not work, the bathroom was old, and there were many basics missing including dish soap, tea towels and other similar items. The only positive was the congenial and very friendly manageress, other than that, staying there was a big mistake.

The rooms were very clean comfortable. Kitchens in the suits were well equipped and staff service was great. Had booked a two bedroom unit and was upgraded to a three on arrival!! Loved how there were two bathrooms and the balcony was nice for drying bathing suits. I have stayed at a number of places in Puerto Rico and this hotel gives you the most bang for your buck. I would highly recommend this hotel to singles and families alike! Should mention the hotel is not geared for people looking to spend a lot of time there,. The pool is nothing to get excited over and there is not a real common area to be in.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cDid not like the stay\u201d", "Author": "acee53", "ReviewID": "UR7869339", "Content": "My family (all adults) and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days. It is a small 3 bedroom apartment-hotel. Seemed clean, but the inside of the closet slats were dusty as well as the ceiling fans. We were sneezing, and woke up with stuffy nose every single day. Furniture and bathroom need some updating and could see the wear and tear. Kitchen is equipped, but did not use any of the utensils/ dinnerware. Glasses were dirty. The key to turn on the A/C is in the same key chain as the entrance door and the electronic gate opener. If you leave the apartment you are forced to turn the AC off. The key will not come off unless you turn it off. All keys are in the same key chain and cannot come off, the chain is welded so the keys will not come off. A hassle as we were in 2 cars and going separate ways, coming and going at different times. Some vertical blinds cannot open, chain broken. Others can be slided to the side but not completly. Parking lot is about 5 houses down the street, has an electronic gate.
