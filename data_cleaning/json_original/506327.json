Unfortunately, we got mixed up with Hotel 81 Joochiat & Hotel Classic & so we were surprise with what our actual choice was. At first, we were surprise to find the lobby clean and presentable considering the district it was in. We paid $70 for 1 night, and felt it was very reasonable. We were happy to receive a nice first impression. Checking in was also very efficient and fast in the day time. However there was no one to help us with our luggages so we had to carry everything on our own. We were given the 4th storey room directly infront of the elevator which we found accessible. We were told that at night the hotels are normally fully book on an hourly basis. Our double bed bedroom was extremely small, with only the necessities you need. The bed was considered big and comfortable, however the sheets were badly stain with things i shall not discuss. There was even red oily stains on the wall. My boyfriend and I ended up sleeping in our sleeping bags on the bed. The cupboard had no doors and hangers that were non removable. The dressing table was small. But it was nice to receive noodles and a pack of milo and coffee complimentary. The bathroom is even smaller. But we found it rather clean. I love the shower. It had those pressure shower hose kind of thing and it was nice. It had only the basic toiletries you ever need. There were some stains on the towels, so thankfully we brought our own. And at night, the hotel lobby was filled with people, but yet a very silent and still environment. I was told of the entertainment situation in that district, but it was my first experience seeing it upfront. Location was good, it was about a 15min walk to the MRT and you can get to town within 20mins. You get to see and explore the Malay village of Singapore along the way to the MRT too. It was an eye opener for us. There are 2 7-elevens nearby, so you never go hungry at night. And it was about 15mins to the East Coast Beach. And due being in the East area, we easily reach Changi Airport less than 15mins too. It is all highly accessible in Singapore.

I was concerned at first about the possible problems that we may encounter with the place as as so-called \"entertainment area\". True enough we saw them waiting for potential customers but they never harass or intimidate anyone in our group. There were no pimps around. They mind their own business as we mind our own. As a Industrial Relations practioners, I respect them for the job they are in. The hotel is clean and well organized but lack staff being a budget one. Isaac, one of staff was a very pleasant one. It lives to it being a ISO 9000 ceritfied by SGS. While there is no breakfast, they provide you with Milo and 3 in 1 coffee and a cup of noodles per room every day. The room size is good enough for us. Other facilities are operational. It is close to MRT station of Aljunied. There are plenty of food outlets like the Victoria Food Court. There are 7-11 and Cheers outlets where you get your needs. Taxi is easy to get but economical if there are 4 riders otherwise you can walk to the MRT, it is healthier. For budget conscious persons like us, we will take Hotel 81 Geylang and fly Tiger Airways again if given the opportunity to visit Singapore. Thanks. Federico G.
