When I visited in April 2011, I stayed in a large beautiful room which impressed both me and my friend. However, after booking a stay in February, I became a little unsure of the hotel. We were greeted at the desk by a very helpful gentleman named Vitor (who became our saviour throughout the trip) and given our keycard. As we entered our double room, we realised that perhaps part of the hotel had been renovated, and this was one of the older rooms. In my friend's opinion, it resembled \"a cave\". With old brickwork, a tiny bathroom and overall, a small room, we decided to ask if we were able to change room. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked and we were told if we wanted to change for our second night, we would be able to. Although we felt like we were creating a hassle by asking this, Vitor seemed to know where we were coming from and instantly made a note for the next member of staff on shift that we were wanting to change rooms. The next day, we returned to the desk to ask if we were able to change rooms and were presented with another key card for a room which was much nicer than the previous. The hotel is in a rather good area if you are travelling to and from Kings Cross or are needing to be in that specific area. If you are wanting to be in the city centre, where you'd like the ability to walk everywhere, perhaps Covent Garden Travelodge is more suited for you. There are buses and tubes run from near the hotel though, so if you're okay with travelling then this hotel is okay.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRun down hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rick D", "ReviewID": "UR125686232", "Content": "This hotel is desperately in need of full renovation.

Just a clean bed and bathroom. I only, however, got half of this. The bed was lovely and comfortable, no complaints there at all. It was the bathroom that I was disappointed with. For once, it was nice to have an actual bath instead of just a shower, but the condition of the bath wasn't great. There were holes in the bath that had clearly been poorly filled in - it was something you would do at home, not something you'd expect when staying in Central London, even if it was cheap. Also, the carpet was all frayed at the edges and poorly fitted. There was also a light in the room that wouldn't stop flickering, and eventually went out. However, the bulb was changed the next day, so really no complaints. Other than that it was alright. But the little things really do matter. What made it worse was that it was a fifteen minute walk to King's Cross Station (which is the nearest tube station, not Farringdon station as first thought) and that we passed another TWO Travelodge's to get to it. Another thing that made it worse was that there was a Holiday Inn exactly opposite where we were staying!

On the plus side the bedding was clean and there was plentiful hot water. The bathroom was dated but generally clean, although the toilet bowl was cracked and the hooks on the back of the door were broken. The room was very small with the double bed pushed right up against the wall on two sides. The mattress was very soft and there was a fag-burn on the duvet. The pillows were wafer thin and when we asked for more we were told there weren't any. The lighting was peculiar; it was all-or-nothing so any hopes of reading in bed evaporated. The remote control for the TV didn't work. The traffic noise, even with double glazing, was very loud. The location of the hotel was absolutely fine for the price. Kings Cross is only a short walk away, or about \u00c2\u00a36 in a taxi if you have a lot of bags, and the walk felt safe. There aren't many restaurants in the immediate vicinity but, as you're in central London, you would have to be severely lacking in imagination not to be able to find somewhere.

The bar is spacious, and the food better than I expected, the drinks fairly priced. Our room on the third floor at the back, was bigger than an average Travelodge room, with a comfortable king size bed (but only 1 thin pillow each).

This hotel does not meet up to the usual 'basic, but still clean and pleasant' trademark of other travelodges.

The 'double' bed was also two twins pushed together - which we wouldn't mind if it still functioned as a double (as in other travelodges!)...but it didn't! It was very much two twin beds. The bathroom was also very old and run-down. Perhaps the biggest negative was the shower as we couldn't get water of a useable temperature out of it - I kid you not...it was either water that felt like it had come from a frozen lake or out of a boiling kettle!!...no matter what time of day we tried it! We had to resort to hand washing as the water temperature was useless! Breakfast was a disappointment too. You usually know what to expect - basic but ok. When we managed to get a table it was filthy. The cutlery trays were empty and the hot food wasn't replenished readily enough. Overall a bismal experience to be honest. On a positive note, we couldn't fault the staff - we received a friendly welcome on arrival (and checkout) at reception, and staff were generally pleasant. However, we were questioned on checkout though as to how we rated our stay and interrogated when we said we felt let down and disappointed.

This is a Travelodge. In Central London. It cost me \u00c2\u00a359 on a flexible (cancellable) rate. You are not going to find a 4 star hotel at this price in this location. Ever. This hotel was perfect for what we needed: a place to crash after a Christmas party. We checked in on a Friday afternoon about half an hour before the official check-in time and at no extra cost. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were given Room 122 (first floor at the front of the building direclty opposite the lifts) which was clean. The bathroom was minuscule but I wasn't planning a night in with a relaxing bath so this wasn't a problem. We spent most of our time out so the room itself wasn't important. More important to me is the location; because of where the hotel is situated we were able to walk to and from everywhere we needed to get to including Clerkenwell, Russell Square, St Pancras and Euston. We were very late back so I don't know what night time noise was like but from about 8am I started to hear the lift noise and people talking outside the room but that's to be expected with a room directly opposite the lift. The traffic noise didn't bother me too much, neither did the slight rumbling from the tube. It's central London - what do you expect? I'm still utterly perplexed about why they only provide three pillows in a double room but you can ask for more if you need them! I was dreading staying in this hotel after reading the reviews. I needn't have worried. It was clean, cheap, central and the staff were friendly.

The hotel kindly supplied some soap, which was the size of an After Eight Mint. The TV didn't work at first, there was no remote control in the room. My husband went to get a remote and an ironing and ironing board, which arrived via the porter about 45 mins later. The remote only turned the tv on, the rest of the controls didn't work. The TV had serious echo on it. The iron leaked water even when it was supposed to be set at steam. The window didn't lock properly which since it was on the 4th floor wasn't a security problem but it was cold being December. My husband (free of charge to the hotel) fixed their dodgy window, mainly to prevent me jumping out of it in a fit of depression. The curtains were filthy. The bathrooms are nasty, the taps are in serious need of descaling. In fact I'd recommend a complete rip out and refit. The noise in the corridoors was ridiculous between 3am and 6am.

No remote, we had to stand on a chair to change channels or switch it off (the wall control panel didn't work despite Omar insisting it did - we aren't THAT dumb, guys); and our room overlooked the entry where cabbies stood and smoked and argued (not what I wanted to hear at 6.30am).

I'd viewed the reviews before I booked and wondered if it was really that bad, but decided to book it anyway. I was not disappointed! To those who have griped and moaned about the property, it is NOT a Travelodge in the usual style; it is a hotel they have taken over and are modernising to their ways, but compromises have to be made as the company fits in their styles to an existing layout. You just can't knock it down and start again! Location wise from Kings Cross Station, it is about a 15 minute walk, or about 5 minutes on the #63 bus. Check-in was \"clinical\", no use of first names etc, but the clerk was friendly. My room was 210, a single room at the rear of the hotel, spacious as single rooms go, dust free (and I know all the usual dust hidey holes) - full marks to Housekeeping! The Bathroom was spotless; again no dust, and all surfaces smear free. However, the bathroom was a tad small. Functional, but tight space wise! Plus, the designer who decided where the toilet roll holder should be located, ought to be shot! it should be relocated where it doesn't physically rearrange your shoulder as you manouvre towards the loo! But cleanliness wise, full marks again to Housekeeping! Best of all, there was a heated Towel Rail in the bathroom, which in the morning meant the chill was taken off the bathroom; why can't other hotels follow suit? Other facilities in the room worked fine, except the light over the bed, but I reported that to reception on my way out, and later in the evening on my return, it had been fitted with a new bulb. I'd a comfortable night's sleep too. I didn't use the Cafe Bar in the evening, but later on when returning to the hotel, it appeared to be the most soulless place on Earth when viewed from the outside. I did however have Breakfast there in the morning. Yes, it is a self service Buffet style, but the quality was good, the food hot and fresh, and no complaints with the quality. But two small points. The Toaster runs at two speeds, dead slow and stop! You have to place your slices of bread in twice to achieve something resembling \"brown\" on a toasting scale! Whilst I had my breakfast at a quiet period, queues still built up at thr toaster. Attention Travelodge - install a second unit, increase the browning rate on the units if possible and delays will quickly reduce. Secondly, the Juice machine was faulty; Orange Juice came out as 98% water, 1% Colour and 1% Flavour. Even though personnel were told it had obviously run out of juice, in half an hour when I was there, no-one fixed that flavour. OK, I'd one of the other choices of juices, and the rest of the breakfast made up for the shortcomings of Orange Juice availablility. Yes, the building is a bit tired. Yes it obviously has seen better days, but to all those who have griped before on other reviews, read the online brochure. It clearly states that refurbishment in ongoing and that contractors will be working in the building from 8am to 6pm; construction noise might even occur. Thus, expect all of that when visiting this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised and when in London again, will book ahead for this hotel. As stated in other reviews, I'm an ex-Hotel GM, so I see problems from both the staff and the customer viewpoints. There are no problems with this property that can't be fixed during the refurbishment. Give it time; the hotel and its staff are doing well already.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service and a free upgrade\u201d", "Author": "Lovely_Liv", "ReviewID": "UR120609493", "Content": "I went to this hotel expecting the worst, the walk was further than I thought from Kings Cross but when I got there I was greeted by the friendly receptionist.

There were 8 rooms booked for a party of about 20, some of them family rooms. At the time of booking, my mother in law requested that we all have rooms together. The member of staff she spoke to told us that the rooms on the top floor had recently been refurbished and if we called nearer the time they would place us all together on this floor. As we were all arriving at different times, we were checking in at different times and 3 families booked in together. We were given a room on the top floor which had obviously been vacated that morning as the beds were unmade, wet towels were on the floor, dirty cups laid about and it stunk. After complaining, and after discussion witht the housekeeper who insisted the room was clean, (her attitude stunk even more) we were moved to a room on the bottom floor right next to a road which was tiny. Chaos ensued afterwards as each of us were all booked under the same surname and when families arrived, they were checked into an already occupied room, luckily it was a family members but they would turn up to the room with a key to get in and find it occupied. After several hours carry on, we were all housed. the rooms themselves were really in poor shape, skirting boards were well worn and in need of painting. The bathrooms, if you run the water too long (Its an open shower), the water comes out into the bedroom. It really was a disgusting place to stay and to be honest, for the money we paid, which did not include breakfast, we would have been better off in a Hilton. The breakfasts were reasonably priced but vile, we sent ours back. We ate out. It isn't even a nice area to walk about in at night so bear that in mind if you are using the tube. We were located in a room two floors up and it was right above the car park so when coach loads were arriving or leaving then we would hear them, along with the bins being emptied and collected of a morning.

How wrong were we. On first glimpse of the room on the first night, it was ok, id read the reviews on here and just thought to myself its just people being picky, its fine, the drawers has stains everywhere, and were chipped and worn and if a child was with us could have easily got a splinter off it, and when i went to put my stuff in the drawer the front fell off! we just laughed it off and said well atleast the beds clean which i had checked for bed bugs after reading reviews, but getting into bed that night was awful, we had a double room but it was 2 singles pushed together and were unlevel! and springs were everywhere! was like laying on a bed of nails! we had to get up and go to reception to move rooms, it was AWFUL! Getting into the second room, the bed was much better, a bit hard but i wasnt in pain!. We slept for the night and left early in the morning not really having a proper look around, it wasnt until the next night we realised there was a huge issue, The light was hanging off the wall with screws almost falling off, the plug had been smashed and has wires hanging out the back which is VERY DANGEROUS and is completely illegal! and to top it off it was right next to the childs bed! that could result in disaster! oh and also to add if you have children, check their beds! because it was exactly the same as our last one and had springs everywhere. There was a dirty cobwebbed light in the bathroom and the sink was blocked so much you couldnt even really run the tap more than 10 seconds. Sorry to be graphic but there were dried bogies all over the wall down the side of the bed!!! and finger nails!! and the radiator was rusted and peeling. The floor had a huge brown stain on it, and to top it all off we missed our jack the ripper walk due to the shower not changing from scorching hot. Yes i know how can you not notice all this before and stay in here for even one night, it was late and we were tired and went straight to bed. In the end we complained, the shower was checked and could not be fixed, the room was a huge hazard and we had to leave to go to another hotel which i might add only had 1 available room at \u00c2\u00a3230 a night!!!!!!

We were given room 302 and greeted with a dingy, tired and somewhat grossly looking room. We were however in a rush as we had theatre tickets so quickly dropped off bags with the mindset of 'we are only sleeping and washing here, so lets go enjoy London!'. Wrong............... We arrived back shortly before midnight very tired and crawled into bed. We very quickly departed said bed with the realisation of the mattress worn out, springs poking out at us and then to our horror, we pulled back sheets to discover wet stained patches, lots of other? soiling and threadbare centre with a bug crawling about. We were so disgusted, we went immediately to reception to find that no manager on duty, just a young eastern European male whom could not offer a solution to us as the hotel was already full and overbooked; the nearby Travel Lodges too were full in capacity. No apology, alternative room or mattress at least was to be offered. We layered the towels on the mattress and then lay on top of quilt, a sleepless night ensued. Next morning at reception, all eastern European staff i might add, were unable to contact manager as he was quote 'too busy'. We were offered a room change if we came back at 16:00; as we had pre booked theatre tickets this was not an option so they advised that our bags would be placed into said different room and a new key card would be waiting for us upon our return late evening. Upon our return, we were given room 305, which did have a somewhat more acceptable mattress but an horrendously and filthy bathroom. Previous guests hair, dead skin and gunk in all corners of bathroom, mould on tiles and bath rim with fungus around tap and shower fitting! Oh boy were we frustrated, tired and uncomfortable. Another awful night ensued, a strip wash with sink water and tiptoeing around the filth laden floor and barely sleeping fearing bed bugs. We felt nothing but anger for the hotel in ruining an otherwise wonderful time in London. We were so glad to check out of this non de script, disgusting, filthy and flea ridden establishment. I think Travelodge management should carefully think about their 'Sleep Tight' advertising campaign. This Hotel breaches every health & safety aspect, it is clearly uninhabitable in parts and is far removed from ANY other hotel we have stayed at previously - In England and worldwide! We are not people that like pretentious and posh hotels, nor do we expect a 'showroom' when staying at a hotel. We do however expect clean and habitable rooms to base ourselves whilst enjoying the area. The Travelodge Farringdon is a Health & Safety nightmare, a building that should be avoided at all costs, we would not stay there again if offered a fee let alone free of charge. Please, please check your mattress at the least, if you have already booked to stay, equally too ensure you keep your footwear on especially in the bathroom. Take wet wipes for washing as these, not ideal, but a far better option than hotel offerings....... Beware too in the breakfast room. The food is not rotated, just piled on top of existing. The crockery left wet through in sink/washing up residue, cutlery a lottery - maybe a steel fork but a plastic knife and the rest consume with caution!

I live on a main road and so I am used to some noise but here the windows offered no soundproofing and as a result I got no sleep at all. However family staying in the other room we had at the back of the hotel said they had no problems with noise. - the actual hotel is not an original travelodge hotel, they bought it off someone else. As a result there's weird buttons and other odd looking electrics in the work that have all been disconnected. It's not a big problem but it adds to the shabby feeling about the hotel. - location - for me and my husband it was fine - around 5-8 mins walk from kings cross but for my disabled brother in law it proved to be a little more difficult to get around easily. - The TVs did not work in either room - again not a problem for me but in the evening my brother in law is limited to what he can do and so was disappointed to not be able to watch tv.

The decor was tired and grubby, the lampshades were burnt, and the wood panelling was scraped and worn.

We weren't at all troubled by traffic noise - and there was plenty of vehicle movement outside our window (probably triple-glazed?) throughout our stay. The room was clean, well ventilated and we could control the heating / air-con ourselves. Yes, there were periodic distant rumbles of the Underground, but this is Central London, for heaven's sake! Foodwise, we could have eaten in the hotel and what was on offer looked quite appetising, though we didn't try it. As we'd had an exhausting drive in heavy motorway traffic to get here during the morning and early afternoon, we had an afternoon nap. In the early evening, we walked a short distance along Farringdon Road where there was a delightful little Italian restaurant on a crossing near the Mount Pleasant Royal Mail Sorting Office. We strolled back afterwards and had an early night in readiness for our appointment this morning. No, I don't think \"we were lucky\" by our experience. Our room and the hotel entirely fulfilled our needs and we'll certainly go again as the need may arise. In the event we may prefer unashamed luxury and flunkies at our beck and call the next time we visit London, there are always places like The Ritz on Piccadilly, The Dorchester on Park Lane, The Savoy on Charing Cross Road and many others in Mayfair like Brown's Hotel and Claridges to name but a few. But I doubt any of those noble establishments do a quiet, clean double room with en-suite, TV and tea/coffee making kit, for under fifty quid a night.

The bathroom was grumby, and the cracked and jaggered tiles on the shower wall were what i would call dangerous, as a slip would of resulted in a cut!! There was filth on the surfaces and mirror was a mix of dirty smears, cracks and rust! Of the 3 single beds only 1 was fit for purpose. the others had bases which were 12inches narrower than the matress meaning even sleeping was a balancing act. There was 3 people staying in the room, but on 2 towels! a request was made for more towels, they never appeared. The staff were miserable and to ask for anything you were made to feel as if you were requesting the world!! the only exception being the male who was serving breakfasts. I have stayed in numerous Travelodge hotels around the country and this hotel ranks as the worse and probably the worse standard of national chain hotel i have ever stayed in! I feel so strongly about the poor standard of hotel that i will always think twice before booking Travelodge again. the hotel and the majority of its staff is a disgrace to Travelodge.

We could only have hot baths, but as there were no small face washers/face towels provided this wasn't the best hot bath I have ever had. Others in our group had no water pressure but had scalding hot water dripping from the shower.

The bed linen was ok in terms of cleanliness however it is very thin and not the nicest sheets I have ever come across. The mattresses were dreadful - no support and if one person moved in the \"double bed\" the other would then be raised on an angle - think see-saw effect.

You can often get good rates at Farringdon, and you're also away from the worst of the King's Cross noise (which is not to be underestimated).

We had two large single beds pushed together rather than a standard double, but they were much more comfortable than the typical Travelodge bouncy castle that passes for a bed.

For the \u00c2\u00a3180 that we paid for the two nights i would have rather saved our money and slept out side with the dossers, it would have probably been cleaner and a more comfortable nights sleep! We were issued room 121 (avoid like the plague) which on first impressions you wouldnt let your dog sleep in, but being english didnt really like to complain after 10 minutes of being there! The rooms are ageing and really need an overhaul, weird colured stains all over the walls, rusting radiators and bathroom fittings, dirty cups, mould all over the bathroom as the extract system doesnt work properly, just generally not value for money, total rip off to be honest. So we decided to stay in this room for the night as we heard other people moaning about there rooms and came to the conclusion that they must all be the same. We were just about to go to sleep as we had and early train to catch, i turned the pillow over and there was a bed bug underneath, concluding with my partner that we didnt really fancy sharing the bed with strangers for the night we went down to reception to share the news. The understanding polish gentleman on reception by the name of Anton didnt care that we had found bed bugs and in fact laughed then accused me of lying! He soon listened when i said i had photos of the culprits! I demanded that we were moved room and he reluctently gave in, 538 was our next destination at nearly mid night! The second room was pretty much the same as the first, rubbish, but knowing we had to be up by six we decided to put up with it, we had a quick look over the bed for bed bugs, but we decided to sleep on top of the covers and use towels as a quilt. Just getting to sleep and half of the local night club come crashing down the corridor screaming shouting and then proceeded keep opening and slamming the doors whilst going between each overs rooms!

Among these I would include: a towel that isn't stained (I'm not asking for two - just as well - or even a bath sheet and hand towel, just one clean towel). Some shower gel and shampoo would be nice. A toilet that flushed properly, maybe. I was however amused by the pedal bin in the bathroom that would launch its lid into the upper atmosphere every time I pressed the peddle. On to the bedroom, I did get a double, rather too singles that had been pushed together. The mattresses were very comfortable, probably, about 20 years ago. Unfortunately when I stayed the springs had melted and it felt like a dehydrated water bed. Had some of the above luxuries been present I might not have minded so much about the fact that the bathroom floor was dirty, that the carpet in the room and especially the corridors had so much ingrained dirt that probably any attempt to clean would be fruitless, nor the unhelpful staff. On a final remark, perhaps the bar deserves special attention. The hotel does not allow check in until 15.00 (unless paying extra), nor do they have anywhere to store bags. So, should you arrive earlier then sitting in the bar until check in is your only real option. Unfortunately the bar is closed, almost permanently. I never actually found a time when it was open.

Therefore I consider myself as a good guest for all the hotels. I will never ever stay in any Travelodge hotels because they do not care about the guests, they only care about money. It is impossible to change anything after you make the booking online because the staff funnily do not have any access to anything. I made the booking on internet and paid it online. As I couldn't see any options on their website for a twin room, I booked a double room and sent an email as reply to their confirmation indicating that the room should be a twin room because I would be staying with my colleague and didn't want to sleep together. When I arrived, I realized that it was a double room with one big bed, and the room was very small like a grave. I asked the reception and they said I had to call them after booking the room. I said why are you doing online bookings if I had to call you overseas. I said I sent email indicating that it should be a twin room, their answer was the emails go to our reservations. So what? I said it is their business to direct my email to wherever necessary, I couldn't send emails to every receptionist separately, could I? I said I am not happy with this and I want to cancel it and wanted refund. They said they do not have access to the system and can't do it. He offered me giving the hotline number, but no telephone in the hotel even to pay and call. It was only first hour of my arrival, I do not have any call cards, but they do not understand anything. Anyway I realised that there is nothing to do other than sleeping together or going away with paying 107GBP for nothing. We slept together with my colleague that night unfortunately. I do not believe thay do not have any available twin room because the hotel was very uninhabited. Also I do not believe their word that all the rooms are same size, because you can not even open your luggage in the room properly.

One time I complained about people smoking, they just shrugged their shoulders, which is disappointing. There is an internet terminal in the lobby: 1 pound for 20 minutes which is convenient. Fellow guests at the weekends can be noisy, so consider earplugs if you need a good-nights sleep. Don't forget to bring an alarm clock as there are no telephones in the rooms. Don't leave foodstuffs in your room as mice do inhabit the building. I once witnessed a small grey mouse one night searching my waste paper basket; I followed it and discovered that it comes in via the linoleum under the shower unit.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed with them frequently because you know what to expect: reasonable service and a decent level of basic comfort in your room. This place is the exception that proves the rule. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst Lodge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and possibly the worst hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have every stayed in. Another inmate described it to me as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hovel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but I think she was being over-generous! After the most cursory of check-ins I found that one of the two lifts (the hotel has five floors and is busy) was out of order. It remained so throughout my midweek two night stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all, lift engineers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easy to find in a small place like London. My room had a second floor number, but to get to it I had to go up two floors from reception, along a football pitch-length corridor, through a door, down a flight of dimly lit stairs, through another door and along another corridor. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re allocated any of rooms 246 to 255 ask for a map! Incidentally, during my stay I saw at least three parties have to make their way all the way back to reception because their electronic key cards did not work first time round. The room was a reasonable size, adequately decorated with a double and a single bed. On switching on the lights I found that one of them was not working. (I mentioned this on my way out the following morning but the dead bulb was not replaced.) There was plenty of storage space for clothes, but one of the drawers was glued shut(!). I had specifically requested a double room (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDouble Room Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the booking details said) but found there was only one towel. To be fair, this was quickly resolved at reception. However, I then decided to take a shower before going out for dinner. In every other Travelodge I have stayed at I have been provided with basic toiletries. Not here: just a wafer-thin bar of soap, forcing me to dress again (okay, I should have checked) and walk to a corner shop two minutes away which seems to stock everything. Later, on going to bed, I found that my \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was in fact two single mattresses zipped together, covered by only a single sheet. That, and the fact that there was a gap of one foot (not an exaggeration) between the two base units made it distinctly uncomfortable lying in the middle of the bed. I then discovered another problem with the room. It overlooked King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross Road, which is busy with traffic 24 hours a day. The window was double-glazed, but it might as well have been a single sheet of rice paper for all the difference it made. Unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a really heavy sleeper demand a room at the rear of the hotel. If you really need low-budget accommodation in the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross area you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do better to choose one of the B&Bs in the maze of streets between Woburn Place and Gray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inn Road. If you want somewhere that provides the reasonable level of comfort and service you expect from a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel, stay instead at the Holiday Inn across the road or the Ibis near Euston Station.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fine for what it is.\u201d", "Author": "Monkeylalala", "ReviewID": "UR56855139", "Content": "Stayed here overnight.

Here is the e-mail of complaint I have just sent to Travelodge: \"I recently booked a room at the last minute for a one night stay in the London Farringdon Travelodge. I have several complaints about my stay: 1. When booking online, I accidentally selected one guest instead of two, meaning that when it came to pre-ordering breakfast and dinner it was only done for one person. I rang up the booking line to explain, but nobody could add another person for me as it was after noon on the day of the booking we booked at very short notice for the same day. I rang up the hotel too, and nobody would simply add another person for breakfast and dinner to my booking. This is the height of inflexibility - I understand that one cancel aspects of a booking after noon on the day of the visit, but there is absolutely no business logic behind not being able to add things. 2. When we arrived, we were put in room 123. The corridor reeked of smoke, as did the room. I went back to reception to explain, and we were helpfully moved to another room. However, I was told that \"all your rooms are non-smoking\". Either that is wrong, somebody is breaking the law, or you have not bothered to deep clean smoking rooms prior to marketing them as non-smoking rooms, which is unacceptable. 3. When eating dinner at the hotel restaurant, or two meals were served ten minutes apart, and to be frank the food was revolting, and gave both of us stomach upsets. The quality of the food was nicely summarised by the pot of BBQ sauce we were given which, when the plastic was peeled back, did not contain any sauce. 4. Although the room we were moved to did not smell of smoke, nearly all the surfaces were dirty, there were fittings on the side of the desk just hanging off, and every surface in the bathroom was rusty, - including the shower head, which is a health hazard. 5. At breakfast served in a room which was dark, dingy, and enclosed by windows which didn't look like they had been cleaned in months, I had to ask repeatedly for a mug for coffee. When the mugs arrived on a tray, the first one I picked up was filthy, covered in brown stains. I have photographic evidence should you be interested. I can assure you that we will not be staying in a Travlodge again if this is representative of your general quality of service.\"", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham UK", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fine - you get what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "Snafflepants", "ReviewID": "UR55015369", "Content": "We stayed here for a cheap weekend as we were down watching some filming at the BBC.

(know we don't have much luck when booking into hotels so I could handle this). About 5-10 mins later we were told they'd found us a room so all was well and we headed up to get ready for a night on the town, Feeling upbeat I strolled into the room about to put my bag down when hello mate, the bed was strewn with clothes and the dressing table was covered with toilletries... yes you've guessed it, they'd given us someone else's room!!!!!!! So back down we went, to be honest rather annoyed by now. We were told to take a seat again but by now I was wanting something for this mess so my husband asked if we could have a drink from the bar while we waited. 'Of course' said the manager. So up to the bar my husband went only to return with the one single drink we were permitted, Were we epected to share the thing!!!!!!!!!!! So back to reception went my husband and horray the generosity of the establishment allowed us another drink. So now five minutes later we were presented with another room key and some towels because the room was only made up for one... later we found out why!!!!!!!!!! Up we went on the now very familiar elevator and enetered, would you believe it an empty room! YAY! No remote control but coule be worse. So first on my list list of jobs was a quick bath as time was now extremely short... we were gonna be late but not too late if we hurried. Just about to start filling the tub up when I looked down and saw a mass of hair littering the surface of the bath. Well I'm no snob but you're not getting me in their no matter how desperate I am. Phone call downstairs to ask for it to be cleaned (have you now worked out why the room was only made up for one......... yes because it hadn't been cleaned since the last occupier wooooopppppeeeeeee). Knock at the door... expecting a cleaner. No it;s the manager with a towel. Ok, in you come mister. He goes in, wipes the bath with the towel and leaves. Oh hooray henry! This is disgusting needless to say I change my mind about the bath. So I opt for a shower... on goes the water and........ no hot water!!!! That was it! Another phonecall dpwnstairs demanding something to be done. 'We have no other rooms but can transfer you to our branch in Tower Bridge, Now that would be ok if we weren't going out in the Farringdon area and weren't already considerably late. So sorry no that won't do. Here comes one of the only redeemable features of this whole stay... after strong words we managed to get our stay for free. Right stay for free now lets jsut get out of here. I go to wash my hair in the sink and find puke down the nearby tiles, oh the joy. Close the bathroom door and I can;t even explain what's on there. We give up hope, go out and have a reasonable night out... only hampered due to our now foul moods. Return rather jolly if you know what I mean and I have an urge for hot chocolate from the vending machine. Machine out of order but I can purchase a sachet to have in my room. Confirm with manager that there should be a kettle in our room. No kettle so my husband is asked by manager if he would pop downstairs with the cup to get some hot water. On return he tells me we've been given a free breakfast (2nd redeemable feature and last). Wake up and go to breakfast. They're out of plates and virtually all hot breakfast items so I end up eating toast out of a bowl. We leave.... end of visit.

We checked in easily at 2:30pm and were informed that the lifts were not working and to take the stairs. This did make me laugh as I had read before we travelled that they had been broke for several weeks. Luckily we were only on the 2nd floor! The room itself was a bit mismatch. 2 single beds pushed together which although old and slightly lumpy were quite comfortable. The room faced the main road in front and was quite stuffy. This meant that we kept the window open the entire stay and therefore the room was noisey. This might bother you if you are a light sleeper however we did not have any problems sleeping. The bedside table was a good metre from the bed. Only 4 hangers in the wardrobe but plenty of drawers. The room did have a flat screen TV which was nice and had a couple of extra freeview channels. There was also internet access if you needed it. Also tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was the worst part. The toilet seat had been taped back together. The bathroom was tiny, I struggled to turn around in it. The shower was old and the shower curtain very smelly. The shower curtain rail was all rusty and there was a lot of mold on the ceiling. I tried to spend as little time as possible in here. The only toiletries you get here are a small bar of soap for washing hands. The bar in the hotel did not open until 5pm and stayed open until at least 12 so forget any ideas of getting lunch. 5 minutes walk away there was a collection of shops, restaurants and pubs and we ate in 2 of the restaurants which were very nice. Rather than getting the tube back into central London we caught the bus (no. 19 or 38 to Leicester Square area) turn left out of the hotel and walk for about 5 minutes. you will come to some traffic lights cross the road and the bus stop is in front of you (area is called Exmouth market) for \u00c2\u00a32 each.

For the unlucky few, we were given free accommodation at the Travel Lodge Hotel in Farringdon, London. On arriving at our destination, I was somewhat surprised at how glamorous the hotel looked on the outside, beautiful flowers, a butler in a suit opening the door for guests, I cheeky smile grew on my face with the thought of 'Im going to have fun here tonight'...however, this thought quickly disappeared from my mind as I was about to enter the hotel, a colleague kindly pointed out that I was staring at the wrong hotel, ours was across the road, in what looked like a partly demolished building, but hey, looks are not everything, I told myself.....On entering the hotel, I was amazed at what they had done to the reception, dullest looking reception I had ever seen. We all checked in smoothly, I asked to be upgraded to the pent house to which I was met with laughter from the staff, they new something I didn't!. Although I was given a none smoking room, the whole hotel smelt of a mixture of smoke, urine and other bodily fluids. My room was small, tiny, the phrase swing a cat couldn't even describe my shoe box. The first thing I noticed with my room was that they had also kindly built in a sauna, the temperature was hot, very hot. Shower room was used, well used. The shower curtain had more Staines on it than Barry Scott's laboratory. By this stage I was hot, smelt worse than I did before I dared enter the shower and cramp was beginning to set in. I decided to relax with some TV, which didn't work. Window wouldn't shut, floors were dirty and my bed reminded me of my younger days in which I would wake up early and change the sheets before mum came in. All in all, the hotel was hell. I decided to complain about the broken air condition, 'We don't have air condition' came the reply, at least that solved one mystery. Staff were friendly and also rather shocked that we have booked into this hotel.

The hotel is about a 7 minute walk from Kings Cross - St Pancras Station, we dragged our wheelie suitcases from the station, and it was no problem. Check-in was the fastest I've ever experienced, didn't have to sign anything or give my credit card, my room was prepaid and the whole process took less than 2 minutes. We were in room 411 on the 4th floor facing King's Cross Road. It was a small room, but from my experience this is common in London. The room was very clean, and well kept (which I wasn't expecting due to previous reviews). While there was some traffic noise from the road, when the window was shut it didn't t bother us. The double bed was two singles bolted together, however we didn't find this to be much of a problem, and always got a good night's sleep. The TV had BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Ch 4 plus some movies you could purchase. When I first turned the TV on there was audio but no picture, but fiddling with the cables at the back of the TV rectified the problem. The shower was hot, and the water pressure not too bad. The heater worked well on the few cold nights we needed to turn it on. All in all, no serious complaints. Great hotel for the price. The only downside is the small room (not much room to have more than one suitcase open at a time), and the fact that it is nearly 10 mins to the nearest tube - no big deal really.

The Farringdon Travelodge is opposite a Holiday Inn. I checked in without too much bother. Receptionist was fairly friendly and let me check in a hour early. Neither of the lifts worked, which meant using a narrow old school staircase to get to my room. My double room was as you would expect fairly basic. A Small size, and was quite stuffy. When i opened the window, this went away but then another problem of noise came in to play, a job the window was actually doing a good job of keeping out. London drivers like to beep alot, i learnt! General cleanliness of the room was again basic, but sheets, towels (all 2 of them) were clean, the room just needed a better hoover in more discreet areas. The bed was of a okay size and i got a good nights sleep. The bathroom was also compact, the shower didnt work, so i used the bath which wasn't the most comfortable experience of my life. The television quality was terrible though, all 5 channels fuzzy and my remote control didn't work. Pay Tv also looked basic as the \"latest\" film was War of the Worlds.

Try and get a room not facing the main road or you'll get no sleep with the noise even with the window shut. Some friends had no TV working. Our TV had 2 channels. Ended up being stuck in the lift for 20 minutes after our night out, fire services had to get us out. Got back to our room, which was flooded due to the raidiator pipe exploding or coming away from the wall, the pipes already had brown markings on it from what must of been a previous incident. Half the room was soaked wet through, the bed was wet, half the room was extremely wet. Went down to reception (5 flights of stairs, i wasn't using the lift again), he said \"it should be safe\" and sent me on my way, even though the raidiator was by an electrical socket. My roommate told him it wasn't safe or sleepable in as it stank of mould and dampness, so he moved us to the smoking floor (we'd booked non smoking) at 4am. Woke up coughing with the smoke from the smoking floor. Had breakfast, paid \u00c2\u00a37.50 for an all you can eat. Although supplies were constantly low and a big rush when staff brought out more. Quality of food for breakfast was very economy, so wouldnt recomend their breakfasts. Then checkout out after asking reception to book us a cab, DONT DO THIS, they have their own taxi firm who decide on their own prices and charged 10 pound for a 3 minute journey, when it cost \u00c2\u00a34 the day before in a black cab (exactly the same journey), so go and flag a cab outside the hotel and dont book with them. Not a safe area to walk, everyone next morning was talking about a girl getting mugged at 4am outside the hotel, everyone heard her screams, and her friends told me about in the morning.
