Brilliant service. Moderately priced.\u201d", "Author": "OnceInALongWhile", "ReviewID": "UR127614980", "Content": "Granvia is a good hotel in central Barcelona. Location: Barcelona is a moderately large city by European standards, and any tourist would want to get the most out of their visit by choosing a hotel as close as possible to the monuments/museums in the city centre. Hotel Granvia is located on one of Barcelona's main roads, the eponymous Gran Via. Even better, it is just about 100m north east of the Placa de Catalunya, the primary square and bus terminus in Barcelona. The Las Ramblas shopping-and-cafes street is only another 100 metres away, and the La Pedrera (Barcelona's most famous Modernist building and one of the most important museums) is only about 5 minutes' walk northwards. Going by the location, Granvia is a brilliant choice. Room: Clean and efficient. European standards of room size apply of course, meaning that the rooms will never 'meet' one's expectations of size, let alone exceed. Together with the room's small size comes the problem of cardboard walls, which may be disconcerting for light sleepers. I woke up one morning hearing my phone ring, but in fact it wasn't mine, it was actually the person's next door. This is normal for Europe, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to some travelers. My room had adequate cupboard space. The toilet was clean and the shower worked well. There were no free electric sockets in the room, so I had to disconnect the TV and twiddle my thumbs as my laptop got charged. Equally disappointing was the view from the window - there's a whitewashed blank construction wall about 10 metres from the hotel's west-facing wall. Service: Staff was very courteous and helpful. On arrival I wasn't handed the standard form that hotels normally ask guests to fill in. The elevator is large enough for heavy luggage. Wi-fi was free and worked very well; speeds were good enough to support voice and video chat on Skype, but Youtube videos took time to buffer. The breakfast spread was good and came free with three nights' stay. In summary: Highly recommended. Tip: Granvia is part of the Nunez i Navarro group (nnhotels.com), a chain of 5-10 hotels in Barcelona (perhaps other cities as well?). If you are looking for a hotel with similar service values but in a different location, you might want to check out their other properties.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Orford, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at the Hotel Granvia\u201d", "Author": "bicyclebetsy", "ReviewID": "UR127044811", "Content": "We recently stayed 5 nights at the Hotel Granvia. Because of a recommendation in the 2012 Rick Steves guidebook on Spain I booked online directly with the hotel. It was just what we wanted: quiet, comfortable, wonderful location and great breakfast. The staff was courteous and helpful. We asked for and got a lovely room in the back of the hotel overlooking the patio. It would have been even better if it had not rained. It was very easy to book online. In fact, I had to go back and change the booking when I noticed that I had only booked a room for one person. The directions included in the booking enabled us to take the Airbus into Plaza de Catalunya, and walk to the hotel with our luggage. Because of our early flight out we asked for a wakeup call, which was done by a real person, and a taxi, which was at the front desk when we came down at 4:30 A.M. The room was a little worn, but very clean and comfortable with a good bed, and room to move around. There was a safe, and free wifi. The location was wonderful: We were able to walk to the port on Las Rambles. To the Barcelona Cathedral and Barri Gothic. To the Palau de la Musica Catalana for a performance. To the Picasso Museum and to Antoni Gaudi designed apartments of the Casa Mila and the Casa Batllo. For the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, and Montjuic we used the Hop-on Tourist bus accessed at Placa Catalunya. The subway was nearby, but we did not use it. There were several dining options available close by. I would recomend this hotel to anyone on their own in Barcelona. We would certainly stay there again. Mary E.

Generally speaking this is a nice, European style hotel in a fairly good location. It's close to Las Ramblas, but not right on it, so you don't get the crowds. It is close to several metro lines, so getting around Barcelona from the hotel is pretty easy. The staff is nice, and they do make an honest effort to be helpful. The rooms are typical European, and many (if not all) have two single beds. The beds are very, very firm, so depending on your personal preference, that'll be either good, or not. The rooms are clean but have minimal amenities. On the downside, the walls are thin. I could actually hear the person next door snoring as if they were next to me. Note that this hotel, like so many others in the region do not have irons in the room. The hotel will press your shirt for you, and they do have laundry services as well. They have a fridge with the usual stocked items of beer, wine, soda, and water. The biggest issue, and what will impact your opinion of this hotel is that the rooms differ widely in their acceptability. The room I was originally assigned was on the interior of the hotel, overlooking a closed up 'courtyard' that overlooked the glass roof of the lobby area. As it was winter, the hotel had shut down the A/C, but unfortunately by doing so, they removed any possibility of air circulation, or fresh air. The week we were here was warm, but there was no way to cool down the room, and when I asked the hotel, they said to open a window, but due to the fact that the interior courtyard is totally closed off, there is no possibility to get fresh air. The second big problem I had with the room was that the sewer smell came in through the bathroom. Again, without the ability to circulate air, this made being in the room very unpleasant. When a new room opened up (3 days later) it was on the outside of the hotel and had a view of the external courtyard. What a difference! Fresh air, no sewer smell, a nice view of the courtyard. Fantastic! Check below for what rooms to ask for, and what to avoid. In general, make sure you do not get a room on the interior part of the hotel. To help you, here are the rooms you should ask for: 110, 111, 112 (all have small balconies) or 210 (my room), or 213. When making a reservation, be sure to ask for a room on the back side of the hotel. Rooms on the side will have no view, and rooms on the front will have the street noise. Rooms to avoid are 116, 211 & 212 and any interior rooms on the 3rd or 4th floors (I didn't see a room layout map for those floors) As for the rest of the property, the breakfast is a simple buffet, but good. They have a small internet kiosk area, but I didn't need to use it as they have excellent wifi coverage throughout the hotel. Lastly, next door is a small tapas bar that is open late and has good food and some local beer that is nice.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gdynia, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "bezetka", "ReviewID": "UR125224011", "Content": "Impressive location and very good price, Small window facing air shaft.Skimpy pilows,bathrooms are very tired.

The hotel was running a promotion during our stay, so they included breakfast in the room rate. It was excellent! Pastries, meats, cheeses, fried eggs, bacon, espresso machine, breads, fruit, yogurt, milk and cereal, 4-5 different kinds of juices, etc. Easily the best breakfast I've seen provided by a hotel in Europe.

I stumbled across an exceptional deal with Hotels.com.au and we booked 2 double rooms with private bathroom and basic small fridge for my husband and I and my 19yo daughter and her 2 girlfriends. The Hotel is a short distance from Paseig de Gracia metro direct transport from the airport (buy a T10 multitrip if you are there for a few days) and is conveniently located for local supermarket shopping to pick up small goods and breads, alcohol anything you need, as well as walking distance or a couple of metro stops to major attractions such as Las Rambalas or the Magic Fountain. Gran Via has very attentive staff that will advise you on busses and attractions as well as well as a palacial character sitting room and massive outdoor courtyard to enjoy an alfresco lunch of small goods and fresh bread and Cava that you can pick up from a supermarket nearby. Overall for just over $100 per night for a double and $120 for a triple room (without breakfast there are plenty of nearby coffee/pastry shops nearby) this was exceptional value!

There is a gourmet coffee maker where you put your cup and get delicious coffee. The salon opens to a courtyard that also has some small playground equipment to the side (small slide, seesaw, etc) -- this was a great break for our kids after sightseeing.

Past the Corte de Inglis department store (by the way it has a grocery store on the bottom floor - buy water here it is cheap). The hotel is clean and simple. We had no problems. We were able to book tours at the hotel front desk. We did the wine cava tour and it was well worth the money. We did Monserrat on our own and should have done the tour. They did ask for our key when we left and kept it for us while we were out. No chance to loose it this way. There is a restaurant a few doors down with good beer. Also, go left out of the hotel to the end of the street and go right. There is a restaurant called Divinius which is very good. Also - Farggi (right around the corner) has fabulous desserts and coffee. If you leave the hotel and go right go to the end of the street and turn right - go two blocks and there is a starbucks. Most things are close and you can catch the hop on hop off at Catalunya as well. We also purchased our tickets for this at the front desk. They were very very helpful.

It is a short walk to the Rambla, the Berri Gotic (old town) and the waterfront. The location more than met our expectations and allowed us access to most of the sights. Using the \"hop on, hop off\" Barcelona Touriste bus on the first day of your stay will give you a great overview of the city and allow you to \"hop on and hop off\" at sites that are of interest of you. Money (21 Euros) very well spent as you can spend the whole day (or 2 days for a few more Euros) touring the city this way. (with good narration about the sites). Expectations you bring about what a hotel should be will color your stay at Granvia. If you expect the kinds of amenities that are found in most American hotels (an abundance of big, thirsty towels, robes, double sinks, tons of toiletries, thick comforters, king size beds, a sitting area and a bed covered in throw pillows, and a flat screen t.v. and large lobbies) you will be disappointed in the Granvia. You might not want to stay there. But if you want a certain old world charm of a former 1800's former mansion--polished wood floors, beautiful wood paneling, a sweeping marble staircase, a Spanish courtyard with tile and columns, palm trees and places to sit--and a clean room with few pretentions, this is the place to stay. We were able to stay 6 nights at a special rate which didn't break us financially given the exchange rate at this time. Since we spent so little time in the room it really didn't matter if we had thick, plush towels and the other things. Instead, we were made to think about the excesses we sometimes have come to expect in hotels in the US and how simpler really IS better for everyone. We didn't NEED all the bells and whistles.

But having visited this beautiful city around 5 times, this time for 10 nights, I can quite honestly say I have had absolutely no trouble at all. While I completely sympathise with people who do have items stolen and who have been mugged, you really do have to make sure that valuables are kept in the safe at all times or on your person, as I have heard of break ins and robberies at so many Barcelona hotels, not just this one. Hotel Granvia was incredibly easy to find having taken the Aerobus in complete darkness. It's a fairly small hotel and the reception is helpful, if not over-welcoming and friendly. The services offered by the hotel stop at dry cleaning and an expensive breakfast buffet (11 Euro, make sure you go early before much of the food is gone otherwise it really isn't worth this cost!), but we noticed that the staff do their best to make what they offer as good as possible. My boyfriend was disappointed that the breakfast buffet was out of Serrano ham one morning, so mentioned this to the staff member on duty who immediately cut him around 10 more slices! Also, we requested a double room with a terrace although we didn't know whether or not this would be possible, and after the first night in a twin room due to limited availability were upgraded to a large room with a terrace and double bed which was wonderful. The TV didn't work, but we weren't on holiday to watch TV and didn't mention this to the staff, so couldn't say whether or not it would have been mended. The interior of the building is fairly grand and some of the larger rooms used for meetings and breakfast are beautifully decorated. The courtyard is lovely and well maintained, and the hotel is cleaned immaculately every day. Our room was always spotless and very tidy when we returned from a day out. I would agree with some previously reviewers about some elements being dated, for example the display cases full of Barcelona souvenirs and guide books from 1994 are not so great! The location of this hotel is absolutely fantastic. It's a short walk from the Placa de Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas, and the Passeig de Gracia metro stop is less than 100 metres from the hotel. This is one of the main stops in Barcelona, and almost everywhere you want to visit in the city is within 4 metro stops (direct) from this stop. You can also connect to the Passeig de Gracie Renfe (train) station from this stop, from which you can travel to places like Sitges for the seaside, Port Aventura for the theme park and Barcelona airport. To walk to the beach from the hotel takes around 20 minutes or 10 using the metro, and a taxi from somewhere like Port Olympic to the hotel costs around 10 Euro. Choose this hotel if you are happy not to have a restaurant, spa, pool etc on site, but instead a comfortable bed, clean room and brilliant location. Try eating somewhere like the highly recommended Txapela tapas bar near the Placa de Catalunya (but be prepared to queue in the evenings!) and buy bocadillos (Calamari with hot mayonnaise was a firm favourite, for only around 3 Euros) and tapas from the excellent bar next door to the hotel .

We didn't take advantage of the breakfast, it was too expensive and we don't eat much for breakfast anyway. The location of the hotel is perfect, you couldn't ask for a better location.

We never had any trouble when we asked for a taxi and no problems storing our luggage at the front desk. We were there to see Barcelona, not socialize with the staff anyway, so it was fine. One downfall was the lack of info about hotel ammenities. There was no info book in the room (like every hotel I have ever been to) to tell you what services are available in or around the hotel. For example, we had no idea the hotel had a terrace until now when I read about it in someone elses review. I also discovered the internet on my own and assumed it must have been free for guests considering the computer is sort of tucked away on the second level.

For a solo woman traveler, this place can\u2019t be beat! LOCATION: The Granvia is located in the very safe Eixample area, very conveniently positioned about three blocks from the Placa Catalunya (where the airport shuttle drops you off). It was also within walking distance to the Barri Gottic and the Ramblas, but far enough away to be safe. There is a city bus directly across from the hotel that goes up to Montjuic and the Joan Miro museum, and another bus close by that goes up to Parc Guel. The hotel was also very close to several nice restaurants and shops \u2013 and it was near the El Corte Ingles, the massive department store that has a killer grocery store in the basement with everything you could ever want (including cheap bottled water, organic foods, fresh fruits, and yogurt -- which I badly needed after a week of consuming nothing but meat and beer). Best of all: I felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel alone after dinner \u2013 even at 11pm or so. OTHER PERKS: Not only was the location great, but the hotel also had free Internet access (they have two computers in the wonderfully decorated parlor/drawing room upstairs, which you can access whenever you want to). There was also a lovely little area outside of the drawing room that had plants and benches. In the evenings, I noticed several guests relaxing outside with drinks, enjoying the nice weather. BREAKFAST: I really liked the breakfast buffet \u2013 it was well worth the money to me (I\u2019m the type of person who absolutely cannot function without getting some food and coffee in my system before I leave the hotel). The buffet was huge, and from what I could tell, you could go back as many times as you wanted to in one sitting. I think it was 6-8 euros per day, but I can\u2019t recall. There was this absolutely wonderful cheesecake-like baked thing that I just fell in love with, and lots of yogurts, fruits, cereals, and \u2013 of course \u2013 meat. I also loved the coffee machine \u2013 once I figured out that I had to hit the button 3 times to fill up the cup. There\u2019s usually one woman working at the buffet to help you out \u2013 which is nice if you\u2019re jetlagged, confused, and in bad need of caffeine like I was. STAFF: Overall, the staff members were great. It took a few days for them to warm up - as they were very professional - but eventually they did. I was particularly fond of the front desk clerk, who went out of his way to answer my questions on several occasions. The front desk staff and the security guards spoke fluent English, but the breakfast women and the maids did not. ADVICE: In general, don\u2019t expect overly-effusive, \u201chappy,\u201d gushing responses from the staff in hotels and restaurants in Spain. The service industry in Spain is very professional, and they do their jobs efficiently and well. They don\u2019t usually stand around or smile, joke, or laugh with you right off the bat. I noticed several Americans getting a bit huffy over this. My advice: don\u2019t take it personally! These folks are at work, they\u2019re busy, and they just want to do their jobs (the goal of which is to serve you your food or give you your hotel bill, not to become your best friend). It took me awhile to \u201cget\u201d this at first, but once I did, my trip went much smoother. I think it\u2019s helpful to know this in advance. That way, when they ARE friendly and helpful (which happened on many occasions) it makes it that much nicer of an experience. :) ROOM: I had a single room with a double bed. I requested a quiet room and it was exactly that. The bed was very firm, and very comfortable. The room was immaculate, for which I was very grateful. There was a mini-fridge stocked full of waters, beer, and nuts and a little form on the night stand that I filled out when I took anything from the fridge. They totaled it at the end of my stay (and it wasn\u2019t really that expensive). There was also a safe deposit box in room as well, which they charged for by the day. Note: This occurred at EVERY hotel I stayed at in Spain, and wasn\u2019t expensive at all. It was well-worth the $1-$3 a day for the safe. In this particular hotel, I told them up front how many days I wanted to use it for, and paid for it in cash. Last thing: I emailed the hotel, and then booked directly with them via fax and got a nice discount. Overall, I was very, very pleased with this hotel, and I would most definitely stay there again.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Groningen, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cThe tiniest room in the world...\u201d", "Author": "eztur", "ReviewID": "UR8456688", "Content": "I've been to this hotel with colleagues.

We only had one pillow each and asked for 2 more at reception but they had not arrived by our return that first evening, but they soon sorted us out after a reminder.

We were unsure of what to do for breakfast as most hotel's offerings of continental breakfast leave you still hungry, but we needn't have worried as there was such a reasonable selection of both hot and cold food of which you could have as much as you liked. The coffee was delightful!! The breakfast worked out at 10 Euros per head and the amount we ate would have cost so much more had we gone to the nearby cafes.

I can't remember what the room number was unfortunately - I know we had trouble finding it because the room number wasn't on the door and we had to ask", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, HI", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5323663", "Content": "EXCELLENT location in the heart of town. Walking distance to many Eixample sights. About 8 minutes from Las Ramblas. Staff pleasant. Room clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good. My only recommendation is that you take a Spanish dictionary as not all the staff speak English, which is reflective of the Spanish population. They do all speak French. Price reasonable for what you get; location is everything. Safe neighborhood with nice restaurants around the corner.

It's not the fanciest place in the world, but the rooms were very pleasantly appointed and clean. The lounges and breakfast rooms, though, were quite beautiful and well kept. Also the hotel's location -- near Placa Catalunya, and the Corte Ingles, a short walk from both the Ramblas and the Passeig de Gracia -- was a major plus. We loved walking around Barcelona and the Gran Via was well situated for that. Owner Juan and his staff were very helpful with everything from dinner and theater reservations to finding a laundry. The breakfast was better than the average hotel selection, although, as always, you can certainly find a wide range of good breakfast places in that area for lower prices. We had booked a double with twin beds (not through an online service, but via email correspondence) and when we arrived, they had somehow put us down for a double with a single bed. Does no hotel in Europe understand what is requested when you ask for two separate beds? Nevertheless, there was no problem changing to a double with twin beds and we were given a room facing over the main street, but the noise did not bother us at all. For the price, we felt we couldn't have done better and were very pleased with our stay there.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, a bit too noisy\u201d", "Author": "bostonbased", "ReviewID": "UR4332441", "Content": "hotel location is super, close to many interesting areas/sites. staff were very friendly and helpful. smoking in public areas may be improved with recent no-smoking laws, but in December the entire hotel smelled of cigarette smoke, like most other places in Barcelona. free internet in hotel common room was very nice, but a couple of days really slow, internet cafe across the street was less than 1 euro for 15 minutes (high-speed access). walls and courtyards did not protect light sleepers from hearing normal tone-of-voice conversations in the next room or when a neighboring room had their courtyard window open. rooms nicely renovated, comfortable, firm mattress, and BBC on the television. did not try hotel breakfast, as so many cafe's nearby with affordable coffee, pastries, etc.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Granvia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d208596-Reviews-Hotel_Granvia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$107 - $193*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes 642</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "208596", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3a/57/8e/hotel-granvia-barcelona.jpg"}}
