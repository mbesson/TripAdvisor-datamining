Our room was one of the quietest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and was thoroughly cleaned every day - with a fresh set of fluffy towels. We were on a budget and opted to share a bathroom, which was very smart and always clean. The breakfast was great and got us off to a good start in the mornings. And the location is very good - only a short way from the stop for the airport waterbus so we didn't have any trouble carrying our suitcases, almost next to the Rialto and also just a few minutes' walk from St Mark's Square. The very best thing about this hotel was the staff. Their professional friendliness and a bit of banter made this a really enjoyable place to stay. We needed to checkout before breakfast, so they made us a picnic breakfast to take with us. I honestly don't think I have stayed at a hotel where the staff have made me feel so welcome and cared for.

I thought it was fair enough that we are unable to do so. However, went to the room and we got 4 people room! However, the man in the front desk is very nice and said sorry etc, anyway our other friend has found another hotel nearby. Location is real good, walking distance to the square and the bridge. But then again, Venice is small enough, almost everywhere is walking distance... It is exceptional value considering our spacious bedroom and bathroom (maybe due to the fact it is 4 bedder not 3). PLUS our room is overlooking the water so we have this soothing sound of water splashing when we went to bed that night.

Everyone was so helpful and accommodating from the moment we emailed to inquire about availability right until checkout. Plus the price is very reasonable for Venice! The only 'con' is that there is no free wifi. But again, the staff is very helpful in looking up any info you need.

I can really recommend this hotel. It couldn't be better located. Close to San Marco and Rialto bridge. I had to go from the train station several mornings and it took just 10 minutes from the Rialto with the vaporettos. It is beautifully laid out in a little square with a church, a ponte and the canal. Staff is wonderful, cheerful and helpful! They helped me to get some caffelatte & cornetti before they had the breakfast opened! That is service! (Talking about breakfast, it's very good! Only thing that could be improved is that the coffee is from a machine and not brewed \"a casa\"). They also let me use their computer to check-in on the airline home, and even print some stuff. Helped several times to find places on maps etc. Forgot my tootpaste and shaving cream home, which the helpful maid brought me at once... Very nice and clean room. Comfortable bed with like new linen. I had shared WC & shower, and it was always clean and tidy. Warm water and fresh towels every morning. A big hug to everyone at Hotel Alla Fava!
