You would never guess that something this nice and scenic would be found near the airport. This place is simply wonderful, beginning with check-in. I needed to make an appointment for a spa visit and asked for a recommendation. The staff member not only recommended a place, but called the spa for me to make the appointment. Great service from the start. The valet service is reasonable and the staff is friendly. If you have a rental car and a morning flight, you should definitely return your car the night before and take the shuttle to the airport. Very convenient. Things you should know: Because of all the positive and because they also served fresh lox, I can overlook the continental breakfast (I pretty much dined on salmon during my whole trip), but I've had better complimentary (and hot) breakfasts at other hotels. While comfortable for one person, the room was small. Like one other review stated, there is no room for dining in the standard room, but I never used room service or the restaurant for dinner so that wasn't a problem for me. Also, the restaurant only takes reservations for dinner, but I was out during most of my stay so that also didn't bother me. If you have a rental car, it is close to plenty of dining options and other useful attractions. Otherwise, you will likely have to dine in or call a taxi. I booked this place based completely on recent Tripadvisor reviews. I needed a place close to the airport for my last night in Seattle and originally booked a lower rated chain hotel. My plans changed and I needed more nights and figured I might as well look for something nicer and enjoy my stay. I'm very happy with this choice! It was the perfect ending to my time in the Seattle area and close to the attractions I visited on my last couple of days.

You get the point. I'm just trying to show that these are the kind of fixtures you find at basic hotels - perfectly acceptable, but based on the reviews, you might expect more. And just to give you a sense of the level of the hotel, the only the toiletries in the bathroom are one bath soap, one bottle of lotion, and some bath salts - no shampoo, no conditioner. Again, it's not a big deal, but clearly this is not a high-end hotel. Certainly the grounds are nice, and the freebies in the \"living rooms\" are really nice - Hagen Dazs ice cream, malted milk balls, string cheese, etc. The breakfast is fine, nothing special, but it's very nice that it's free.

I travel for business 100 days a year and this property is one of my favorites. I am one of those guys who write letters to the management if I have a problem with a hotel. That said, my rule is to also write good reviews when I enjoy uncommon service or quality. Part of me doesn't want to write this review because I don't want to have trouble getting a room in the future, but I also want this property to succeed so I can stay here in the future! I stayed at the Cedarbrook last Summer for 7 nights and am now just finishing up a 8 night stay for a training at a Criminal Justice academy nearby. Why such emotions you ask? Well - it is just blocks from the airport and a mile from the freeway, but you would never know it. I feel like I am in the woods as it is tucked into effective landscaping. The architecture is attractive and rustic. The standard rooms are large and comfortable with big bathrooms and huge tubs. The included breakfast is simple, but fresh and of good quality. Each building in the hotel has a nice little lounge with a fridge full of water, yogurts, string cheese and ice cream. Yep, you read that right. AND there are bins with chocolates for you to enjoy anytime you like. The room service is fast and reasonable, and the food is terrific. Every employee I have come in contact with in my 16 nights here this year has been helpful and pleasant - every single one. Finally, the place is a great value (which I care less about because I don't pay the bills on my business travel, but it does matter). Bottom line, if there were one of these in every city in America I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Downside? It is about a 20 minute drive north to downtown Seattle - a bit of a distance - but you can rent a car from Thrifty a few blocks away for like $30 a day. There is also a light-rail station nearby, and I think their shuttle goes there. Heard enough?

After hearing such rave reviews from them, we decided to try it ourselves. I tried to book a studio suite over a month before our stay and everything was booked. So, I booked a regular room. I kept checking back and nothing was available. The day of our stay, I checked and, lo and behold, studio suites are available. I called to change my reservation to a studio suite (which at the AAA rate should have been another $30). The front desk told me it would be a flat $50 fee-no exceptions. So, you block out all these suites; open them the day I am arriving; offer them at a AAA rate; but tell me since I already booked a regular room that I have to pay a flat fee to upgrade? How does that make me want to keep referring people; put up family & friends or personally come back and I haven't even checked in yet? You're not even full that night... Ok...Now we pull up in front to check in at registration. Most parking is coned off so you have to either park hither and yon in self-park ($12 per night) and walk to registration or use valet parking ($15 per night + gratuity) to get out of your vehicle at registration. Being disabled, I asked where the disability parking was located. Valet pointed to 2 spots. I said thanks and started to pull away. He stopped me and said \"whoa, you can't park there! Those are reserved valet spots\". What?!? So, there is no choice for parking if you are disabled? We discovered later that there are other spots in self park, but they are so far away (2 buildings) that it would be impossible to negotiate that distance. Management really needs to make some sort of allowance and designate those two close disability spots as self park. The valet was so rudely insistent that we get out there that I was absolutely shocked. We checked in without a problem and our room was absolutely spotless and wonderful! Bed was great, room was very comfortable for a basic room. Would love a bigger room next time if I come back. As for amenities, all the friends and family have always raved about the \"Living Room\" at Cedarbrook. Here's the website description: \"Each 500+ square foot residential oasis features a vaulted ceiling, stone-encased gas fireplace, wall of floor-to-ceiling working windows, original artwork, 26\" Panasonic flat screen stereo TV with DVD/VHS player, comfy sofa, multiple lounge chairs with ottomans (corduroy or leather, you pick) and shelves of 'library' books. Among refreshment items available daily are bottled waters, individual yogurts, string cheese, ice cream bars and a variety of gourmet malted milk balls, a signature of Cedarbrook Lodge. \" Lovely, except there was no string cheese anywhere to be found and all the chips & ice cream they usually have out had been cleaned out by convention people. There is ALWAYS string cheese. Some of us don't want sugar-can't have sugar. Called the front desk. \"If there's no chips or string cheese, then we're out.\" But isn't that part of what you advertise? \"Don't you restock?\" \"Ma'am, whatever is there is what we have left and you'll just have to choose from that.\" Hey, listen, I'm not trying to be picky, but for what you advertised, from what I know from the 20+ friends and family I have hosted here-there are supposed to be some other selections. Could you just be nicer when I call and inquire? Dinner was absolutely lovely (see my other review of the Copperleaf Restaurant). Overall, this is a wonderful property. However, some of the staff are quite young. Our observation of them, not only with us but with other guests, at the desk found that they had a tendency to be abrupt and a tad condescending. Perhaps they thought they were being professional, it came across as cold and dismissing. If management can warm up the hotel staff and they match the professionalism of the staff of the restaurant-I'll be back. I'm hoping it was just an off night for this place. It was our anniversary and did wish for just a bit more.

We very much enjoyed much of what Cedarbrook Lodge has to offer, especially the unusual breakfast and the peaceful landscaped surroundings. I appreciated hard boiled eggs rather than what I term \"mystery\" eggs, so common elsewhere. Since no trays are used in the breakfast room, be prepared to make a few trips around the large room to get the various elements of a good breakfast. We also enjoyed the crab sandwhich lunch a couple of times at their Copperleaf restaurant; it was that good - CRAB, not filler, in a woodsy yet elegant atmosphere. The front desk staff could not have been more accommodating - special thanks to Alice & David, rightfully proud of their hotel, who saw to our getting to and from the light rail station several times during our stay without our own car. They also gave us excellent advice for our time there. Because of their help, we were able to be happy tourists despite being perhaps 15 miles from the heart of Seattle. We are native New Yorkers, so spending about 40 min. on a clean city train (light rail) was not inconvenient, just one more part of a very good vacation.

The staff was so NICE and SUPER sweet, you could tell everyone enjoyed working there, from the front desk to housekeeping, everyone had a genuine smile on their face, which made our stay even better. We were allowed to check-in a bit early and received a room which overlooked the wetlands. For each area there is a \"living room\" with nice oversized chairs, fireplace, and SNACKS! My friends were elated when they saw the Haagen Das ice cream (and greek yoghurt). I'm constantly eating so the complimentary fruit, chips, and water were definitely welcomed as well as the extra space in the refridgerator for food and the microwave. Breakfast in the morning was yum especially the organic tea and Apple cider. Bad breakfast is a deal breaker for me, but Cedarbrook came through with scrumptious bagels, 7 grain toast, fresh figs and much more.

They also have a complimentary 24 hr shuttle which will take you to the rail station or airport. The driver gives you a card to give them a ring when you're back at the station. We had a rental but used the shuttle the day we went sightseeing and used the rail. The driver was prompt and courteous and let us know it was 24 hrs and how to contact her. We called for a pickup later that night around 1030 while we were still on the train and were told to call back when we were actually at the rail. We did not like the idea of 3 young ladies at the platform at night so we called when we were two stops away and the shuttle was waiting for us and a few others (the distance from the lodge to the station is less than 4 mins, tack on an extra 4 to get to the airport).

Burgers etc. Breakfast was good quality, usual US fare except the fancy tea bags and the smoked Salmon. That was nice.

I agree with reviews concerning most things, and a few I felt were overrated but still very OK. (When a hotel is so highly rated, it's hard to not have ridiculously high expectations.) The grounds alone would be reason to stay there; they are gorgeous, and lush, and manicured and tucked away in a quiet area. The room was spotlessly clean, the beds very comfortable with beautiful linens, the decor lovely although not luxurious. The bathroom was fantastic, and the soaps the best ever! The snacks available 24/7 that everyone refers to were great fun, and I ate too many 'chocolate malt balls'. It was extremely nice to have bottled water (although we ourselves have stopped using plastic non-refillable ones for environmental reasons, and this bothered me a bit) One of the highlights was the really wonderful continental breakfast that went beyond the usual. GREAT FRUIT, granola, and oatmeal with toppings galore ... a real treat. And smoked salmon! It is served in a gorgeous dining room (so unlike many other hotels), with large round tables and floor to ceiling windows to the beautiful grounds. We drove, so parking was a bit of a problem ... not enough of it. This was prior to a charge for parking so perhaps that will improve the situation. The room price was fair, the stay fantastic, and any complaints are so minor that the only reason I mention them at all is to try to keep expectations realistic.

I picked this hotel over less expensive airport hotels because of the reviews which talked about the beautiful grounds. Well, they are beautiful but we were essentially not allowed to use them the afternoon/evening we were there as they were rented out to a wedding. As this was the whole point of choosing this hotel, I felt I certainly did not get my money's worth. It is a beautiful setting although the hotel rooms themselves are starting to become dated- arm chair in the room stained, tear in the blanket etc. Additionally, perhaps due to the wedding, we were put in an wheelchair accessible room. This meant we did not have a bathtub and the shower was only a hand held. As is usually the case, hand held showers give much less pressure. The shower was also a roll in with a shower curtain that did not reach the floor. As a result, it is very easy to end up with water all over the floor, especially if you have children. Not very relaxing after 15 hours on airplanes. Over all I felt as though we were not valued as clients. The benefits went to the wedding party. If that is the hotel's priority, fine, but they need to tell potential guests that parts of the facilities will be off limits and they may end up with a room with poor bathroom facilities. I did ask to speak to a manager right away only to be told that none is available on weekends. The solution was to give me a card with his name and contact information and to suggest I get in touch with him on Monday.

(Probably more of a flaw with the Trip Advisor rating system than the hotel.) The hotel is certainly unique... definitely not your run of the mill chain. It has a nice rustic, northwest motif. As others have pointed out, Cedarbrook Lodge has lots of unusual amenities like 24/7 malted milk balls, chips, ice cream, etc., in the lobby area of each building (to go along with comfortable chairs, a fireplace, and a flat screen TV.) The grounds are nicely maintained and they have a gourmet restaurant where I enjoyed a very pleasant dinner outside on the patio (the pan seared halibut was excellent). Peter, my waiter, was attentive and friendly, even though I was a lone diner in the midst of several other busier tables. One problem... after ordering dessert, the maitre d' reported back that the chef would be unable to prepare it (the coconut sorbet) unless I could wait 30 minutes or so. I probably didn't need it anyway. Here's what Cedarbrook Lodge would need to do to get in my top tier: have a bellman meet me at the front door and offer to help with luggage. The first people I encountered were behind the front desk (and it was only 6:30 PM or so). The front desk clerks need to smile and be friendlier. The young man was friendly enough, but I felt like I was imposing on the young woman. Maybe they were trainees??? The early morning front desk clerk (and shuttle driver) was fine... competent and friendly. Ice for the rooms is provided in plastic bags in a freezer in the lobby, but unfortunately, each bag was frozen in a hard chunk, and I didn't think the people downstairs would appreciate me breaking it apart on their ceiling!

The package we purchased included continental breakfast, box lunch, and afternoon snack as well as coffee and soda throughout the meeting. The cost per person, including their mandatory 21% \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was $101.64 before taxes. When we arrived in the room, there was, as planned, coffee and tea, plus a tray of cold bagels a small batch of muffins about the size of a mini-cupcake as well as a bowl of apples, oranges and pears. The fruit was not sliced nor were there utensils provided. There was no way to toast the bagels, however there were small packets of cream cheese. This is what they advertised as a continental breakfast. After our meeting started, so did the gardeners outside the room. For a good part of the morning portion of the meeting, we were competing with a gardener who had a complete arsenal of power tools, including a mower, edger, and blower. There was no apparent consideration for keeping the noise down during our meeting. Lunch was supposed to arrive at Noon, but it was delivered a half hour early, interrupting our meeting. Rather than have the servers disrupt us further, we asked them to leave the box lunches on the carts on which they were brought and we would serve ourselves later. This apparently caused much confusion for the staff, because they took it to mean we wanted no further interruptions and therefore did not deliver the afternoon snack, which was included in the price per person. Not once during our stay did anyone from the sales or catering departments stop by to see if we needed anything. When a couple of days after the meeting we complained about the service, the noise, and the non-existent afternoon break, we were treated in an unprofessional manner, laying the blame on us for not complaining at the time. I should point out that the meeting was in a building quite a ways from the front desk. In order to complain, we would have to leave the meeting, hike to the front desk, wait for someone to speak to from sales or catering, and hike back to the meeting. For the amount of money we spent on this relatively short meeting, we should expect better from a luxury hotel. To add insult to injury, when we finally received a copy of our bill (it had been charged to our credit card) we discovered they overcharged us by $250. It took over one month to receive the refund.

My boys were able to see rabbits and other animals on property. Every floor has a common living room where you can help yourself to chocolate covered raisens, pretzels and other candies. Chips, water, cheese, yogart and ice-cream is yours to indulge in. My boys had a field day with the ice-cream! The rooms are beautifully decorated and beds were comfortable.

I must say one more thing...keep in mind when you book a hotel downtown, you have to pay for parking. They don't tell you that upon booking...just keep that in mind. Sometimes up to $30 a day.

We were on our way South on a road trip, this hotel felt very remote and I would have never seen it driving along the interstate and yet it's less than five minutes off the Interstate. As much as I loved this hotel I can't imagine staying here without a car, it's only a ten or 15 minute drive to downtown and the parking is free so it's a great base for touring Seattle by vehicle but I wouldn't try relying on their shuttle and transit it's simply too remote a location. Now that I've gotten that out of the way let's move on to the good stuff: As I mentioned the location is gorgeous. The hotel is located next to extensive wooded wetlands and they have some short paths you can stroll along as well as some pretty ponds. Our room had a nice view of the wetlands, two queen beds and a really comfortable full size chair and ottoman. The bathroom had a soaker tub and a separate shower which was really nice not to mention really comfy bathrobes. A short elevator ride was the common area they call the living room there was a fridge stocked with bottled water, yogurt and cheese strings and a freezer full of individual Hagen Daz Ice creams. There was also fresh fruit, potato chips and the yummiest malt balls on offer. This was a unique and much appreciated amenity, it was like having a mini bar without the ridiculous prices, or any price did I mention it was all free? Breakfast was not extensive but was high quality and tasty. There was homemade granola, bagels with smoked salmon and a few other items I don't recall it too was included in the price of the room.

After reading all the glowing reviews, I was expecting something truly extraordinary. And was........quite surprised and a little disappointed. Here are the good points: Close to airport, tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Gorgeous, restful environment Free snacks Nice staff I didn't use it but the Fitness Center looked very nice. Now for the negatives: We dropped our rental car off at the airport and called for a shuttle ride from the airport kiosk. The call just kept going to voice mail. \"We're sorry to have missed your call. Please leave a message.\" After deciding this wasn't a fluke and, indeed, there was no one answering the phone that day, I called the reservation number. We stayed on hold with her for about 10 minutes while she tried to call. Same answer. Or should I say, Same No Answer. Finally she advised us to walk down to the next island and try from there. Not sure why a different person would be manning the phone for each island, but it worked--we got to talk to a live person and requested a ride for 5 people. Our ride arrived within about 25 minutes. It was the hotel car (not a shuttle) and wasn't big enough for the 5 of us. Our five year old sat on a lap. I thought it was odd that a high rated \"airport hotel\" that advertises an airport shuttle, didn't seem to have their act together in this area. The rooms were beautiful but not very practical. The light was dim, not good for people who like to read at night. The tv was small and, surprisingly, not a flat screen. It was tucked away in a cabinet, on a swivel base, and seemed like an after-thought. There was no table in the room so room service had to be eaten at the desk. High points for aesthetics, low marks for usability. No pool. At this price point and with the beautiful grounds, our family was very surprised that there wasn't a pool. Indeed, there's not a lot here at all for families to do if you don't have a car. Except snack. The restaurant on-site is very expensive and the seating extremely limited (13 tables total). My husband and I enjoyed our meal there, but to take an entire family to dinner would cost a small fortune. Because this hotel is close to the airport and in a residential neighborhood, your options are seriously limited if you don't have a car. In short, I think this hotel is trying to cater to a certain type of traveler and I'm not sure exactly who that traveler is. I assume it's the business traveler on an expense account. I saw several people on their laptops sitting in the \"living rooms\" in each complex. It's very quiet and I can see how that would be appreciated by a business traveler. As for us, I don't think we'd stay there again. It was actually more expensive for us than our beautiful rooms at the Mayflower Park, and there just wasn't much to do once we got there.

Since it was my adult daughter & me (Even though I hadn't seen her in 6 months), I reluctanly agreed to the two rooms so as not to put out the family w/ small children. Arrived in the rooms to find them VERY stark and disgustingly dirty - no furniture - only pull-down hollywood beds, extremely stained carpeting and fresh coffee ring stains on the counter. No toiletries or coffe pot / coffee. Called the front desk to ask why no coffee / toiletries and what these rooms are used for because they are obviously not guest rooms. (The television was a tiny one tucked into the hallway, which you could not watch unless you stood in front of it!) They avoided my question and said they would send housekeeping over with coffee and etc. Again, no apology and treating me like I was putting them out. A housekeeping young man arrived with one coffee pot without a handle. Said it was the only one he could find and still had no coffee or toiletries. I asked him what these rooms were used for and he said they were really meeting rooms - not guest rooms. I went back to the front desk and said I was not told the rooms were meeting rooms and wanted the double room after all - it's what I had reserved and paid for. The front desk was extremely rude - especially the young man - and insisted they were no rooms - they were completely sold out. Once again, suddenly the girl at the desk said they had a double and would put me in that one. She then proceeded to scold me and said \"I gave you a choice and this is what YOU took.\" (??!!##) I had never been treated that way before and I was only wanting WHAT I RESERVED AND PAID FOR! There was NEVER an apology for the inconvenience they put ME through - they acted as if I was at fault. I did not simply walk in off the street - I had a reservation for a double room and the confirmation paper with me! This definitely ruined our stay at Cedarbrook and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone I care about. I think their 15 minutes of fame that Trip Advisor gave them has gone to their head.

Our stay was horrible and I would never wish our experience on any other traveler. It started with the restaurant. There are very limited food options at the hotel-room service, the bar or the small restaurant which is located in the lobby. Our room layout was odd and if we had chosen room service there would have no place to eat. Our beds filled the room and the only other furniture was a wall of built ins with two built in desks. It looked like a dorm room. So we had to go to the restaurant. Our service was terrible as the diners arriving after us and sitting next to us were repeatedly served first for each course. We were made to wait for the same dishes that were served to the diners next to us who again arrived after we were seated. One dish was missing a key ingredient according to the description in the menu. Efforts to get the dish corrected were not successful as the waiter just denied that the ingredient was supposed to be part of the dish even though it was listed in the menu. The waiters apologized for the very long wait that we had for our food and offered me half a glass of sparkling wine as compensation for the inconvenience. We never complained about the service but left the restaurant feeling that we had received second class treatment at a very high price. But the worst part of the restaurant was the obnoxious noise coming from the bar next to the restaurant. A woman and her group were screaming like they were in a cheap beer joint. Two other tables at the restaurant complained about the noise as it ruined the dining experience. The waiter told us that we were lucky that the bar no longer had a dart board. He said the noise had been much worse. No one from the restaurant made any effort to curtail the bar noise. Our dinner tab was over $100 for 2 people, 2 courses. We skipped dessert to get away from the ruckus in the bar area. The next day we tried to schedule the shuttle and were told that the shuttle only ran on the half hour. The information sheet we received at check in never mentioned that the shuttle ran on a set schedule. We arrived at our scheduled time but after waiting ten minutes past our reservation time, it appeared that no one on the hotel staff remembered our shuttle reservation. When we asked about the shuttle, suddenly someone was found to give us a ride. We were the only people waiting for the shuttle so it seemed strange that we were just ignored until we had to ask about the shuttle. The second night of our stay was a continuation of our nightmare at Cedarbrook. Around 3 or 3:30 am, our upstairs neighbors came home, apparently from the bar. They continually dropped something on the floor that sounded like bowling balls. No sleep was possible with so much racket and it went on for over half an hour. I was preparing to call the front desk to beg someone for help so I could get some sleep. But the noise had finally lessened although there was still noise coming from the room until 4:30 am. Sleep was out of the question and I was exhausted after a very long night. I noted that the hotel lobby was again very noisy on Saturday evening with all the noise once again coming from the bar. So I could only conclude that this is a party hotel for those who do not mind boisterous party goers setting the tone for this hotel experience and intruding on the rights of all other guests who want to have an enjoyable, relaxing stay. After trying to get some sleep, I tried to use the free internet. I found the service to be erratic. Sometimes it worked, sometimes I had no signal. It was frustrating to have such inconsistent internet service even if it was free. The following morning we went to breakfast and the buffet was okay but not spectacular. The promised smoked salmon was missing and was never replenished. Upon check out, the hotel staff member did not ask at all about our stay. It seemed odd as I have always been asked at other hotels about my stay. I certainly did not feel my business was valued in any way by the staff who checked us out. The shuttle was operated by the one staff member who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and she was very helpful. Unfortunately she was the exception in this horrible weekend at Cedarbrook Lodge.

We stayed for 5 days in a Seattle hotel very well-reviewed on this site. It was fabulous. But we had an early flight so we moved to Cedarbrook for the last day. I had read glowing reviews, so I thought it would be a good finish to our trip. I liked the photo of the studio with fireplace, so I reserved it. So far, so good. We arrived to the information from the desk clerk that there was no bellman to help my 75 year-old husband with the bags. Really? For a $235 room? We parked extremely far from our room because the lot was at the exact opposite end of the building from our room. Big pain for my husband. The room was large... very large and bare. One Murphy bed, two easy chairs and many, many built-in cabinets and drawers. I counted 24 cabinets and shelves. Wow! This could have been an apartment with great storage. But it was a hotel room with no luggage rack, nothing for the suitcase. The entry space into the room was 8x8 and bare, except for a vanity with no chair. Also, a small overhead light was not enough to make the vanity usable. I had a strong feeling that the room had had another, happier life. It was just too sparse that I feel sure no decorator planned for it to appear as it did. Too bad it was not completely refitted for a hotel room.The bath was 9 feet long with one little 12\" towel bar near the far end. Otherwise, bare wall.Very strange decor, but the bathtub itself was deep and lovely. I know this may sound picky, but we had just left a fabulous hotel for the same price, with bell hops, great service, fresh flowers. And great free wireless. Cedarbrook advertises free wireless, but not in our room. Nada. I called the front desk and was told that it didn't quite reach all the way to the end of the hall but I could walk to the desk with my laptop and turn it on there, get online and then walk back to my room and usually the wireless would keep working. I am not making this up! I never got a signal at all. The restaurant was beautiful and the food was great. We had dinner, no drinks and a bottle of wine for $175. Well it was good food and good service. We did not eat the continental breakfast included with the room because we had to spend that time hustling our bags back to the car. We travel frequently with no budget issues. But I know a good value for a great place, and Cedarbrook is not it. The hotel advertises as a great place for a conference or a wedding. This might be true. There are little living rooms in the middle of the halls with a frig filled with ice cream and other treats. Maybe this works well for togetherness for a large group.

We love the family room with the snacks, especially with a late flight...cheese sticks, water and yogurt hit the spot at midnight. The candy and the ice cream are also fun for that \"must have\" treat...just because. The rooms are not huge, but nicely set up and comforabel with good products in the bathroom AND you can brew Starbucks while showering..not a bad way to start a Seattle trip. The breakfast has moved to a bigger room and the lobby changed somewhat also, but it is very nice. It is not a super family friendly place, not much for kids to do, but it is a great place to sleep and have breakfast...kids can deal without the pool and snack machines! The breakfast has terrific oatmeal and granola that I often replicate at home. I just can't say enough about how much I like this hotel.

Having never been there, we relied on TripAdvisor reviews and were happy we did. We got a great AAA rate, which gave us three nights for the price of one, and a late checkout on our last day. However, we weren't aware there was also a complimentary upgrade to the next class of room until we actually made the reservations and got the confirmation letter where that detail was mentioned. Thus, we paid for the suite and could have paid for the smaller room and been upgraded to the suite for the same price. When we mentioned this at check-in, we were told there are only a limited number of suites and we may not have been able to get a suite if it had already been booked anyway - adding that there had been a number of inquiries into the suite. This was not a big deal, and on the plus side, they honored the credit for checked baggage where they reimburse you the cost of checked baggage (one bag for each (max two), for the flight to Seattle). The website said they would not credit the cost if combined with any other promotion (AAA), but they reimbursed us with no problem at all. I believe this promotion expires in March of this 2011. Without going into detail, we agree with the other positive reviews here....great service, comfy bed, free healthy breakfast (wonderful if you're not expecting bacon and pancakes), great view from our room, a wonderful clean gym that I want in my own home - with Life Fitness equipment and men's/women's bathroom with shower and towels and a great view while exercising. In the room, the TV is a little on the small and old side, but it worked just fine for us. Inside the room with the windows closed, we never heard any airport noise. I'm always about the bathroom, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a magnified make-up mirror, and the tub was huge (see pics). Our shuttle drivers picked us up from the airport, and shuttled us to the Lite Rail, which took us to downtown. Kudos to Tasha and Alice, who were both friendly, informative and warm. We found a few hairs and a mud smudge on the bathroom floor after housekeeping had cleaned, but we met the housekeeper and she was also warm, pleasant and friendly. A great, quiet and romantic stay at the Cedarbrook Lodge! Oh, and my brother and his wife stayed at the lodge as well.

If your expectations are sufficiently set, you will be pleased. The rooms were comfortable and spacious, the beds were wonderful. The hotel staff was pleasant but seemed young and inexperienced at times. When checking out, they had trouble fixing errors that were made in my final bill. I expected more from a top-tier boutique hotel. The facilities and amenities at Cedarbrook are pleasant, but limited. Aside from a fantastic restaurant (Copperleaf), a small bar, and a large workout room, there isn't much to do aside from relax. However the hotel is so close to local shops, movie theaters, and restaurants, that is hardly a problem. The grounds were beautiful as well, but rustic and not highly manicured. If I had to gripe, I would point out that there was some trash in the landscaping, and that we clearly saw a \"working girl\" on her way out in the morning with her \"companion\".

However, the rest of the room was clean and well-maintained, the furniture was high-quality and the bed (and pillows) were ahhhhhhhh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so comfortable. One word of warning: no high-def television. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to me, but I know it does to some.

Our sever, Niecy, was knowledgeable and extremely polite. The bartender, Joey, recommended a very nice beer for my husband and the other wait staff were very friendly. I honestly hope guests continue to respect this place. I can see people taking advantage of the hospitality this place offers (taking more free food, water, etc. than one could possibly consume). I didn't see anyone doing that, but I can see it being a problem. My only complaint, if I had one, would be that I miss not having a fridge in the room. If you have something you need to keep cold (like the homemade cheeses we bought to take home from Beechers), you would have to keep it in the community fridge (no thank you). So I got some ice and made my own \"fridge\" in the room. It worked. :) My only other complaint would be that we couldn't stay longer! I can't believe this place!

This is a gorgeous hotel, with beautiful landscaped property. We like to sleep with the window open, and heard some faint noise from planes, but otherwise you would never know this serene hotel is minutes from the airport. There is a free shuttle from the airport plus they will shuttle you to the large, nearby mall. The only thing negative thing I would want people to know is that if you have mobility issues, you may want to stay elsewhere; there is a fair bit of walking to get around the property. There is no one to handle luggage and it was a bit difficult to get our luggage from our car to our room as they only have one(!!!) luggage cart and getting it from the main building to our building was a bit of an adventure. We did speak to the manager on duty regarding getting a cart for all three buildings, which would be extremely helpful to travellers with luggage. The hotel consists of three separate buildings connected by pretty walkways with extensive and lush landscaping throughout. Service was excellent and always pleasant. There are separate lounges in each of the buildings where there is free: Haagen Dazs ice cream cups, fruit, local Tim's potato chips, the best chocolate malt balls I have ever tasted, chocolate covered raisins, yogurt and string cheese, plus local Talking Rain water. We stayed in a studio suite, which is extremely spacious for two with a murphy bed. The decor is light and airy and modern, as evidenced in the other areas of the hotel. Though we enjoyed our room, it seemed a bit \"office-ish\" and on the hotel website we noticed later that the bed is put up to turn the room into a conference room. Though comfortable, I would not recommend it for a romantic getaway. As another reviewer noted, the queen bed is probably not a full queen as it seemed slightly small to us, but was very comfortable and we had a great sleep. I also would have appreciated some bedside lighting -- there is none for those of you who like to read in bed. The bathroom was well-lit and the deep soaker tub most enjoyable; the shower had excellent shower pressure. Wifi was slow at times, but otherwise worked well. The restaurant has amazing local farm to table organic cusine on par with restaurants downtown. Even you've got a fairly long layover between flights, consider the short trip on their shuttle to have some great local Northwest food. Also, the continental breakfast is fairly extensive - bagels, smoked salmon, fruits and cereals and pastries -- you would be hard-pressed to find nothing to eat.

It was one of the top highlights of our entire vacation! The amenties were awesome, the staff was incredibly friendly (every staff person we met was genuinely pleasant and helpful), and the room was stellar--underscored by the very reasonable price per night. Now to be frank, I went into this a little bit skeptical in light of all the previous rave reviews, but wound up completely wow'ed by the place. I chose the Cedarbrook Lodge, after much internal debate about the pro's and con's of staying closer to downtown and staying somewhere that wasn't a known quantity (familiar hotel chain). I made the choice after careful consideration of the reviews for the top 10 hotels in the Seattle area. We were not particularly worried about price (albeit it's always a consideration) but we were mostly concerned about access to downtown from the SEATAC area juxtaposed against the exorbitant parking fees at downtown chain hotels and the industry's ridiculous, but common tendency to nickel and dime you for everything. Not the Cedarbrook. Free parking, free wi-fi, free breakfast, free shuttle. For example, the Cedarbrook provides a very responsive shuttle to and from the local train station about 5 minutes away--(well worth the price of admission) not to mention the posh free breakfast and well-appointed fridge/freezer in the common \"living rooms\" with Haagen Das, bottled water and other light snacks.

This time I had some meetings near the the airport and decided to try out Cedarbrook for two nights. What a great experience. As other reviewers have said you would never know you're only several minutes from the airport. The Lodge is in sort of a residential area and I didn't hear or see an airplane the entire stay. The facility was really built for conferences and is set up so that you can stay on the grounds for several days and not feel cooped up. There is one main building with reception, restaurant, etc. and three additional buildings, each 3 stories, with the guest rooms. The feeling is homey and spacious. Each guest building has a lounge with a pantry with the much-discussed free snacks. Free parking and free wired and wireless internet in the room although my room got spotty wifi reception. I did not see many other guests so either the buildings absorb the activity really well or their occupancy is low. The guest room seemed a little small to me considering how spacious the rest of the facility is but it was well appointed, clean and modern. The bathroom in particular was nice--well lit and plenty of counter space. We had dinner in the restaurant. I found the quality excellent and would compare it to any standalone restaurant. Prices were reasonable and they participate in Restaurant Week so they had a $25 3-course menu that was great value. Service all-around in the hotel and restaurant was attentive. The staff tends to be younger so they are not up to the level of say a concierge at a high end hotel, but they try hard and are friendly. I don't know what year the resort was built but it seems new and is spotlessly maintained. I understand Washington Mutual used to own it but since they were sold to JP Morgan I don't know who took it over.

Kudos to Lorie and Ian at the front desk! More concierge training for others needed, however! Free shuttle to Sea-Tac and light rail into town is very handy! Great environment! (See their website!) Restful plus! Someone here really knows fine dining but they need to work on how it is finally delivered to the guests. My evening meal was at the bar which is way to small to have a pool table crammed in the center of it! I got cracked in the ribs by the pool cue of one player while I was eating at the bar, which sent one inebriated female of a certain age into loud whoops of laughter. (Nothing like being laughed at while trying to enjoy dinner.) The bartender was a bit atitude-y as well. Food was ok but as often is the case, the menu hyperbole outshone the finished product. My companion's dungeness crab sandwich was by his estimate excessively oily, and my BLT made with pork belly was not as good as I expected. The complementary continental breakfast was wonderful - with (peeled) hard boiled eggs, smoked salmon with capers, , bagels, and a great blueberry pastry among other great choices. The comment earlier about food not appropriate for children was groundless. There was even oatmeal, for heaven sake! Lunch al fresco on the lovely terrace area the next day was some bettter, but service was maddeningly slow. My friend's Caesar salad presented only a few greens, with the parmesan regiano, the chicken, and anchovies just sort of dumped into this enormous bowl. It looked very unappetizing. My burger however was excellent, though there were no salt or pepper shakers in evidence and requests took over 10 minutes to be heeded. Many guests were curious about what we presumed to be big jars of sun tea sitting on the terrace. Mid-meal, I asked our (overly) officious server who grandly announced that, yes, it was indeed sun-tea and it was a gratis service. He however had failed to mention that when he took our beverage orders. My request for him to leave the (elegant) water pitcher on the tabel was agreed to after the obligitory caveat of \"Well, we don't normally do that...but...\") The tea was delicious and they should've put little announcements letting the guests know about it. Chocolate banana bread pudding was somewhat bland. The nice free youghurt or ice cream in the living areas would've been better.Tip! BYO soft drinks to go with the free water! !

We looked at this particular hotel initially because they were associated with the Rock-n-Roll marathon but we picked them for many other reasons. First, the pictures and the website are dead on. The place was beautiful! We stayed in a double queen bed room and it was huge. The set up of the room was perfect, with a long desk along the front wall. There were two closets, and built in cabinet where the TV was kept. Right next to the oversize windows, they had a lounge chair and table. The bathroom was large and very clean. I believe there are three different \"lodges\" and each building has an individual \"family room\" type area. While the individual rooms don't have refrigerators (which is something I normally need to have); you are encouraged to use the large one in this family room. And there are FREE snacks~~~ three different types of malt balls, string cheese, yogurt, and Hagen Diaz ice cream. I admit that we definitely helped ourselves to these on a daily basis. Our booking deal came with a credit to the restaurant, Copper Leaf. We liked the seasonal menu and came back both nights. I recently finished culinary school and was really impressed with the food we received. I especially liked the presentation of their butter with the sea salt sprinkled down the middle. I had the most tender and light gnocchi/ fava bean dish ever. Initially the price can seem steep but everything we had seemed to be very worth the price, except maybe the soup, which was tasty but nothing overly special. We ate outside both nights and really enjoyed the setting. Another bonus was that we could just add the bill to the room charges, no questions asked. Nice and convenient. We walked the grounds and found what looked like very well tended herb gardens. We also took a walk through the greenbelt that circles the property. Everything was quiet and peaceful. I was really surprised at how close we were to the airport but how little of the noise we heard. And I liked that we could see the planes take off from our room, like they were in our backyard! And let me not forget the staff! From the minute I called to ask questions about the hotel to the minute we left, we were impressed. Everyone was not only nice but KNOWLEDGEABLE!

When I checked in, I felt like I was stepping into a cozy yet refined mountain lodge. The gentleman at the desk was extremely gracious and, to my delight, informed me there was complimentary ice cream, bottled water, yogurt, fresh fruit, and other snacks in the lounge near my room (which also featured a lit fireplace, books, and comfy chairs).

(This is due to the fact that the hotel is made up of separate lodges). I was so exhausted and unable to take one more frustration that I had a \"meltdown\" at the desk and this is where I first learned how fabulous this hotel's service is: they insisted on accompanying me out to the parking lot, and staying with me until I got settled into the room. They could not have been more solicitous even though I was beyond \"cranky.\" Although the restaurant was closed, they were able to rustle up a fantastic dinner in a beautiful room with a fireplace, and next morning the excellent service continued in the form of a most wonderful breakfast buffet. I've only been commenting on the service here, so let me also point out the comfort and beautiful furnishings of the room. Also, each of the lodges that makes up the hotel has a lovely sitting room with snacks, books, etc. It could not have been more comfortable and charming.

Covered walkways lead you a few steps to side buildings holding the guest rooms. All rooms face either the wetlands or an interior view of beautifully landscaped trees, bushes and the occasional squirrel. The rooms are modern, glass, wood and chrome themed. Clean and obviously well cared for. The rooms are so quiet you are barely aware of other guests. A central lounge in each of the buildings holds a fireplace, tv, small library and a refrigerator stocked with all the free bottled water, yogurt, ice cream and string cheese you can drag to your room.
