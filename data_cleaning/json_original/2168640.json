The location is perfect 50 m. from tram and 200 m.from grand baazar. 10 minutes walk from Ayia Sofia Blue mosque and Top capi. Very quite smole street, Friendly staf (Metin is nice man) good breacfast. The only minor is that, the coridor some times noisy at the afternoon if you want to have a siesta.
