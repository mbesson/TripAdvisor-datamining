Like its sister hotels, Basico (also in Playa) and Habita (in Mexico City), Deseo is a \"design hotel,\" a place that focuses more on style than substance. This didn't matter much to me and my travelling companion, as we were there mostly for the beach and to hang out, and didn't spend much time in the room. That said, the (very) small room was comfortable and quiet, the bed was comfy, and the bathroom was enjoyable, but there was basically nothing in here but a bed. In addition to the amenities in the room, there were things for sale that could be added to the final bill, and you just took what you wanted (a beach bag, flipflops, Deseo tank top & undies, etc) and the hotel added those things to your tab upon checkout. This is a nice hotel for a young couple or single person, but this is not a hotel you would stay at for the restaurant or bar, the former of which is non-existant and the latter of which is pretty basic. There were some nice cabana beds on the patio, and at dusk/dark when the DJ set up came out, the patio took on some life (locals hung out here more than tourists).

So, the good - the design is fantastic. Attention to detail in the design is excellent, it really is a study in minimalism, and I loved that element. But that is really all there is - you would expect a minimalist room with no TV, etc. to be very calming, an oasis of white. This would be the case if not for the location of the hotel and the operation of the poolside disco. Now, I know that Playa del Carmen is a late night place and that is fine. But the Deseo is built around a pool courtyard that becomes a disco. This disco is open until 1:00 AM every night - and at times there were people there until 2:00 - 2:30 AM. There is no sound insulation at all in the rooms and the music is not really \"lounge\" music as mentioned in some reviews. When the hotel bar closes, then the street life on 12th Street picks up. Until 6 AM, every day. I tried earplugs, staying out late, etc. - but I could not do it for 7 nights in a row. They must make more income off the bar than the rooms, because it is unbearable after a few days - I left absolutely exhausted. From a design perspective, the noise just bounces off all of the hard surfaces and there is not nearly enough attention to making the room sound-proof and a relaxing retreat. I know I sound like an old fogey, but really am not - I love a trendy hotel, but think that one of the reasons to stay in a hotel is to get a good night's sleep.

Some people evidently dislike the simplistic approach of this property. We love it. Very quiet during the day...a bustling nite club in the evening ...playing the coolest chill out music you'll ever hear. Feel free to approach the DJ and ask him what music he's playing....make a note of it for reference when you get back home. The rooms are very clean. The decor is wonderfully simple...mostly marble, Euro appointments, piped in music, incense, no TV, hammocks on the 2nd floor balcony rooms (I recommend you stay on the 2nd floor), and very comfortable bed and awesome linens. The open shower design tends to wet the bathroom floor but throw a towel down,,,no problem. The shower head is awesome. The pool area during the day is second to none. Very tranquil with the best lounge mattresses you'll ever encounter. Cool music in the background, great view of 5th avenue from the second floor pool location, you cannot beat this experience. We loved it. Bring your camera. Check out Deseo's sister property down the street: Hotel Basico. This is a COOL hotel. A little hard, yet fun, to get to...you have to take a freight elevator up to the hotel lobby. Check out the top floor with lounge and pool area. The two conjoined pools are oil tanks converted into more of a soaking pool concept rather than a conventional swimming pool. Great view of the ocean from this top floor.

Needless to say its right in the heart of town and extremely noisy but the hotel provides ear plugs so that was a bonus. Very comfortable bed but the room itself is far too minimilist and for that, not particularly functional. The first morning we were woken at 8am by drilling and hammering into the floor below us as the wine bar downstairs was replacing part of their ceiling. We were blessed with the same the second morning as well. The shower would have been great had it not been blocked full of hair but regardless there is no divider so water floods the whole bathroom area, somewhat hazardous with the travertine floor. The fitttings are stylish but cheap and badly installed. Nobody called the first day to tell us which room we had to move to so we stayed where we were. The bar outside and pool area are largely for show and are really not functional at all but be prepared to be up until 1am until it closes. We should have complained about the drilling the morning it happened but we had more important things to do so when it came to checking out the very casual staff (there does not seem to be anybody in charge in this place) couldn't have cared less, in fact they didn't even answer. We were forced to pay for two nights in the suite as we were never moved so lesson learn't, get writen confirmation of your rates.

We didn't need a hotel on the beach as the beach is not that far away. And the tickets the hotel gives you to the cool Tides beach are to die for, as the beds are very much in demand. The Tides or Nuddy Beach Club is the hippest spot to spend the day on. Ask for a nice guy called Mundo, he is very friendly and helpful getting a bed. The staff back at the hotel are friendly and the bar tenders make very good drinks. Now, the noise. We knew in advance what we would have to deal with; but we could not have expected that it continues until 6:00am. Here is the reason; as I went to find out the root cause. The hotel bar is not the problem - that ends at 1:00am and we would go to sleep at around 12:30 anyway. It is the massive club on 12 Norte right behind the hotel that wins the prize. It goes on everyday and the clubbers spill out into the street right underneath the hotel. SO if you want to get away from that but still stay at the hotel, your best bet is the inner rooms with no blacolney on 12 Norte....this however would prevent you from staying in the super suite!
