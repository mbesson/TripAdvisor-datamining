I read several reviews prior to booking the accommodation at the Shaftesbury which hinted the hotel wasn't very good, and I regret not giving greater consideration to these sentiments. THE BAD - Someone at the hotel distributed information about my booking to a third party person who called reception. I felt that this was an unacceptable violation of my privacy. When I called to complain, the manager stated that she felt this was not wrong, because the person enquiring 'knew my name and room number'. Certainly if they were entitled to know these details, they could have asked me for this information directly. I had informed this person of my room number so that when they called the hotel they could ask to be connected to Room Number \"X\". I did not tell them further details about my stay for a reason. - When I called reception to request fresh towels on my second day, I was told someone would bring them up to my room. This call was made at 3.30 in the afternoon. No one came, and so at 7.30 in the evening I called reception again and requested fresh towels. Once again, I was informed that someone would bring them up, yet no one came. When I complained the following morning, the man at reception explained that no towels were brought because the staff at reception 'did not know where they were'. I found this to be a little strange, yet if this was the case then why did reception inform me that they would be able to provide me with extra towels twice? Moreover, why is it written in their guest information book that extra towels can be provided upon request? - The following morning one of the house keeping staff walked into my room without knocking. I was getting undressed at the time she opened the door. I was startled, and immediately grabbed the doona to cover myself up. Despite this, the woman did not excuse herself and stood at the door looking into the room. As I reached for clothes to put on, she walked into the room saying 'sorry' over and over again and began the housekeeping service. She did not appear to speak much English, yet common courtesy is a universal language. - The hotel room did not have air conditioning, and was uncomfortably warm even when the heating was turned off. In an attempt to regulate the temperature I opened the window, however there was an unpleasant smell outside which forced me to leave it closed. The hotel room was so warm that when I woke up in the morning I was covered in sweat and both my clothes and the bed sheets were damp. Because of this, I asked one of the housekeeping staff to kindly change my bedsheets (also stating that it was the 3rd day of my stay). She said 'no' and 'sorry' over and over again. I was confused by her refusal. My bedsheets were changed after I called reception to complain about the incident. - The mattresses are old and uncomfortable. There is a notable groove in them, and I noted that some of the springs in the mattresses in my room were poking out. - The hotel is not as clean as one would expect. I noted one or two small hairs on the bed linen when I arrived, coffee cup rings on the table, tears in the wallpaper, stains on the wallpaper, some mould in the shower, soap scum on the side of the washbasin table that faced the shower, and lipstick stains on the hairdryer. - The furniture appeared to be unstable; when I sat down on a both chairs in my room I felt the legs strain under my weight. As a person of 5'8'' weighing 50 kg, I certainly don't feel like I should worry about breaking a chair when I sit on it. - Internet access is only available through ADSL. As the cord was only 1 meter long, it restricts you to sitting at the table should you need to use the internet during your stay. THE GOOD Certainly there are a few positive things about this hotel: a large flatscreen television, a complimentary newspaper each day, a selection of recent magazines in your room (although they were limited to fashion and beauty magazines), fresh flowers in your room upon arrival (only upon arrival), two bottles of complimentary water (only upon arrival). However, these embellishments do not detract from what the hotel is lacking: the basics (!). In my opinion, the Shaftesbury's location is it's only redeeming quality.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected!\u201d", "Author": "Frenzotic", "ReviewID": "UR124026592", "Content": "My father in law had booked 2 rooms; one for him and his wife, one for me and my other half here for 3 nights. He booked before telling us so I had to quickly check it out, the location was ideal but after reading many other reviews I felt the rooms could potentially be too small for them as they are a large couple and such a small room could be quite uncomfortable. I was quite wary of this, I was also wary about parking, parking is very limited and is on a first come first serve basis costing \u00c2\u00a320 a day. I made note that there was a large NCP multi storey parking nearby. When we got there there was no parking area so I parked to the kerbside, infront of the hotel, to allow the in-laws to quickly check in. We were only at reception for 5 minutes before I noticed my car outside was about to be TOWED AWAY! Yes, outside 2 men and their van were looking at my car ready to take, me and the half ran outside to quickly tell them we were just checking in. Let this be a warning not to park your car for too long or at least keep an eye on it incase. Fortunately there was parking available in a chained-off area specific to the hotel. The reception is small but clean and modern with such friendly staff. We took the lift to our floor and noticed the hallway is fairly narrow but what we noticed more was how 'soft' the carpets were. The sort of sinking-soft as if the underlayer was put in unevenly, be warned the floors like to creak a bit but it wasn't such an issue as you cannot hear it if someone walks past your room. The in-laws booked a club room for themselves and a double for us. I must admit their room took me by surprised as it was actually quite big and cosy with a lovely sofa, plasma tv and even had a microwave(sadly no fridge). They had windows and a door leading onto the roof/fire exit area, unfortunately the view is just of the side of the next building but it didn't bother them so much. The room decor is lovely and the bathroom is stylish with instant hot water(you actually have to turn the dial to slightly cold to get the perfect temperature so don't turn it on hot immediately!). I think the only issue they may have had in their room was the air con that didn't quite warm up their room enough to their liking. My and the other half's room was smaller but quite adequate for us. The only issue I may have had was there is too much lighting in the bathroom, you can't dim it or turn the lights by the sink off and the bath towels didn't smell that pleasant...rather sweaty smelling. Overall however, the stay was very pleasant, very close to the bustling streets of Craven Road which houses many restaurants, shops, hotels, pubs and the train station and underground.

From these reviews it seems common that you do not get booked into the hotel of your choice. Secondly if you want a double bed make sure it is one. We were booked in at the Hyde Park hotel but on arrival at 2200h were told rather curtly by the unsmiling receptionist that due to maintenance there were no rooms and we would be transferred. the bar man made us welcome and gave us a complimentary drink while we waited for the taxi that the hotel ordered. Taxi duly arrived and dropped us off at the next Shaftesbury hotel. Wrong hotel!! Wee had to walk down the road to another of this chain's hotel--the one I am now reviewing. Of the three Shaftesbury Premiers we visited that night this was the least appealing reception but staff were very efficient and welcoming. The room was a club room and was well appointed with a sofa and armchair. Excellent TV and good wardrobe space. Terrible view of a concrete wall but as it was winter it did not matter much. The big problem for us was the double bed. It was two single beds pushed together-not only that but with single bed bedding! Not impressed but as it was late my wife was happy to put up with it rather than move (if they had any double beds). Excellent bathroom though the shower/bath water was only warm whilst the sink had very hot water. The room heating was poor, despite us complaining on the first morning. Not good in winter. Lighting could have been better as there was no light in the central part of the room. We were given complimentary breakfast to make up for having to move. It was good and a reasonable choice. Breakfast staff excellent and helpful. Hotel had poor signage, particularly to reception and to the bar and restaurant.

We booked this hotel for its proximity to Paddington as we were arriving on a late train. Despite having booked more than a month in advance, they had no rooms. As the reception staff were trainees and the manager lives out of town, there was nothing they could do except ask us to stay one night in their Kensington Town House, and come back here for the second night. They offered us a 'complimentary' taxi (I should bloody well say so). The manager knew about the 'maintenance issues' and should have arranged for equal (Town House is not as good) or better accomodation in Paddington, since this is where we had paid to be. And shouldn't have left trainees on reception without authorisation to deal with these issues. Whilst we remonstrated with them, another very similar argument was going on next to us with another couple, seems a pretty common occurence. We asked them to show us where on the map Kensington Town House was, and they pointed vaguely at Kensington Gardens (it's a park!). They didn't even know where they were sending us!! We had to ask them for the address, then look it up ourselves, then show them where it was on the map! Outrageous. In the end, we stayed one night at the Town House (having declined their Hyde Park two single rooms offer - we're a couple on a weekend in London!!), and transferred back to Paddington, where we were upgraded to a Club Room, given free breakfast both mornings, a bottle of wine and plate of fruit to compensate our disappointment. Despite these efforts to compensate, we wanted two nights in the location we had chosen and booked in advance without the inconvenience of moving between hotels. Overall, felt that they were trying to buy us off, for deliberately overbooking, to fill a lesser quality hotel in a location we didn't want to be.

While I can expect the rooms in London to be small, similar to the ones in the budget hotels of Singapore, I cannot expect a 4-star hotel in London to be leaking from the ceiling and the lack of smile and politeness from the staff. 1) There was a night when it was raining the whole day and night. When I woke up, I saw the ceiling leaking water. It was a stream of water flowing. It only became better, and subsequently stopped, when I turned off the air-con. 2) The counter staff - of particular a lady of Indian origin - never did smile. And when she could not understand my question in English (probably due to accent and style of speech) she immediately turned away and continue with her work. 3) When I requested for late check-out as I was enrolled into the hotel chain's loyalty customer programme (premier club rewards), I was flatly told that the check-out time was 1 hour after the published time of 1200h. To me this was not a late check-out as small hotel even without being their loyalty member allow their customers to check out from 1230h to even 1300h.

A small writing table and a single seat sofa with a side table. Tea/coffee making amenities were also available. A pity was that for this room, no refrigerator is available.

Yes its true that was a little hard to find but once you know where you are its actually in a great location, virtually behind Paddington station. Perfect! So on checking in, make sure that your booking is in the correct name, couldnt find us on the system as my partners surname was spelt incorrectly. Anyway we were charged a \u00c2\u00a310 fee for something but unsure really as to what that is for. was told to cover any extras but should get it back in a week. i will wait for that but wont hold my breath!! ok so for the room itself.....room 002 we were allocated and was told it was large room, mmmm not really the right description i would say. pokey springs to mind but as it was only a base, size not that important. the bed was a double but for 2 people it was a bit erm how would i put it........compact maybe lol. the room did have sufficient storage space to hang clothes etc. had safe which is free, decent size tv with plenty of channels, kettle with tea & coffee etc, iron and board in wardrobe which i thought was great, NO fridge though. Furnishings probably could do with updating, curtains need hanging correctly, covers on bed clean. Bathroom was really small and getting into the shower was not easy especially if you are tall and slightly bigger, dont get me wrong we are not obese people here but 2 tall average built people. you probably need to be under a size 34 waist or size 10 lol but the shower was really good. overall the room was clean and tidy but not big enough to accomodate 2 people however as its only a base you can deal with it for 2 nights but wouldnt for any longer. so for the reception and restaurant staff.....very pleasant on arrival and the 2 who were at breakfast were pleasant too. the price we paid did include breakfast which was good enough but if i had to pay the \u00c2\u00a315 each i probably wouldnt have. plenty of choice with full english available, continental and cereals, fruit, croissants (dry) and small selection of bread etc. the full english consisted of bacon (smoked) sausages (catering ones) hash browns, beans (warm) scrambled eggs, mushrooms (tinned variety...yuck). The coffee was nice but maybe could be little warmer. The restaurant itself was very clean and quite contemporary which i did like. if you do get the room next to reception beware, it does get noisy and as you have to smoke out the front, it is right by the bedroom window. was really noisy throughout last night and we had awful nights sleep. this review is not me whinging but a real review of what it is like. the hotel is good enough to stay in and for the price you cant go wrong. should it be classed as 4*? not really, more 3*, would i stay again? yes but not in that room. would i reccommend? probably.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland Park, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cMixed experience\u201d", "Author": "bdk418", "ReviewID": "UR98038448", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in January, paying GBP 58 per night.

Mind you, there is no fridge, but for a two night stay, it didn't matter for us. I would not know how the rooms would have been if we were given the Deluxe Twin Room we originally booked for. But, the fact that they had upgraded us to a bigger room just shows that they are courteous - and judging from another review I read, most times, they will upgrade if you ask.

The bathroom is small, you can use the bath and the sink all whilst sitting on the loo! I think my understairs cupboard is bigger at home! On a serious note getting in and out of the shower was tricky for an able bodied, fit average sized individual and for anyone lacking in mobility or lets say more generously proportioned will struggle.

We booked for 2 adults and a child requiring a cot however the room was accessed via 8 steps inside the rooms front door (so it was almost impossible to get our pushchair in) then the room its self had a (extremely dirty including a used plaster stuck to it) travel cot unmade up. We tried to make this cot up however the room was too small to fit the cot in even when we moved out all movable furniture into the shower room. We contacted the manager who said this was the only room available and we \"should be lucky to have this\" as she had to \"call around to get this\" for us. By this time it was 10pm and we had gone to check in at the original hotel at 7pm. My daughter is 2years old and very tired as it was 3 hours past her bedtime. The manager gave us access to the hotel computer to find alternative accommodation but would not tell us any local hotel names outside the chain which she told us again had no other rooms. At this very late time in the day we could not find an alternative so we had no choice but to stay in the room offered as an alternative to the room we booked. This room was NOT suitable for us and was in no way \"Deluxe\" or a suitable alternative for the \"just refurbished\" room we had in our booking. The shower room was clean however the sink did not drain properly and their was no cold water. As their was no room for a cot and the bed was very small our daughter had to sleep on the floor. The room was very noisy both from outside as their was not adequate sound proofing/double glazing and their was also a lot of noise from other rooms, we could hear the tv of our neighbours very clearly and were woken by other guests loud arguments and door slamming. I fully realise that other guests actions are not the fault of the hotel however this made our stay even worse. The bed linen was stained, the fridge did not work, the light smoked and smelt of burning, their was a dead bug on the desk and an alive one crawling up the wall and I think their should have been a radiator cover but instead their was a broken and rough bit of wall and wood (not very safe for my daughter or us adults either) In summary the hotel we booked had not allocated us a room, we had a long wait for a room, the alternative hotel was not in the area we wanted to stay in and its room was unsuitable, unclean and unsafe. The staffs attitude was terrible but i guess they had heard the same complaints time and time again.

I am still fuming from the worst experience and service i have ever come across in any hotel in London and I've been around a few! Firstly make no mistakes, this is NOT a 4 star hotel, it would barely get a 3 star based on cleaniness but take the size of rooms and staff attitute in account and it quickly drops down to barely a 1 star for me. Arrived to check in at 9pm after a long days work and travelling and what you expect from a 4 star hotel costing almost \u00c2\u00a3200 per night is to be swiftly checked in and have a comfortable room to put your head down. Oh no... not in this place! There were 2 receptionists and there were 2 other guests who were trying to check in when we arrived but the hotel could not find their reservation so we were asked to TAKE A SEAT while they sorted that out even though there were 2 at reception and one of the two could have checked us in. 15 minutes later and still no sign of anything being sorted out. The two gentlemen in front of me were being messed about big time, they were asked to pay again for a pre-paid reservation and had to deal with the now almost famous rude and argumentative receptionist as mentioned in previous reviews. 20 minutes gone, then 25 and we are still on the sofa... with half an hour gone i couldn't take any longer and walked up to them again only to be met with the rudest reply ever \"I am dealing with another customer, you just have to wait\", not even an apology for the wait. Asked why the second receptionist could not check us in since he did not seem to be doing anything but no... why would he be bothered? The attitute of the staff was truly unbelievable, extraordinarily bad... they could not have made a guest feel so unwelcomed even if they tried! To cut a very very long story short, after 45 minutes they finally called us to check us in and suprise suprise... they couldn't find my reservation either! Again no apologies, and apparently it was not even their fault, it was \"central reservations\" that messed it up. Great! so we get the worst service ever, not even a tiny apology for the wait and the messing about and it is not even their fault! I really lost it when the receptionist asked us to take a seat again until she typed in using one finger all the information of the booking and checked with central reservations and blah blah blah... this was the biggest farce of a hotel reception i had ever seen. The rudeness of the lady who was supposedly checkingus in was unbelievable, has a manager or owner never seen the way this woman treats their customers? If she was working for me and treated gusts this way she would've been out of the door yesterday... it was almost 10:30pm, a whole 90 minutes since we first walked through the front door that we finally got the room key from a guy who appeared to had just arrived and who was wearing his namebadge upside down. We were given the keys with these exact words: \"if you don't like the room you can ask the morning shift to change you tomorrow\". I was dreading what would lie behind the door of the room... how can anyone send of a customer to their 4 star hotel room with those words? Unreal! Off to the room... it was in the basement, not a good start but i did not mind too much about that, as long as it was comfortable and quiet it would do nicely for my 2 night stay. But it was not. Tiny tiny tiny with a single bed and barely room to move around it. The width of the room was no more than 4 feet at best! How are they even allowed to advertise this place as a 4 star is unknown to me. Look out of the window and not only was it in the basement, someone thought it would be a good ideat to install 6 huge airconditioning units, suspended at ground floor level above the room window, blocking any hint of natural light that we may had seen the morning after and leaving you to go to sleep with the sound of the aircondition units in your room. Needless to say i did not wait until the day after, walked straight out of the room and back uo to reception well prepared to just check-out and move to another hotel if my request for another room was turned down. Luckily for all concerned, they did not argue with me much and they \"upgraded\" me to a \"club room\" on the first floor. Much better than the rubbish i was first allocated but still nowhere near the level expected when paying this sort of money for the night. The double bed was not even a proper double, only a 4ft one, the TV was very stupidly placed on the side wall next to your pillows so in effect you had no chance of watching it from bed and as there is simply nowhere else in the room to sit than the bed it did not make any sense at all. The room was again very very small, even smaller than the rooms at the likes of the 3 star Stylotel that i have also reviewd which for less than half the price of this place offers a lot more, bigger rooms and above all friendly service. It was now 11:15pm and i finally had a room where i could at least sleep for a few hours before checkign out early the next morning and heading for the hilton Paddington nearby. I would never ever recommend this lace, not even to my worst enemy, even they don't deserve to be put through this!

I'd read in other reviews that you can sometimes get a complimentary upgrade to a club double room, so I asked, but was told there were none available. Our triple was really nice...large room with a comfy king bed (two twins pushed together), sofabed (perfect for our teenager), nice bathroom, frig, microwave, coffee/tea, safe, large windows across one entire wall ... even a vase of fresh flowers. Unfortunately, my in-laws didn't fare as well. Reports of the tiny doubles are true. But, they got situated and said it was fine, especially for the price.

It worked out at \u00c2\u00a333 per person per night (room only) which I thought was excellent value for a 4* hotel, however, I would NOT class this hotel as 4*. On arrival, despite booking 2 deluxe doubles we were told that there was only 1 available so we could either have 1 double and 2 single rooms, or a double room in their 'sister' hotel. There was no way I would leave my sisters on their own and they didn't want to be separated from us so they opted for a single room each. I wasn't really happy with this either but at least we were together and their 2 single rooms were on the same floor. However, these rooms were only available for 1 night and a double was being made available for our second night. My sisters were told not to unpack, leave the bags in their rooms and when we came back after being out all day their bags would be in the new room. I felt this was inappropriate for us but could have been worse - what if we had been 2 couples or a family with children old enough to have their own room but not old enough to be left on their own? Ridiculous. After sorting this out the woman then asked me how I would like to pay. We had already paid through lastminute.com so I told her this, she started arguing with me saying that no we had not paid, after looking on her computer she realised that we had, in fact, already paid. We were given no apology. This woman was extremely rude, when we first arrived she just said there was a problem then spent 10mins on the phone without explaining about the room situation, we didn't have a clue what was wrong. She also demanded that we give a \u00c2\u00a310 'swab' of our credit cards incase we didn't pay for any extras we had used, I found this quite insulting and have never had to do this at any other hotel. When we finally got in to the room I couldn't believe how tiny it was, the so called 'deluxe double' was the SAME SIZE as my sisters single room! The bed was NOT a double so anybody slightly over weight, big built, pregnant or over 5 ft 10, do not stay here! There was hardly any storage - no where to store luggage so we were constantly tripping over it, only 4 tiny 'cuby holes' and 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe and no drawers - how is this enough for 2 people?! If we had a small child or baby god knows where a cot would have fitted. The rooms were also boiling and the aircon didn't seem to do anything, it didn't go below 19degrees anyway but we left it on from the minute we arrived to the minute we left and it not once felt any cooler. We couldn't open the window as we were on the ground floor at the back of the hotel, with a lovely view of a wall and some windows - people in these rooms could have seen us in bed as it was pushed up against the wall. The 'double deluxe' that my sisters finally got moved to was at the front of the hotel also on the ground floor. Worryingly the window did not shut so they were scared of somebody getting into the room to steal their stuff or harming them whilst they were in bed at night. Their TV didn't work, one of the sockets was broken and the plug in the sink was wedged down so water drained far too slowly causing a backlog. Their room was marginally bigger than ours but still not what I would call a double room. On our last visit to London we stayed at The Tower Hotel, also a 4*, next to Tower Bridge and the room was easily 5-6 times the size of the rooms here and a lot more luxurious. Despite the rooms being only big enough to house The Borrowers they were exceptionally clean and the bathrooms (again, not big enough to swing a cat in) were really clean and modern. The shower was brilliant, really big and powerful and there was free shampoo, conditioner, shower gel etc. Would I stay here again? Probably not, unless I was travelling alone. The rooms were far too small, the staff were extremely rude and none of them were English. Whilst I'm not racist it would be nice to speak to somebody who can actually understand what I am saying, and likewise. The service was not worthy of a 4* and I know I keep banging on about it but the room size was bordering on the ridiculous. I also feel this hotel has some what of a scam going on. There are several hotels obviously in the same chain - all Shaftesbury Premiers. I chose the Paddington one as it seemed nicer than some of the others and was a bit more money - not much but enough to matter. After reading some other reviews it seems many other people have booked this hotel and then, on arrival, been told that it is full and been shipped to their other hotels. When they tried to do this with us we were not offered back the difference in cost and they only relented as I was so adamant about not leaving my sisters alone. I think that even if this hotel is full or certain rooms aren't available, they are still taking bookings then when you arrive they send you to their other hotels, which are slightly cheaper and don't refund the difference. Cynical? Maybe, but we were offered no apologies, no explanation and no refund on the difference if we had moved. The upside of this hotel was that the location is fab, literally round the corner from the tube, and only about 5 stops from Kings Cross, Oxford Street and many of the top attractions. It is also near lots of lovely restaurants and fast food places that cater for all tastes. We ate in an Italian which was gorgeous food and very resonably priced.

I chose this hotel because its close proximity to the Paddington Station which is very convenient for me to travel from and to Heathrow airport. Hence, location wise, it is superb and you simply can't beat it. It's basically one big block away from the station - 3-5 min. walk max. I also got a reasonable price directly from the hotel website, which made the deal look even more appealing. Now about that hotel. The reception area is small but functional. People at the front desk were efficient with the check-in/check-out process though not particularly friendly. I was put in Rm.103 right across the elevator, which is NOT ideal as I kept hearing people in and out of the elevator late at night during my entire stay there.

In addition, a safety box, tea/coffee facilities and internet connectivity is also provided in room which is quite good. Bed and pillow are a bit soft but I did manage to sleep ok. Breakfast was probably the best part of this hotel - both the breakfast area (basement) and breakfast selection (free) was very good. Bathroom is another story. While it was obviously newly refurbished, the toilet was leaking and shower area was very TINY. An average size guy like me could barely move around so shower in the morning proven to be extremely challenging. I can only imagine what a struggle it would be for a big and tall person to use this shower! Yet the bigger problem I had is about the service. The maid service was not adequate that it looked like they only came in to make your bed and changed your towels without cleaning your room or replenishing room supplies like tea/coffee or toilettes. Also the room service was somewhat lacking as well - one night I asked for an extra pillow (BTW, pillow is extremely flat and soft) and after two visits downstairs plus two phone calls, they finally called back 25 minutes later with a response of \"sorry no more pillows\". It makes me wonder what the service would be like during the peak season. Even so, I would still consider this a decent hotel.

After reading the reviews on trip advisor i have to admit i was extremely worried. i didn't know what to expect and thought my entire holiday would be a disaster. We arrived at Paddington and found our way to the hotel, which was less then a 5 minute walk very good if your travelling by tube. My first view of the hotel was very nive, the whole street has identical looking houses, and the hotel is in the middle of all of them. 1 thing i did notice on arriving is that there is no parking, which is slightly strange for a hotel, i do advise that if you do come by car, do not park infront of the hotel as your car can be clamped. When we entered the hotel it was nice, clean. it smelt and looked very nice. We went straight to the reception desk, the gentlemen at the desk came to greet us straight away. He took my name and also told me that i would hav to pay \u00c2\u00a330, but would be put back into my account whitin a few days. he gave us our room key and told us that our room was on the 5th floor. We took the lift to the 5th floor, the lift was slightly small but we managed, even with a few other people and several bags we were ok. Me and my partner had booked a double deluxe room. We entered into our room and the first thing i did notice was the size. it was a small room it didn't really look like a double deluxe room. it did look abit cramped. The toilet and bathroom was very small, only 1 person at a time would be able to enter it. But the cleanliess was exceptional. it was very clean, the room, sheets, floor, bathtub, sink and toilet was very clean. there was a wide screen telivison, table, lamb, air-condition, toilletries, side tables with lamps. there was no mini fridge but there really wasnt any space for it. There was a cuboard which had an ironing board and also a mini safe. for a small room it was brilliant i enjoyed it. The weather wasn't very warm when we went, but our room was extremely warm. the window had safety locks on then so only minimum air would be allowed into the room, but there is an air-con. We had to use it every night. The room service was fast and efficiant. The staff were very helpful, in giving directions and basic questions. I would not recommend having breakfast as it is \u00c2\u00a315 per person. if you don't pre-book, and \u00c2\u00a312 per person if you do pre book, but even for them prices it is every expensive for me.

I was met at the door of the hotel and helped with my case right to the room. Check in was quick and efficient all the staff were friendly and helpful.

Having stayed in Hong Kong and Narita hotels, I thought I have seen the smallest rooms and I was confident I would be fine in Shaftsbury. However, after this trip, I now have a new definition to the term \"small\". I was allocated the double room 405. To be very honest, the room decor is very modern, I am just really amazed by how many things they managed to squeeze into this small room. Their furniture are all customised as they wont be able to find such small sized ones from normal shops. Their closet depth is a mere 30cm. It is really a joke! And this hotel is really the 1st hotel where they do not have toilet roll holder. I really wonder how they are given the status of 4 stars. Well, for 52 pounds a night, I decided it is all not so bad. But to my horror, we were bitten by bed bugs. I woke up and saw a squashed bug. I prayed we were not bitten much. As the day goes by, it got more itchy and I could see all the bites (in group of 3). I'm now super worried that they are in my suitcase and will infect my home. We told the front desk about it and were immediately upgraded to their club room (room 116). They didn't seem at all surprise and it just show that we are not the 1st case. The new room is not the best room as it is right next to the elevator. But at least it is of a decent size, Now it seems more like a 4 star hotel. My advice is NOT to stay in this range of hotels. (unless you are booking their clubrooms) From tripadvisor to booking.com, you will see many negative reviews. Initially, I thought maybe the reviewers were expecting too much. Now I know the hotel is really really bad. Trust me, I'm not a particular person but this is really too much to bear. Please do not stay here.

However , the atrocious service we received from the staff was the worst we have ever experienced. Pipes clanging at 6am and 2am - the second time we demanded to move and they downgraded us to a worse room. We had to drag our bags all over the hotel in the middle of the night until we were given a room with a blocked out window(see photo). Messages for us left at the front desk were not given to us. We told them we needed a taxi on a Saturday night well ahead of time and they said we should just ask when we need one, but when we asked for a taxi and they said it would take half an hour. We found one on the street in 10 seconds. Good pricey breakfast.", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Visalia, California", "Title": "\u201cSmall, but modern\u201d", "Author": "TheSeeker15", "ReviewID": "UR15014401", "Content": "Yes it's true the rooms are tiny, especially based on American standards.

If your traveling on a tight budget the Shaftesbury Premier Hotel London Paddington is a good choice. It's within two clocks of Paddington station and bus stops. Purchase an Oyster card, hop on the train and be anywhere in the city within minutes.

Staff were friendly and efficient, the room was clean and well fitted out - but it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in - from the fire exit card (see photo) I think it must have been the smallest room in the hotel. As it happens, I was only there for (part of) a night so only spent about 7 hours there (and most of those asleep)! If I was there for longer I definitely would not have accepted the room. Breakfast was good and reasonably priced.
