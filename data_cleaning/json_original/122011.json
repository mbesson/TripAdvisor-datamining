They had just arrived in Manhattan. They were some of the survivors of the Titanic tragedy. Atop the building, in that era, was a searchlight. The same searchlight that is mentioned in the accounts of the survivors, as they sailed into the city. Many of those seaman stayed at the hotel, At the time...it was exclusively maritime housing, I believe. Lying in bed, in that little room, as, uninviting as it was...I felt a special kinship with those survivors. If it served their purpose...it served mine, as well. The last time I was there, the photographs had been removed.

Hotel Riverview is one of the few places you can crash for a reasonable price. You won't, however, feel as if you've received a bargain. Let me describe the experience for you. At the check-in desk you'll be treated either rudely or with indifference You'll have to speak up, as your voice has to carry through the bulletproof glass. The staff will be in no hurry to process the paperwork for your stay. Customs at JFK is quicker than this motley crew. Just smile as you are handed a paper-thin towel to shower with. Your \"room\" will be the size of a large closet. If you carry a large frame, be sure to step sideways into the closet, lest you get wedged between the bed and wall. Your closet will come equipped with a t.v. which may or may not provide a reception. You'll pray that it does, if only to drown out the endless incoherent ramblings of your next door neighbor, or should I say neighBOAR. If your television isn't working properly, fear not. Your neighbor's t.v. will be working fine. You'll be able to enjoy whatever he's listening to as the walls are paper thin. Another form of entertainment is only a few yards away, as two of the permanent \"residents\" will be having a heated arguement that may result in blood being spilled. After all this excitement you'll be ready for a good night's rest. Sleep soundly as the bedbugs nip at your body. Crack open your window to combat the sauna-like conditions in your closet. Come morning, it's time to hit the showers. You might have trouble finding one that doesn't have urine, feces, or wet toilet paper on the floor. You'll get plenty of exercise, climbing the stairs to other floors to find a shower that hasn't been violated. Upon leaving the \"Hotel\" Riverview, tears will be streaming down your face. These will be tears of joy, as you just survived one of the most miserable nights of your life and now realize the nightmare is over.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "world", "Title": "\u201cfeces on the bathroom floor, scary local tenant with hideous glares...\u201d", "Author": "travelingrocket", "ReviewID": "UR6099594", "Content": "feces on the bathroom floor, scary local tenant with hideous glares...and thats just the beginning.

I have read a lot of reviews on here where the people freaked out about seeing a hair on the floor or having to wait 30 secs for some hot water and then give the hotel a 1 star rating and went on to rant and rave. That is not my style but I do have to say that this was a horrible, terrible experience. So bad, in fact, I am not even quite sure where to begin. Although I gathered enough... experiences (use the term loosely) here to write a novella, I will list only certain of the more egregious lowlights and affronts to normalcy which I encountered during my oh so long week at the Riverview. One morning I was awakened by a transgendered person of color collapsed but lucid in the stairwell screaming aggressively at the top of her lungs, \"One-a y'all M.F.ers gonna help me up!!? Help!!!?\" She didn't appear drunk, lord only knows what she had ingested to have so inhibited her so that she collapsed. Nobody helped her up, not even I and I am a compassionate soul, and she went on screaming for quite some time. This was a Sunday AM at maybe 9 am. The bathroom was absolutely positively disgusting, BRING SHOWER SHOES and I truly did not feel safe showering here, thank God I found one shower where the door actually locked, it is worth looking around at showers on different floors to find one which locks because otherwise I quite simply would be Euro for a day and skip the shower altogether. The showers were uniformly disgusting and looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years and you'll want to have the shower over with as soon as possible anyway even if you do find a shower which locks. Also, the weather in mid-Feb. in NYC was surprisingly temparate yet they blasted the heat and my \"room\", half the size of a small closet (generously), was so hot that my chap-stick literally melted. This was far and away the least of my worrys here given what else I faced at this establishment. My skin also became dried out from the heat. It was so bad, in fact, that I began to sleep with the windows open but one day I forgot to close them and ran back to the hotel terrified that somebody had broken into my room through the screen beacuse most of the other \"guests\" here are homeless or transient and not tourists. If you are a normal person and not homeless or borderline homeless you will REALLY stick out and I am not a flashy dresser, in fact, in most places I wouldn't even stick out of a crowd at all. I felt so unsafe here that if somebody were hanging out in the hallway I walked past my room and waited for them to leave because I didn't want anybody knowing which room was mine. Looking back, I think this was a smart move and not overly paranoid at all. Also, the walls are paper thin and you can hear it if one person has their TV on 5 rooms up as if it is in your own room. I slept only with the benefit of earplugs. I later learned from a friend that on the weekends many people come here to rent a room to be intimate with a new friend or escort. Of course you can hear this as well. I don't think I would have gotten any sleep or survived the week without opening the window whenever I was in the room, earplugs and shower shoes, it would have just been too much. Also, it is an exaggeration to call this a room, it is more like the size of half of a closet. Unlike other reviewers I did not get bug bites from the sheets but I am not surprised to read that that occured here. It is a small miracle I was not harmed in any way and lost no property here. This was a scary, scary, scary place and undeserving of a one-star rating. There are no ratings for this hotel! Do yourself a favor for your health and security, beg a college friend to crash on their couch or look for a sublet or something on craigslist maybe. I cannot recommend this place for any reason under any circumstances. Abominable. Repellent.
