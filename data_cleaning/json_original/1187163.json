For the price you pay you get a clean room, which is really small but this is an issue fro almost all HK hotels. Bathroom was really clean and included a hi/tech shower with radio and steamer. In the time we were staying the hotel was just undergoing some reconstruction work, which made the entrance a little bit harder to find, but as we didn't spend much time inside it didn't bother us at all. Wifi is working only in the reception floor. Receptionist was very helpful on the day of our departure, he did store our luggage in the reception area for he whole day and gave us the right directions for the bus as well. If you are coming form the HK airport and want to save some dollars, you can use a public bus E21 going from right in front of the airport. It takes around 50 min to the Tai kok Tsui and cost HK$14. There is a space where to put your luggage and from the top deck you can enjoy the ride with a spectacular view. Get off the bus the one before last station.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cnot bad!! if not for noisy doors slamming and construction noise\u201d", "Author": "yandao87", "ReviewID": "UR131138000", "Content": "5 mins walk to olympian city mtr about 200 metres.. that line not very useful unless u don't mind transit. walk to mongkok is 11 minutes, i walk everyday, so i find it alright. especially weather is about 25degs. taxi to mongkok is always 20hkd, < 25hkd. to mongkok east mtr is 30hkd. toilet doors and rooms doors shutting is a big concern if u wake after 10 am, i am constatnly awoken during that timings, as neighbours take lifts, visit the toilets so frequently, the previous stay at sham shui po bridal tea house was much better", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cTolerable\u201d", "Author": "talonglang", "ReviewID": "UR129892845", "Content": "What you pay for is what you get. We arrived in HK at around 2 a.m. and we needed a cheap and accessible place to spend the remainder of the night while we wait for the check in at another (better) hotel at 12 noon. I chose this place because it was the closest to Cosmo Hotel Mongkok. To enter the hotel, you have to go through a restaurant with white French windows and doors. After the counter/bar of the restaurant, there\u2019s a manager\u2019s room. I don\u2019t know if that was the reception already. Anyway, the receptionist confirmed our room booking and then gave us the room keys, remote control, adaptor and aircon remote control. When we got to the room, it was really small compared to other accommodations. From the reviews I read here, I was expecting a very clean and cozy room. I must admit I was a bit disappointed. Though the bed and bathroom seem clean, the white walls have become dirty because of luggage scratches or marks or dirty fingerprints. The room was just really enough for a double bed and a 1 \u00bd aisle for the chair. The bathroom was clean but again, very tiny. You cannot even stretch your hand sideways when you\u2019re showering. The sink and toilet bowl are also closely placed to each other. I liked the hardness of the bed and the pillows were just fine. The comforter seemed clean too. Though the bathroom had a funky smell at first (maybe due to the small space and lack of ventilation), it was pretty decent because the sink and bowl were white so it seemed clean. The water pressure and temperature were also redeeming factors for this place. The aircon provided good temperature and there was also a tv which we weren\u2019t able to use because the remote control is broken. All in all, if you are just looking for a place to sleep in and on a tight budget, Bridal Tea House is okay. But if you are a bit big like for Westerners, I think you will have a hard time moving in here because the place is really small.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cSmall cozy room and economic!\u201d", "Author": "Jacklynsze", "ReviewID": "UR120935145", "Content": "This hotel is quite near to the Olympic mtr with 10 - 15 mins walking distance. The hotel is surrounded by all the workshop where the walkway is slightly greasy. But overall still bearable. The hotel room is small but clean and cozy. It is equipped with basic neccessities such as hair dryer, refrigerator and TV. Toiletries and towel are provided too. We booked a standard twin room, and was being upgrade to family room which can accommodate 3 person. Even though the room have one double bed and one single bed, but the double bed is at the size of a super single bed. The single bed is really small! One thing i don't like about the hotel is that they have really bad sound proof! Every night we can hear people talking loud, bang the room doors and the sound where people moving chairs. It is really irritating! Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful. The huge Olympian mall is just 10 mins away from the hotel with walking distance, where the mall is just beside the Olympic Mtr station. The mall have 3 phases which can actually link to Mongkok too. Overall, the hotel is quite good, I Will come back again.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay again\u201d", "Author": "paulhb", "ReviewID": "UR74260094", "Content": "The hotel is in an area of Hong Kong that I would say \"had character\". It is in what I would expect the stereotypical Hong Kong street to be prior to the tourist age. The staff, although unable to speak anything but the barest English, were very friendly and helpful. When necessary, they would get the boss on the phone to translate. We arrived in Hong Kong early in the morning, and they allowed us to drop our bags and took good care of them whilst we were out for the day. The rooms (we had two) were both very comfortable and homely. Price was great, and the hotel is only ten minutes' walk from Olympic station. When arriving, don't be put off by the street - entry is through the restaurant on the ground floor.
