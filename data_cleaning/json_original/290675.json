When I made a few phone calls inquiring about rooms and eventually making a reservation, the staff was helpful, but I couldn't get all the information from just one person. I believe I have it figured out now though: they have two different kinds of rooms: hotel and motel. We stayed in the motel rooms (door opens to the parking lot), and they were pretty dingy. They say the hotel rooms are more spacious. Our rooms were good enough to stay in for a couple nights, but there were visible cobwebs all over the ceilings, and in general it felt very unkempt. Some people have commented on the area of town being \"scary.\" I don't think it was such a bad part of town, but if you come from a fairly homogeneous, upper/middle class neighborhood, this area of town might make you a little uncomfortable. Just remember, diversity doesn't mean dangerous. It certainly isn't located in a glamorous part of Chicago though. But the price is just right for where you're staying; anywhere else is going to cost you many times more. A great advantage is that the train is located just two blocks away. One last thing they could improve would be the knowledge of the staff. I asked about recommendations for restaurants, for example, and no one had an answer except for their own restaurant on the premises. It wasn't very helpful from a tourist's perspective. Final verdict: stay here (try the hotel room) if you care more about the economical value of it and don't mind not having a fancy place to sleep, but be prepared that the location is not like the nicest parts of Chicago.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edwardsville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cMore than what meets the eyes\u201d", "Author": "Jharlin", "ReviewID": "UR115617049", "Content": "At first I was skeptical!

The room wreaked the smell of \"BM\" and other things. When we reported it, they stated they had not cleaned that room, the manager was getting that carpet cleaned from some party that was held there where alcohol and vomit had soaked until the carpet. We were then given another room that was on the 3rd floor in the opposite direction. The attendant informed us the only access to the room was from the elevator. The elevator went to the 3rd floor but the doors wouldn't open there. The next room they took us to was still dirty. They informed us that it will take 25 minutes to clean and advised us to seat at the restaurant down stairs. The restaurant was not the greatest but it was okay. There was no seasoning on the food, but then again we leave in the south and that's how we do it. When the attendant told us the room was ready he informed us there will be an additional charge of 24.00 because there was a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. We spoke with the clerk and the manager of whom both had a nasty attitude because we had concerns of the additional price. It was a short notice trip so the 128.00 over priced room was accepted (and this was supposed to be a discounted rate). It took 3 hours and 2 phone calls to get extra towels. It took another 2 calls for them to fix the TV. The bathroom had not been swept nor mopped. Granted the room was very spacious.
