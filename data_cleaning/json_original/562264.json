At 2 in the morning what can I do? I don't believe they had only one expensive room left OR that they couldn't transfer the booking, they were just profiteering. I checked out next morning and friend who has house in Dubai, negotiated an upgrade for the original mis-booked room, when I got back later, I was back in the same room with the same bed line (ie not changed).

And what a disappointment. After looking forward to staying at this design 4 star hotel for some time, we were not happy to find that it was not really a 4 star hotel at all! The room was old and dated, bathroom was mouldy, tiles cracked, and generally looked tired and worn down. The only positive was that the bed was proper kingsize and VERY comfortable. We were also disappointed to find there was no pool. Ok, maybe we should have investigated further what \"pool access\" meant. But we thought it meant onsite pool, not a 20 min busride (provided by the hotel I might add) to the public park where you had to pay to get in... Also the hotel boasts of having two restaurants and a cafe open 24 hours a day. Well, the italian restaurant wasn't open through the whole time we were there (nearly a week), and the other restaurant didn't want to serve us anything from the menu. Only buffet or nothing!! On the positive side, the staff was very friendly, and helpful, although it appeared there was a lack of local knowledge. And of course the price for the hotel was decent, however, do not think you are getting a good deal, as we would class the hotel a 3 star at best...", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDo not look any further, this is the hotel for you\u201d", "Author": "Hadi000", "ReviewID": "UR116735525", "Content": "stayed for 2 days. excellent staff who are very freindly and flexible.

I did initially have trouble finding the hotel though - the public transport directions that Google Maps had given me were wrong, and I spent 2hrs walking around in 37 degree heat (with a 20kg backpack) trying to find the place, and no-one I spoke to had heard of the place. So I would recommend people going here to catch the Metro train to the Union stop, and then catch a taxi to Naif Rd where the hotel is opposite the second mosque along - don't try and walk there like I did! Compared to Western standards, I would think that the hotel is 2/3star, rather than the advertised 4 star - no frills, but like I said, it was perfectly adequate for people who would rather spend their money on exploring rather than just on where they are sleeping. I stayed there as a solo female traveller, yet I would urge caution to anyone who is thinking of doing similarly. Whilst the hotel was fine, the area is not the best for single women, even if they are covered up. I originally tried walking to through the streets to the nearby Gold Souk (30mins walk away), however this was definitely not a good idea, and I quickly concluded that taking a taxi to and from attractions was a far better plan! This being said, the hotel was fine, but for girls staying by themselves, please do be prepared to taxi to and from places - it's not too expensive, and it is always better to be safe than sorry!!", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI never been to this hotel\u201d", "Author": "srekanth", "ReviewID": "UR97285957", "Content": "I booked this hotel and because of other reasons I had to cancel it.

Tell me, how many fish kebabs to you get in a mixed grill. My son had a reaction which could of killed him and we asked for the ambulance service, due to the location of the hotel it took half an hour for the ambulance to come. Be aware that hospitals in Dubai are hopeless and the docters don't have a clue what to do in a life and death situation. Thank God he survived as I had never saw him in this state ever. After the long night, my family and I went to have breakfast, the staff are really nice however the food was not edible and they didn't have many options of food. They gave the same breakfast everyday and i stayed their for a fortnight. Then you get the taxi problem. No taxi goes past the hotel so you have to get the concierge to order one for you. The taxi service they get charges nearly double than the other public taxis. When you mention that you want to go to the Coral oriental hotel they do not have a clue where that is and I have resulted to giving directions to the hotel 12 times! To stop the taxi problem i decided to rent a car from the hotel desk office. The man at the desk seemed trustworthy and probably wouldn't cause any more problems. I asked him if the cars were all insured and he said yes. After three days in driving in the dangrous roads of Dheirah i had been crashed. let me warn you that accidents occur all the time in Dubai and is probaly tone of the worst places to drive. When i told the man at the desk that i had crashed he told me that the car actually was not insured. I had to pay a hefty bill, i couldn't do anything about it but the manager of the tourist operater in the hotel said that the man at the desk will be paying a quarter of the fine. That sounds better but they still charged me a hefty bill.
