If you get a king room it includes a refrigerator and microwave. Free wi-fi, good speed,flat screen TV but no HDMI input so I couldn't connect my laptop to stream movies from Netflix. Bed was fairly firm and comfortable, room was quiet in regards to traffic or outside noise other than your neighbors; we had people in the rooms on either side of us and never heard anything through the walls either. Room phone was out as well as Showtime during our 5 day stay despite the fact that maintenance told us that they had reported it to the phone and cable companies. Nicely landscaped grounds with scattered shaded seating areas, nice pool area. Breakfast was cheese omelet, turkey sausage, Belgian waffle, pastries, cereal, yogurt, some fruit, drinks, coffee from 6:30-9:00 weekdays, 7-10 weekends. Adding some salsa or hot sauce would be nice. Area is not the best but plenty safe to walk around during the day. Emerald has a restaurant across the street, a 24 hr bar/grill on the next corner, a few other restaurants within two blocks, an Office Depot on the next block and streetcar stops on the block. Streetcar line has undergoing repairs while we were there but the City added bus routes to take its place. Staff was very friendly and helpful although I wouldn't ask for restaurants recommendations; as a former resident and frequent visitor to New Orleans what I overheard as suggestions weren't where I would go, stick to nomenu.com for eateriies. Although the area isn't the best part of St. Charles Ave. the security was very good. They have a 24 hr guard, large metal gates that they close a night to turn the area into a secured compound and their parking lot next to the hotel (self park, $17 plus tax per nite) is also well fenced and closed and monitored at night. Should you need your car at night security will let you in to get it. Our party had to leave early due to Hurricane Isaac headed for New Orleans; management was very understanding and waived their cancellation rule. We all enjoyed our stay there and hated to leave early, especially since we had a fantastic rate and were facing several days of power outages across the lake.

But once the sun went down, it was like a prison lockdown - the lobby doors were locked, the side gates were locked and a security guard was on patrol. We had an early flight out in the morning and I had to wake the security guard up to let us out (he was asleep in a chair by the pool).

We loved this hotel! The hotel is on Saint Charles St., with a street car stop right out front, is very convenient. The Magazine St. area was not too far away for a walk or a quick bike ride. A great pub over there is The Bulldog Pub, a must visit for beer enthusiasts! The accomodations were very clean and comfortable, the expansive grounds secure. Our room was done in a festive motif a little reminisint of Mardi Gras, but not gaudy (see picture with purple wall). You knew you were in New Orleans! Originally they gave us a room across from the elevator. However, we asked to me moved to an end room. Our room was instead across from stairs and a balcony overlooking the pool, much better and quiet! The hotel is five, old original buildings covering an entire city block. All buildings and rooms were preserved and renovated into a very quiet, quaint and charming hotel. They offer a full complimentary breakfast which is certainly good enough to get you started for your day in NOLA! Hot and cold offerings, fresh fruits, juices, cereals hot and cold, yogurts, bagels, waffles, pastries, scrambled or hard boiled eggs, sausage and some pretty good coffee. All served in a very spacious multi-room breakfast building adjacent to the pool with indoor and outdoor seating. There is a pool and a hot tub tht never seemed to be too crowded. So during our down time, it was easy to relax and enjoy this ammenity on Tuesday. It too was well kept and clean. I saw the pool guys out taking care of it each morning. The staff were friendly and accomodating and the price was right. There was a very large parking lot next door which they charge $17 a night. Very good for us as we left our car parked for the 3 nights and used our bicycles to get around. Having been to New Orleans more times than I can count, never for business and always for pleasure, I can say to you that we will keep this one high on the list of places to stay If you haven't been to NOLA or only a few times, there are so many other great areas of this city worth exploring besides the Quarter, so its really not hard to broaden your enjoyment. Magazine St., the Garden District, Frenchmen St. are new favorites on our must-visit list while in town. The Maison St. Charles sits in a location that makes doing that even easier. We did bring our bicycles to explore the Garden District, ride into the French Quarter and to get back and forth. This worked out great as we left the car in the hotel parking lot and biked our way around. The hotel is about a mile off Canal St. and was certainly easy to get over to via bike. There are so many bikers in the city that we felt comfortable with the traffic. The city has bike lanes almost everywhere for ease of use. Even at night, we stayed on the main thoroughfare and made it safely back to the hotel quite quickly. It is also nice that this hotel is in the Choice Hotels system, so we received points for staying here, plus they allow small dogs.

Hotel room was filthy, including mold growing in the shower and clearly was barely cleaned by the housekeeping staff. Housekeeping staff was very friendly, just not very thorough. This alone would have prompted a 2-3 star rating; however, the front desk attendants were extremely rude. One morning we hurried out of room to get out of the cleaning staff's way and thought we would just use the restroom in the lobby (which is a hike from the room we were in) on our way out of the hotel. We were rudely told that hotel guests were not allowed to use the hotel lobby restroom as it was reserved for non-guests that paid $10 for a wrist band to use the restroom. We were paying over $1000 to stay at this hotel for 4 nights and they refused to let us use the bathroom (with a newly potty trained child). We were told that by the time we got back to our room housekeeping would likely be done. Additionally our room rate was advertised to include breakfast in the morning. When we went to the lobby area for breakfast we were laughed at and told that breakfast isn't served during Mardi Gras. Icing on the cake was when we tried to leave the hotel, our car had been blocked in by 2 other cars of hotel employees. I understand that is was Mardi Gras weekend, but this was several hours after the parades had passed, and they took about an hour to locate the 2 employees to move their cars. Good thing we didn't have a flight to catch! We live only 45 miles away, but always stay in a hotel for Mardi Gras. We reserved our rooms too late and this was the only hotel on St. Charles with any availability...I understand why now.

Wrong. Someone was shot right next door at the Wendy's during Mardi Gras weekend...of course that is out of the hotel's control.

It had all the features you'd expect from a normal mid-range chain hotel, and a kind of wacky decor with lots of purple. Staying midweek in March, my rate (AAA I think) was $98.

Finally my husband said, \"How are you doing?\", the man said \"Busy!\", in an angry tone and looked down. My husband tried to make small talk to lighten him up to no avail. He was very abrupt, made no eye contact and made us to feel like we were unwelcomed. we basically had to make our own introductions to get our check in process started. His whole demeanor was strange and the interaction awkward. Finally we were asked for our credit card after being surprised by the $17 per day parking fee which was supposed to be free for AAA which wasn't accepted. My husband gave the clerk his card. Almost with glee the clerk announced \"Your card was declined!\" my husband said this couldn't be. He then said very confrontationaly, \"Computers don't lie!\". My husband said yes computers do lie. We have more than enough available in our account. The clerk made some other demeaning remark. My husband is pretty aggravated at this point and said well yours is wrong! Mr. Phillips snatched up his monitor and shoved it in my husbands face!!! The whole thing seemed crazy like we were on Candid Camera or something. If we were not exhausted we would've walked right out the door! I read on the screen where it did not say the card was declined. It said an over ride was needed. I even said this to the clerk. He insisted we did not have enough money in our account to pay for the room! My husband decides to call our Bank while waiting on the line for several minutes it is finally found out from our bank that they had no record of the card ever being swiped by Maison St. Charles! My husband handed the card back, he swiped it and voilla it went through!! No apology was ever offered by the clerk! As a matter of fact he never uttered another word to us in the lobby. The clerk just handed us a key and a map. That's it. No good evening, nothing. So we just head out the door to roam around in the rain to find our room. We make it to the end of the courtyard and the clerk comes out and yells, \"Hey!!\". We turn around and he has a slip and a pen and he says \"You didn't sign this!\". My husband says well you didn't speak or say anything to us so we left. My husband looks at the receipt and now we are being charged $300 per night base plus taxes and parking!!! He said that wasn't the rate we booked he made a note we do not agree with the rate and signed the slip on the side of the wall. It is pouring rain, very little lighting and it's hard to find where the buildings are. We finally get to our room and get to our door of room 304 and the door will not open. We have to go find maintenance who had a trick! You have to pull up on the lever instead of down and use your shoulder to bust it open. He blamed humidity. And our entire 5 day stay this is what we did to get our door open. The room smelled damp and musty and at times had a odor that came from somewhere smelling of raw sewage. I bought Febreeze spray and sprayed constantly, ran the air, etc. temporary fix when the smells became unbearable. The decorator I could see tried to make this shabby place chic. The decorator is to be commended because they used tricks of the trade, paints, fabrics, etc. to draw your eye away from the poor construction of the place. The place has a lot of potential and could be quite nice if some real construction work were possible. The courtyards are nice with fountains and wrought iron patio sets but could use some more flowers. The lobby was done in a New Orleans funky shabby chic style which I appreciate. They even painted some interesting murals on the exterior walls. The sheets, bedding and towels seemed clean. The walls and carpet were filthy. You will note my pictures of unknown brown stains on the walls and human hairs stuck on the bathroom walls that werent ours. We even had a gigantic roach that was trapped in our bathroom tub. I called the front desk to ask for spray. I waited forever. Finally my husband came back killed it and flushed it. The maintenance man that day did finally show up and said I must've left the door open. Well the next morning we had a smaller roach in the bathroom. On our bank called on Sunday and left a message they were shutting off our account due to suspicious activity. We were panicked while on a tour and had to take time out if our paid tour to call the bank back. Our bank proceeded to tell us someone at Maison St. Charles had tried to charge our card for large amounts several times, 5 in total for varying amounts. They blocked all but the agreed upon charge. Our water went out on Monday mid morning and we were told at front desk it would be on in 10 minutes no apology. My husband waited over an hour. I called the front desk and the young lady said be patient another 20 minutes. My husband needed to shower so we could leave for a timed event and went down and asked the plumber himself and the plumber turned the water on for him but it lasted 5 minutes with cold water shower then the water went off, he just gave up and dried off. Again no apology from staff at all. The maid knocked constantly on our door every morning especially one day when my husband had to work in the room. I told her don't worry just give us towels. She seemed aggravated we wouldn't leave! It was around noon. Next door is a Tapas Restaurant called Santa Fe. I enjoyed their specialty drink The Bill Cosby and the company of the owner and many party loving locals. The crowd gets a little wild at night but hey It's New Orleans! The trolley was always too full to use. But cabs were easy to find. The garden district is nice in the day and a little sketchy at night but using common sense you will be safe. There were some pretty good restaurants on St. Charles and if you like Antiques and vintage finds there's a market across the street. This hotel could be charming if it was staffed by a team of friendly, customer service oriented people, mistakes and problems could be overlooked by guests if at least given an apology. We are very amiable and friendly non demanding people, we are not looking for problems.We felt unwelcomed and like we were a nuisance. We certainly did not get what we paid for. This hotel isn't worth $100 per night, much less $300! We've been to New Orleans no less than 20 times.

For my first trip back to New Orleans in several years, I decided to go back to Maison St. Charles. We have stayed there several times over the years and have always had a good experience. The Inn complex is a series of neat old buildings that are well-maintained. We have stayed in other places in NO including some nice places in the French Quarter and prefer Maison St. Charles. It has the charm of some of the neat places in the Quarter without the nastiness or late night noise that often comes with being in the Quarter. The lovely brick courtyard with its fountain and nice wrought iron tables and chairs lured us away from dining at Emeril's Delmonico's, which is about a block (very walkable) away from the Inn. Instead we picked up a nice bottle of port, some phenomenal cheese, almonds and artisan bread from Martin's Wine Cellar and spent a few evening hours in the courtyard chatting. It was very relaxing. There was a rather large gathering at the nearby Daiquiri place but the noise and traffic did not reach us in the courtyard. Our spacious room was well-laid out and clean. The bed was comfortable and the flat screen TV's reception was clear. Located on the street car line not too far away from Lee Circle, the Inn is well-situated for tourists or business travelers. Its proximity to Downtown translates to a quick and easy commute. The World War II Museum is not far away and is a walkable distance. If going to Audubon Park or Zoo, Uptown or to the University Area(Loyola/Tulane), hop on the street car heading the other way. It beats the heck out of driving. The front desk staff has always been very friendly and solicitous. The Continental breakfast was a bit sparse in that the replinishment of the limited items was rather slow and not too happily done (the only employee here I have ever not seen smiling and solicitous).", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay & unwind from a day and nights of touring and partying!\u201d", "Author": "orlandobop54", "ReviewID": "UR127352885", "Content": "This was a very nice hotel and perfect for us.

The room had a fridge. When we opened it to put some water inside, we discovered a gross smell which turned out to be a ziplock bag filled with meat that was crammed in the freezer. Gross. Breakfast is included. The usual continental breakfast type fare. You can eat in the patio area. There's a small pool, but we didn't use it. The lobby staff was not helpful and gave us wrong information regarding events and transportation. For example, they told us they'd arrange a cab for a 3:30 a.m. ride to the airport. They didn't and instead we were standing in the street, hailing a cab in the middle of the night with our luggage and four-year-old daughter. Stressful and scary!

Although it IS winter, and this is a warm weather destination, most Snowbirds tend to visit at Halloween, before and during Christmas, or in the couple of weeks leading up to Mardi Gras. This is important because the rigid rates at the Maison St Charles do not really reflect this slow period. Other reviewers seem pleased with the rates they received, but I wonder if they understand that many fine rooms in the Fr Qtr were going for $89-$99/night at the same time they were paying $109-$129/night here. I myself stayed at the Place D'Armes, right next to Jackson Square, the week before moving here, and my bill averaged $99/night there. Which brings us to the matter of the location. Maison St Charles is always being praised for its terrific location because it is halfway between the French Qtr and the Garden District. While that may be geographically true, any seasoned traveler knows that halfway between 2 highly desirable locations, can often leave you in \"No Man's Land\". While that is not exactly the case here, it is pretty close. First, the Streetcar issue: Yes, the St Charles Ave line does stop right outside the door. Problem is, this close to town, it is almost always packed with other riders by the time it makes it in this far (Erato St by the overpass). We literally NEVER took the streetcar INBOUND from here; always gave up and walked the 25 mins into town. Given the rich foods we were eating, and the fact that we are healthy and good walkers to begin with, this was not a huge issue, but I think it really could present a problem to older or more sedentary visitors. Next, the Neighborhood: In the immediate area are Lee Circle, the WWII, Civil War and Ogden Museums; also, Emeril's DelMonico and a couple of ordinary restaurants in the proximate 2 blocks of St Charles. Then there is that \"Daquiri Bar\" on the corner, which is seedy looking and literally has people lying on the ground in front of it. (This did not happen once, but every single day we were there.) The Wendy's next door and the Popeye's and KFC on the next blocks could be convenient, I suppose, if you had children with you, but otherwise they just function as hangouts for the area kids who slow down service by gabbing with their friends behind the counter. Finally, Safety: There is onsite Security, but the iron gates on both sides of the driveway are left open all day and only closed at night. This allows free access to the Hotel property all day long through the Wendy's driveway. Twice I witnessed two young men who walked in this way early in the morning, went directly to the breakfast room, loaded up plates, and left together, via the other side of the driveway. Maybe they were guests who like to walk and eat at the same time?? Since we hiked into town so many times, we tried several different routes and found that, within a few blocks, are a public housing building (St Charles at Lee Circle) and a homeless men's shelter (Camp St by St Patrick's Church). All in all, I would rate the location as pretty dicey, especially for women. Now for the Hotel itself: The Lobby is smallish, but attractive with shabby chic furniture and tile floors. There is a single computer here which had an \"Out of Order\" sign on it for several days of our stay. We were in a nicely decorated, good-sized, ground floor Double Queen room which was a little musty when we first arrived. I got a bottle of Febreeze, cranked up the Air Conditioner, and left the door open for about half an hour. Problem solved. To be honest, this is a common problem in New Orleans, so again no biggie for us, but if you have serious allergies, best beware. . . Also, the tub/shower area was just disgusting, with brown stained acoustic ceiling panels, peeling wall paper, and a plastic mat glued to the bottom of the tub in an attempt to cover still obvious stains below. Again, I got disinfectant at the CVS downtown and scrubbed like crazy before I set a toenail in there. Complete overhaul of the bath is needed. There was a crack in the vanity near the floor which I plugged up with paper after killing a roach (just one; it's New Orleans) on the sink. One of the headboards was in really bad shape and should be replaced ('nuff said about that). One of the lamps was non-functional for the entire period we were there. The Internet is free, and worked fairly well, but was completely inacessible one whole night and part of the next morning. The in-room safe was too small for a full-size laptop. The hairdryer had low power and should be replaced. The in-room coffeemaker looked as if it had never been cleaned, so again, I did it myself. Cable offers poor selection and erratic signal sometimes goes out completely. I know most people don't come to New Orlean to watch TV, but we were in town for an extended stay and after a while you just miss Mr Ed! (Get METV.) The outside is very pretty, although that inside courtyard is a little weird-- seems like a wasted space to me. People smoke throughout the grounds, which are fairly noisy, and one night we even had to open the door to protest prolonged pounding next door where another guest had bolted the door on his roomie (I know this was not the Hotel's fault, but where was Security?). Jazz is played outside, which gives the space a nice vibe during the day and evening, but it is a little loud early in the morning and late at night. The Laundry facility was very helpful and Breakfast was fine with hot and cold options; only suggestion is to add herbal teabags. The Staff was distant and seemed to spend a good deal of time talking to each other, rather than exuding the customary New Orleans warmth towards its guests. As mentioned above, we moved here after a week in the French Qtr, thinking a week of the downtown maddness would be enough, and we would welcome both a little quiet, and an opportunity to explore the Garden District, Mid-City, and Audobon Park areas more thoroughly. We did all of that, and I have to admit that we were reasonably comfortable at the Maison St Charles, but I doubt if we will return. We were there for a faily long stay (2 wks) and no one ever asked if the room was okay, or if we needed anything. Really, what you are getting here are mediocre accommodations and practically no hospitality. They just don't seem to care whether you are there or not.

Luckily, as soon as we told her we infact had two rooms booked she sorted it out quickly and put us in a room next to our friends. We stayed in rooms 334 & 335, which were at the back of the hotel complex in the corner, but still had a view of the pool if you stood in the hallway. The rooms were just what we needed, an excellent size, with a lovely sink area and clean bathroom with massage shower head! To my suprise the room had all the facilities we could have needed, including a coffee maker, a microwave, fridge, hairdryer, and ironing board and iron, very useful, and all of which was very clean also. The bed was comfortable and linen was clean, the room itself was also to a very high standard, we slept very well in the 2 nights we stayed here. The breakfast was also very good, included hot coffee & tea, bagels with cream cheese, and toast with choices of jams, also hot food served such as sausages, eggs, and waffles. We opted for cereal, bagels and yoghurts, which were all of a good quality and set us up well for the days of exploring the city. One afternoon we returned to the hotel early and made use of the pool and jacuzzi. The pool wasn't the cleanest it could have been, with some leaves etc in the bottom, the jacuzzi also had some debris at the bottom of it, but we didnt really mind, but perhaps could have been monitored more. The Jacuzzi was always on, and the area in itself was quiet too so it was a nice extra to our stay; we even took some of our own drinks and snacks down to the poolside tables in the evening and sat there drinking before we went out, which didnt seem to be a problem. Parking was fine, an additional $17 per day, which was quite a lot, but it was convenient as only a 1 minute walk to the side gate of the hotel. Location is good, if you want it there is a Wendy's right next door, and various other shops and restaurants along the street. The best part of the Inn's location is the streetcar stop which is literally across the road, one way taking you towards the rest of the Garden district, Zoo, and University, the other direction taking you to the CBD and French Quater, which is about 15 mins by streetcar, but also walkable if you have time.

The beds were very comfortable. Housekeeping was very good with the exception of one day they only exchanged towels due to the tropical storm, but that was no big deal. The hotel complex itself is very unique. I loved the older buildings on the property and seeing the photos in the breakfast area. There is a nice patio area we were unable to enjoy due to the rain, but it would be a great space in more enjoyable weather. The complimentary breakfast was on the better side, especially during the weekend. The breakfast area itself is in one of the older buildings and is full of character. We were okay with the location. I can see how one might find it beneficial to be more in the French Quarter area but we also went to the Garden District and a few other area and found it to be centrally located. There are several good restaurants and a nice tavern as well as a Walgreen's in a five-block area. The street car runs right in front of the hotel, but we really could never figure out the schedule, nor was there a covered waiting area, so it didn't work out too well for us in the pouring rain. It quit running early in our trip anyway due to the storm. We took cabs or walked mostly. Just a few cons I feel I should mention: The hotel has older doors in the lobby and I found it awkward to try to get in and out of them with luggage. I know they're probably not trying to alter the historic aspects of the building, but maybe something could be done to make it a little easier to get in and out. Our door to our room was also very tight and required us to \"put a shoulder into it\" to open every time.

That said, I find it hard to believe every room at this hotel was booked on a Thursday night, leading to my Friday night reservation. It was a standard answer and procedure, which I understand, but have stayed in other New Orleans hotels which allowed me in early, so I'll keep that in mind for future visiting. The hotel is laid out very interestingly. You walk in from St. Charles into the lobby. On each side of the lobby there is a circle driveway that leads to the parking lot. It's kind of hard to explain, but imagine a horseshoe with the lobby in the middle and behind the circle you have the rooms. There's one or two historic looking houses/buildings converted into rooms, then more of a traditional hotel behind that. We were in the converted older style building. Our room, unsurprisingly, was very small (located on the second floor in the corner). I expect rooms in New Orleans and other cities to be small so it wasn't a huge deal. I did, however, look in the windows of some other rooms (in the same building) and they were quite large(r). I probably got shafted because I booked through Orbitz and got a super (low) rate....just a guess... The carpeting in the room looked to be fairly new and the bedding was comfortable and clean. (Just an FYI, they do charge a deposit to your credit card for damages based on your length of stay.) Hopefully I won't get dinged for the bathroom door that was hanging off the hinges (you had to pick up the door and push in the hinge to get it to close.) The shower was clean enough but there was some sort of a black discoloration above the shower (guessing some sort of mold.) One of the main issues we had with our room was that there was NO cold water...zero. Imagine being in New Orleans in August...cold water would come in handy. Turn the cold side of the sink...all warm...turn the shower...lukewarm. Terrible. The AC did work fairly well though, would be hard not to be able to cool such a small room. The front desk staff was okay, not very outgoing or helpful. I didn't try the pool, but I heard some other guests talking about how it was out of order. There was also breakfast served daily but I didn't get to check that out. One final drawback is the location. It's a great location for catching the street car (just across the street) and a 5-7 minute ride to the Quarter but its around several fast food restaurants which leads to some less than spectacular interactions. I'm not going to return to this hotel. Just not worth the risk when there are comparable hotels at very comparable rates in the city. If you get a super rate and are in town for a short stay you'll be fine.

However, the housekeeping service was only average because the beds were made and the bathroom cleaned but there was no vacuming in the 4 nights we stayed; we asked 4 times for a top sheet for the sofa bed and never received one but got extra towels instead and the refrig was not defrosted so it leaked. Check-in was slow because there was only one person on staff (who kept her cool in spite of being overwhelmed). The WIFI didn't work immediately and was spotty at times. Finally, there was no check-out option on the TV which often had poor reception and the channel guide card on the table was inaccurate-channels didn't match the card! Most of these drawbacks were already mentioned in previous TripAdvisor reviews so believe what you read here. If you are looking for a no frills place to stay with low prices and average services the MSC will be fine for you.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Monroe, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good rate, good stay.\u201d", "Author": "thekeithmeister", "ReviewID": "UR70543782", "Content": "Clean and comfortable rooms, New Orleans style architecture feels authentic.

I had no problems getting a car in the morning, but a return in the evening at 5:30 pm was quite difficult. I had to wait for about 45 minutes. The hotel itself appears to be a series of multiple building, which appear to be fairly new, and an older building in the center. I stayed in the older building on the 3rd floor. I'm assuming this was because of the discounted rate, but it might have been a coincindence. The room reminded me of European B&B's - Quite elegant with a King size bed, chandelier, small bathroom, and large flatscreen TV, and Queen Anne chair. The ceiling was sloped (since I was on the top floor) and there were 2 small picture windows. The Air conditioning worked very well, which is important in New Orleans. The room was very quiet On the down side, the room was starting to show its age - The white paint on the doorways could use a good cleaning. The stairway leading to the room also showed its age in the form of steps that weren't level - typical of older houses. The continental breakfast in the morning was much better than I anticipated. In addition to the standard cereal, fruit & breaks, they has sausage links and 2 types of pre-cooked eggs. The parking was also adequate. There were about 8 spots \"on-site\", and an additional 30-40 spots across the street in a private lot.

The Quality Inn Maison St. Charles did not disappoint. We arrived early the morning of our check in, around 4am. We called ahead to make sure that it was ok to check in and the girl was very nice, informing us that they did have a room available but it would be another days charge, which I expected.

The balconies, ice machines, and elevators weren't as clean as I would have liked though. The rooms were nice, but could use a little remodeling. There was a weird bath mat in our shower, which seemed to have been glued to the bottom of the tub. It was old and worn out. The menus in the directory were a little out of date as well. We didn't get housekeeping while we stayed, but they did get us extra towels and took our trash out that we left on the porch, which was great. This was our first time to New Orleans.

In-room coffee is delicious and the continental breakfast is appealing and served in the comfortable pool house. Parking is on-site which is a real convenience as you can get to your vehicle any time you want.

I don't plan to stay here again. The most disappointing part of the visit was the lack of compassion by the hotel's night manager. Because of highway construction, rain, and flood, our drive from Houston was long and we were on the highway after dark. My elderly mother and I were tired, concerned for our safety and wanted to stop at a hotel on the road. New Orleans subsequently flooded that night. Because we had confirmed reservations at the St. Charles, which would have had to be cancelled two days previously, we called the hotel. The manager refused to let us out of reservations even though we offered to stay there another night instead. We called Quality Inn to express our concern and they were of no assistance, telling us that it was up to the hotel management if they would let us out of our reservations or not. The lady at the hotel was very friendly, but she was not the manager. Before she hung up, she told us to be safe on the road because the weather was very bad. We drove through two more hours of rain to get there as we didn't want to pay for two hotel rooms. The St. Charles is made up of several older buildings, which can be very charming if the weather is nice. The room was a good size and looked good, but the bathroom was dirty and had several hairs on the floor and in the tub. There was a party on the third floor and people were yelling across the courtyard. The linens were clean and beds were very comfortable. I enjoyed taking the streetcar to get to the French Quarter. We were never told that a breakfast was included with the price and we ended up going out for breakfast. Our keys to the room never worked for us. When we first arrived, we had to walk to the lobby in the rain and through a flooded courtyard to get assistance. Security let us in and gave us new keys. The next day, those keys didn't work either.

It was great! I'm sure Mardi Gras is amazing, and I'm told the parade goes right down St. Charles in front of this hotel, but you might want to check my facts. This hotel was amazing. I work in the hospitality industry and needless to say I'm picky, but also interested in value. I chose this hotel for the price and the location. Of course, our first choice was to stay in the Quarter, but it was much pricier that weekend because of Halloween. I found Masion St. Charles on the Choice Hotels website and it does not do one bit of justice to this hotel! (The property has its own website that will give you a much better look at what you will experience, especially in terms of pictures: maisonstcharles.com.) The streetcar stopped right outside the hotel, which was very convenient for getting to the quarter. When we arrived and checked in, the front desk agents were very helpful with noting that my parents would be checking in separately although the reservations were under my name. As we proceeded to the building we would be staying in (there are several), we were heartily greeted by the property's manager, who offered us assistance in locating our room and told us to contact him if we needed anything during our stay. The standard rooms are pretty comfortable, although not fancy like some of the places you'll find in the Quarter. But we weren't looking for crazy fancy, we were looking for comfortable and functional; the room looked exactly like the photos of the rooms on the website, which is important to me. I get pretty annoyed when I show up to a hotel that depicted a room all dolled up for their website photos, but in reality they look shabby. This was not the case with Maison St Charles. The breakfast was great and always stocked in spite of the relatively heavy traffic they had that weekend. Every morning when we went to breakfast, the breakfast room was full of people and still full of food as well. And it looks cute too--not your typical generic table-and-chair set up. We will return to this property when we visit New Orleans again. It was a great experience with great service.

We had not stayed in this area of New Orleans before so were excited to to be so close to the garden district. Considering the location and age of this hotel I expected it to be old and maybe a little run down so wasn't surprised when it was both of these things. At check in we found the lobby eclectic, charming and inviting. More inviting then the desk clerk who was having a conversation with, I am assuming, a housekeeping manager and seemed annoyed we were interrupting. She may have been having a bad day or whatever but wasn't particularly friendly. We had booked two king suites for two days and ask if we could have rooms on the first floor. She informed us, as if we should have known, that there were no suites on the first floor......(really) she gave us our keys and sent us on our way to our second floor king suite rooms. The concierge, Tony,(very nice guy, I hope he got the tip we left for him at the front desk) greeted us and helped us to our rooms and we tottered up several narrow staircases to rooms 244 and 245. There are stairs everywhere by the way. They were rooms with king beds all right but that where the whole \"suite\" thing ended. The rooms needed a good cleaning were a bit shabby around the edges but the linens appeared to be clean as were the sink and toilet. As I walked over to look out the window I looked down and saw a very large (2\"-3\") cock roach on it's back kicking wildly, obviously in it's death throes. I know....south,by the water...roachs..blaa..blaa. I have stayed in the south many times and this is the first time I found a roach in the room. Dead or alive. I went downstairs and explained the situation to Tony and he did take care of it immediately but I was left with a creepy crawly feeling knowing where there is one roach they has to be more. The hotel is on St. Charles street at the edge of the Garden District. The area is very noisy (mostly cars with the bass cranked), it is rich with homeless panhandler types asking for change, trash was everywhere and while I never really felt afraid I did feel unwelcome. In my mind the area has none of the French Quarter ambiance. They did have security on the grounds and everything was well lighted. I would note here that of the 20 or so pages in the hotel information booklet in the room at least 10 of them dealt with personal and property safety. We did have a nice dinner at Zea's, which was down the street a couple of blocks. Zea's specialty was rotisserie meats and was a nice place. The chicken was really good and the grits were yummy. The service was good but again I felt a but unwelcome. I'm a pretty friendly open person, I'm not rude or snobby so was not comfortable with this. The hotel offered a very nice hot breakfast in a interesting little room by the pool. The pool and hot tub looked clean and well care for. The high rating and glowing reviews on Tripadvisor were some of the reasons I chose this hotel for our visit to New Orleans but my personal experience at this hotel was a disappointment. We had booked for two nights but after one decided we were ready to check out. The front desk clerk was very nice and waive the parking fee when I explained about our little \"friend\" in the room. An additional note about New Orleans, for those that think this city has recovered from the storm you would be wrong. It is heartbreaking to see how many buildings are still boarded up and how things have deteriorated. It's a city hanging on by it's fingertips. It's lifeblood is tourism, to ever recover to it's former glory it must have the tourist trade but I felt, for want of a better word, resentment from some of the natives, that people could come and party and ignore the devastation.

The nearby corner nook resembled a makeshift toilet found in the alley of some Third World country, stained and always filthy - a place that if you dropped a ten dollar bill you might just leave it. But this is nothing. A large portion of the hotel was under construction and unoccupied, so there were no rooms to move to. All night long forklifts hummed and beeped and things crashed and rattled about 60 feet from our room. It was so absurd it was almost funny. Almost. The pool area is great too if you're an unsavory looking character who likes to stay up all hours playing dominoes, cussin', and suckin' down daiquaris. The oddest thing of all is that the employees thought nothing of the construction madness, the noise and mess - and when I pulled the car around to load up the bags I was barked at and forced to park my car on the street and push everything up the block. Bizarre. The room itself: average size, had no cold water, and the air conditioning maxed out at around 70 degrees - which is just a touch too warm. The TV was 17 or 19-inch - quite a splurge... Not!

Some were old houses and others are more \"run-of-the-mill\" hotel type buildings. We were in one of the smaller buildings (room 247). The room was relatively comfortable but extremely SMALL. There was one double bed, one chair and one small desk. There was a closet built into the wall but there was no bureau of any kind (meaning no drawers -- anywhere).

Although this is not a 4 star hotel with designer furniture, the grounds are immaculately groomed by Cookie and beautiful. The housekeeping staff does a great job of keeping the rooms tidy. Diane will make you feel right at home in the on site lounge (be sure to ask her how she got her 2002 employee of the year award). Security by Tony couldn't be any better, and Kathy, the reservations manager, adjusted our room rates downward voluntarily because there had been a price adjustment after our reservations were made. I'm sorry for leaving out anybody else as the staff was all friendly and bent over backward to ensure we had a pleasant stay. I appreciated the wi fi in the lobby and business center where I could check my email while enjoying the bottomless pot of fresh Community Coffee and a muffin available in the lobby every morning. There are good restaurants nearby. Voodoo Barbeque's ribs are to die for, and the crawfish etouffee omelet at the St. Charles Tavern tastes just as good at 1 a.m. as at 10 . You can hoof it to the interesting shops on Magazine street where there are unbelievable bargains. Everybody, please come back to New Orleans if you want to help this amazing American city and its residents. They need tourists. Although my heart breaks to see some of the devastated areas, Katrina largely spared the French Quarter and the beautiful Garden district. The art museum is open again and is world class. The majestic live oaks in City Park are recouperating. The music on Frenchman Street is wonderful, even on a Sunday night.

We are trying to reestablish ourselves in New Orleans so our stay was primarily business, i.e. checking on our house, meeting with contractors and visiting family. I booked this hotel on the choice privileges website and due to a pricing glitch got a steal of a deal on their 2 bedroom suite, The Robert E. Lee suite. Check-in was quick and the staff was friendly. Parking at this time was free and is a lot across the street. The room was a two bedroom suite with a King bed in one room and a double bed in the other bedroom. It also has a sofasleeper in the living room. The room on arrival was not as clean as I like. One of the bathrooms was a little dirty and the carpet was filthy. I think since this room normally goes for $275 a night and probably had not been used recently, I think that's why the room was not as clean. Had I been paying that rate I would have left shortly after arriving. Since I was getting the room at a steal, I contacted the front desk staff who was very nice about everything. They said to make a list of all our problems and they would remedy the next day which they did. They came in and did a thourough cleaning the next day. They even removed the dirty oriental rug and shampooed the carpet. Maid service at this time was only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturday, so be aware of that. The rooms are quaint and a change from typical hotels, so if you like that style of hotel, this place is for you. There's no elevator. Our room was the entire second floor of one of the buidlings, so be prepared to climb stairs. For our family of five including 3 small children we had adequate space. There are also 3 TVs, one in each room which is a must have with children. Our room came with fridge and microwave. Just be aware also if you are travelling with others and seeking privacy, don't let anyone use the sofabed. There is no covering on top of the master bedroom door, it's an open window. There is a lounge and pool if you want drinks, but no restaurant open at this time. There are fast food and neighborhood restaurants nearby since this is St Charles avenue, so eating out is not a problem. Just be prepared for lines like most restaurants Post Katrina.

Of course I received a great deal online from the hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 web site. We paid $91.00 per night, the third night was free and parking was half price. The pool is great and there is a spa. One block down is a fantastic tavern called \"St. Charles Tavern\" that serves New Orleans style dishes (seafood, steaks, etc); and the prices are reasonable. My girls can be very picky when it comes to eating away from home, but they loved it so much we ate there two nights in a row. The streets have good lighting so we never felt unsafe walking at night.
