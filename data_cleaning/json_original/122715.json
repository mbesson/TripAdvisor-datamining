We went for a quick morning jog and when we got back we were greeted and offered water as soon as we hit the lobby area which is always a nice touch. The hotel is conveniently located by the interstate and even with all of the construction in the city this is still the best location for shopping and entertainment.

Valet was very polite and prompt (not sure what the cost is normally, it was included in our rate). Check-in was fast and we made it to the room with no trouble.

We had to wait 45 minutes past check in time to get our room, and you know that isn't all too convenient when you have an 8 week old baby and a 4 yr old with you. They had said the rooms were not ready. While the room was beautiful and accomodating, it was not very clean. There were fingerprints and smudges all over the glass table tops like they hadn't been wiped down. Having such a small baby cleanliness was definitely a concern so I asked housekeeping (that I saw in the hall) to go back down and wipe the tabletops off or if they would just give me some disinfectant wipes. She couldn't speak english so she walked into our hotel room, walked into the bathroom and back out. Clearly she had no idea what I meant and didn't know what she was doing. The rest of our short stay at this hotel was not problematic. Room was quiet. Everything went smooth with check out. However, two days after our trip, I check my bank account and notice an additional charge from this hotel for $55. Upon calling the hotel I am told that it is for numerous items in the mini bar/fridge. Which makes me obviously furious to see because we did not even touch the mini bar. I am not going to be drinking alcohol with my two kids in my presence not would i have purchased any of the snacks because it is so pricey. I do have a call in to the hotel to dispute this charge. The hotel has told me that the housekeeping made the note in their computer of these items missing from the fridge. I am furious.

I reserved two rooms for two nights, one for me and my husband and one for his parents. The 2 queen beds room I requested for me and my husband was a nice size. However, the room with a king-size bed I had requested for my in-laws was half the size and had a horrible odor. I called the front desk, and they gave my in-laws another room that had 2 double beds, but more room. The tub in my room had rust all over the drain. I called housekeeping to remove the rust, and the maintence person reluctantly did so after I agreed not to take a shower until the morning so the paint could dry. No offer of another room was made. The free morning beverages is a nice perk of Omni hotels, but I did not get the soymilk I had requested for my coffee or the croissant I had ordered. Turns out they ran out of croissants, but couldn't be bothered to let me know by writing a note or calling to see if I wanted an alternative item. The following night we returned to the hotel @ 9 pm to take showers and rest. After I got out of the shower, I smelled smoke. My in-laws called our room and reported the same thing. The front desk informed us that an A/C unit caught fire and offered to allow us to change rooms, which we accepted. It would have been nice if they made the offer on their own rather than us having to ask. We moved 2 floors down, and my in-laws were disappointed that their replacement room was the same size as the small room they had initially received. The hotel did give us free breakfast coupons, which made the late night move a little more bearable, and allowed us to end our stay on a positive note.

An additional incentive to me was their comp. self parking in a garage, I dont mind paying to park but I dont trust most valets with some of my diff. cars.

The only downside I noticed on the hard product the outside of the hotel could use a good pressure cleaning or fresh paint. Service was where the Omni really impressed me. Ive stayed at lots of 5-Diamond hotels that would have trouble keeping up with the Omni's service standard. I was always greeted very quickly and by name. Everything was done quickly when I requested it and I never once heard a no. I had one unusual request that they had no need to fulfill but they did it for me anyways, I was very impressed! I normally do not eat at the hotels as I like to go to local, well known establishments when Im in different cities. However, one night I was extremely tired and not very hungry.

There is absolutely nothing around it besides a slightly tacky new housing area, and the hotel has limited it\u00c2\u00b4s services to get out to a depressing little pool area, just in front of the highway area or a parking lot. Nice for a city hotel... The service is working, until you start asking questions. With one obvious exception - a young receptionist - I have never in my life heard that many \"I don\u00c2\u00b4t know\", and gotten so little information about the hotel, the possibilities around, the city - anything. A tourist information? \"I don\u00c2\u00b4t know\". Where is my conference? \"The what? - I can\u00c2\u00b4t find it in the folder\". And yes, the room was huge. But the location at the highway with badly isolating windows gave such a traffic noise that it simply woke me up every morning - too early. If I haven\u00c2\u00b4t already been waken up by the intense noise when a neighbour entered the room, and the door slammed. Kapow! At least the beds were great, so one could enjoy the sleep until the noise got to you. And last, I simply felt like a cash cow in the room. Where other hotels would have information signs or free offers, especially at this price level, here you we got \"Buy this\", Want to use this, it\u00c2\u00b4s only 6 USD\", \"Want to see a movie, 19.99 USD\" (for ONE regular theather movie).

It allows you to have free internet access. Otherwise, it is 9.95 per day. Also, when you are a member, you get complimentary morning beverages. In previous posts, some people mentioned a low constant humming. I noticed it, but did not let it bother me. Trivial things like that do not bother me when the overall atmosphere is pleasant. Also, they do have a stocked minibar. The pricing on the items are expensive. The Omni also hasa gift shop. The items there are slightly less expensive than the minibar but not by much. They do allow pets for $50 nonrefundable deposit for the entire stay. They do have a fitness center which was fully equipped with ellipitcals, treadmills, stationary bikes, and weights. Also, they have a dry sauna in both the mens and womens area and a shared hot tub. We ate twice from the restaurant. It is quite expensive, but overall, the food was good and the service was good. The hotel is located off of 635 and between the GeorgeBush tollway and 35. You can take 635 either direction to get to restaurants, convenience stores, and a movie theater, easily within 5 minutes. Also, within 10 minutes going East on 635, you can get to the Galleria. Overall, we loved the stay. It had all the amenities that we desired plus much more.

As long as it isn't rush hour, everything from downtown Dalls to Six Flags is only 10-20 minutes away. The hotel specializes in hosting in-hotel conferences in their gorgeous facilities, but this vactioning family was warmly welcomed and eagerly served. The staff isn't just friendly or polite, it's like we have come to their own home to stay. And not just the front desk, but the bus boys and housekeeping and gardeners! These are the happiest bunch of employees I've ever seen, proud of their hotel and eager to prove their considerable worth. We stayed in an Executive Suite which was very large and very comfortable with a nice view (although it's true there isn't much too look at around the hotel itself). About 5 minutes away is MacArthur Blvd which has any kind of food or retail anyone would need. Yes, you can hear the soft purr of the elevators, even in the bathroom, but it didn't bother us at all. We live downtown and are used to trains and sirens and such at night. But if you are used to dead quiet in the night, the elevators would probably bother you. The biggest surprise of all was the food. The chef at the Park West is stellar and we had some of the best food we've ever eaten in Dallas. The hand cut fries, gourmet macaroni and cheese, and the tortilla soup were especially unique and expertly prepared. Best of all, room service is reasonably priced - no 300% markups! - with fast and generous service. For health-concious travellers, this is absolutely the place. The health club is huge with every kind of equipment, the heated pool doubles as a fountain outside the restaurant, and there is a spa/whirlpool in the basement that is secluded and relaxing. The breakfast buffet is filled with Kashi cereals and 20 kinds of fresh-cut fruit, steel cut oatmeal and other tasty and healthy food. I can't list all the little things that made a big impact - covered parking out of the Texas sun, full-sized soaps, thoughtful notes, HDTV!, etc. From now on, we will always stay at an Omni Hotel!", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "sprinkles17", "ReviewID": "UR27544011", "Content": "I went to Dallas with my mother for a girls' weekend getaway.

The location is nice since it's right off the freeway and about 15 minutes from downtown Dallas but there isn't a lot around the property itself as far as resturants or shopping from what we could tell. It was too cool outside to check out the pool area but it looked nice as well. The staff was nice as well. The fitness center was quite nice which included a sauna and hottub.I do have a few complaints though. We stayed in room 706 and there was this intermittent humming noise that went on 24 hours a day of our two day stay. It may have been from the elevator but we were about 5 rooms down from that so I'm not so sure. It was annoying at times. Especially when it was dead quiet and you're trying to fall asleep. The beds were nicely decorated and pretty comfortable with the exception of the pillows. They were just like sticking your head into a heap of clothes. No support at all and I was using two of them. We got a room service breakfast which was tasty but was way WAY over priced. On the menu it looks like you are going to pay around $25.00-$30.00 for the full breakfast for two but when the final bill came it topped out about $50.00 with additional fees! It was $90 per night to stay there! That's a little messed up for a breakfast. There seemed to be ample free parking at all times so that was good. Check in and check out were pretty standard. To conclude, it was worth the price we payed through hotels.com but if we had payed the standard price, it probably would have been too much.

Our one night visit to Dallas ( from our three week holiday home in florida) had been uber organized in advance, and we selected as our base the Omni hotel after reading reviews on trip adviser. The hotel was clean and functional and well located just off the interstate, but it never really clicked for us; the fact that we'd been given rooms on the 2nd floor with a lovely view of a flat roof leading to the interstate didn't exactly endear the hotel to us; we were only there for 1 night so we didn't bother asking for better rooms and we only used the hotel as a base but maybe it was too functional. The rooms themselves were, though clean, a little dark and gloomy. There were a number of large business conferences and tour groups staying at the hotel at the same time as us, so maybe this hotel is more suited to that type of traveler than my wayward family. Nevertheless, the pool was nice (though too hot to endure in the August Texas sun shine) and the concierge did well in suggesting a restaurant we all enjoyed. There is a large free car park attached to the hotel; a car is essential as there is little around the hotel (however, this is common in America ). Dallas itself for 2 days was fab: we found out who shot JR, but not who shot JFK (the picket fence really is only 50 yards from the X on the highway where he was first shot); The Galleria Mall was superb for a Brit (with a wife & 2 teenage daughters) in the heady days when you could get $2 to the \u00c2\u00a3, and was really worth the extra $$ for valet parking. A hire car with a sat nav is essential; Texas is massive (certainly by English standards) and the off site car hire at DFW airport was a breeze. There were plenty of frequent buses to and from the 2 locations. So it's a big thumbs up for Dallas, and a fairly neutral wave goodbye to the Omni; it did what it said on the tin, but that's all it did. Incidentally, on our return flight to MCO, we were staggered to find 2 identical separate car parks with 2 identical floors and very little to identify & differentiate them in the way of signage. At midnight, we left the airport to return to floor 5, row 7, space 6 in the car park to find an empty space. An hour later, and after much tears and tantrums (from me, let alone the girls) we discovered (with the help of the single security guard on duty after midnight) an identical car park next door, where our vehicle resided in floor 5, row 7, space 6.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel -- not in the city\u201d", "Author": "surreyuk", "ReviewID": "UR26839100", "Content": "Good hotel.

We thought we'd try somewhere new, instead of staying where we ALWAYS stay. Big mistake. What we thought would be a wonderful birthday trip for me was nothing close to wonderful. It was just plain bad. The location is okay, being that it is right off the highway and easy to find, but we didn't care for it overall. It is supposed to sit on a lake, but where is the lake? I didn't see one. My husband joked that their promo picture must be of an Omni in Chicago or LA, because it looks nothing like the pictures in person. The room was standard in size, nothing special here, but the bathroom was terrible. The sink sits out very far, making it difficult to apply make up. I had to use a magnifying mirror to come close, and I hate those! For a woman, this is something that is important when you have a husband waiting two hours for you to get ready. It took me forever! I had to lean in all sorts of ways to be able to see myself in the mirror. I gave up and used the little one, because it reached where I was standing. The water is VERY hard. When I say VERY, I am not exaggerating. My hair broke off when dry. I am so glad I packed a few cute hats for a night out on the town! =) As for service, what service? They took all of our soap when they cleaned the rooms, and it took an hour and three calls to the front desk to get any. I forgot my body wash... silly me! One would think they would supply soap, when politely asked for it. As for the beds, they are very hard. The \"foam\" pillows are not foam, and the down pillows are old and worn. We had to get six just to sleep, and even then, it took forever to get comfortable. I woke up many times to readjust my pillows. When calling for extras, we requested four and received one. After a day of just dealing with it, I called again for more down pillows, and received nothing. A trip to the front desk proved fruitful. We received our pillows, although just as bad as the first set, it was nice to be listened to. Casey was wonderful! I informed him that it was my birthday, and that our stay had been less than pleasant, and he personally delivered the pillows, along with champagne and strawberries. It was a nice gesture, but we would have enjoyed a discount or some other form of compensation. A cheap bottle of Brut was a little beneath our standards, and we are no snobs! The strawberries were good, though. The hot tub rocked, so a plus there. The gym is state-of-the-art. I didn't use it, because we wanted to take a break from our normal routine at home, but I was very impressed with the equipment. It made me wished I'd packed by running shoes! Would we stay here again? Never. We will gladly pay more to stay at the Lumen, which is where we've stayed before. The Lumen is only rated 3-star, but puts the 4-star Omni in the dust with service, comfy beds, awesome showers, and a convenient location. You just can't beat them. You may think the Omni is classy and shiny, as I did upon arrival, but when you take a closer look, you will find that the marble pillars are not marble at all, but covered in \"marble\" wallpaper instead.

I was a little weary becaase of the price, so I went to Tripadvisor for...well, advice. Most of the comments on here are right on. It was well priced for what we got. The hotel has a restaurant, a bar, a wine bar w/ tapas, a snack shop, and a lovely pool with a great veranda to sit out of the sun by the pool. They even have a waitperson that comes by the pool to take drink/food orders. They also have room service. The rooms were fine. Everything seemed really new and clean. The windows don't open in the rooms, so that's one downfall. The only other one is the parking fee. It seems every hotel has one now, but compared to the Hilton's, it was $6 less (Omni's is $11 a night). OH, don't mention a car and express check-out?...you may not get charged the parking fee.
