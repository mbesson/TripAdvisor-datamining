The carpet had a pub feel, sticky carpets and the view was non existent. This hotel should be razed to the ground it is the worst place that I have ever stayed and that includes bus shelters and fields when I was a drunk student. Do not waste your money, yes this place is cheap for central London but what a hole, stay away do not stay here.

The staff overall was helpful. The lift is still out of service. We were on the second floor so not easy climbing the stairs with the suitcases. The double room we had overlooking the main road was very small. just a double bed, a two-door wardrobe,tv and small table all crumpled together, hardly any space to walk around. The shower room..interesting enough was a caravan/yacht piece literally placed in the room, so you can imagine ow tiny it was. Can't complain about the cleanliness, all around the hotel it was clean and tidy, towels changed everyday. Breakfast was served in a small room but we never waited long to be seated. orange juice and coffe /tea and toast offered twice. then choice betwen continental (yoghurt, muesli/cornflakes and 2 slices ham + 2 slices cheese) or english (2 sausages, beans, mushrooms, 1 slice bacon and egg). English breakfast was listed as a 2pounds supplement. My boyfriend had it twice but at the end we were not charged for it. Overall it was a nice stay besides that we only use the room for showering and sleep and maybe a short rest in between. But still find that it was expensive especially for the size of room and no functional lift. I know overall London is very expensive re accomodation, but for the same amount of money i always got a good sizeable room, bathroom and better services( lift and breakfast buffet) in 3 or 4 star hotels in other european capitals. as far this was the worst room i ever got. i don't think i will stay her again if some other time i return to London.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "Rempt2", "ReviewID": "UR125428208", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in February on our way to Spain. 5 minutes from Paddington.

I would have thought the hotel would have laid on staff to carry your bags. When we finally reached our room, to say we were disappointed would be an understatement, the room looked tired & in need of a refurb. We had booked a double room, but this was at best a single with a double bed in it. The room could only have measured 10ft x 8ft with just enough room to walk around the bed. The heating didn't work, the windows were not double glazed, so the draught whistled through the gaps. The walls were paper thin, you could hear everything coming from the adjoining rooms The so called ensuite was a joke, i have seen bigger bathrooms in a caravan. As for breakfast the breakfast room was far too small for the number of guest rooms only 10 tables, you had to wait outside for a table. When we finally got a table, the choice of menu was poor, the full english was made up of sausage bacon egg mushrooms beans & toast, made from very poor quality ingredients, probably supermarket own brand value range. As we paid \u00c2\u00a399 per night you would have expected something better for your money. The hotels only redeeming feature was its good location right next to paddington station.

We had a twin room on the 4th floor. The lady on the reception desk was extremely friendly and welcoming, and explained that the lift was currently out of order (we were expecting this from reading other reviews). To get the the 4th floor requires climbing up about 8 flights of very steep narrow steps - not an easy feat with bulky bags!! On first impressions, the room was dated, but clean and tidy. The beds were actually really comfortable, with fresh clean sheets. We had a view over Norfolk Square & London Street. There was a little kettle and 2 mugs, and a little tin containing coffee, tea milk and sugar. This was nice, but didn't get topped up during our stay so we ended up buying our own. The room also had a hairdryer (I'll use the word hairdryer loosely!) and a TV. The bathroom was appauling. It can only be described as a 'caravan bathroom' and was basically a small plastic pod put into the room in the corner, it couldn't have been any bigger than 70cm square. It was so small, you couldn't use the shower without flooding the tiny room and using the toilet was interesting!!! There are towels supplied, but these are VERY small so I would reccommend bringing your own. We had a cooked breakfast included with our room, which was very poor. The sausages were tiny, and the really cheap kind which had the texture of wallpaper paste inside (there may have been traces of meat somewhere!) the mushrooms were undercooked and cooked in oil and garlic, which for breakfast is vile. The beans were very much of the value variety and the single egg you get is overcooked and very small. However the selection of toasts and spreads was nice, as was the orange juice and coffee. On both mornings we had to wait for over 20 minutes for a table, and we felt like we were being rushed to eat and get out to free a table up. Overall, its an OK hotel. If you just want a place for a shower and a bed its fine. I would reccommend leaving breakfast and popping to McDonalds or Costa Coffee around the corner from the hotel.

Probably unwisely I decided to go ahead and decided to lug my suitcase upstairs. You see, I am 66 and have a bad back, and something like that could easily send me to the hospital... The lady led me to the 1st floor where the breakfast room is, and then pointed to the beginning of the stairs, leading up to the 4th floor. This is a very complicated maze, as the hotel is made up of several smallish buildings. You end up going through about 3 doors on the way up. Furthermore, at one point you must actually go down about 1 floor before you can go up again... The stairs are narrow, steep, and make frequent sharp turns. All in all, reaching the 4th floor is the worst climb that I have ever experienced in any hotel, bar none! I checked out at 10 this morning , and the lift was still broken, so I had to redo the whole thing backwards. I noticed some Asian women asking at the desk about some other hotels with working lifts. I wish I had done the same! In their defence, the manager told me that they do not advertise the lift, and so I had no ground for seeking some discount (which I didi).

However the smiles were soon wiped off our faces when we stepped in the door. We were informed the lift upstairs was broken and had to haul our large suitcases up the very poorly signed stairs to our room. Seriously, we couldn't even fit our suitcases in and still walk around. The room was tiny, the lights were dismal and coated in dust, the bathroom was like an all in one cupboard with no bath, just a shower, sink and toilet all together. The window vent was broken and jammed open, meaning the room was like a fridge. Oh and the bed had no covers on the quilts. I immediately went back to the front desk to complain and, thankfully, they gave us another room, this time a decent size with a proper bath in the seperate bathroom. Unfortunately this meant hauling our belongings up two more flights of stairs! Over our 5 night stay we only had breakfast in the hotel once as it really left a lot to be desired. It wasn't particularly unpleasant, just the staff seemed irritable and we felt rather uncomfortable. Luckily there was a number of food chains in the same street so we didn't starve. The few good points in the room ended at the TV which had some freeview channels, but no remote, a CD player/radio, and a large radiator which did keep us reasonably warm. Bad points however; no shower curtain or any kind of enclosure around the bath meant the floor flooded everytime wanted a shower. Everything we touched seemed to fall apart, from the top of the hot tap coming loose, to the knob on the warbrobe coming off in my hand as i tried to open it. The room seemed generally clean, although I tried not to look to closely after the first room, and regularly used hand sanitizer whilst staying there. The staff were often very short with us and although our beds were made at some point everyday, they failed to empty our bins, fill up our tea and milk and even failed to provide us with toilet roll! The last day though really took the biscuit. Sitting in our room, packing, with the door locked and the key in the door, with the tv on (so its not like the room was silent) a member of staff unlocked the door, pushing out our key, walked in, without knocking and upon seeing us asked if we'd like the room cleaned! We told them to leave, appalled at the fact they'd just walked in when anything could have been going on! In all my life I've never known such poor service! The only thing that saved them was the fact they had actually moved our rooms without any hassle and the only polite member of staff we encountered carried our suitcases down the last flight of stairs after two others had watched us struggling. With a view of the Hilton mocking us out of our window, my friend and I both agreed the hotel was an absolute joke. If the room we were switched to is the same price as the one we'd been originally put in I think its an absolute disgrace that people pay good money for such a terrible room!

We described the quality of the hotel we wanted by saying that it should be something along the lines of a Holiday Inn-type. Not anything five star, but somewhere in the middle, clean, and near to Paddington Train Station. Well, be still my heart! What we ended up with was an abomination! The only way it resembled our criteria was by being in close proximity to the train station. It reminded me of some place out of the1940s where a WW II soldier would have taken a woman for a one-nighter. The lobby was nothing more than a store front, of sorts, with a front desk area at the foot of - at some point in time long, long ago - a beautiful staircase. The carpeting was stretched and buckled causing a walking hazard, and the public loo on the first floor was the typical old style hole in the floor; of which we had no appreciation for. Althoough by now we might have enjoyed a glass of wine, we chose not to try to relax in the very dark and dreary bar down the hall behind the front desk. The musty smelling halls and rooms were what one would expect to see in an old black and white movie showing an old boarding house. But let's start with the key. A basic skeleton key in 2010!? That should have been one of the first clues as to what lay ahead. And then there was the bathrooom! Oh dear God - the bathroom! It was actually a fiberglass shower enclosure installed / recessed into a wall with a shower curtain running across it providing just enough room for one to take a shower. The toilet, toilet paper holder, sink and mirror were also inside the same enclosure! The genius who installed the toilet paper holder in that spot obviously didn't take into consideration that the roll would get wet from the shower water! There was a set of recessed shelves that appeared to have been a closet in it's former life, but now housed an older \"boom-box\" radio CD/ tape player and a tube-type TV with a choice of four channels. A hair dryer was mounted on the wall right next to the door and was too high for me to reach. The sheets and blankets were old and showed signs of wear. The place was \"tidy\" but I can't categorize it as being \"clean\". Again, it had an old, musty house smell to it everywhere (probably because it actually hadn't had a thorough cleaning since WW II). We were so tired when we arrived - and at that point, when we finally finished climbing the stairs (no working elevator/ lift) and walking the length of the building to the room - that we just didn't have enough energy to check out and go look for someplace more livable and not so depressing. So, I lay motionless and awake most of the night, staring at the ceiling waiting for some drunkard to mistake the room for his own, and burst through the door using his own skeleton key! They did serve breakfast. It's served in a room on the second floor that looks somewhat like a sort of tea room. We opted not. In fact, we couldn't wait for dawn to come, and when it did - we RAN out of that place. It's been a couple of months now and we can finally laugh a good belly laugh when recalling that hotel.

The Norfolk is perfectly situated at Paddington Station and the underground. Also, in the evening, there are lot of nice places to eat and drink. The Saywers Arms, opposite the road, is fun for a drink and/or a bite, the small Italian San Marco serves great pizza's for a ridiculous low price, the Indian place Mughal hasn't a good reputation for service but the food is super. A bit further away (a 20 minutes walk, at Porcherters Gardens) you'll find the Cous Cous Cafe. Bit more expensive but an excellent and cozy Maroccan. The closeby Victoria is an absolute beautiful English pub, etc., etc. Around the hotel you'll will also find a lot of Libanese cafe' and restaurants, especially on Edgware Road. And if you walk to Little Venice (just around one of the corners of Paddington Station and London Street) you'll enter a little paradise with beautiful narrowboats on the canals and a couple of more trendy stylisch restaurants at the waterside. Also Notting Hill (one undergroundstop or a relaxed walk that takes about 25/30 minutes) had lot of great options to spend a nice day/evening. And Hyde Park is just around the corner also. But back to the hotel. Yes, the lift are -probably- forever out of work. So I wouldn't go there if you have a problem with climbing stairs. Further I can't find any excuse of not going there. it's not the Hilton but a small budget place. Excellent is you just have to shower and sleep there. And certainly not the 'hotel from hell' as some guests call it.

One twin room and one single room. Booked last week as accommodation while we went to watch a show in the West End and enjoyed a day shopping. We parked at Paddington Station's car park ( Not bad value at \u00c2\u00a322 for 24 hours) about 10 mins walk from hotel- just turned up and parked unbooked. The hotel's location is very good- a few hundred yards from Paddington Tube- 20 mins or so to Covent Garden. We arrived too early to check in but were able to lock our bags in a cupboard on the ground floor while we went out. The hotel is very down-at-heel. The entrance is very dated and a little grubby. Our rooms were on third floor (twin) and fourth floor (single). The lift was out of action and, looking at the age-worn out of order notice and reading other reviews, it has been in the same condition for many years. Thus we had to walk up many flights of grubby stairs and wend our way through sepentine corridors carrying our bags to get to our rooms. The rooms are grim- very old decor, nasty curtains, filthy faux suede bed heads, the cheapest, nastiest furniture. These features wierdly juxtaposed with very clean bed linen and comfortable beds! The en-suite bathroom is a tiny wet room which looks as though it has been recently ripped out of an ancient caravan. There is a toilet, a basin and a shower- none seemed too clean and the floor is revolting. Water was hot though. A genuinely unpleasant experience to use. The breakfast room is reasonably pleasant, the service reasonable and the food offering is fine. My wife had the \u00c2\u00a32 upgrade to full English which she enjoyed. My step-son and I had the continental- Ham and processed cheese, toast (which seemed to be unlimited in quantity), cheap, but decent jams and butter, coffee and yoghurt- all pretty good. I stay in expensive, business hotels several times a week all around the country so I am being careful not to demand too much from an economy hotel, however I can scarcely believe the poor standards, poor decoration and downright unpleasantness of the rooms this hotel offers. ( My step-son's room was little more than a grubby cupboard). The thought of American or other international visitors seeing this as a typical British hotel is horrifying. Strangely the hotel's failings did not ruin our brief city break we had a brilliant time. I cannot imagine that we are unique in saying that we will never return to this hotel - it seems inconceivable that anyone would stay at the Norfolk more than once.- this is a great pity as relatively small level of investment and time;cleaning and updating the rooms in combination with it's excellent location would make this an ideal hotel.

We were told by a gruff young lady that our room was not ready & given a key & directions to the luggage store. I used the bathroom which was really grubby.

I asked for someone to take our luggage up for us, this did happen, but they didn't seem happy to do it. The hotel building was probably once lovely but is now grubby and in desperate need of a refit. The bedroom was adequate for our needs, but had no space to store our cases. The bathroom was a joke!! Our caravan bathroom is bigger, It was really awkward to get into, up 2 very narrow steps & totally airless with the door shut. The shower was minute & very loose, it refused to stay upright once the water was turned on. Both evenings were very warm & we had to sleep with the window open, but noise of traffic & other guests kept us awake both nights. Which was a shame as the beds were actually quite comfy. The breakfast was terrible!! The staff were rude & spoke very little English which made communication difficult. We opted for the continental breakfast which consisted of museli, - we had to ask twice for the milk, yoghurt - no choice, toast & jam, cheese - sliced burger type, ham & orange juice - which we left because it tasted odd, coffee & tea - which we had to ask for twice because they forgot. All the food came at the same time & there was not enough space to put it all. We both felt as if we were in a boarding school!! We left our cases in the luggage cupboard again after checkout & were again just given the key.

I previously wrote a review on this hotel about my stay 2 years ago, the hotel was good value then, but even better now. The price is brilliant considering you are in the centre of London. The only things I can fault is the cooked breakfast is not very nice (It's free), but there is cereal available with plenty of toast and conserves and unlimited tea/coffee/orange juice which is very very good. The rooms are quite small generally, but we were lucky enough to get one of the Duke of Wellington suites which was a bigger room with pine furniture. Noise outside from nearby pubs was quite loud but this was only down to the World Cup being on, it's not normally like this. I've read some reviews from other people who did nothing but complain about this hotel. Yes the rooms and bathroom are small and it could do with a refurb but, the price reflects this. A hotel, for most people on city breaks, is a base (Somewhere to sleep), not to spend the majority of their break in. Overall the staff were friendly, a locked cupboard is available for storing luggage before room is ready and after checking out. Maids came and cleaned thr room, changed bed sheets and renewed towels everyday. Transport links a brilliant with Paddington Station having national rail and the main tube lines running through it. Also there is a tour bus available which takes you around the main attractions around London. This is the second time I've stayed here and it certainly won't be the last. The hotel also offers a discounted price on tickets into Londons attractions which can be purchased from reception. This saves you money and it means you don't have to queue at the attraction!!!.

There's plenty of bars and restaurants which suited us down to the ground. On my recent stay last week, myself and two of my friends had a triple bed room booked for 27th of June to the 29th.

We had our own modern fully useable kitchen, two double beds and a single, bathroom and lounge with tv. This apartment and the staff at the hotel made our stay in the city most enjoyable. I felt that strongly I even emailed the manager!! On reflection on the staff, the receptionist was soo nice and friendly and made sure that we were satisfied with our stay. She even commented that she hadnt seen us during breakfast and seemed concerned that we had missed it! The kitchen staff were great and were approachable if we wanted another cup of tea or more toast etc. I will definately be staying at the hotel in the near future.

However, the access to my single room which was on the fourth floor of the building next to the main hotel, was either by a tiny lift - room for 2 without luggage maybe? - lined with dark blue carpet and felt like I imagine a coffin would feel - or numerous flights of stairs leading to an outside \"fire escape type\" steps going down slightly, to the next building. I felt like Mary Poppins up amongst the chimneys! Then, in through a fire door to a place that wasn't nearly as nice as the main buiding had appeared. You had to use the outside steps even if you used the lift and I heard other people saying they weren't going to use that lift again! There didn't seem to be a proper fire escape. The instructions were to use the main stairs if there was a fire. My room was very small but just about OK - for a few hours. Bed seemed clean, but hard. Kept the window closed and it was quiet - but might be very hot in the summer I should think. Tiny moulded plastic tea tray/kettle with the basics. Built in plastic cabin type bathroom - tiny, reminded me of a cheap ferry cabin, cheap soap and shower gel. But it was OK. Carpet grubby with cigarette burns, curtains - very heavy elaborate ones - hanging off rail in middle. Furniture - not that there was room for much, not even a chair - cheap, very basic. Small TV worked OK. Didn't try the phone as my mobile worked. No restaurant - I think the ones mentioned are really other nearby businesses that they have arranged access to via internal doors. The breakfast room is on the first floor of the main building. Check that you have booked for a full English breakfast if that is what you want. A Chinese girl sitting next to me was asked if she wanted English and after eventually saying yes and waiting she was told she had only booked for continental breakfast and would have to pay extra. My English breakfast was quite well cooked. I didn't try the orange juice or bread etc. I had paid \u00c2\u00a350 for one night - months in advance with my rail ticket.

Here's our experience: Upon arrival, we were informed that someone reserved for us a double room although our reservation was for a TWIN -and as promised by the manager- SPACIOUS room. They managed to get us a twin room, which was probably the smallest hotel room in history ever! (Not to mention the condition of the bathroom: there were FLAKES OF PAINT COMING OUT OF THE BATHTUB!) There wasn't even space to put our luggage. When we complained about that, they said that usually people don't bring two suitcases with them! If you ask me, there wasn't space for not even one suitcase but according to the guy at the reception that's what the nightstand between the beds is for! And if we made a little rearrangement with the chair and the TV, we would manage to fit the second suitcase, although then we wouldn't be able to open the door... Eventually they discovered that there was a larger room available from the next day and we were so happy to hear about that, that we managed to overcome the fact that our room had no heating and that we had to wait for the porter to switch it on THE NEXT MORNING! The new room was almost what the website was promising, but I must say that having to spend FIVE nights on the same sheets and FIVE days on a carpet that was never vacuumed wasn't that comfortable! The next surprise was when we found out that WE HAD TO PAY TO GET A REMOTE FOR THE TV. Fortunately, we brought our own adaptors, or we had had to pay for them also! And that wasn't hardly all... Most of the staff was almost UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN PROPER ENGLISH and -apart from two young ladies who were attending reception in the mornings- they were also RUDE! Every evening, when I entered the hotel and said \"hello\" I didn't even get one smile as a reply! Smiles were also missing from the breakfast room, as well as orange juice! In fact it was probably replaced with water with sugar and orange colour! Last, but not at all least, when we unpacked we found out that we forgot in our room two adaptors and two rucksacks.

The negatives were a grossly out of level floor(or was it the Sawyers)central heating didn't work although they had an electric heater which was ok and we left it on 24/7. It wasn't dirty or smelly and I would stop there again at the right price. Now, NEWCOMERS to London, DO get a Travelcard for your duration absolutly essential, This was my first time on the tube, when are we getting one in Nottingham ? Ratings out of 10:- St Pauls, 10. London Bridge,7. Tower of London, 10. London Eye, 6. London Aquarium,2. HMS Belfast,7. Harrods,5. Museums near to Harrods,8. Big Bus, expensive but very handy on first day. The south Bank from London Bridge to Westminster bridge is a nice walk. I printed a street map of the web with just the area I was interested in,Hyde Park to London bridge, It had all the Tube station marked, I found it invaluable and didn't get lost once.

The room itself was adequately equipped with 2 x single beds, clean bedclothes and clean towels left every day, a small wardrobe and a dressing table/desk but no drawers. The curtains were falling off the rail and would not meet in the middle so I secured them together with pins!! The bathroom was a good size, no shower curtain though. We had a problem with the toilet not flushing, this was reported and supposedly repaired but failed to work every now and again. The breakfast was adequate but be early as on one occasion there were approx 10/12 persons waiting outside and we had to wait for some others to leave before we could go in. All in all I suppose you get what you pay for but it is badly in need of a good overhaul and modernisation but most of all a thorough clean. On the other hand it is in a prime location close to Paddington Station, buses, shops and restaurants and is ideally situated.", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDirty and outdated\u201d", "Author": "Nikka", "ReviewID": "UR3751273", "Content": "I wish I had read the reviews before staying here. I thought I had found a great deal booking this hotel online. The only good thing to say about it is the location which was great, right by Paddington station for the heathrow express and all the buses and tubes. Unfortunately, the room was dirty and outdated. there were stains on the walls, bedspreads, carpet and ceiling. The original features was found in the fact that nothing had been updated... I could barely see in the bathroom as it was so dark. The breakfast room as pleasant but breakfast only consisted of cornflakes and a fruit yogurt. When my friend tried to specify WHICH type of fruit yogurt he wanted, his request was denied.

We left the facade of the reception area, and headed to our room, carrying our suitcases up and down numerous stairs, once there we found it somewhat, well how can I put this? It was supposed to be for two people, what a laugh you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even swing a cat. As for the bathroom if your 6ft like me then all I can say is that I hope you are a contortionist, my wife is 5 foot 3 and had trouble moving about. Before checking out we went for breakfast in the hotel, we ordered the continental breakfast and received the following: two thin slices of pre packed ham, one slice of toast and two cheese slices (still in their rapper),I have never seen anything like it.
