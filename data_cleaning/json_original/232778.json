Before I get to the review of the Hotel Arc La Rambla - let me say - the La Rambla area is real \"cheesy\". The restaurants have pre-made food that sits for hours. The stroll area is super-hype - and classless. And so onto the hotel review. Upon check in the staff was friendly and efficient. But when we entered our room ... OMG... what were they using to clean the place .. the worst smelling cleaning solution you could imagine. It stunk! It burned our eyes. The room was just large enough to fit a small double bed with barely enough room for 2 persons to stand in. The room was really warm and yet the climate control did not work. When we went downstairs to the front desk we were told that the climate control (the air conditioning system) had been turned off because about a week before they had a few chilly nights. And they had no intention of turning the A/C back on. They said, \"open the window\". When we asked for another room they didn't have anything available but \"would let us know\" if we could move. So that night, we opened the window, but when looking outside the window ..it was like looking down an elevator shaft. There was no way we were going to get any fresh air. also, because the window opened INTO the room - we had to have the curtain pulled back. Not having a curtain for privacy - all the lights from the hallway lit up our two sleeping bodies for all the guests to see as they left the elevator and walked along the hallway. Unbelievable!! There was no fresh air - it was like sleeping in a coffin- a hard coffin at that as the bed was extremely hard. It was disgusting. We were originally going to stay 5 nights - but couldn't get out of there fast enough. We left after 3 nights and couldn't get out of Barcelona fast enough either.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "classybird_10", "ReviewID": "UR126591294", "Content": "This is a v good hotel.

Your not going to get a hotel this good and cheap with a location as good as this, the rooms were very modern and the balcony looked out onto La Rambla, the room was clean and fairly large with a safe, hairdryer and ironing board on request.

Like other reviewers, I agree the location was superb, right on La Rambla - a tad too noisy for sleep until the not so small hours most nights we were there, with revellers partying very late. The rooms were very basic, comfortable beds but very short on hanging/drawer/storage space, with only one plastic garden type chair, so sitting on the small balcony to people watch was not really an option. The bedroom lighting is very dim, an uplighter with small bulb for bedside light and only one small ceiling light, making dressing, other than in daytime rather awkward. Also, the only mirror was in the bathroom - don't people care what they look like when they go out and about? Breakfast is 10 euros each day unless you stay and indulge for more than two days, when the price is reduced to 8.50 euros daily. A reasonable buffet is presented and the price is probably about in keeping with the elevated restaurant prices to be found in most tourist places in Barcelona. Reception staff are friendly and reasonably knowledgeable about tourist attractions. We booked through Hotels.Com and, at the booking stage, understood we had paid a price which included breakfast, however, this wasn't endorsed on the paperwork and as we were unable to prove otherwise had to bite the bullet and pay extra for breakfast.

I imagine that the lack of double rooms was just a one off- but I would recommend stating on booking.com etc or whichever company you book through that you want a room at the front and whether you want a double or twin very clearly", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cArc La Rambla - Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Edgcumbe", "ReviewID": "UR119799455", "Content": "We were in Barcelona for our first ever visit and had booked in to the Hotel Arc Rambla for 5 days.

We had a great room with a large balcony which was bathed in the afternoon sun! After two nights we found the buzz of happy revellers from the streets below kept us awake. We requested a move and were dealt with graciously and efficiently and were moved to another suite which resulted in 3 good nights rest. There is a restaurant inside the hotel which does a great breakfast but the other restaurant accessible from the hotel has a great variety of food all day long. The staff were great. It is worth bearing in mind that it is cheaper to eat in rather tan outside on the pavement extension of the restaurant as there may be an additional charge for table service. Check this out before you order your meal. The Hotel Arc La Rambla is ideally situated to access key areas of Barcelona and is near to all the transport locations. The hotel is well presetned.

Breakfast was relaxed, tasty and plentiful.

I would recommend it to everyone - I took photos of our room and breakfast room, but they are identical to the ones shown on the website, so I have not included them with this review. You could probably pay lots more for a hotel, but I am not sure what you would gain, as there is so much to see in Barcelona, I would not want to be sitting in a hotel room when I could be out and about absorbing the atmosphere of this beautiful and vibrant city. We also were within easy reach of some very good restaurants, just off Le Ramblas, which had excellent food at reasonable prices.

Anyway: We - me and a friend - had booked a superior room with balcony and it was my impression after taking a sneak view of the standard rooms, which seemed really claustrophobic in my oppinion, that the extra money you pay for a superior are well spend, eventhough it's a bit overpriced compared to other places in Barcelona. Had we lived in a standard room, I would probably have rated the hotel 'poor'. The interior of the reception and the rooms is not as appealing and new as showed in the hotel advertising photos, but it's clean and the beds are good to sleep in, and the staff is really nice and polite.

The hotel is advertised as a three star hotel, it has free Wi-Fi and two adjoining restaurants. We arrived on an early flight and were told that we could secure our luggage in bus station-type wall lockers for two euros per locker until our room was ready to be occupied. The taxi fare to the hotel from the airport was 35 euros with tip (it cost about ten euros to take a taxi to the ship). After we ate a good lunch next door our room was ready for us to bring up our luggage. The room was very small and so narrow that I had to turn sideways to walk in front of the bed. The Ikea type furniture was very spartan, there were no drawers to put clothes in. Our room had no refrigerator, phone, alarm clock, coffee maker, ice bucket (hotel has no ice machines, you have to ask the front desk to get it), extra blankets or pillows. On the plus side, the bathroom was very large for the room with a full sized tub and plenty of hot water. It also had towels, soap,shampoo, and a waste basket. The beds were not that comfortable but at least the mattresses had springs in them. I slept soundly the first night but had a sore back after the second night. The room/hotel seemed to be pretty clean although there was plenty of wear and stains in the carpeting. Every staff member but our housekeeping lady was friendly and helpful. The hotel has no pool but does have a terrace for sun bathing on the top floor. The selling point for the hotel is the location. It is located about a block from the southern end of La Rambla, walking distance to the port and the traffic circle where you can catch sight seeing buses. It is also close to the metro. Unfortunately it is also two doors down from the Peep Show and Sex Shop, and this \u201cPrime location\u201d is a haven for pickpockets, prostitutes, transvestites, and homeless people who use the sidewalk for their toilet. The place reeks of urine. Finally, you can\u2019t escape noticing the crime in the old quarter, people are constantly getting robbed despite the presence of cops everywhere. During my three days in Barcelona I saw no less than five couples call police after the pickpockets got to them. One couple got robbed inside the SuperMercado grocery store across the street from the hotel. Two more got robbed in the area in front of KFC. You\u2019re a target on the street people, beware! I think I can say with confidence that the Hotel Arc La Rambla is a good TWO STAR hotel if you don\u2019t have children and IF you can get a room for less than seventy five euros. I previously stayed at the Avenida Palace Hotel located about a mile north of La Rambla, paid about 150 a night, and thoroughly enjoyed the elegance, comfort, and security of the place. I suggest paying the extra money to stay in a quality hotel in Barcelona, you can\u2019t go by how many stars an establishment advertises itself as having. I also highly recommend not staying on La Rambla, particularly if you have children. It\u2019s worth a stroll and there are many nice shops and restaurants in the area, but you\u2019ll have to keep your guard up the entire time you\u2019re there.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brno, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for downtown trips/walks\u201d", "Author": "Kroulak", "ReviewID": "UR117097118", "Content": "After many experience- all hotel categories over the world- we can recomand this hotel .

The staff were very thoughtful and I'm thankful for their customer care. The hotel is well located on Las Ramblas and was a great point of reference for getting around town. We took the local metro, which was only a block away from the hotel. It was easy to walk around the area and there were some charming bars on sidestreets. We did notice some hookers two doors down from the hotel at a sleazy saloon, but I'm from New York, so they didn't scare me. Just some nonsense to avoid on your way to better places. The staff gave us recommendations of where to rent bikes, motorcycles, and good directions to take the bus to the Parc Guell, which Gaudi built.

Booked it on a major hotel website. Pros: Nice entryway, hotel is easy to locate as it is on the lower end of Las Ramblas, (towards beach/docks). Check in fairly easy, lift will accommodate two people with full size luggage each. Room itself, (standard room), is basic, two beds, a small desk and a particle board armoire, it did suit our needs. Shower has good water pressure. Staff friendly, we had minimal interaction but that which we did have was positive. Cons: location, although this is on Las Ramblas, it is on the lower end, as opposed to the upper end, which is at Placa Catalunya. The hotel happens to be next to a sex shop or adult store, and every night, we would see prostitutes, and the men who would frequent them. No big deal, but if you are with kids, I would not recommend the location. We were walking out and about later in the evening and overall felt safe, that is, we were not approached by anybody but as a parent, your gut tightens up as you walk through that area. Another con is the in room safe. It can accommodate a small laptop, has the combo function but it is not secured or mounted to any object. A person could literally walk off with this. I did speak to front desk about deposit box and was told they have none and are not liable for items stolen. Nothing was taken but it remained an uneasy feeling. This hotel does offer a breakfast however we did not partake so I can't comment, other than to say it is 10 Euros per person, 8 if you book at least two days in advance. There is a daily produce/meat/fish market up the street, on the left hand side as you walk towards Plaza Catalunya, that has many vendors. We had fresh bread, fruit, coffee, juice, daily and prices were reasonable. There is s self service Laundromat nearby, the hotel will provide flyers for it. The small front end washers are 4.50 Euros, large tumble dryer is 1 euro per ten minutes, (twenty minutes should have your clothes dried). They do sell soap, not sure how much as we packed ours. Overall, Las Ramblas is a great place to visit, and lots of nice little plazas off the main road, that offer great deals on food. Regarding the hotel, it served a basic function but as a single parent, I would not stay here again, given the in room safe issue, as well as the outside environment, regarding the sex workers.

Well there was nothing superior about it, the room smelt, the bathroom was horrendous you could only get either boiling hot water or freezing cold, nearly all of the tiles were cracked, you couldnt take a shower without the water going everywhere as there was no shower curtain. I think we had the water cylinder in our room for all the rooms on the floor as all you could hear all night was the cylinder dripping, the aircon unit was broke and would turn itself on and off whenever it pleased!

I knew I wanted to stay in or near La Rambla but didn't have much money to spend as I was waiting for a response after claiming the money back that I'd lost with the previous booking company for a stay at another hotel in the city. I found Hotel Arc La Rambla online and the usual mix of \"Fantastic!\"/\"Awful\" reviews but decided to give it a go anyway, my decision based solely on the reasonable price quoted for a 5 night stay. Arriival? Excellent. Friendly staff and a smooth quick check-in process, no wasted time for anyone keen to spend time out and about in Barcelona rather than in the reception of a hotel. Room? I booked a standard twin. Clean, comfortable beds, adequate spotless bathroom and shower. room had a safe, ample storage and a balcony opening out to a great view down on La Rambla (Was this really a standard room?!) Breakfast? I booked breakfast everyday to fill up with a reasonably priced meal first thing of the day. Breakfast room was spotless. Buffett selection included several cereals, yoghurts, rolls, sliced bread (white and wholemeal) with a toasting option, various meats, cheese, jams, honey, 5 different fruit juices, coissants, fruit patries, cakes, coffee and tea. The breakfast staff were very pleasant, helpul and discreet. There was also a generous supply of complimentary bottles of spring water in the hotel lobby for guests to pick up on their way out. When I needed directions to tourist attractions and for public transport, the reception staff gave me the answers I needed with a smile and a map. Location? It's right on La Rambla in the pavement artists' quarter, with the street entertainers section nearby. There's also bars, pavement cafes, restaurants and souvenir stalls right on the doorstep and all around with the attractive port only a short walk away. There's the Place Reial (a large popular 'eating and drinking square') only a very short distance away as is the nearest underground station that links you to all the famous attractions that are not within easy walking distance. The popular beach is about 2 miles away by foot past the marina and craft markets on the way (a regular bus is available if you don't fanct walkng) At night? La Rambla is a 24 hour buzzing street but we had no problem sleeping without ear plugs(my daughter's a light sleeper). There's a peep show 3 doors from the hotel lit up like Disneyland at night but you wouldn't know it from the hotel. There's 2 or 3 African hookers hanging around outside (not right outside the hotel) but a poilte 'no' acts like a puff of insect repellant and amongst the lights and vibrant atmosphere of La Rambla, they're not as seedy an addition to the mix as some might like to think they are. General - Barcelona is a fascinating city blending the old magnificence of the gothic palaces and religious sites with the archtecture of Gaudi, the buzz of a 21st century port, marina, and there's curio shops, souvenir and clothing boutiques down every little narrow street (there's hundreds to choose from). The La Rambla indoor fruit/veg/fish/meat market is visibly stunning in itself and well worth a visit. there's street music everywhere and be sure to watch the entertainment when the police appear anywhere near the activity of the african street-peddlars. There's african peddlars everywhere you look with their merchandise (fake designers gear of every description) laid out on sheets on the ground with cords attatched so that they can be gathered up and removed in a split second. When the police arrive (and there's plenty of them all over the city), just watch the peddlars scatters in every direction, disappearing in a puff of smoke. It's the same on the beach where the sound of the crashing of the waves competes with the calls of the plentiful beach-sellers peddling beer, coconut slices, beach silks, sunglasses, massages and henna tattoos. One sniff of the poices and they run off in a wave, squawking and flapping down the beach like a flock of panicked overweight seagulls.

It was a good size with a balcony. The room had nice decor and was light because of the two large windows. A safe is provided in the wardrobe. The bed was rock hard and the pillows were not what you could describe as plump! Bathroom The bathroom was clean and had a good, powerful shower. The towels were slightly thin but perfectly acceptable. Noise We experienced a little bit of noise on thefirst night but none thereafter. The noise came from groups of drunken English speaking men on the street. Drunken Brits abroad - Spaniards must love us. Breakfast You can pay 10 Euros to have a set breakfast in the hotel. This consists of bacon, eggs, toast, orange juice and tea/coffee. However the breakfast room is also a cafe which is open to the public so you can actually have what you want. There are a lot of places to eat on La Rambla anyway. Safety The hotel is perfectly clean, safe and secure. There is a sex shop a couple of doors down and 'ladies of the night' do congregate around there but the position of this shop is further down La Rambla than you would probably would be walking down so you would probably not need to walk past it at night. It is no worse than Soho in London. Location of the hotel It is right on La Rambla towards the bottom end. This is right in the heart of the most touristy area. Think Leicester Square in London. Yes it is busy and yes there are street performers lining each side of the street. However it is easy to get from the hotel to most of the places of interest and the closest metro station to the hotel is about a 2 minute walk away. Overall for a 2* hotel I found this one above average. It is clean, safe, with pleasant staff and is in a very central location.

My family and I checked into the hotel in March for a few nights. We were told upon checking in that we should leave our key at the front desk whenever we left the hotel. They said this measure was to prevent us from losing it while out, but I soon realized it was their way of determining whether or not you were in your room. As soon as we checked in, we headed out for a quick lunch. An hour later, we returned to find our $2000 brand new laptop had been stolen right out of our locked room! The laptop bag also contained many other valuable items, none of which would fit in the safe. We made the wrong assumption that it was safe to leave items in our hotel room. We immediately informed the staff. A young guy who worked at the front desk had a knowing smirk on his face the entire time, which lead us to believe that he was involved. When we checked in we walked up to our room and there was NO ONE anywhere around....so who else could have known we had a laptop in that particular room besides the hotel staff? The manager was being completely unhelpful and simply shrugged his shoulders as if to say, \"these things happen.\" I asked him to call the police. He said there would be no point since they would not show up anyway. I told him to call anyway. Once on the line, he told the police officer not to come in Spanish. He then put me on the line and the officer, who spoke english well, told me that he was told NOT to come by the manager, but that he was going to come anyway. We spent the rest of our holiday filling out police reports and being treated like crap by the staff - they evidently did not like having a finger pointed at them by myself or the police, or decided that there was no sign of forced entry into our room, and that a key had obviously been used. The worst part of all was that there was a video camera pointed at the front door. The staff claimed that they were not able to access its contents - only the owner of the hotel could do that...and he conveniently did not live in Barcelona. I understand that we will never get the laptop back, or all of the files and pictures of holidays that we had stored on it, but to have to worry about theft in your hotel room is just unacceptable.

The only thing that really upset us was when we left, the hotel booked a taxi for us to the airport and we ended up paying \u20ac39 which was double that what we payed on the way to the hotel..all the other taxis we used also were very cheap when called from the street and quite accessable.. so we really didn't need to book..", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "Gem_84_23", "ReviewID": "UR7186198", "Content": "After reading some of the horror stories in previous reviews I was dreading my stay at the Arc La Rambla however, I could never have been more surprised. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the very friendly staff in the elegant recently refurbished reception area. On check-in we were told that the standard rooms we had booked had been upgraded to superior rooms free of charge which was an added bonus! The rooms are basic but considering the hotel is 2* you get a TV, powershower and both the room and ensuite are both immaculately clean. I could not fault it. We had a small balcony looking out onto The Ramblas which was good for watching people go by. Even though we were right on the front the double glazed windows were just enough to keep the noise to a minimum. Yes it is true... there is a sex shop next door and a peep show next to that however we did not see or hear anything that we did not want to - it was all very discreet. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Port 'Vell' if you turn right out of the hotel and a 10 minute walk to Catalunya Square if you turn left out of the hotel were you can catch the Red & Blue line sightseeing tour buses (2 day ticket costs 23 euros and takes you to the likes of the Nou Camp, Sacred Family Church, Cathedral, beach etc etc) Breakfast is available at the hotel but to be honest there is more choice and better value out and about. Also if you like a drink then venture into the square behind the Ramblas as a glass of beer on the strip ranges between 7-10 euros whereas in the adjacent streets / square a beer only cost 3 euros. I would recommend 'Mikel Etxea' (midway up the ramblas on the left)for breakfast especially if Benito is working! Check out is at 12pm however if you are flying later in the afternoon there are lockers at the rear of the ground floor of the hotel for 2 euros were you can store your suitcases (two small or one large) until your flight. Shuttle bus to and from the airport is 3.80 Euros and you are picked up and dropped off in Catalunya square however there were four of us and it only cost 30 for a taxi which drops you right outside the hotel. If you want a very very reasonable hotel right in the centre of Barcelona then you will have to part with some of the creature comforts however, I thought the hotel was superb value for money and would recommend it to travellers coming to Barcelona for a short stay.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "fylde coast", "Title": "\u201chappily surprised\u201d", "Author": "maggieFyldeCoast", "ReviewID": "UR6829260", "Content": "Before staying at the hotel i read negative reviews, i was somewhat apprehensive ..however on arriving, the reception was modern and clean, the staff polite. I was impressed with the size of the room & bathroom and again, modern & clean. Admittedly we were staying at the back of the hotel and therefore didn't hear any noise. However, I would have loved a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony......your staying in a cosmopolitain city - I would expect noise and this would be a great way to watch the city go by. I felt secure in the hotel, you could leave valuables in the hotel safe. I didn't eat in the hotel so can not comment on the food. A kettle in the room for tea/coffee would have been handy.

The entrance, smart polished marble, the reception staff I met were very helpful. The lifts worked and the room (the basic double) was clean and tidy although I have to say the bright avacado coloured bathroom suite took a bit of getting used to. It's plus and minus is it's central location. Near the bottom of the Ramblas and at the front as I was there was some noise. However double glazed double doors inside the shutters kept that down to a minimum. At the far end of reception, away from the entrance, a set of luggage lockers are provided which will fit a large suitcase for 2 euros. I think this is better than dumping the bags in a room which nobody supervises.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, well located on Rambla\u201d", "Author": "hmose", "ReviewID": "UR5833278", "Content": "Much better than expected from reading earlier reviews.
