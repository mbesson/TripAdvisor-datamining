Will Stay Again I stayed at the hotel for business purposes, considering the location of the hotel and the surrounding hotels in the area, I found the Rydges Hotel to be the most suitable hotel for my corporate stays.The hotel has a friendly and warm feel about it, the staff are always helpful and prepared to go the extra mile.I've stayed in many hotels throughout Sydney, and I believe that the entire process, from making the reservation, to check-in and check-out was a seamless and smooth process, the staff are efficient and welcoming.Considering that the only other hotels in the area are 3 star motels, I found Rydges to be stand out performer in service and quality.I will stay at Rydges again, I even joined the Priority Program that was offered to me by the staff.... they didnt pressure sell, or use hard sales tactics, they were honest and positive about the program, it even got me a 20% discount on my meal and it was free to join.I believe that you need to make a educated decision before you bad mouth the hotel, earlier reviews were not too positive about the hotel... but honestly, what are they expecting in Bankstown?? This is not the Four Seasons, and you're definately paying hundreds of dollars a night...... on top of that, you are in no position to complain if you are not even paying the tab... ... ...The area as a whole may be a little bit shady however, the hotel has taken steps to improve security for both its guests and staff.I am a very regular guest, I always enjoy my stay, the staff know my name, and are always happy to make my stay even more enjoyable.Well Done Rydges Hotel, Bankstown...

Our department uses a third party contractor to book our accommodation, so I did not personally talk to the motel itself. On arrival, we were informed that there was no booking for us, yet in my hand I had a reply email from our booking agency, with the name of the girl on reception listed on it as the person who confirmed the booking. She said she did remember the booking, and could not explain why we did not have a room. As luck would have it there was plenty of rooms so we still were able to stay, but after having seen the neighborhood, we weren't so sure we wanted to. This motel looks like an older building that has been refurbished, and not very well done either. Paint coming off the walls, mould in the bathroom and carpets were a bit shabby. Not what I was expecting from a Rydges Hotel. The fridge i =n the room was so small I could not even get another drink bottle in there for myself, so I took their stuff out. My drink froze. If you want takeaway, your in luck. I think I saw every type of fast food in the streets on the way in, but there was no way I was going to be walking the streets at night in this place. The only restaurant to speak of was the one in the motel. While the food was OK, the drinks were very expensive and even with the 15% discount they offered it was an expensive meal. And I know what you are thinking, I didn't drink that much. As I wasn't paying, this motel was OK, but if I was paying out of my own pocket, I would be bitterly disappointed as it was too expensive and I felt like a prisoner as I did not want to venture out. We ate out on the second night, but we had to drive for ages to get anywhere decent.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR853011484", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Radarz"}, {"Content": "Okay For The Location Stayed here with my significant fella as we were going to a concert at Revesby Workers Club and didn't want to drive.The website noted a deal for show goers but it didn't have one.Rooms are clean and area is Bass Hill- other reviewer mentioned the guard dog, we met him in the lobby at about 1am, have to say I was quite happy that he was there..Room Service?? 24hr room service is a choice of 3 meals one being chips (THIS IS NOT A MEAL!) The other choice is a curry - AS IF that is what you want at 1am, and the other option escapes me as the only food available was chips! with a $3.00 delivery charge on top I passed.

The approximate cost to by Taxi to Bankstown was AUD $23.00. The exterior look of the hotel is old and dated. Inside, the rooms are fully renovated and actually quite lovely; they have dream beds which are very comfortableThe location is not ideal, a Taxi driver warned us not to go out at night. The hotel security guard had a baton passed his knee and also a German Sheppard dog as part of security for the hotel. It is in the middle of suburbia with nothing around you apart from McDonalds which is located next door. Room Service was disappointing; the steak I ordered was inedible so they kindly replaced it with a safe chicken Parma which was very average. I was advised that the steak would not be charged to my room. They had a movie deal, which included Breakfast, movies and munchies. The munchies consisted of microwave popcorn, sounds great except for the fact that the room does not have a microwave! Customer Service at Check in/out was also disappointing, I had to get my hotel bill corrected three times before I could pay for it. That Steak did appear on the bill. I would suggest staying at a hotel in a better location.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR406310731", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "pinan"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d287097-r21306774-Rydges_Bankstown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "287097", "Price": "$159"}}
