{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean and adequate This review's for the Main building 100m away from the newer Annex building. We stayed at this hotel because it's rate was reasonable and it's near Ginza. It's not exactly at the main Ginza shopping district and it's pretty far from Shibuya and Shinjuku but Tsukiji subway station about 10mins' walk away will get you everywhere. The room was small but clean which was most important for us. Amenities included TV, mini-fridge, hot pot but no internet access. There're 2 in-house restaurants which we didn't try. I'd recommend it for singles/couples/friends but not for family with kids mainly because the room's small.

I didn't use subway to get to Ginza, I was walking. Single rooms are very small. I coudn't open fully my lagguage on the floor. I had to do it on the bed. I couldn't also fully open the window, because of protection screen outside. That's why I had not to much sunlight inside. The whole bathroom is a just container placed inside of the room, what is tipical in Japan. Internet is available in lobby, but very expensive. The cheaper was in Internet caffe in Ginza. Take better your laptop with you, because they don't borrow laptops in the hotel and internet access is for free almost everywhere. If you have time to take 1 day or more trips, I recomend you Sunrise Tours agency. They have a pick up service from this hotel. At 8.00 they will come for you to the hotel and at the evening will drop ypu off in the Ginza, 10 minutes from the hotel. This hotel is very good for changing clothes,taking shower and sleeping. I stayed overthere 7 nights and took 5 1-day trips, so I had no need to stay in my room for long time. Many Japanese guests stayed in this hotel. Hotel staff speaks English so so-depends on person. They charge guests for: outside calls, calls for taxi etc.", "Date": "May 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR707633520", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "D0ominika"}, {"Content": "perfect location I booked this hotel directly through their website (both english and japanese, unusual for japanese hotel). You can see the rate per day at both this hotel (annex) and the main Ginza Capital Hotel.The room at the annex is slightly larger than the main. Do not expect a western type of room in term of space. In Japan business hotels (like the Ginza Capital Annex) have standard rooms, with prefabricated bathrooms and very little space. However the ambience is comfortable if you manage to accept that in Japan there is little space. The rooms are clean and the price / quality ration is very good, mainly for the location.In fact, I would choose again this hotel for his location. Unless you want to explore West Tokyo and look for accomodation near Shinjuku or Shibuya, this is one of the best locations you can have in central Tokyo. You are within walking distance from Ginza (10 min walk to the west). You are 5/10 min from Tsukiji fish market. The area is full of sushi and fish restaurants. And, most importantly, you have two lines of underground. Just in front of the hotel you have the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho line, connecting easily to other lines. And 2 min walking left, the Tokyo Metro Hibiya line. 10 min and you have the Oedo line. You connect easily with the JR lines (Yamanote) changing from the Yurakucho. I have found that when staying at this hotel I used a lot Tokyo metro lines and went everywhere with maximum one interchange.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR426472102", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Meteoman"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value, Excellent Location I stayed at Ginza Capital in March. I followed some of the advice I had read on-line and stayed at the Annex. It was affordable, clean and well located in Ginza near the Kabuki-Za that I was keenly interested in attending. I took the airport bus to the Marriott and Ginza Capital was a short taxi ride away. Checking in was easy and fast. The room was clean and compact. Don't expect a huge room but it has everything you need. The breakfast was excellent and included in the room rate. I paid about $100 Canadian per night. The only think to watch out for is be sure to arrive on the right day. I was delayed and arrived the morning after the first night for which I was booked. The hotel wouldn't let me use the voucher for another night. They did offer me a discount if I wanted to stay an extra night.The staff was very helpful and provided maps and directions to help me get around, find everything from a bank to shopping.If you are looking for something affordable and functional but still comfortable, look no further than Ginza Capital - Annex.", "Date": "May 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR610395063", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "executiveoasis"}, {"Content": "Mediocre, mejor buscar otro   showReview(20280727, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR216694672", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JLCastellano"}, {"Content": "Mittelklasse Hotel in Tokyo   showReview(19953524, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR471229236", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Kleriker"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u64b1\u5062\u9289\u5d83\u5063\u9289\u70aa\u5142\u9288\u20ac\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19169650, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392961636", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "carino, essenziale   showReview(11488467, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR476610904", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "torquemada1269"}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel simple et abordable   showReview(7753904, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR964686967", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "miaParis"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d655294-r18238943-Ginza_Capital_Hotel_Annex-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "655294", "Price": "$155"}}
