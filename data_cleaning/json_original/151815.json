You can tell it is an older hotel but they have kept it up pretty well. The a/c works well, they have cable and a fridge in the room. Our tub was a bit funky as it had been redone and was sort of unstable but we were traveling with a toddler so we were happy to have the tub. The outside of this hotel is beautiful and the hotel itself is amazing - the lobby is charming, the pool is great ( a bit cold on a windy day), the areas next to the elevator are so charming - they a have chairs and tables in wonderful spots to just relax and read. The rooftop breakfast area is fantastic with flowers and quite a view. Breakfast consists of juice, coffee and cereal and bread. They have parking right next door.

My room was on the third floor which afforded partial views of the Cathedral, the historic firehouse, the La Perla theater, El Vig\u00c3\u00ada and Serrall\u00c3\u00a9s Castle. Dining and nightlife options are around the square, and nearby as well, most notably just steps away on Mayor @ Cristina. The hotel's parking fills up at night and closes so if you go out in your car and arrive late you'll most likely have to park on the street but it's relatively safe since Plaza Las Delicias and its environs usually have plenty of car and pedestrian traffic.

Not super clean, but no bugs or anything that you would notice if you aren't super picky like I am. The bathroom was tiny with old fixtures and limited hot water. I would not recommend for a young crowd however as this hotel appeals to a quiet, seemingly older crowd . The elevator is extremely small also. The pool area looked nice, but we didn't use it as it was pouring rain the entire time. There was a basic continental breakfast on the rooftop that would have been very nice if it had not been raining.

After we walked to both of them and realized they were closed we also realized that we probably shouldn't be walking the streets at night.

Overall, in the hindsight, having travelled in Europe, i would bypass Ponce all together due to it being way too rundown for my tastes or possibly avoid staying there overnight - the city's colonial architecture, art museum and Parca de Bombas are nice to see, but i did not feel they warrant spending the night in what seems to be a city with no decent hotels.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "nneico", "ReviewID": "UR17631218", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one night in a room on the second floor.

If you arrive on a Monday night, as we did, give things a chance - the city was quite deserted and it was tough to find a restaurant that was open. I thought \"What the heck was I doing, booking a hotel for two nights here?\" The next morning, though, the city square was filled with school groups, vendors, and people hanging out in the park, and much more vibrant. Be sure to walk around and see the different styles of architecture! And be sure to buy your Alto Grande coffee here as opposed to San Juan ($9.59 vs. $14).

Hotel clearly spent most of their money on an impressive lobby. The rest of the hotel is pretty \"dated\", especially the rooms themselves. I liked the outdoor corridors that lead to the rooms. They have a nice feel. But the rooms themselves felt a bit \"old\"... sorta \"dirty\", even if technically clean, if ya know what I mean. The included breakfast is really nothing to speak of. A few dried cereals to choose from with milk, coffee, something tasting like imitation orange juice, and some assorted pastry... nothing of any quality. They also offer some doughy sliced bread (think Wonder Bread) for toasting in the toaster. Overall, the breakfast was rather depressing as they really didn't seem to care to put any effort into it. The hotel restaurant, Mark's, was pretty nice, again, considering this is a pretty small town. The food quality was very good. We didn't really look into other hotel options for Ponce, but I guess I'd say this place is \"ok\".", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cMelia preferred in Ponce\u201d", "Author": "farkels", "ReviewID": "UR7153758", "Content": "My wife and I spent two days at the Hotel Melia and enjoyed it very much.

Included in the price of the room is a continental breakfast which is small, but I wouldn't expect much more for free. A couple cleanliness issues though: Two times, on different days, I found women's hairs in our bathroom towels, which is just gross. Also there was a small ant problem in the bathroom. Lastly, one night I was in the shower, and I saw something fall from the nozzle area, and I looked down to see an inch-long roach near my feet, trying desperately not to drown. Kinda gross. About the area: Ponce gets really dead at night. We had to really hunt to find good restaurants at night. We found an Argentinian restaurant not far from the hotel which was good. In downtown Ponce, the police are EVERYWHERE. It was crazy. Our Continental flight came in at 4:30am and we rented a car. A cop pulled us over as we drove through town, just to find out what we were doing on the streets. Well, we were looking for our hotel! He then told us to turn the car around and gave us an escort there, which was nice, but still, a bit daunting. Cool stuff to see in the area: Tibes archeological site, Camuy park, Arecibo radio telescope, caves near Arecibo, Cabo Rojo lighthouse (beautiful views, cliffs). To avoid, in my opinion: La Parguera bioluminescent bay- it's a scam! In the photos they make it look like it just glows and they take you on a boat ride and then 5-10 people (employees) jump off the boat and as they move their arms around in the water, you're supposed to ooh and ahh because the water is slightly blue.

My one hotel pet peeve is bathrooms. I know it's an old building and big bathrooms are a hassle to clean. At a quick glance, our bathroom seemed clean, but once you took a closer look it was just poorly tended. During our 3 night stay, the tub had hair and soap/dirt film (we always showered standing on a hand towel), the sink had traces of the previous guest's toothpaste and toiletries looked re-packaged. We did get clean towels and we should have probably requested that the bathroom be cleaned, but we were on a tight schedule and didn't stop to think about this. If you suffer from dust allergies, try to avoid this hotel. In addition to being an old building, it is also located in the heart of a traffic congested area--which otherwise, also makes it a great location tourist-wise.
