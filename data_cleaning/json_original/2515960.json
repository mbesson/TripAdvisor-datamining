Cocktail hour and the complimentary breakfast on the top floor were lovely, and the top floor also has wonderful views of downtown San Francisco. The breakfast buffet had a great selection of breakfast foods. The hotel has free wifi, which I really appreciated! The fitness center is great, with many cardio machines plus an entire room of weights and spacious locker/shower rooms. I did not use room service, nor did I use the concierge service, so I cannot comment on those things. A problem I have with TripAdvisor's rating system is that there is no way to distinguish a five-star hotel from a five-star, excellent experience. This hotel is not a five-star hotel--it's probably more of a 4 star hotel, but I had a truly excellent experience.

By showing my husband's military ID when we checked in, our rate was reduced from $199 per night to $80 per night. What a great value! This price included our room which was adequately sized (by downtown San Francisco standards) and a buffet breakfast each morning on the 12th floor with a great view of downtown SF. For $27 a night, we parked our car in a garage which was about 50 yards up the street. Again, this was a great value, as most hotels in the surrounding area charged upwards of $50 per night to park a car. Our room included bathrobes, two double beds, an alarm clock, a coffee maker, a small fridge, and a hairdryer in the bathroom. The room did not have a DVD player and the pay-per-view movies were incredibly expensive, which was sort of a bummer for my sons. Also, our window looked directly out to a brick wall of the hotel next door. Some of the interior of the hotel was a little dated, and the nightly happy hour was always too crowded for us to attend. At $80 a night, I can't really call any of these things \"complaints\" because it's easy to overlook minor issues when you're getting such a deal. Had we paid the full rate, I would have wanted a nicer view and expected some nicer finishes here and there in our room and the common areas of the hotel. The only major reservation I have about recommending this hotel to people is that it wasn't the most comfortable place to stay with small children. My kids are pretty well behaved, and we travel with them a lot, but I still found myself \"shushing\" them and telling them to be quiet, sit up straight; etc. The hotel is frequented largely by retired military, and there weren't a whole lot of families there. This made the atmosphere feel a little stuffy. As a matter of fact, one morning, the breakfast buffet was especially crowded, and after we finished eating and got back on the elevator, one lady in the elevator remarked to another that the buffet was too crowded because \"there were a lot of families in the hotel right now\". I kept my mouth shut, but I actually thought it was the older folks up there drinking their coffees and reading newspapers that slowed things down. If you've ever eaten at a restaurant with small kids, you know that families usually eat and leave, and don't dawdle at the table. Plus, there were really only 3 or 4 small families of 4 in the dining room (including ours) during the time that we were there for breakfast. Her comment let me know that even a small amount of smaller sized families was an anomaly for the MMC hotel. Bearing that in mind, we will definitely go back to MMC again. The location was so great (we walked to Union Square to go ice skating) that you end up not spending a lot of time in the hotel, so even though it wasn't the most kid-friendly hotel, we still enjoyed our stay and will be back.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat military benefit!\u201d", "Author": "debedmtzIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR122241184", "Content": "Great hotel in the heart of San Francisco.

There was a big selection of fruit, bagels, breads, french toast, potatoes, oatmeal, cereals, and much more. The only selection that I didn't care for too much was the scrambled eggs.

The desk clerk was more-than-accomodating by letting us check in early, then issuing us keys to both our reserved standard room and to a suite so we could look at them before deciding whether to upgrade. Exploring the hotel was half of our memories from the trip! Meeting other guests at the happy hour was true fun and exploring the hotel / museum / library / memorial wall was awe-inspiring. Yes, the decor is a bit old style, but that only helps to outline that you are in a place celebrating history; kinda adds to the charm. When we opened our suite door, I felt like I was stepping into Nixon's living room (so the furnishings are a bit 70's ish, but it is gilted 70's.) We usually try to avoid \"cookie cutter\" hotels when we travel, and this one breaks the mold! Breakfast each morning is a great perk, too and the hours are long enough that you can still catch breakfast even after recovering from the generous happy hour the night before! Also, there is a piano player at happy hour - very nice touch! Hopefully you'll get Patty as your bartender at happy hour because she is fantastic, helpful, and a joy to hang out with for a couple hours! As others have mentioned, the view is phenominal from the restaurant / bar. We ate at Leathernecks one night and it was a great meal and a romantic time.

At first I didn't know what to expect from a military hotel and we (with wife and kid) were all pleasantly surprised. As soon as we walked in the lobby, the security staff (Troy, big, tall guy -- made my wife feel secure right away) welcomed us to the club, didn't leave out our 3 year old by talking to him, asking him about his toy cars, very friendly. The front desk manager checked us in and made sure we knew about the free full buffet breakfast (not just a continental breakfast) and happy hour that came with our room rate, free gym, \"free internet\" (big plus for my family, even for my 3 year old); manager also mentioned the special discount for the Rat Pack show playing in their theatre; (they have a theatre in the hotel). We had dinner at the Club Steakhouse on the top floor (great view of the city), I had the Ribeye Steak and my wife had the Prime Rib, must say, it mimicked the quality (not the price) of Peter Luger's Steak House! Even my son's baked mac n cheese was superb. My wife asked for the recipe and the staff happily obliged (the next day a copy of the recipe printed on the club's magazine was delivered to our room). Needless to say the service was incredible! The manager came by a couple of times to make sure we're enjoying ourselves, our server was very attentive, filling up our wine and water glasses. The hotel's really nice. Our room had 2 queen beds, the room has a/c, nice new furniture and the fridge is stocked with free bottled water (free bottled water! if you travel as much as i do, you know it's a plus not to pay $4 for a bottle of water). They have a beautiful library and a memorial wall of soldiers who died in the recent war (this area of the hotel is really something else). I attended my conference the next 3 days and for what I paid to attend the conference, the food provided exceeded my expectations and any other conference I have attended to date. For breakfast the conference package served smoked salmon, bagels, cheese spreads, assortments of pastries, muffins, yogurts, different fruit juices and more. For lunch, the hotel served a Mexican themed buffet the first day because of Cinco de Mayo (i thought that was very creative); we had a buffet of chocolate cookies, brownies, truffles, frappuccinos, sodas and coffee for afternoon break (i believe to keep us awake the rest of the conference); we had more food, buffets of appetizers at the networking reception after the first day of conference, the hotel served us sangria, beer, wine... (it's unbelievable), and that's just the first day. The next 2 days did not disappoint. The meeting rooms are very nice, good room temperature, really high ceilings and very unique decor, not like the many beige wall meeting rooms I've seen over the years. My wife and son were also well taken care of by the staff at breakfast and were recommended several things to do around the city during the day while I was in meeting all day. My son enjoyed the visit to Ghirardelli ice cream and chocolate shop, visit to the Academy of Sciences. My wife enjoyed shopping at Union Square (just 2 blocks from the hotel). I also managed to catch an 8pm show of the Sandy Hackett's Rat Pack (Buddy Hackett's son, funny guy) with a few colleagues and had a great time! I highly recommend this show. The cast did meet and greet after the show. It was over all a very packed 4-day trip, the conference could not have gone better, great food, great hotel, the staff, outstanding!

Just a block or so from Union Square and 1 block from the cable cars (which I don't recommend to use as your regular transportation in the city, they are a pain in the rear).
