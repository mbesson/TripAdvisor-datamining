The staff that we encountered were at all times very helpfull and available,Having read other reviews we asked for and got a high floor room overlooking the front, we were not dissapointed, Our room was on the small side, very clean and well presented, beautifull linen. The bathroom area was tightish but very well equipped and everything worked as it should. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room - dissapointed, TV seemed to be mostly pay-for , very few English speaking channels (4 to be precise, all news).Some of the woodwork around the windows could do with some small repair work, but nothing to write home about.Did not need the A/C but it worked fine. When windows closed at night no city sounds to be heard- good nights sleep. Breakfast was served in very nice surroundings,all you could want for, but I have to say, having stayed at a lot of 4/5 star hotels it was on the expensive side. Have read reviews that people found the lfts not to be good, they were slightly on the small side but clean and worked very well. The overall impression that the hotel gives is very good and well worth its starring. Travel time from airport Leo Da Vinci to hotel was about 35-40 mins, Rome has good private taxi service, expect to pay about 80 euro for the round trip (Merc E class).

We were underwhelmed (indeed somewhat disappointed) upon seeing our room. It was clean, modern and high ceiled but certainly \"compact\" and looked out over an interior well facing into other rooms opposite. Wooden floors which are no doubt cool in summer but seemed rather hard underfoot in the middle of winter! The bathroom was very compact - just about large enough to fit everything in - with hardly any room to emerge from the shower (over the bath) between the edge of the shower door and the edge of the basin! Hand held shower (which I prefer) Towels were good quality and fluffy with robes provided - and there were a few bathroom goodies as well Nice quality linen on the bed - and a pillow menu Room had kettle (but only 1 mug - 2 Tea bags, 2 coffees and no biscuits) - iron and ironing boad and trouser press. Mini bar rather uninteresting - and no water supplied. TV had English sports channels - but we were unable to find an English news channel (although our friends seemed to have one) Bedroom lighting not as bright as we would have liked Room was very stuffy overnight so we turned on the a/c which was rather noisy - and ineffective (despite it being February!) All the staff we encountered were delightful - although we were rather surprised to find there were several staff in the roof top restaurant who spoke very little English and we had considerable difficulty in ordering our drinks! The gin and tonics arrived with \"full strength\" rather than slimline tonic - and when the rest of our group arrived, it proved impossible to order a Southern comfort (we gave up on this one!) and the (2 rather than 3) Ameretto and cokes arrived with \"full strength\" as opposed to diet coke. We didn't complain as we were amused rather than anything else - but the English lady sitting on the adjacent table was clearly extremely angry at having to wait so long for her order of a glass of wine and she took herself downstairs to the bar, carrying it upstairs herself! The restaurant itself is super - no doubt great ambience and views in the summer (although inevitably not quite so great in February with the roof on and sides down) and I'm sure we'll be back. Service was quite slow - although once again we didn't mind as we weren't in a rush - and plenty of bread was served. And the food was worth waiting for.

We were smack dab in the middle of Rome and we walked everywhere, except to the Colosseum. The Pantheon is right in front of this hotel and tons of restaurants are right there in the square with lots of live entertainment; loads of good Italian food and of course Gelato ice cream! We stayed in 2 luxurious rooms. One extremely large and the other was very spacious. I am not sure of the exact dimentions. When I saw some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor I am guessing those people stayed in small rooms. I did take a look at some smaller rooms while we were there. One of our rooms had a sofa bed so our kids all slept in \"our\" room and the extra room down the hall pretty much went to waste. So about the hotel.... sometimes I like to break it down to the good; the bad and the ugly. Away we go! The good This is hands down the best location, and I am pretty sure the best hotel in this location. The rooms are nicely decorated The bedrooms are spacious We had music below our window everynight from the locals. Everything from beautiful singing, accordion playing, guitar playing and more. If we closed our windows it was pretty quiet, but we loved keeping them open. The room had nice furniture and great amenities. Of course we had robes, slippers, and nice European toiletries and soaps. The baths were very spacious and the towels were bath sheets. The bedroom that didn't occupy our family I preferred to shower in as there was a large window that opened up and you could hear the locals below. It was kinda dreamy. Many times on our visit we felt that it was dream like. So wonderful! Overall the staff was polite and helpful with a few exceptions. The hotel welcomed us with treats for all of us. The bad The Internet connection was by wire not wireless and it was down while we stayed there. We had hoped for connecting rooms but unfortunately the only connecting rooms were small. However the rooms they put us in were very large! A big thank you for that. The pillows and bed could have been more comfy. The bed was large and the linens soft but the matress itself wasn't that comfortable and the pillows were not soft enough for me. The Ugly When we were checking out, we were paying our final bill. The rooms were prepaid so only an airport transfer was left to pay; however the desk person insisted we owed additional taxes on our stay. We had paid over $400 in taxes for 4 nights on-line in advance and our receipt showed we had paid in full so I argued they must be confused and why was this so called tax never mentioned to me at check in when I confirmed all was prepaid and my credit card was put down only for incidentals such as mini bar or room service etc. Anyway after threatening to fish my receipt out of my packed luggage in the car waiting to take my family to the airport the receptionist \"waived\" the fee or as he called it \"the tax\". If there truly was an additional tax why wouldn't they include it in the original price of taxes and fees or at least tell you in someway upfront that you have additional money to pay but at the last second as you are rushing out the door? That is just wrong and tacky. All in all this hotel is great. It is closer to 5 stars then 4 but because of the ugliness at the end; I am giving it a 4. Five star hotels don't do that stuff. I would definitely stay at this hotel again though. I loved it. Please let me know if this review was helpful by checking that little box.

If they don\u2019t want such high standards to be judged against, they should not present themselves as a 5 star hotel. I\u2019ll present the pros and cons so that you can decide if this is right for you, based on what is important to your trip. Pros: Location! You cannot get more in the middle of everything. 10 minute walk to just about every site except the Pantheon which is literally meters away; even the usually out of the way Vatican was a pleasant 20 minute walk. Safe, lots of restaurants and smart shops around (including internet cafes, travel agents who book train tickets, etc). Luxury amenities in the room like fancy soaps, robes, etc. Fair sized room for a city hotel, especially the nicely sized bathroom with full tub (and we were in the smallest room they have). The girls at the check in desk are cute and helpful. They seem to know just about every language between them, so everyone feels at home. Cons: The room itself was just so so on the furnishing and upkeep. For example, there was terrible scratching where the luggage rack is, right in the main visible corner of the room (see pictures). Clearly multiple scratches over many occasions and the hotel just did not care about that level of detail to fix it. Gives the room a 1 star motel feel for sure. The furnishing and bedding were totally on par with Holiday Inn Express (which if you have gone to you know is actually a nice sub-chain of Holiday Inn, but not 5 star). There is no pool or similar area. The front of the hotel is in line with everything else in the area \u2013 nothing special at all, and the well lit internet pictures do not give an accurate representation. Don\u2019t expect it to look any different from any other hotel. Lobby was nice but nowhere near 5 stars. Their photographer was again good with the lighting and angles. They want money for every little thing- there is nothing that is high (included) service. When we got there before the room was ready, they stored our one bag and scowled when we carried it to the room (tip free) ourselves. Other hotels of this caliber have put my bags in the room when it was ready and certainly don\u2019t troll for tips. Internet/TV entertainment is a crazy E23 for the full package per day. Not that you are inside a lot when you are in beautiful Rome, but it would have been nice to have something to keep me occupied through that initial jet lag (and to check plane arrangements, etc). Basic breakfast is E35 per person. Again, there are sooo many great places to eat around there, no reason to eat in the hotel, but sometimes if you have an early tour it is nice to have the option of eating in the hotel without mortgaging your home. Overall not worth the price (even half price that I got on Priceline), and although I was not unhappy with my stay (simply neutral), I would not stay there again \u2013 too many other places to try in the same area.

Fantastic location, totally central, walk to most of the major sites on all sides very quickly. My opinion is that it's the location and charming surroundings makes this a 5 star. The hotel is just behind the Pantheon (which you really should make certain you go back twice to see thoroughly), it is a fantastic site to have just outside your hotel door, even if just to sit in the piazza and decompress at night with a beer or wine and ponder your adventures, while admiring the almost 2000 year old temple! The hotel shares it's own little Piazza della Minerva with the Basilica di Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The piazza itself has a famous Gian Lorenzo Bernini elephant sculpture, The Pulcino della Minerva, and, get this... the sculpture is a base supporting one of only eleven Egyptian obelisks brought to Rome back in the day, this one was made around 2500 years ago. Did I mention, all this just outside your door! I was looking at some other central hotels, none of which would have had the charm of having these surroundings, it really made the trip just that more memorable. The hotel building itself very nice building, and nicely lit up a night, beautiful lobby, just like the pictures. Our room had a courtyard view with some distant landmarks visible along with the nearby rooftops, some rooms have a view of the piazza and partial Pantheon view, although like I said, it's all right outside your door anyway. The bathrooms were marble or granite, built in hair dryer, the room was cleaned daily, and the bed turned down with complimentary chocolates. The windows open fully for fresh air. The air conditioning worked. The room was quite. The bed was huge, there were a few nice armchairs, table, desk, night stand, luggage rack, large closet, fridge, and mini bar, and TV if you so desired to pay the extra fees. The room itself could use a good paint job. For the room rates my only wish would be at least some free Internet WI-FI in the rooms. Rooftop patio has a minimum charge so I decided to skip it, and just had a few panini sandwiches and beverages nearby and sat in front of the Pantheon like I said, there's no way any rooftop patio could be better. Forgetaboutit. I didn't have much daily interaction with the staff, they seemed helpful when I checked-in, helped with bags, showed my the room, answering a few questions, and I know they helped several times to resolve a bit of confusion on my travel agents part, even before I arrived. I would recommend Grand Hotel De La Minerve. Quick Tips: - Pre-arrange for a ride to the airport at the end of your trip. - Buy your Vatican tickets on-line before you go. - Buy your Borghese Gallery admission on-line before you go. - Buy tickets to the Roman Forum first thing in the morning which include Palantine Hill and the Colosseum which you enter when your ready later in the day. - Research what you really want to see in each of the museums before you go, there's tons of stuff. - Bring a backpack and load up with some beverages to keep hydrated, buy them at one of the grocery stores for better prices. - Stay for longer than a week. - Navigating street by street could get tedious, but if your like me you need to know exactly where you are at all times, look at getting an IPhone with a travel data plan, or use the IPhone App \"Rome MTrip\" to plan your routes. - Bring comfortable shoes and some first aid. - Check out [-] for some cool travel items.

Our room was a corner room which afforded great views in multiple directions. The room was large by European standards, and was comfortable. The bathroom was floor to ceiling marble and huge! The hotel staff was very courteous - no complaints. Our reservation came with 2 included breakfast buffets each morning. This breakfast buffet far exceeded our expectations, and we still talk about it to this day. This would be worth paying extra for if it wasn't included in the room rate. Every day they had fresh fruit as well as fruits in syrup, scrambled eggs, the most amazing bacon I've ever had, breads, cheeses, sliced meats, pastries, cereals, and several types of juices. It sounds typical, but was much better than typical. The hotel offers free internet, but is only wired only (no WiFi) which was a tad annoying. They have free computers off the lobby for use, but during our stay they were remodeling and those were unavailable. We used the third option of using the Internet on the TV which was for a fee, but presumably due to the construction and unavailability of the public computers we were not charged for this use. As mentioned above, they were doing remodeling throughout the hotel during our stay, which I'm certain is completed by now.

That's no excuse to allow a property to fall apart and the team at the Minerve are working diligently to keep their hotel up to a 5 star experience. My criticisms of the Minerve are limited to some stains on carpets in hallways and very few 'scuffs' on the walls from what appears to be luggage damage. Other than that the service, quality of the rooms and amenities are definitely Italian 5 Star. The rooftop terrace is seasonal and that's why we visit Rome during the best season from April to October with our great cities tour. Their breakfasts are great, too.

The teenagers got a large room with a balcony, facing a peaceful inner courtyard. We upgraded to a suite so as to not be outdone, giving us a very spacious living area. The spectacular lobby, common rooms and decor contributed to an oasis-like ambience which made it easier to brave this busy city and the crowds at the coloseum, forum, etc. all of which are within walking distance.

We did try several nearby restaurants, of which our favorite was the trattoria-like Ristorante Der Pallaro where, to quote their non-menu, \"what we serve is what you eat\". The concierge staff went out of their way for us on several occasions, most notably when I asked them to get tickets to the sold-out La Taviata at the opera house.

It is a gorgeous hotel, and also very conveniently located. The service we received was very good. The concierges, in particular, were very helpful. We loved the rooftop terrace. We had drinks there every night before going out to dinner, and it was definitely one of the highlights of our stay. The location was great. Our eight year old son was very upset that breakfast was not included with our room. We tried it one morning, but I frankly felt that it was too expensive for what it was, given that there were plenty of cafes in the Piazza della Rotunda that offered perfectly fine deals on breakfast. He was not pleased. Another problem was that there was scaffolding on one side of the building. They did upgrade us, from the deluxe double room we had booked with expedia, to a junior suite with one window overlooking the Piazza della Minerva. However, my son's pull-out room was still totally dark because of the scaffolding on that side of the building. He did not want to have to stay there again on our last night in Italy, after our visit to Capri. So I cancelled our reservation, and instead booked us into a junior suite at the Duke Hotel for that one night. Expedia was offering a terrific rate. Location was no longer an issue, as we were flying out the next morning. (We had a lovely experience at the Duke Hotel. The room was light and very comfortable, and the buffet breakfast was one of the best we had on our entire trip to Italy. We felt very well taken care of there. My son loved it.) We plan to return to Rome next summer. If the scaffolding is down, which one assumes it will be by then, we will maybe again stay at the Grand Hotel de la Minerve. My husband loved it there. He is an architect and was extremely impressed by the physical beauty of this historic building, which has been a hotel since the 19th Century. He was particularly awed by the ceiling heights in our two small rooms. (I may also check out rates on the Albergo del Senato, however, in order to satisfy my son's request for an included breakfast. He loves buffets. My husband does not wish to return to the Duke Hotel because of the location.)

We stayed for 6 nights, in room 459. Our travel party consisted of me, my wife, our 5 year old, and 11 month old. Hotel: Location, Location, Location. We visited Rome for the first time, so we were unsure as to the distance between the sites. We picked this hotel primarily because of its location, and for the size of the room that we could book. The location is incredible. As mentioned before, the hotel sits about 50 yards from the Pantheon, on a relatively quiet piazza. We were able to see much of \u201ctourist\u201d Rome without ever taking a taxi. From the Bourghese Park above Spanish Steps, down past the Collesium and across the river to the Vatican and Trastevere, we walked everywhere. The hotel map was more than sufficient to navigate everything. The actual room was about what we thought it would be. It was a \u201cking\u201d bed \u2013 two beds really just pushed together \u2013 along with a sitting room with a pull-out queen bed. Mornings were fabulous out on the deck \u2013 we had a deck with a table, 4 chairs, and two chaise lounges. Not many of the rooms had this feature, but it was worth it! The bathroom was OK, but they use shower curtains instead of glass doors. Bathroom was of adequate size. Did not watch TV (although there were 2 flat screens) or use the mini bar or room service\u2026We did eat at the $30 euro buffet several times \u2013 it\u2019s not easy getting two small kids out to eat early; for us the convenience was worth it. Also, the hostess never charged us for our kids, so it really wasn\u2019t that bad\u2026 Service was good. Restaurant service was good, and pleasant. Lots of interaction with the kids. Concierge was also good, and did a decent job of recommending restaurants (more on that later). They took care of the \u201clittle\u201d things, like weather reports, having the hotel umbrellas ready, etc. Is the property a little worn? Certainly. However, it looked in better shape than most others that we looked at while there. Quite frankly, there wasn\u2019t much in Rome that wasn\u2019t a little worn (more on that later too). Would we stay there again? If we had to stay in the center of Rome, we would. The central location is that important to us. However, if we return to Rome, we might try to stay further away from Rome\u2019s center, to avoid some of the more \u201ctouristy\u201d things going on\u2026 The City: Sorry Rome. The first thing that comes to mind is filthy,filthy,filthy. Rome was a giant ashtray with trash strewn about. I understand that the eternal city is old. I understand that soot and ash from cars and trucks will happen. What I don\u2019t understand is the apparent lack of pride that many Italians have in their beautiful city. Everywhere we walked, we were literally stepping over dozens of cigarette butts, old newspapers, and various food wrappers. My 5 year old kept wondering why people were throwing the trash on the street and on the parks! Tourists, I\u2019m sure, are responsible for some of this, but Rome needs to do a better job of cleaning itself up. Food:Surprisingly poor in the center of Rome. ( With the exception of gelato. That was usually good) We mistakingly were under the impression that any corner trattoria would have great food. (Previously, we took 3 trips to the UK, and had a hard time NOT finding a good meal). The center of Rome had many, many, lousy (how can Italians get pasta wrong?) restaurants, with service to match. In our first 7 meals in Rome, our order was wrong on the bill, with each restaurant trying to put things on the check that we did not have! In addition, some of my favorite tricks were 1. Seating charge. (yes, charging you to actually sit and eat) 2. Bread charge \u2013 per person.(ex. \u201cbread, 2 Euro\u201d means 2 Euro PER PERSON) 3. Charge regular price for things that are modified. (ex. \u2013 our son wanted a non-alcoholic drink at Harry\u2019s. The regular price (with alcohol) was 14.50 Euros. We ordered a non-alcoholic version, and were still charged 14.50 Euros!. We then ordered (at Harry\u2019s) a small plate (saucer size) of pasta \u2013 plain \u2013 no sauce, oil, butter \u2013 nothing \u2013 and were charged full price for a shrimp pasta special \u2013 38 Euros! Then, of course, they tried to charge us for something else that we did not order\u2026) That lunch at Harry\u2019s did us in. We decided to only walk outside the center \u2013 down to Trastevere \u2013 or get specific recommendations from the Concierge. The meals instantly got better, and we finished the trip with several excellent meals. Sites: There are too many to mention. We were not disappointed by any sites or churches. Just alot yourself (as we luckily did) a great deal of time for the Vatican museums and the Collesium. Other: We chose not to bring a stroller to Rome because we thought the streets might not be paved well for them. We were right. Go with a back carrier or a wrap.

We were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary and wanted the trip to be memorable. We spent months planning this trip and found the reviews that were posted on Trip Advisor to be very helpful. We selected the Grand Hotel de la Minerve because of its location and the reviews that we read on this site played a role in our decision. We were not disappointed in our selection. This hotel is walking distance from all the sites we wanted to see and allowed us to enjoy Rome on our own by just walking and taking in the sites and the people and their way of living. We arrived at the hotel early and the room we had requested was not ready and would not be ready for several hours. We left our luggage with the consierge and headed out for some sight seeing and lunch. You don't have to go far from the hotel to begin to experience the sites and the history of this fabulous city. The Panthenon is a block away from the hotel with its beautiful fountain and busy Piazza. Just outside the Hotel entrance is a beautiful church with a statue by Michelangelo inside. After a few hours of taking in the sights and fantastic lunch at a local trattoria we returned to the hotel to find that our room was still not ready. This was because we had requested a particular room and the people were late checking out. It was worth the wait! We requested Room 530 based on information we had read from another reviewer on this site. We were not disappointed. The room was a large suite with a great view of the Piazza de la Minerve. By any standards this was a spacious room and for what we have seen in hotels in Rome it was HUGE! This room is right next to the elevator but do not let this stop you from requesting this room. We were never bothered. My wife loved the big walk-in closet and the large bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. The only complaint we had was the mattress was hard as a rock and did not live up to the rest of the room. It was bearable only because we did so much walking during the day that we were exhausted when we got back to the room and could have slept on the floor and still fallen asleep! We cannot comment on the food at the hotel because we never ate there. You cannot go more than block or two without running into a variety of different restaurants, In addition the prices at the hotel restaurant were 10 times higher than what you could find just by walking down the street. The staff at the hotel was attentive and helpful, but this is what you should expect at a 5 star hotel. The hotel offered a breakfast buffet each morning for 30 euro each! We walked about 10 minutes away and found a great little place for a cappuccino and homemade pastry for two for 8 euro. You can also walk to the Cafe St Eustachio in the Piazza St Eustachio which has the reputation for the best expresso in all of Rome. It was OK but I don't know if I would call it the best. Overall we were very satisfied with our experience at this hotel and would return and stay there again. The location is fantastic and you pay the price for it. The service was excellent and the room fantastic. If you ask for Room 530 I do not think you will be disappointed. If you decide to stay in Rome get yourself some comfortable walking shoes, a good map and head off to experience this fantastic city and its ancient history.

The Minerve is an outstanding hotel, 5 star staff - reception desk, concierge, and bell staff all included - and I'm very picky about hotels. We booked a deluxe queen room for fear of the tiny rooms we had heard about in Europe - it was a suite! All one big room, but suite non-the-less, with king size bed (not a queen), and the entry hallway and closet provided nice insulation against elevator noise - we never heard it and we were right next to it. Windows also shut tightly and completely eliminated street noise at night - individual A/C thermostat in room, so we stayed nice and cool. The deluxe rooms are huge, with nice sized bathroom, all marble, and jacuzzi tub (which was so wonderful after all-day walking). We were in room 530, looking out over the Piazza de Minerva and had a nice view of the Pantheon. Right next door is a beautiful Catholic church (Santa Maria Sopra Minerva) with amazing art and a statue by Michaelangelo (Masses at 8am & 6pm). The rooftop restaurant, Le Cesta, is lovely with great views of the city. We opted for a package that turned out to be quite economical - deluxe room, breakfast each morning (choice of full American buffet downstairs or continental in your room), and one 3 course dinner for two at Le Cesta, for about 495 euros a night. Also a \"welcome drink\" at the lobby bar, but not your choice of drink; sparkling wine or soft drink, although they let me have an espresso instead. Package price sounds high, but not for this particular room, and breakfast would have run us 31 euros per person if we'd payed separately, plus the lovely dinner (4-5 star) we enjoyed on the rooftop would've easily cost us 300USD. Tips: Don't buy water or drinks at the little outdoor stands; there's a supermarket off the Piazza Rotunda (Via Gustnani, I think?) and the deluxe rooms have mini-friges. Long lines at the supermarket, but they move fast. There's also a wine shop with great prices on the street that runs between the hotel and the church - 31 euros for a bottle of my favorite super tuscan that costs $60 at home, and a 9 euro bottle that was also quite good. We ended up enjoying a late breakfast (buffet serves til 10:30am) and not being hungry at lunchtime, so we just kept site-seeing til dinner. You can eat a casual dinner for as little as 5 euros for pizza for two at a little Pizzeria around the corner toward the Pantheon (wonderful!). I don't recommend any of the outdoor cafes on the major piazzas close to the hotel for a nicer dinner - pricey and not great quality. But step around the corner from any of the piazzas and find authentic Italian (house wines are excellent!) for the same price or less. Try one on the street (they're more like alleys than streets) that leads from the north end of the Piazza Navonna to the Trevi Fountain - it has a walkway of flat paving stones set in the middle of the cobblestones; we called it the \"yellow brick road\" becauase it's so easy to follow and leads straight to the Trevi. Best authentic Italian dinners for best prices are in Trastavere (full dinner for 3, with wine, for 43 euros), an area that seemed to be as populated with Italians as with tourists. Shopping was better on Via Cola de Rienze (out by the Vatican, just east of museum) than on the pricey streets like the Via Corso, Condotti, and the designer shops on the Vitorio Veneto. The Cola de Rienze shops seemed to be more frequented by the locals and had excellent quality clothing and other items. After shopping, try taking the boat taxi (1 euro per person!) from Pont Castel Sant Angelo (dock is opposite of river from the Castle) down the river to Trastavere for dinner. Great cafes all around the Santa Maria en Trastavere church, or cross the river and check out the fresh market in Campo di Fiori, then stop in at one of the cafes on that piazza - La Carbonara is right on the piazza and is great with reasonable prices. Also, the fresh fruit is Rome in beyond compare to anything in the U.S. - grown just 30 min. outside the city and picked at the peak of ripeness. Wonderful city, fantastic hotel, wonderful sites, great food - just bring well-worn-in walking shoes, cause the metros are useless (not like Paris; too few trains, not enough stops, and never seem to go where you want to go)and the buses are crowded. Rome is very compact; we walked from the hotel to the Vatican and from the hotel to the Colosseum/Forum - it is never as far as it looks on the map. Plus with all that walking, you can eat anything you want and never gain an ounce!", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel and its surroudings\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3730695", "Content": "We picked the Hotel based on our travel agent and trip advisor. It was wonderful. It is kind of pricey with the exchange rate, but to roll out of the front door and see the back of the Pantheon cannot be beat. EVeryone was very helpful, especially the doorman, who spoke to my husband's aunt who lives in Rome for us since our Italian is poor. The rooms have got to be some of the biggest in Europe. I was really impressed. THe only downfall was that there was no breakfast included as in some of the reviews. That was ok in our book becuase there are plenty of coffee bars nearby where you can get some cappucino and a pastry.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool", "Title": "\u201cGood location..but have stayed in better hotels\u201d", "Author": "CanastaHotel", "ReviewID": "UR3659701", "Content": "At 300 gbp per night I was expecting something a bit more than I got.

Our group was originally scheduled to stay at the Crowne Plaza but was moved to this hotel because of overbooking. We couldn't have been more pleased. Like so many of the hotels in Italy, this one isn't that impressive on the outside, but, unlike many of the others, it is just gorgeous on the inside. The three of us were amazed to find ourselves in a large suite. We had two fullsize beds in our room and the couch in the outer room folded out to a very comfortable bed, allowing our daughter to have a room of her own. Both rooms had televisions (though I can't say much about Italian television choices). The bathroom was very large by European standards and, happily, the shower had a shower curtain. The room was beautifully and tastefully decorated. The breakfast in the restaurant was good and included fresh fruit. The other big advantage of this hotel is the location. It is literally right next to the Pantheon and easily accessible to the major attractions in Rome. Restaurants (and gelatto places) are nearby. After starting our tour with two nights in this hotel, all the other hotels were a real comedown.

Rome stays up quite late on weekends and people and traffic make noise till 3:00am! We stayed at this hotel two times. The first time we stayed there we had a room that faced the quiet side. It was great! Unfortunately we payed the same high price for a room on the noisy side the second time and had a hard time sleeping for our early morning flight. The hotel could not move us to the quiet side as all those quiet rooms are taken first! The hotels location is awsome, the rooms are clean and the interior is elegant but if you can't sleep the rooms sure aren't worth the $370 euros per night. So be aware that rooms on the quiet side of the hotel are taken first, especially on weekends! Also, I found the front desk staff a little stuffy ab bit rude under pressure and not all that helpful. The roof top bar/restraurant is worth going up for a night cap, but when we ate at the restaurant we found older grey haired Maitre Di to be quite rude and arrogant! The rest of the staff were much freindlier and almost made up for his abruptness. All and all I would have to say that the rooms at the Grand Minerve vary quite a bit so be careful and state \"QUIET ROOM ONLY\" on your booking if you stay over a weekend!

Though reasonable in size, it had not been renovated and looked nothing like the pictures on the website-more like a Holiday Inn, with a dark interior view, which at $450 plus per night is disappointing. We offered to pay extra for a better room, but were told none were available, even though we were booked for four nights.

Our first room was small and not suitable for our needs and had an awful view, so after seeing the manageress, who was wonderful, we were give a junior suite at no extra cost which was just amazing. I took my elderly mother along with my sister and we had 1st class treatment from start to finish. Our room was fantastic with views of the Pantheon and the surrounding area, the chuch outside the hotel is breathtaking inside. The staff in this hotel were so helpful right from the manager down to the housekeepers, they could not do enough for you. You must have lunch or dinner on the rooftop this was the best part of our day, we would have lunch and then sit in the sun and relax for a while before going back out to see more sights. My mum has limited mobility and this hotel was absolutely no problem to her in any way. I can only say that this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in throughout the world.

When it was not, we asked the concierge to be allowed to speak with the manager about this. After pressing him several times, he finally relented and let us speak with her. She did not offer any apology for the signs and error of her employees, and insisted that the garden not being open for drinks was due to the short rain the night before (it had rained for 15 minutes).
