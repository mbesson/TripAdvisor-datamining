The Address is indeed hyper modern. Styled in the colors of black and camel (the only way to describe the color - beige is not good enough) it is marbled and stainless steeled to the hilt. It has obviously been designed - not in the sense of subtle - more \"integrated\" with the same color and material. Never relieved by reds or blues - it is relentless. You are greeted with the latest sit-a-desk-in-a-lounge-chair type registrations. It feels like a pleasant job interview, when all I want is my room. The room I was in was small but relieved by a balcony. Which is great. The view is over the Marina - actually as a Marina it is not what you think - it's a tiny waterway winding between 70 story buildings some of which are still being constructed. Fascinating if you like to study construction methods and the use of cranes. The Beige and Black room (relieved by the odd beige brown) is good if small. The bathroom is large - as that is when the camel/black marble comes into its own. Looks like square water taps are all the go now. Big shower and a bath with a big window to get a closer view of those cranes. Supermarket - yep there is a good one in the accompanying \"Mall of Endless Brands\" Staff - good but they are way too obsequious for this Australian Walking - forget it - you can walk around the \"Marina\" but the view is as I described. Food in hotel - so so - loads of promise, lots of bowls and 'stations' - but dull. they need some good advice on this. They go for the overcooked and the 'stews'. If you like potatoes in a stew and pasta this is the place for you. Internet - as expected - excellent and easy Other: you get more pillows and light switches than you need in a lifetime. Basically the whole Marina area should have an \"Under Construction\" sign and wait till it's finished before letting in people.

The staff is very efficient, and it seemed has if no-one was actually in the hotel as the lobby was always quiet, and the check-in area never crowded with a wait. Perhaps it was just the time of the year/week that I was there. One important tip: The hotel will allow a 24 hour room use for some room categories. You may find as I did that upgrading the the next category can be cheaper than paying for two nights. The additional fee is about 50% of the room rate.

The Address definitely did not disappoint. It is an \"address\" meant to impress and it truly does. I liked it so much that I went back for a second visit and it did not disappoint. So why would I recommend it? Where do I start. Location location location- situated on the Dubai marina and walking distance to JBR, and just off Sheikh Zayed Road it is ideal. It is easy to get around, close to the hustle and bustle, yet a feeling of secludedness that allowed you ample peace and quiet. The views from the balcony overlooking the pool and the Marina is truly spectacular. Having an elevator that is key controlled meant that you felt as safe as houses as no un-authorized persons could gain access to hotel floors. Ideal for females traveling without male companions. Hotel room- stylish yet comfortable and cozy. Sundowners on the balcony! Well worth it. The pool bar and restaurant- great venue to sit and listen to music(live saxophonist played in the evening) - super place to chillax and put your feet up after a day of shopping and checking out the sights. And the pool is amazing/stunning in fact. Staff- superb from the moment You check in until you leave. Unobtrusive and efficient. Breakfast is pricey but excellent and worth trying out. The only hitch throughout the whole experience- do not order a half bottle of red wine from room service. At 500 Dirrham for an ordinary red wine(ridiculously over-priced) you might as well order the bigger bottle at half the price(go figure).

The service at the Address is top class; friendly, attentive and stil relaxed. We had a Grand room which gave us a lot of complimentary services and the room was just perfect. The mall in connection to the hotel was also a big plus. If anything, the view from the room, considering the price, was perhaps not what you might had expected as there is a constant building process going on on all sides of the hotel. We might had preferred to have the balcony towards the pool. The atmosphere at the hotel is also perhaps more like a business hotel than for a vacation, but that is perhaps just a matter of size - the hotel plus the residence hotel is enormous and now, when the hotel was pretty crowded (Russian winter holiday etc.), you could not obtain a free deck mattress at the pool in the afternoon unless waiting for an hour or so.

I know there were great adventures to be had if you're not a nervous nelly like me...boat rides, local markets, camel rides, desert jeep rides, etc. Food at the hotel was VERY diverse...something for everyone including italian, indian, and asian options at lunch and dinner. A few tips I learned from fellow westerners: everyone speaks English and wears \"western\" business attire so no need to be concerned with that, women should not initiate conversations with men as it appears forward (even saying hello or good morning in the elevator, who knew?), don't take picture of the men or women in national dress (especially the women), be careful exposing too much skin as a woman just be conservative with skirt lengths, etc. If I ever find a need to go back to Dubai, I will definitely stay at an Address Hotel again.

All facilities are equally faultless; from the infinity pool to the spa and the restaurants. The Address adds a new twist to things: though the main restaurant is organized as a buffet, the large number of cooking stations, combined with the food being displayed elegantly in small portions, means one is never overwhelmed; The quality of the food (the deserts are to die for!) was matched by the impeccable personalized service of the staff.

The hotel has a great swimming pool - very large infinity pool. The sun bathing area is well equiped with nice beds and sun loungers but in the winter months I would imagine that it will get very crowded as the area is quite small.
