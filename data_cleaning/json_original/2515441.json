The gym was quite good, alougth there were plenty of walking/running tracks that ran through the hotel grounds. There were restaurants and take away outlets in and around the hotel complex, which was great if the kids were tired after along day out. The pool and spa were beautifully warm, even on a cold day! The buffet breakfast can be included in your room package and is well worth it, with lots of variety from hot dishes to traditional cold buffet. Parking is free.

It was immaculate, safe and in a great location. The staff was professional and friendly and extremely accomodating. I even had a bit of problem at check in (the computer locked up) and the desk clerk first asked me to wait in the lobby until tech support could fix it but then she grabbed the master key and escorted us to our room. Much better than sitting in the lobby. Quick thinking on her part. (we checked in and got keys a bit later). The area around the hotel is beautiful. There are a few resturants within walking distance and there is plenty of parking. The pool and walking path in the back of the hotel are great. You need to get the city view if you can. It was so nice sitting on our balcony overlooking the pool, the waterway and the city of San Diego. The rooms are very nice and big and clean. Bath products are not great just the low-end stuff. But I loved the single cup coffee maker with GreenMountain coffee. I ate breakfast in the resturant once but only becasue we were given a complimentary voucher due to our mix-up at check in. Food was average (but hey it was free so hard to compain). I generallyl don't eat in hotel resturants and why would you in San Diego??

Add the words \u201cstylish\u201d and \u201cwell-appointed\u201d to the Courtyard San Diego Liberty Station. When it comes to my list of favorite hotels, this Courtyard would rank among them. There is an extensive lobby and bar, outdoor seating area, and pleasant pool scene. There is an on-site which restaurant which offers room service. The hotel is adjacent to a park, and there is a walking trail which follows the Liberty Station waterfront. The location is ideal for early morning flights from Lindbergh field and convenient to downtown and other attractions. The room d\u00e9cor is the latest generation design. Guests will enjoy the movable desk, flat screen television, and wireless internet. All three of my stays were in water view rooms, and these come at a $15 premium. The verdict is still out on whether this is a worthwhile upgrade. The view was exceptional the first time \u2013 a spectacular view of downtown, the airport, and water. The second time I was in a south-facing water room which had an unobstructed water view. The water is closer to a river than a bay, so it was not noteworthy. During my most recent stay, the room was at the corner of the \u201cL\u201d, so the view was interrupted by the building. All of these rooms had balconies. Finally, the hotel\u2019s CRM is quite impressive. When I arrived for my second visit, the front desk associate acknowledged my recent stay. The associate also noted that my upcoming stay was not booked in a water view room and asked if I would like to change room type. This information often disappears into the black hole of an enormous database, so I was pleased to see this attention to detail. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel as base for exploring San Diego.

This year, issues at a friend's house precluded us from staying in their guest bedroom, and thus we booked ourselves at the Marriott Liberty Station. We found the location to be ideal to get into downtown, just turn left from the hotel, follow harbor drive and you're there in no time, without even having to get on the freeway. Likewise to get into Ocean Beach, PB, or locations north; simply turn right out of the hotel to get to the beaches or head north on the 8 freeway to La Jolla. In short, we found the location of the Marriott to be ideally centered between the two areas of San Diego where we spend the most time. As they say, the three most important aspects are location, location, location. On top of the fantastic location, the staff at the Marriott could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They upgraded us on check in to a room overlooking the water, and handled our requests with ease. In the room, we found a flatscreen TV, a small fridge, and (most importantly) a Kuerig coffee maker. From the small balcony we could watch the sun set over the Pacific. Remind me again why we moved away from San Diego? Outside of the hotel, the liberty station area has almost every shop and restaurant that you could need, and others, like Target, In-n-out, and rubio's fish tacos, are just a mile or so east on Rosecrans st.

The room was very nice, well-maintained and clean, with a huge 32\" widescreen HDTV, wireless internet, lots of gizmos so you can view your pictures on the TV, an iHome docking station and a Herman Miller ergo-chair, LOTS of room and a balcony with an incredible view. I'm not sure what brand of beds they are, but that was the most comfortable bed I can remember sleeping in. The sheets were high thread count stuff and each bed had 4 feather pillows.

They offer laundry detergent free! Value is great. We have had a suite both times and pleased with the value. If you have your choice, request 4th floor suite. Breakfast buffet has amazing staff and is a wonderful value. Can go for a walk along the water. Can walk to several restaurants and Starbucks. The hotel is extremely close to downtown, which is easy to access, and literally 7-10 minutes away from the airport. The hotel does provide a shuttle to the airport, and one of the drivers, Sandy, was amazing. My husband and I did not use the shuttle, we got to know Sandy because she was one of the first to greet us upon our arrival. Throughout the week, we saw a lot of Sandy. She would help in the restaurant when it was busy, she was helping people at the front, she would be helping out other staff members in different areas. All the while, no matter where she was, she had a smile on her face. But we noticed this alot in this hotel. The GM, Rick Brown, was actually clearing tables for the breakfast buffet several days we were there. Nice to see a GM hands on with the staff! One of the waitresses at the buffet, we noticed at another area in the hotel helping out, and she also drives the shuttle. Her name is Lisa B and she was incredibly happy and personable. The breakfast buffet was very busy the week we stayed, and Lisa had a smile on her face, greeting customers by name, all week. Larry and Anna also worked the breakfast buffet, dinner, and the bar and always happy. Larry, fabulous personality, took time with every customer despite the level of activity! If the staff is that happy and so willing to work in other areas, the hotel must be doing something right.

The rooms are excellent, spacious, well appointed with a flat screen tv, mini refrigerator, A/V hookups to watch videos if you have your camcorder or laptop with you and want to watch footage on the TV, cable including HBO, very spacious bathroom, granite counters, and even granite window sills. The staff is SUPER friendly, the lobby and main areas are immaculate, the fitness center has 24 hour access, unlike many hotels that limit access, the jacuzzi was awesome as was the pool, the location has the harbor to the rear, a huge open park and trails, plus a beach area, and it's in a very upscale looking neighborhood. The business center is free to use, ie free internet access and a printer, plus free wi-fi in the rooms. There's a market attached to it that has starbucks plus other sandwich type deli items, plus a little store for knick knacks if you've forgotten something or need a little something extra (protein drinks, candy bars, chips, batteries, etc). Parking is FREE!! Which is impossible to find at a hotel in this class. So i basically had no complaints whatsoever and really can't imagine how anyone could complain on this hotel. Sure you hear planes, you're near an airport. They stop flying around 10p and they start around 630am, but again it's not anything major. The planes aren't directly over head so it isn't super loud.

From the friendly staff, full-service restaurant and resort-like pool and spa (complete with palm trees a fire pit), these are amenities that I do not normally expect at a Courtyard. The location is another plus. The Liberty Station area has a lot going for it and is not far from downtown San Diego and the Gaslamp district, but unless you really need that kind of night life, there's enough to do as far as dining right in the Liberty Station/Point Loma area. The desk clerk was helpful with recommendations. My only real complaint is the run of the mill room I received as a Gold Elite member. I have come to realize that Couryard's are much more hit-or-miss in offering what should be a guaranteed upgrade (space permitting of course, but this was the middle of the week and space was permitting) than are full service Marriott's. This doesn't really make sense to me, but it is what it is.

It's the perfect location, particularly if you have young children. There's a nice, big playground in the Liberty Station area that only takes 5 minutes to walk to on a nice paved running/biking path from the hotel. Some of the playground is on soft turf and some is on sand, so take your sand toys. The front desk told us they had sand toys we could borrow, but we never did. Next to the playground is a bathroom as well, which is convenient with young kids. The playground was extremely clean and had a nice number of kids playing on it. The playground overlooks a river or inlet of some kind, so nice for the parents to enjoy as well. The beautiful jogging trail goes for miles! If you want to walk a little further, you can walk 10 minutes from the hotel on a paved path and go over the foot bridge to the bay where there's a beach (Spanish Landing) and the kids can safely play in the water. There's also a playground and a bathroom facility at this area as well. Trader Joe's is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, which was convenient for us to get some groceries for the mini-fridge in the hotel room. There are many other stores in the same complex as Trader Joe's, but we never checked them out. Liberty Station (where the hotel is) has several restaurants and we highly recommend Oggi's. When the power was out in all of southern California for 12 hours or so, they were trying to accomodate customers by working in their kitchen by flashlight. Very hard workers and good food! The front desk staff was wonderful and helpful. They remembered us by name and greeted us each time we came and went. We did rent a car and loved the free parking at the hotel. The hotel itself and the individual rooms are clean and modern. The WiFi worked smoothly for us as well. Their breakfast buffet was reasonable and we thought it had a nice variety (oatmeal, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, bagels, english muffins, juices, coffee, etc) for the price of $10. Was $12 if you wanted the hot food (eggs, waffles, sausage, bacon). The pool was the perfect temperature and never over crowded when we were there. Although, it is starting to get a little cooler in San Diego at this time of year, especially when the sun goes down, so take layers! We could hear airplanes from time to time and could see them out our window, but it didn't bother our 3 year old during naps and didn't keep us awake at night. I think the volume of planes flying significantly drops from 11 PM- 7 AM , which helped. If you are a super sensitive sleeper, take ear plugs, but we didn't think it was an issue. The location of this hotel is great with it being next to the airport and only a 5 minute drive to downtown. All the conveniences you need are right around the hotel.

Large desk, large flat screen, pull open wardrobe, mini-refrigerator, etc. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked flawlessly (I like my freon). I ate breakfast twice at the buffet which offered made to order omelettes, Belgium waffles, bacon, sausage, fruit, and various breads, pastries, and cereal.

We did have meetings in one of the larger meeting rooms. The service for our meeting was good. I think my room was a little over $200 per might which I thought was a little pricey for a Courtyard but it is San Diego (perhaps for a little more you could stay near the beach).

As mentioned in the other reviews, the rooms are very nice at this property and they keep it up amazingly well. I had to ask how old the property was, and was amazed they said 4 years old as it looked like it was a brand new & they just finished everything a few months ago.

So expect to make a bunch of 5-10 min. drives to most items. Or go park near the Old Town trolley station & ride the trolleys. That's the best way to go downtown. Two items. Jim the bar manger/bartender is a master at classic cocktails as he spent 30+ years at the Del Coronado as a bar manager and is way above what you would expect to find at a business hotel.

Harbor Drive (for those not familiar with the area, many GPS will route you back to I-5 to get downtown, don\u2019t follow that, much quicker and prettier to drive back around the airport and bay front). *Free internet (wires and wireless), High Def Flat Screens, very workable desks with lots of plugs and lighting. *Great running/walking trails and parks right outside your door. *Well equipped exercise room (yes it\u2019s on the smaller side but they really make good use of the space and give you everything you need). *No in-room safe. *Not all rooms have balconies but all have opening windows, I would definitely try and get a balcony room, however, so you can sit out and enjoy the weather (albeit small, probably 2 people max). *Good common areas (especially the outdoor space). *A few restaurants in the immediate area (walking distance). A mix of options, nothing I would call a culinary sensation but good for families (i.e. Thai Place, Sports Bar/Restaurant, Sushi, Subway, Fast Food Mexican). Trader Joe\u2019s in the hood as well as a Von\u2019s (I would walk there but most would probably call it a 2-3 min drive). *My room seemed a little more wear and tear than I would expect for a newer hotel, however, this place is popular and the wear was fairly minor (i.e. some nicked furniture, a stain on the couch). *Housekeeping is good, place was clean and refreshed well. Bathrooms were especially kept very clean. *Pool and spa were well maintained and just the right temperatures. *Noise level \u2013 lots of reviewers speak of this, yes you are in the flight path but I never heard it inside and even outside, it was not disrupting to the peaceful feeling of the location. I only once heard a neighbor (and it was a full house) but for the most part never heard people in halls, or elevators opening, etc. *Self valet service so if you have lots of luggage, grab a luggage cart from the front desk. *The location is central with good access to all the places you probably want to see and the immediate area feels safe but as in any large city, you can go a short distance and be in a great area or a not-so-great one. You can always ask, however, as the staff is happy to help (we especially cared about this for long runs in the early AM and wanted to make sure we stayed in the better areas). *Hotel crowd seems to be mostly families or business /military folks, no groups of young partiers (like you see in Gaslamp or some of the Beach Areas). So for us, that\u2019s great. If you like the nightlife scene, consider Pacific Beach or Gaslamp.

We certainly weren't disappointed, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The King-sized room (room 438) was huge, with a large bathroom and small balcony. Bed was super-comfy and although close to the airport, we heard almost no noise during our stay. There was a small fridge in the room, and a Keurig-style coffee maker, but no in-room safe which was a bit of a hassle (free lock-boxes are provided at reception). All the staff were friendly and very good at their jobs; nothing seemed too much trouble. It would help if the instructions on how to summon the shuttle bus from the airport were clearer. As it was, I called reception on a payphone and they dispatched the bus straight away, but we couldn't find any directions or a free phone (other hotels have this sorted). We took breakfast on a few mornings, and this was pretty good value for an unlimited selection of either continental, or hot items. During the day, free coffee is available near reception, as well as huge containers of chilled juices. There's also an on-site laundry which was reasonably priced at $1.25 per machine (free soap from reception). The surrounding area is gorgeous, and there's a Trader Joes and Vons supermarkets within easy walking distance. Buses into downtown leave from the main road opposite Starbucks every half-hour (not Sundays, and only hourly via the airport on Saturdays), but there's another bus route towards the trolley interchange which leaves from Rosecrans Street. We bought a 3-day MTS unlimited pass and this was really useful for exploring San Diego (good for buses and trolleys). Overall, a great hotel in a stunning location.

Found that the conference hotel (Sheraton on Harbor Island) charges $20 a day for parking and is only a pleasant walk away through Spanish Landing Park. This place is a crown jewel for the courtyard chain-- if you have never stayed at one this is the one to try. It has all the practical things you'd want including free internet and parking. The rooms are as always spacious and bright but it also helps that the facility is brand-new. Service is good but don't eat at the restaurant. The best thing about this hotel is its location next to the Liberty Station neighborhood-- a perfect example of urban renewal done right.There are bayside parks stretching in both directions inviting romantic walks. Liberty Station is a former naval facility and has anything from Panera and Vons Supermarket to an evangelical megachurch (\"The Rock\"). It is 5 minutes from downtown by car or taxi and 5 minutes from the airport by complimentary shuttle. You can walk or bicycle downtown through the bayside parks, too. Downside: Noise --but not really a problem. I was concerned about the proximity to the airport and airplane noise, but it was a minor nuisance since the hotel is not in the direct flight path. All of downtown San Diego including the Hotel Circle neighborhood, however, is in the flight path of the airport so you really can't get away from it. The noise from people in the outdoor hotel pool and hot tub was worse but stops when they close it. Ask for a room overlooking the parking lot if kids noises from the pool bother you.

Ok, I will describe this place from my personal experience. First off, I am still currently residing at this location for a long term stay and even after a month and a half I the staff all around has continuously gone out of their way, literally, to help me out with ANY personal issue or request I have had. If the amenities do not grab your attention the friendly staff most certainly will. Please do not let \"friendly\" be considered a loose term. Every staff member here is very personal and it is not because it is their job, but because they are warm and caring people and really do want you to enjoy your time here in San Diego. Every recommendation to every ridiculous request is spot on for everything I have ever needed. It is almost as if they cannot do enough to make sure your stay is wonderful. The food? Glad you asked! They have a wonderful array of options for breakfast, lunch (which i dine here for every day) and dinner. Outstanding steaks to half off happy hour appetizers to outstanding salads. I've even made absurd requests just as a test, which I do feel a little guilty for, and all have been met with a 5 star ending. Yes, five out of five. Oh, who likes hot tubs? I do! Nice glass of wine by the fireplace, ok, if you want to, it is available here. They even provide you with a ride to the surrounding areas for dining or entertainment and even to go shopping if you like. Also, as an extended stay guest, I was greeted with extra gifts to help me be as comfortable as possible. A big thanks goes out to the sales manager Bonnie for that. And to everyone at the front desk (Matt, Joe, Christina, Stephanie, Cara, Chris, Kurt, Jamie, Marlene, and don't worry, Sandy and Mitch I don't forget about you) thank you for being so awesome. Susan, thank you for the outstanding sandwiches for lunch, Jim, Anna, Sara, and Hector, thank you for the evening dining company and great service at the bar and restaurant, And Ms. Claudia, although you may or may not read this, you do an outstanding job with the room.

We sat out in the sun a bit but was too cold to use the pool and it was small, not for swimming, more for dipping. -Great to have Trader Joe's & Von's nearby.

Would be great if they had bikes available for use. - Airplanes do land and take off frequently but not until about 6:30 a.m. It was never loud enough to wake us up. - Free parking is a great perk. You will want a car here unless you do not mind walking a few miles to catch the trolley or to take a bus. The Old Town Trolley tour has a shuttle pick up next door at the Homewood Suite but they only pick up and drop off at a specified time per day. - We did not have a balcony but there was a decent park & water view ; there were a few rooms with balconies overlooking the water(I would guess those are the suites). - Room was spacious enough for two people and, other than some loud people coming in late, we had no troubles with noise.

I believe that the first and major measure of a hotel (above location and price) is cleanliness; this hotel was spotlessly clean; the bedrooms, pool area, restaurant and lobby were immaculate; the towels and bedding were crisp, clean and comfortable. we were given two interconnecting rooms on the second floor with a good view over the pool and bay. the rooms were spacious, airy and the bathrooms were a good size, with good toiletries and plenty of towels. the rooms were cleaned every day (apart from christmas day when just the bins were emptied). the hotel is a very close to the airport (at most a five minute drive) and there is a frequent free shuttle to the airport; we used this when we over nighted in vegas and on our return we contacted the hotel to send the shuttle to collect us; this worked brilliantly and the shuttle was waiting for us as we exited the terminal. the airport is much busier than I thought and there was some noise in our bedrooms from planes taking off and landing, but no real inconvenience or disturbance the hotel is on a modern complex, alongside a hilton,a number of restaurants, a starbucks and a massage spa ( Envy - $50 for a full hour long massage - brilliant); the only thing lacking was a convenience store on the site. however, there is a very small mini shop behind the reception in the hotel. there is loads of free parking (the internet is also free as is use of the desktop computers in the lobby where we printed our airline boarding cards). the hotel also accepted a couple of faxes on our behalf (again free of charge; I recall being charged $20 for a fax at the bellagio several years ago!) location of the hotel is good; a couple of minutes from the airport and maybe double that to down town san diego and the midway. the drive to the fantastic zoo (where my kids fed the giraffes; available every day between 12pm and 1 pm- unmissable) took 10 - 15 mins. the price of our stay at the hotel was ok - we paid maybe a little more than we expected, but when you add on free parking ( another hotel we considered down town wanted $30 per night to park) and the free internet, the price was about right. there are no safes in the room, but I used a safe box behind reception for the duration of our stay (although there wasn't much left to put into it towards the end of the holiday), and again this was free of charge. I don't get the impression that in the san diego we saw petty crime is a problem. we ate in the hotel a couple of nights; the restaurant had virtually shut down other than for breakfast over the holiday season, but the restricted menu and the food we chose from it and ate in the bar area were pretty good and reasonably priced a holiday in san diego in the winter is the epitome of cool, and the laid back friendly tone of this beautifully clean hotel means that we'll be more than happy to \"come home\" here again.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRest and Relaxation for a Young Family - - and a GREAT LOCATION to boot!\u201d", "Author": "5877", "ReviewID": "UR92172592", "Content": "By far the BEST location and hotel experience for a young family like ours - - where proximately to all the great things in San Diego is important (Balboa Park, Seaport Village, etc.), but totally WITHOUT the hustle and bustle \"rat race\" of the city.

Hands down! Although our hotel room was no where near ready upon or arrival (as we had selected only one of the three suites on property, the day after New Years Eve celebrations at the hotel - - late check outs, etc), our love for the extra room in the suite with our new family was key. The mini-fridge, pull out couch/family room, and great view of the water at sunrise was a welcome touch. (And we loved the little Kuereg coffee machine to get us going in the morning.) But by far - - the ability to just get out and walk along the water, enjoy the history and patriotism of the Liberty Station naval training area, and sampling any number of the great food around the hotel was the perfect combination. One suggestion - - our personal vehicle was key, as this location is just far enough away from key locales, that having your own transportation was a must in our book. It worked out great, as the access to N Harbor Dr, Rosecrants, and the 5 & 8 freeways was a breeze.

This hotel was everything I expected and more. I was looking for a Marriott family hotel (Category 4 or lower) to redeem two free night certificates, and this hotel was a really good choice. It has been many years since I stayed at a Courtyard property, and I found the Courtyard Liberty Station to have a new, modern feel, which I really liked, and a lot more amenities than I would expect at a Courtyard. All the hotel personnel we interacted with were friendly, professional, and helpful. The location was great with direct access to a walking trail along the water, proximity to the airport, availability of several dining options at the hotel and within Liberty Station, and pretty easy access to the freeways for getting around the San Diego area. Rooms: I have Gold elite status in the Marriott Rewards program, but I\u2019m not someone who pushes or even asks for room upgrades. When I booked the room (by phone), the agent did ask for my room preferences, and they were met (two beds, higher floor, good view). We had a great view of the pool and the water/walking path. The room was well designed, attractive, and a good size. Furniture included two queen-size beds, a chair/lamp in a corner for reading or looking at the view, a desk/desk chair with a sliding table underneath it, and a dresser/credenza. The room was equipped with a single-brew Keurig coffee maker (coffee/tea were provided and replenished daily) and small refrigerator, nice flat screen TV, wired and wireless internet, and other electronic hookups. The bathroom had a single sink but a large vanity that was great for two women travelling together. Linens and towels seemed to be pretty good quality (nicer towels than some of the Marriott extended stay properties I have stayed this year). Staff/service: We (my sister and I) arrived separately. My sister, who is not a very experienced traveler, had an easy time getting to the hotel (using the hotel\u2019s complimentary shuttle from the San Diego airport) and having the hotel store her luggage (repeated on her departure day since she had a red eye flight and I left earlier to return to LAX with the rental car). Our room was cleaned in the morning while we were out for a walk. We were able to check in a little early, and we were able to get a slightly extended checkout. Front desk staff members were helpful and professional whenever we spoke to them. Property Amenities: The hotel had a nice outdoor seating area and a outdoor pool/jacuzzi (didn\u2019t use because of the weather), fitness room with Life Fitness equipment (multi-station weight machine and several pieces of cardio equipment), full service restaurant and snack bar/deli type place (didn\u2019t try either), three computers and a printer available for guest use, and probably other things that I didn\u2019t notice or use.

Quite simply, they are the best bang for the buck. When you stay at a Marriott you aren't sleeping at some dive nor at a world-class hotel. This was my first trip to San Diego. Came out here for Comic-Con. Ultimately I booked the Residence Inn downtown for the duration of Comic-Con but decided to add an extra day of R&R and booked the Courtyard Marriott located 4 minutes from the San Diego airport. The experience here has been mostly great. As every review prior to mine indicates this is a new hotel and it's quite nice. It certainly lives up to or exceeds any Marriott I have stayed at. Upon arrival I was booked in a really nice room on the second floor complete with balcony overlooking the pool. That was a real treat within itself. I didn't ask for such a special room but they gave me a choice of several at the front desk. The room itself is wonderful. It had a couch and a great workstation to plug my laptop into. The hotel is situated in a very nice waterfront area complete with walking track. I wish I had more time to walk the area as it seems very beautiful. Instead, I chose to go down to the pool and spend an hour or two there. The pool is tiny. By the time I got there kids were already swimming in it and I decided I probably would not enjoy a swim. So, I laid in the sun for a bit but shortly thereafter more kids arrived and I decided to leave. Too many kids yelling, screaming and diving in the pool just isn't my idea of relaxation. Then again, this is the kind of hotel that is going to attract families so who am I to complain. Have kids? They will enjoy the company of other kids. Want to relax? Too many kids. Was going to hang out in the bar, but it didn't seem like a happening place. Some of the Marriotts have a happy hour with food and drink specials but this bar didn't seem to have any of that going on. Bed was very comfortable. Absolutely no plane noise. I found out the planes stop flying by 10pm so no need to worry about losing sleep. In fact, the most noise I incurred was the slamming of doors throughout the night. The walls are thin here -- I could hear voices -- but I managed to sleep well nonetheless. Room has a high definition LCD television and all sorts of ports to plug in your video camera or PC. Free wired and wireless high speed Internet is always a welcome bonus. There is even a Keurig coffee maker in the room with a selection of coffees and teas --- buy wouldn't you know it, my coffee maker was broken. I hear these Keurig coffee makers, as nice as they are, don't stand up to repeated use. In the morning, since I did not have a working coffee maker, I went to the lobby where they have a Waterside Deli that served very good coffee, but its pastries were abysmal. I skipped the buffet breakfast. Parking is free which is another huge, huge bonus. The only major negative surprise here is the elevator. It's a single elevator (though there seems to be two at separate locations) but to get to it you have to go through a tiny, standard doorway. Some poor guy walked into the hotel with a skid of luggage. In trying to get through the doorway to the elevator he had to take all his luggage off the skid. It was ridiculous. I have never seen such a small accessway to an elevator inside a hotel. With one elevator at your disposal it can be slow wait at times. In all, I would make this my first choice of stay the next time I come to San Diego. It's almost a hidden secret how great a hotel this is. I hope it stays that way because it's very rare that you can get such a nice hotel like this with free parking and Internet for this price point.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "shamers2", "ReviewID": "UR71052467", "Content": "We chose this hotel after reading good reviews here and noting which areas of SD we were planning to visit. Wasn't interested in Gaslight with the kids, didn't want to pay for parking or an old room at Mission Bay, and wanted to be fairly central to the historic sites. The location was central to downtown SD/harbor, Old Town, and Point Loma/Cabrillo. There was plenty to do, see, and eat near the hotel (Point Loma Seafood!), and most everything we wanted to visit was a quick jaunt in the car. It's a pretty recently redeveloped area and was completely safe and nice. We had a king room with a pullout bed for our 4-year-old and a pack-and-play for the baby, and it was tight but we fit. The room was not as spacious as some courtyards we've been in, but I would stay there again. The rooms are even smaller in the older hotels. It's still a new hotel and was very clean and pleasant. I used the guest laundry and the machine I chose happened to break on us and the front desk staff took a few minutes to figure out how to handle the problem, but my money was refunded and they gave us extra soap to run another load. The hotel is very near the airport which was initially a concern because my husband is a super light sleeper, but he slept through whatever flights there were (with the windows/balcony door closed), as did both kids. Airport noise was not a problem at all. As with most other Courtyards we've stayed at, the breakfast is a complete ripoff. We got the free breakfast rate and paid $10 extra per night to feed us and the kids, which is the only way to eat breakfast there. It's basically your free continental breakfast at any other hotel, plus some dude in a chef hat flipping you an omelet. That omelet was NOT worth $12 or whatever the menu lists it for. If you're going to pay $12, go to a real breakfast joint. Overall it's a very nice hotel in a nice area and we would definitely stay at Liberty Point again.

The front desk staff acted like we were an inconvenience for them. We arrived at 3:00 PM and I said that we would wait to get a room with a nice view. A couple of weeks prior to our stay, I had talked with front desk staff and requested a room with a view of Liberty Park and/or bay. I am also a Marriott Reward Program member and have been for 30 years. On my rewards data, I have a permanent request for a high floor. Granted this hotel only has four floors. Well, it took us three rooms to get one with an acceptable view. First we were sent to a room on the second floor looking at a concrete roof and concrete wall of the next building. The next room, also second floor, all you saw when you looked out from the room was the high wall of the patio. The room was among their smallest, and it felt like you were in a dungeon. If you went out on the patio and looked over the top of the wall, you would see water. If you looked down, you saw roof. The third room was OK. We had to wait 30 minutes for it to be ready. Which was fine, and what we had said repeatedly when we first checked in. Third floor room, looked out over the roof of the portico at front of hotel, but did have a little view of distant hillside of Point Loma. We were tired by this time. Oh, the keys didn't work, so we had to go back to the front desk, again. We almost checked out on Saturday, but then decided to stay. I didn't sleep much at all the first night. The air conditioner sounded like a freight train was coming through the room, so every time it turned all, I would wake up. You would think that there would be better sound proofing in the newer hotels. People talking next door, doors banging, woke me at 1:00 AM.

I actually have nothing negative to say!! Trust me this is a first. My tip to travelers is STAY AT THIS HOTEL. You will be surprised.

I'm used to staying at bigger chains but this Courtyard's location, price and its reviews kindled my interest. I was definitely happy with the location.

I chose to hold out and wait for something closer to my liking. The agent helping me for my entire stay was Joe. He definitely did a good job and hopefully somebody from this Courtyard will recognize him for his efforts. (He checked us in, was there when we went out for dinner and checked us out the next morning!) Our waiting for a room was actually a good thing as we were able to see the nearby attractions like the USS Recruit. We also walked up and down the area looking over the bridge (Halsey Rd) and had our 5-year-old play at the Park at Beacon Point. When we did finally get into a room it fit our requests. The room was cozy and clean. Although I would recommend staying in a King suite as it has more room and a better view. Our view was slightly obstructed by palm trees but all-in-all it wasn't bad. The area around the hotel is clean and there are plenty of restaurants in the area too if you don't feel like eating hotel food. It's close to the San Diego Zoo/Seaport Village/Point Loma.

This hotel is really near the airport, so if you are outside you will hear and see planes taking off and landing. The view of the airplanes taking off was a plus for us because our son loved seeing them. The noise inside was not enough to disturb us. I dropped the sleep quality down 1 mark from excellent only because one night there were people talking too loud and too late on the patio below our room which made it a little difficult to sleep. All of the attractions we wanted to go to in San Diego were just a short drive away from this hotel without having to fight downtown traffic. We did enjoy the fact that there was a nice laundry facility and free internet in the business center at this hotel.

Check-in was easy and they allowed us to check in early around 1pm. It\u2019s a 5 minute drive from the airport so it was nice to get right to the hotel and unload after a long flight. The rooms were very nice and clean. We had two queen beds and a single sleeper which was perfect for our two boys (ages 3 and 5). Just allowed them to have their own beds at night. The bathroom was large, the TV was big and offered plenty of channels to watch. The room had a mini-fridge which was perfect to store milk, water, pop, etc. The room also had a Keurig coffee maker which was a very nice touch. Very convenient to make a cup of coffee and they offered plenty of coffee flavors. Our room did not have a balcony, but there are rooms that have them. I think because we got the room with the sleeper sofa meant there was not a balcony but we preferred the sleeper sofa option. Yes the hotel is near the airport but when you are in your room you don\u2019t really notice it. They built it in such a way that it blocks out the noise very well where it didn\u2019t bother us at all. Most of the flights are done by 10pm anyway. The kids loved the pool\u2026was heated and also had a hot tub area as well. Lots of outdoor patio space with a fire-pit but we never used much of that. The hotel is very conveniently location near restaurants, Starbucks, grocery store, etc. There is a walking path right outside the doors that leads to a great playground for the kids. The hotel had a restaurant, caf\u00e9, and bar as well. We never ate at the restaurant but it sure smelled good. The hotel does not offer a free breakfast so we just got items at the local grocery store and used our fridge in our room to cover the first meal of the day.

They were awesome. We had a room on the 4th floor that was overall quiet. The view was just fantastic. We could see the city, the water, the pool. The airport is close by so yes you do hear airplanes but that is one noise that has never bothered me too much. If you close the sliding glass door you don't hear much. The pool itself got pretty crowded but it is summer and that's the way it is in summer. The noise from the pool does tend to get kind of loud but it ends once the pool closes so it's not too bad. Housekeeping does tend to come later in the day but they clean your room every single day and they do a thorough job. The little deli downstairs is a nice added touch, the bar is small but sufficient, there are many seating areas outside; one with a fireplace and one with a firepit. There is a walking path by the water that will take you down to liberty station where there is a Starbucks, Panera bread that has some awesome pastries and sandwiches, a pizza place and a Von's to buy groceries. There is also a Subway, TCBY yogurt and a brewery within walking distance in the other direction. Parking was a challenge when the property was full but parking is free. I will def be back to this property. Point Loma seafood is close by and is one of the best sea food places I've ever eaten. Harbor Island and Shelter Island are close by and a must see just for the beauty and to sit and watch sailboats or take a walk or jog. Coronado is not too far...maybe 10 mins and Seaworld is not too far either. There is a free shuttle to the airport and the shuttle drivers are kind and courteous.

This hotel is conveniently located less than 5 minutes from the airport. Yet, it doesn't seem like one of the same old airport hotels. They have gone above and beyond in making this place special. The rooms are very stylish and clean. The HD flat screens make watching TV very easy from any point in the room. The internet worked great and the bathroom was also clean and nice. The grounds are beatiful and there is a park nearby for walking and relaxing. Although I only ate breakfast at the hotel one day, I will second what another reviewer said and say that the sevice was less than stellar. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as expected. Downtown is close by and there is a grocery store and other places close by as well.

Conveniently located, near new restaurants and shops, and less than 10 minutes away to Sea Word, airport, and Downtown. The NOT SO GOOD - I could hear planes take off from the airport in Room 158. This wasn't as bad as constantly hearing a door open and shut loudly to a service area nearby. Poor service in the restaurant - We weret tired of standing around waiting to be seated, then helped ourselves to breakast buffet. Half-way through our meal a server finally acknowledged us and offered drinks. Had breakfast again the following day and same poor service (two different servers on staff).

This was our first time staying close to Gaslamp and we were a bit hesitant at first... WE LOVED IT!!!! this property faces a little bay that even though small is enough to make your early morning stroll relaxing and fresh. The hotel grounds are extremely well kept (brand new property) and the hotel staff was very friendly. The room was impeccable and spacious (we got a two queen bed room facing downtown and the bay), our only complaint was that the \"fancy\" coffee maker didn't work at all and they never took care of it even though we mentioned it the first morning. This didn't really affect our trip since Starbucks is on walking distance (on the same plaza). The pool looked big enough, the jacuzzi was tempting but didn't get to use it, and the outside fire pit was a great touch. We didn't use the breakfast buffet since we normally like to go grab breakfast somewhere else, but we walked around and were surprised by the selection.

Inside the room, a little stuffy, but gleaming new stuff as the hotel has been opened only two months. I was looking for the AC controls and could not fine them. I remember reading on the website some rooms don't have all the amenities, thinking I got shafted with the AC. Unpack and there were only three drawers, when other places have double the amount, closet was small, so a five day stay would pack the closet, but still doable. I walk back to the front desk, ask the lady, who was very polite about the AC. She says all the rooms have AC. I go back to the room, the controls are behind this fake mini plant. AC worked, a little loud, but cool the room quickly. There was a mini fridge which had two buttons, more of an energy saver type fridge. I asked, no microwave, none even to rent for your stay, still on order. There was a restaurant, lunch-deli-coffee stand and bar in the hotel, did not try any. Fitness center was small, but new and new machines, water cooler included. Pool looked nice, did not try. The elevator closest to the lobby was broken for the entire time of my stay, there was another elevator at the other end of the hotel, but stairs are fine for the second floor. I recommend the highest floor as you don't hear footsteps of three year olds running back and forth from the room top of you. All doors seem to slam shut kinda loud, even with door closers on them, may the closers need an adjustment. Housekeeping, I think I had one the first part of my stay, I could tell alot of details were not done like wiping down the shower, dusting, making the bed better. I still tipped daily. The third day, she leaves a note, thanking me for the tips. I'm thinking she's going on days off and yes, I could tell the next housekeeper was better. Free parking, I'd say 10 minutes max to the Gaslamp or Pacific Beach. Only weird thing is I entered the hotel address in my GPS and got lost in the Liberty Station complex as it was the old Navy Training Center. Best to enter off of Rosecrans or Pacific Highway and two minutes, you are right there. A supermarket about eight blocks away (very walkable) and a cluster of high end fast food and sit down restaurants two blocks away towards Pacific Highway within the complex. Oh, airport noise, you can hear planes take off, but it's nothing distracting, unless you are the type that wants to complain just about everything. My brother stayed with me two nights here and he is even thinking about staying there on his next San Diego visit.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery New Courtyard\u201d", "Author": "sed953", "ReviewID": "UR17560251", "Content": "This hotel just started taking reservations in May 2008, so it's only about 2 months old.
