The service is top-notch, and the rooms are fine. It's not the trendiest boutique hotel, but I prefer it to their sister hotel, the Park Hyatt, because the GH is better located, an easy 5-min walk to Taksim Square, a major transportation hub and lively dining and shopping district with locals until late in the evening, and it has a nice Grand Club with very high quality bite-size tidbits during their cocktail hour (18:00-20:00). I was very impressed by the improvement in the food quality there last week - yummy, imaginative, and delightful dishes. Drinks selection was fine, including a decent Spanish and Turkish sparkling wine (no champagne though). Service was excellent. Breakfast at the Grand Club was average but good enough. Service was fine but not nearly as good as the evening crew, mostly due to the consistently unsmiling and angry-looking, albeit competent, waitress. The food selection for breakfast at the restaurant on the mezzanine is much better. By the way, the hotel restaurants are currently undergoing renovations, and they have a make-shift restaurant in the mezzanine, serving all 3 meals daily. Also, you'll hear some construction noise throughout the day and into the evening (even past 19:00, even though the workers are supposed to stop by 18:00). There is a decent health club, including use of a sauna and steam room. However, their Turkish hamman is only available by reservation and for a fee, which is a shame, as it is one of the hotel's unique value propositions. I recall having a nice time using the hamman with both locals and hotel guests in the late 90's, when it used to be free and open along with the health club. Now it's just locked up most of the time. Also, the hotel has a nice outdoor pool (but no indoor pool), but unfortunately it's not heated, and I've never been able to use it during all my previous stays, even on sunny, warm days. Finally, I have to commend the staff for excellent service.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dushanbe, Tajikistan", "Title": "\u201cStylish hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "Evginka", "ReviewID": "UR128263508", "Content": "Located in a 5 mints walk from Taksim, it's a good place to stay with easy connections to any part of the city.

As an example, I had room service one night and I had asked for two glasses of wine. When the food arrived, there wasn't enough wine in the bottle for two glasses and so the guy immediately said that this was his fault and that he would get me another glass free of charge and bring it to the room. That's what I loved. There is a problem - how can I fix it - just do whatever is necessary.

The lobby and the common areas of the hotel were impressive. They were updated, clean and very pretty. The pool was also very nice but there were not enough seating at the end of the day. The rooms were okay. They were clean and the bed was very comfortable. The negative part were the rooms were a dated and bland. The main reason why we switched hotels is because we did not like the location. The first night we walked to Taskim Square for dinner. It was crowded, a bit dirty and there weren't any nice restaurants and stores. We became aware that when we needed to go out to dinner we were going to have to take taxis to leave the area. It may have been safe but it did not feel like the best area to be in. It is not a pretty area of the Istanbul.

However, on the third night of our stay my wife was bitten by something while we were sleeping - maybe a spider, not sure what it was but it hurt and she couldn't sleep afterwards - but the front desk was pretty rude when we requested to change rooms. We did end up changing in the end but not without a hassle and we would have preferred to have been treated with more respect when we made the request (especially as I'm a frequent Hyatt guest). First the pros - this is a pretty nice hotel up to most Grand Hyatt standards. Loved the location close to Taksim Square and Istiklal Caddesi (a 5 minute walk) - for my money its much better to stay in this area and enjoy the great restaurants and bars than in Sultanahmet. The metro is right next door as well which makes moving around the city very convenient. Breakfast was very good and the staff were extremely friendly and professional every morning. The bar is nice as well on the mezzanine with some good Turkish wine selections. In the room, the bathroom was incredibly nice and spacious - loved the rain shower. They provide free water twice a day as well. Overall, the room is spacious and no major complaints. The cons - the rooms are getting a bit dated. No flat screen TV, an older one that I used to have ten years ago. The bed was hard as a rock as well and looked worn. As mentioned, the front desk staff can be rude. One other thing I didn't like - after paying $250 a night for a room, I don't think the hotel should nickel and dime their guests by charging 1TL to mail postcards (with stamps already on them). Overall I cant say I would recommend or not recommend the hotel. The pros outweigh the cons, but there are plenty of other properties right next door - Intercontinental, Hilton, Ritz Carlton, W Hotel, Swisshotel - so I might try one of those next time I visit Istanbul.

Stayed at Grand Hyatt Istanbul for 6 nights in November 2010 . Front Office Staff was very RUDE and USELESS . Our travel agency booked and we paid our hotel accomodation on Sept . 2010. requested for an early check in and connecting rooms . I even called the hotel front office 2 days prior to our arrival to confirm our request of interconnecting room . Arrived Istanbul at early morning as stated on our reservation confirmation . To horror of all horrors .. after a whole night of travel .First , Mr. Murat has told us that our reservation was cancelled by our travel agency . No explanation at all .Got to call our Travel agency overseas many times . My husband told them we got a voucher and reservation confirmation No. 45160645. We paid our hotel accomodation on Sept . 2010. A month and a half before our arrival to Istanbul . Why does Mr. Murat doesn't focused on the name indicated in the hotel voucher and the reservation confirmation . No rooms available for us even we got a voucher and a Grand Hyatt confirmation of reservation with a request of interconnecting room . We understood that the hotel is fully booked and normal check in time was 14;00 p.m but what we were requesting was a connecting room because I have my children with me . I think all mothers would do the same . Front office Staff was offering a room ,3 rooms apart from each other . We are all exhausted for travelling the whole night and waited for our room till 14:00 p.m. Only one room was available . Very distressing . Front Office Staff was very useless, kept on blaming our travel agency eventhough we kept on telling that we have Grand Hyatt Istanbul confirmation number .We sounded like a broken discarded CD. They kept on confusing us by saying that our reservation in another name was cancelled though it was very crystal clear that the name indicated in our hotel voucher and the Grand Hyatt confirmation No. 45160645 was very valid .The front office Mr. Murat was very unreasonable and twisting everything .No hospitality or kind gesture at all . We even requested for a room besides each other if no connecting room available. Being a helpless tourist family in Istanbul ,One of my son was already sleeping in the sofa and my 5 year old daughter was too sleepy , we agreed as family of 5 to be squeezed in 1 room with 4 big suitcases in the 7th floor .Waiting again for another room far away as it was was being prepared . Five minutes promised waiting becomes. another hours . I kept on calling our travel agency in Dubai and my phone bill amounted equal to a one night stay . The drama kept on going as the Front Office Manager entered the scene as I requested to speak to the GM of the Hotel. . F. O. Manager kept on blaming us and our travel Agency . His voice was very loud in the telephone . I explained to him that since September 2010 we paid our hotel and I even called Grand Hyatt prior to our arrival . I told him that we have reservation No. 45160645 from Grand Hyatt Istanbul . He told me that other guest have confirmation for interconneting room before they arrived Istanbul .I asked him how the other guest avail the interconnecting room confirmation . How come they havent told me when I called the front office prior to our arrival . I even aked how the other customers avail of interconnecting room confirmation . His answer was twisted again . Kept blaming our travel agency and told me that If I have a confirmation of interconnecting room they will upgrade us to a suite . Making the matter worse than solving it . I told the Front Office Manager , Mr. Furqan that our travel agency is one of the biggest and reliable in Dubai but if we need to take legal action.. we will do so . Suddenly with a speed faster than lightning and Superman , He offered us 2 room besides each other on the 6th floor . 2 rooms besides each other suddenly dropped from the sky . What a great way to start our holiday ... our first tour was cancelled because of Grand Hyatt front office staff . Front Office Staff focused on blaming instead solving the issue . They made the guest feel unwelcome , helpless and hopeless . Grand Hyatt Istanbul F and B Department were EXCELLENT . Thay are exceptional in many ways . Staff at the Agora Buffet breakfast are attentive and cheerful . Wide selection of food and the Simit Local bread was delicious .We dined for 5 nights through Room Service . Staff of Room Service and their Chefs were exceptional and the gave us the finest in dining . The king prawns , tomato spaghetti , yogurtlu kofte , spring chicken ,urfa kebab ,beef burger ,cheesecake are savory . F and B Department made our stay in Istanbul worthy . Housekeeping Staff always kept our room fresh and neat . They always make sure our simple request were granted like ironing board and the iron . The lady answering the phone for HK was courteous. Warmest Thanks to the all the Staff of Grand Hyatt Istanbul excluding the Front Office and Concierge . I hope . Mr. Jan Peter van der Ree,General Manager of Grand Hyatt Istanbul understood the situation we 've been through . Kindly do the needful .Please give proper training of Customer Service to all your Front Office Staff and Concierge.They must learn to respect the guest and to deal with courtesy . This will be our first and last stay in any Hyatt Hotel. BITA Tours toured us for four days . Amazing Istanbul. Visited Blue Mosque , Topkapi Palace Hagia Sophia , Dolmabahce Palace , Bhosporus Cruise , Spice Bazaar and Princes' Island . From Grand Hyatt we walked several times to Istiklal Cadessi .

However, nothing was particularly exceptional, and there were some service flaws, leading me to conclude that this is a rather average 5-star hotel with a heavy price tag. In regards to service issues, they put me in a smoking room initially, although my office had reserved all non-smoking rooms. Then, I never received a wake-up call the first morning I was there, and the next morning, they called an hour too early. Although apologetic on all fronts, it still didn't change the fact that there were a few screw-ups. Also, during meals, the waiters continuously interrupted our table discussions to try to take away dishes that were clearly still being consumed. It became a running joke at the conference... hold your plate and fork so they don't grab them when you turn your head!

The hotel has a nice lobby and atmosphere, and there are staff around to assist... service was good to excellent, especially in the restaurant. Overall I can't say I liked Istanbul or Turkey much, as soon as you get into the airport the billing commences. Buy your little sticker for your passport for 45 euros, no checking or anything involved, just gouge you because they can. This type of thing extends to the taxi drivers... 3 out of 5 attempted to scam me, and one did nail me when I dropped my guard (did a bill switch on me). The cab drivers will try to take you an out of the way route, or run without the meter on, or start the meter high. So be aware, ask your hotel what the expected cab fare will be before going to your location. Ask the cab driver for the expected fare before getting in. Watch the meter at all times. The bill switch scam works when you give them a large bill for change, if you drop your attention, say fussing with a wallet or purse, they will switch the bill and wave a small bill in your face like you got the currency wrong. I fell for one of those after a long day walking around. Back to the Hyatt, in-room you're going to be paying about $15/night for internet, anything from the minibar will be very expensive (about $9.00 for a can of Coke for instance). I had to send some faxes, and the charge per page worked out to about six euro. So a ten page fax will run you about $80.00. If you're stuck and need to fax it, they have you nailed. Buffet breakfast I think ran to about $40 which is pretty expensive for an omlette and sides. I hate this feeling of being nailed and of being gouged, but that was the entire experience of Istanbul. I don't think the Taksim square location is anything great, the few business hotels side by side there are nestled in an ugly area. The old town of Constantinople/Byzantium/Istanbul was much nicer by comparison. I followed a recommendation from this site to stay on the Taksim side and that I think was really not for me, maybe if you are going to hang out in bars every night. The rooms are adequate in this hotel and comfortable, I found them to be quiet. The food was also adequate, nothing special, but not bad. If you have to go for business and your company is paying for everything, well I guess that is what this hotel is for. For a tourist, you probably have better choices. The sights of the old town are magnificent and it is maybe worth a visit for them, but overall with all the charges and scams I would say pass on visiting Turkey and go somewhere else. Also any tourist areas were really jam packed, so you are elbow to elbow with people in some areas to the point of being claustrophobic. There is no concept of queuing in Turkey either. If you are slow to move forward someone will step into your spot, if you pause at all you are roadkill. Even if you defend your zone trying to move forward people will try to advance from behind you and squeeze in front of you anyway.

We opted to pay extra to stay on the Club Level. I have done this in the past at Hyatt (Melbourne, among others), because having the free wi fi and free breakfast makes up for the extra cost. I requested a Bosphorus room several months in advance and we got one (room 951). Because of the Ritz Carlton blocking the view, be forewarned that it is only a partial view, but it is worth it nonetheless. (It was great seeing the weekend fireworks from the room). I also requested a baklava plate which never came (but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charged for it). As expected, the room was spacious by European standards; pretty much what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a Grand Hyatt club level. A couple of complaints: At the Club Level lounge, the waiters hover incessantly and even get in your face. There is an espresso machine set up for guests to make their own coffee, but the waiters would clearly prefer to do it and give you nasty looks if you want to do it yourself. Taking food or drink from the lounge is forbidden, and this is enforced. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not much of a breakfast person; my preference is to get a decent cup of coffee and take it back to my room while I get ready. Twice I was stopped and told not to do this. I certainly understand that the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want guests loading up on sandwiches, drinks, or yogurts to take with them during the day, but for heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake! I just wanted a coffee! The second irritant was that, even on the club level, the hotel charges 1 TL to send a postcard. C\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon! This is a charge for each stamped card! Kind of petty considering what you pay for a room. One of the best things we did was book the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jet lag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkish hamam at the hotel just hours after flying in from San Francisco. I read a good deal beforehand about hamams in Istanbul; the consensus among many was that they are set up for tourists.

Good call. I really felt like the steam and the scrubbing took away all the flight nastiness and indeed helped with the jet lag. Not cheap, though. Security is tight at this property and the pool and the service at the pool is great. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we stayed in Taksim instead of the old part of the town; we had some qualms about this, knowing we would be spending most of our time there, but it turned out to be a good call, and I would recommend this to anyone not wanting to be in the thick of tourists. We found some great places to eat with lots of locals on the little side streets of Istiklal, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we would have experienced this in Sultanahmet.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for, but you pay a lot.\u201d", "Author": "PerfectStay", "ReviewID": "UR67427673", "Content": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad to be able to say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a true 5 stars experience at this hotel.

This hotel has all of that, but what makes it the 5 stars is the service. There were a lot of staff around and they were really helpful true out my stay.

The congress venue as well as the hotel hosting participants was the Hyatt on top of the very central Taksim Sq.. The check-in was quick and as I arrived with an early flight, I needed a nap before venturing in the city. The room was spacious and nicely furnished. I slipped into my bed and slept for some two hours. During the last few years I remark that most hotels have understood the importance of bedding and the Hyatt knows about it. The bedding was relaxing, the bedsheets of good soft cotton quality. Before going out, I passed by the restaurant for a light lunch. A courteous assistant showed me to my table. The self-service buffet selection of well known Turkish plates was what you would expect from a high class restaurant and the broiled meat corner offered delicious meat selections broiled on the spot for you. The congress was well organised but there is a big but and this concerns the lack of wi-fi broadband connection in the congress area. Nowadays, the availability of wi-fi broadband in international congresses is a must, since not only are the presentations live streamed but also participants live comment in their social media. Cutting off a conference from the outside world is deplorable and I cannot understand why the hotels want to sell it as extra. Broadband IS A STAPLE for business venues and business travellers. I think that event organisers should base their venue selection, among other, also on the availability of broadband connection in the event premises, and negotiate special discounted rates for participants staying in the hotel.

It was business trip. We had a groupe of around 20-25 people who stayed in 15 rooms in Hayatt. It was terrible. The attitude of staff is on the level of 3* hotel. I needed to use Internet often and print a lot of copies of different documents. The policy of the hotel is not frlxible for groups and they don't give any discounts or at leats free smiles. But 4 facts were just embarassing: 1. Internet. There is no free wi-fi area at all. Prices for the Internet like this is the only hotel with Internet in Istanbul. 2. I asked to provide a hotel car to meet new arriving group of 4 people in the airport. Decent car with a driver with a card - basic service for any decent hotel. Consierge said - \"we don't have such a service\". I was shocked then, but asked to find some outsourcing taxi service, and he replied: \"We have hundreds of taxi services in Istanbul, do you want me to call all of them?\" (NO comments) 3. I needed to buy a basic chair (for the show). Asked on the reception where I can do it. The guy sent me to Istiklal strret. The ones who know this street will laugh at this advise. For the ones who don't know - this street is crowdy touristic street full of caffes, restaurants and clothes shops. To buy a chair there - mission impossible. 4. We were having a drink in the most cosy and nice bar in the hotel - the one with the fire-place. It was Friday or even Satturday night. We were in the \"drinking mood\" not in terms of aggressive level but in terms of volume of drinks. The waiter came to us at 30 mins past midnight and said that the bar will be closed soon. I tried to talk to him in a nice way, in an angry way but no reaction. He said that we can order a drinks from the room service and drink it at the lobby (not ath the lobby bar but just LOBBY). As a matter of fact one of the guys we were drinking with was the Russian Ballet Start (I mean really well-known and famous). But as I said earlier, the Hayatt policy is \"NO EXCEPTIONS\". It won't be surprise if I say that those 4 points are unacceptable for 5* hotel !!!! Also the size of hammam is too small for 5*. And no indoor swimming pool. As for the good points: great rooms, amazing view on Bosphorus, basic but quite tasty breakfast. Output: Worse possible value for money. For the same money you can stay in Ciragan Palace Kempinsky 5* with heated outdoor swimming pool, free wi-fi zone at the lobby and atmosphere of Ottoman Palace.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, UK", "Title": "\u201cLeft with a bad taste due to service and poor breakfast\u201d", "Author": "aoghnasmac", "ReviewID": "UR64394779", "Content": "As other reviewers have experiecned, the Grand Hyatt is an OK hotel in as far as public areas and rooms are concerned but is badly let down by the poor service attitude of the front desk staff in particular.

It has recently been upgraded to a Grand Hyatt. The staff was warm, friendly and very helpful with sightseeing tips. The rooms are big and what you expect from a Hyatt. Some of the rooms have views of the Bosphorus, others overlook the pool area. We enjoyed the Turkish breakfast buffet in the mornings. It's pricey but was generous enough that we were able to skip lunch most days. The pool area looked very inviting and would be nice during warmer weather. If you have time, the spa is a very nice place to relax after a long day sightseeing. I enjoyed the facial very much. There are two restaurants in the hotel, both are good. There are plenty of restaurants in the Taksim area as well for dinner. The Hyatt is close to Taksim Square so you will need to find transportation across the water to the old town area to see all the main sites (Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, etc). We took taxis to go to Sultanmahet (about 20 TL each way) every day. We walked to old town one time across the bridge but it was a long walk and not very relaxing with cars speeding past. We were in Istanbul for the week of New Year's and experienced different weather conditions almost every day. It was sunny and 16C a couple of days, but would dip down to freezing at night. Other days we had heavy rain and one night even had some light snow. It was quite windy as well. I recommend bringing lots of layers and a good coat. We skipped the Bosphorus cruise because the water looked quite rough. Based on the recommendation of the Hyatt concierge, we opted to take the overnight tour to see the cave dwellings in Cappadocia (a World Heritage Site). It was the highlight of our trip and highly recommended! We booked the tour through the Hyatt and it was all inclusive (airfare, hotel, meals, private guide and private car with driver for two days) for about 300 TL for 4 people. It was well worth it! The 4th century cave dwellings and churches were amazing as were the bizarre rock formations throughout this area. It was incredible to see. The guide was fantastic and took time to show us some of the local life such as how the village women bake their bread in an outdoor communal oven. We had hot bread to take with us as a snack and it was delicious. It was quite cold with some snow and ice on the ground. The hotel in Uchisar was tucked up against the cliff but was not actually a \"cave hotel\" as some of the hotels in the area are. If this is important to you, specify at the time of booking. The hotel was clean but not luxurious in any way but it was fine for one night. Note: the Hyatt allowed us to check out of our rooms for one night (storing our luggage) so we did not have to pay for the night we were gone.

It's about an hour walk to Ortokoy, but on a Sunday morning before the traffic hits it's a nice stroll and you get to walk pass Dolmabache and Ciragan palaces. It's really quite central, and if you have 4 days or more, I think Taksim area hotels in general are more convenient than Sultanahmet hotels, especially if you like late nights... Service: Generally very good - professional, helpful, friendly. Although we were with a Turkish speaker, I don't imagine you would have a problem with communication. There's a young lady in the Regency Club who must be commended for exemplary services (and of course I forget her name). She was just very friendly and helpful during the check in process and always has a wonderful smile every time we see her. Food: I suppose food always taste better free, but the breakfast buffet was excellent. Full Turkish breakfast (cheeses, olives, simits, pastirma, fresh fruits, yogurt, etc.) as well as an egg station for omelet and fried eggs. The pastries were very nice. The Regency lounge has water and soft drinks all day, as well as alcohol during between 6-8p. Gym/Pool: Gym is clean, but basic in terms of equipment. There's a sauna and steam in the locker room which is free. It looks nice... The pool space is great. There's hardly anyone using it though. It looks just like the picture on the hotel's website. Room: The standard is about 400 sqft, which is a very good size. If you are on the 9th floor and above, and if your room face the Bosphorus, then you'll get the amazing view. Otherwise, you'll see the city or the university right in front of the hotel. If having the Bosphorus view is important to you, be careful. The suite is large, probably around 700 sqft, much larger than I need but I won't complain. The bathroom with the separate shower stall is deluxe. Overall, this is one of the nicer Hyatt Regency hotels. So if it's within your budget range and you don't expect Four Seasons lux, you'll be happy.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPricey - obviously - but rather nice...Penguin Family Review.\u201d", "Author": "Penguin_Family_1", "ReviewID": "UR42090940", "Content": "Of course it's pricey - it's a Hyatt and therefore gets lots of business travellers with expense accounts.

It is very rarely that I experience door systems that actually do keep the water inside the shower stall. Thus time I had a new flooding record.

Another annoying policy of the hotel (and the Ritz-Carlton too so it may be standard practice) is that prices are quoted in Euros when you reserve the room but you are charged in Turkish Lira when you check out.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the small gift shop near the front desk, which surprised me with authentic crafts and a sharp storekeeper who helped me pinpoint the location of an especially tough-to-find local handiwork near one of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ancient markets. He knew his stuff. The only drawback of the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrific old-Istanbul location is somewhat problematic access to the new business center a few miles north of the Taksim area. This is a relatively minor criticism, though. Taxis are plentiful and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just a bit adventurous, you can even take the subway from Taksim into the new business district and glimpse the flow of life for the average Istanbul commuter. The Hyatt Regency honors the legendary city in which it sits and is worthy of your consideration.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but be aware of the price of coffee!\u201d", "Author": "SelinaE", "ReviewID": "UR10052774", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights on a stop over at Istanbul.

The room had a wardrobe with a safe and lots of services from washing your clothes to ironing them.It had 2 huge extremely comfortable beds and a desk with free internet access.Also it had 2 sofas and tables like a small living room.Of course tv and a mini bar very equipped although expensive.Be very careful because if you try to take something out the cost is added to your bill at once.I tried to fit some cheese we bought outside and saw on the special channel that you have on the tv,with your account details that i was instantly charged.I called the reception and they took care of it. The hotel offers an amazing breakfast,promised to make you full until dinner.Once again the staff is very polite and warm.Also because you have to be very careful where you eat outside a good suggestion is the 2 restaurants the hotel has,a pricey but lovely Italian and a very good value for money turkish.The Italian is a nice idea for a romantic dinner for a couple.The Turkish is quite nice for lunch also. I would also recomend while staying at the hotel to visit the hamam and the massage rooms,the lovely gym and the very stylish pool surrounded by gardens.. The cost of the twin room was 250 euro,a very reasonable price for the luxury and the service of this hotel.I would definately visit again during a warm month to have the chance to actually dive in the superb pool.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMini Bar Charges - Has to be a joke\u201d", "Author": "brysal", "ReviewID": "UR7868214", "Content": "I am at the Hyatt Istanbul and having a great stay.

I therefore cannot really comment on the value-for-money side of things. However, I would like to say that, the free room notwithstanding, our experience was excellent in every way. Location is really good, 5 min walk to Taksim, 10 min to Nisantasi, handy for Bosphorus villages. The hotel building itself is a bit of a monster, built in a 'palazzo' style but completely ruined by horrible smoked reflective windows. It is positively lovely compared to the Intercontinenal and Ritz Carlton however ! Check-in was great, we were upgraded to a suite, and were asked what time we would like to check out on the last day. 2:30 pm was not a problem. The suite was huge, bigger than my first apartment, and was nicely (although blandly) decorated. There was a small kitchen area, a huge living room and bedroom, a large cloakroom and dressing room, and a huge bathroom with walk-in shower. Windows on two sides as it was a corner location, with a view of the pool area. Everything was spotlessly clean, as it was throughout the hotel. All staff were courteous and helpful, and I experienced no problems with surly security at the front door - we were not scanned once. Restaurant reservations and taxi requests were made efficiently. Canapes and drinks in the executive lounge and the buffet breakfast were of excellent quality. I was also surprised that the Turkish wine they served in the lounge was really nice ! I agree with other reviews that the room-service food and hotel restaurants were very expensive, however I would not consider eating dinner in the hotel (unless very pushed for time) with all the nearby restaurants to choose from. Unfortunately the pool area was closed (it doesn't open until June), but I think the weather we experienced was unseasonally warm, so normally there would be no desire to sit outside in April ! It looked very nice though. I would come back in an instant, although next time I will be paying and would probably not stretch to a suite !", "Date": "April 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg", "Title": "\u201cvery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "travelxyz", "ReviewID": "UR6916035", "Content": "Having read the previous reviews I already travelled to istanbul with mixed feelings, in particualr as I have already stayed many times in other Istanbul Hotels such as the Swissotel, The Ciragan Kempinski, The Hilton and the Four Seasons. Howerver, this time it was a long 4 week stay and I was able to get a good deal so that we decided for the Hyatt. The location is good and very convenient but the staff at the reception definelty lacks training and friendliness. The cleaning was EXTREMELY poor. Having complained after 10 nights that the desk hasn't been wiped once and dust was piling up allover the room I just received a stupid reply rather than a professional sorry and after the 26th night it still hasnt been wiped!!!!! Furthermore, certain things (not valueable) disappeared from the room and after having indicated this to the reception I just received another stupid reply and not even an apology. Furthermore,bathrooms and rooms in general are not fitted with the obvious such as cotton pads etc so that we ended up going to the local drugstore piling up on bathroom essentials.... As already indicated by other travellers, the prices for drinks etc in the hotel are extremely high and the food in the restaurants at the hotel is extremely poor!

The Hotel is very well located a brief 5 minute walk from the Taksim square, and a 10 minute walk from the best shopping area of the city. Location wise I rate it a 5/5. The staff was not at its best during check in (I am not quite sure how much the fact that we are Greek affected them...). I won't go into details, but I would not call the check in \"polite and friendly\". From there on, all the staff of the Hotel was very nice, but I guess they did not know where we were from... So a 3/5 for the staff. The hotel in general is modern, and well maintained. Yes, there is airport like security at the entrance, but this is standard for all serious hotels in the city, and it does not bother me at all. After all, there have been bombs going off in this city in the past... The room was clean, large, modern, and well appointed. The bathroom was large and included a very nice walk in shower and a bathtub, and has a window to the rest of the room. Not too many nice amenities though. The bed is very comfortable, and there are tons of great statelite TV channels to watch. Also, we got a room with a view towards the street, which also overlooked the sea, which was nice. Overall, the room gets a 4/5. The breakfast is really good, and you should make sure to include it in your rate. Full buffet, with local and international delicacies. 5/5 on this.

I spent 3 nights in February 2007 at the Hyatt Regency Istanbul and found the staff to be professional, attentive and cordial. Yes, the lobby entrance is outfitted with a metal detector portal and bag searches---but I found the Hyatt staff who maintain this operation to be considerate and speedy, not bureaucratic and unfriendly. As an American-franchise business hotel in a city that suffered Al-Queda bombings in 2003 of British and Jewish targets, I think that I understand the reasons for taking extra security measures that may seem unusual for a hotel lobby in other parts of the world. (While I was staying at the hotel, seven of the 2003 bombing suspects were sentenced by Turkish courts to life in prison. Security measures were, perhaps, on higher alert in Istanbul than usual.) The King size bed in my room had wonderful pillows and duvet, a terrific mattress, and great reading lights at hand on both sides of the bed. (I find that many hotels do not pay enough attention to good reading lights near the bed.) The bathroom was terrific: large, marble floor and wall surfaces; a separate shower area (with a large Rain Shower head); a deep-soaking tub; and complimentary use of thick cotton robes. The hotel delivered complimentary coffee to my 3rd floor room each morning. I passed on the room service breakfast---but the staff who delivered the coffee never pressured me to go with the Hyatt breakfast service. Internet service is 20 Euros for a 24-hour period. Not cheap, but the service a dependable and high-speed. As other reviewers have commented, in-room water bottles and mini-bar goods are expensive at this hotel. But I expect that at business hotels. A grocery store around the corner (on Cumhuriyet Caddesi) provided for me lots of choices of liter-size bottles of water, juices and milk, and I simply stocked up on the first day, and used the freely available ice machine down the hall and the wine goblets and glasses in the hotel room to keep myself well hydrated.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Mean Service\u201d", "Author": "DoubleBakedPork", "ReviewID": "UR6694486", "Content": "This hotel is one terrible hotel.
