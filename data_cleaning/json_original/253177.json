{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Would not recommend The room had no airconditioning (in July) and so had to leave windows open to get clean air (lobby and stairwell was extremely smoky from cigarettes). Room faced on to a park where the disco was on the other side of small park and people yelled most/all night during the 2 nights we were there.The carpet was absolutely disgustingly dirty. Used our shoes or thick socks to walk.Linens and bathroom were clean. Typical small limited European room. We would have moved if we had to have stayed longer and were not so tired from travelling and on our way home.

We had a two night stop on our way back from West Africa. The hotel was 20 minutes by subway from the airport, and 5 minute walk from station. The front desk were very friendly, helpful, and polite. The rooms were above average for a budget hotel, clean, as was the breakfast room. The cable TV was the only negative, not into porn movies. The area is not seedy as noted in other reviews, you are only 5-10 walk to central shopping district, on Thursday and Saturday they have a farmers market, with wine and beer. Skip the negative reviews, we travel a lot, and for a budget this was above average, would even reccomend it for our parents.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR307799960", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jackelowna"}, {"Content": "Won't be going back Have just spent the weekend at the Luxor. We were a bit disappointed to be honest. Obviously the very high temperatures of the weekend were not the hotel's fault, but with no air con, the rooms were totally unbearable at night. The website states coffee/tea-making facilities, but we didn't have this in our room. A tiny circle of soap was left in the bathroom each morning, but I would have liked a small amount of shower gel or shampoo. We also lugged a laptop all the way (had to do some work) and was informed that to use the internet in the room cost a lot of money, so I didn't bother.All in all, we had a disappointing weekend - we were caught out with RyanAir's rip-off policy of not allowing you to combine your weight allowance in one suitcase. We were charged \u62e244 for excess baggage. We only had 23kg and the allowance for 2 people is \u62e230. Outrageous!!!!!

Laterooms[--] promptly passed my credit card detials to the hotel (without my consent) where the hotel took a further payment of EUR 180.00 - this was the 2 may. I returned from my holidays to find that instead of refunding this EUR 180.00 - they charged it AGAIN (24 May). I am still fighting to get a refund on both these extra charges, however unfortunately as we do not have the receipt (from 2 months ago) it dosent seem we can do much about it.Both the hotel and Laterooms[--] have been very unhelpfull, in fact Laterooms[--] told me that it is now my problem to deal with the hotel direct, they dont have anything to do with it. Beware - do not leave any credit card detials with them (or Laterooms[--]) - pay cash, they are not reasonable people.

Definatly an Egyptian feel to the place in a kitsch kind of way, with various ornaments scattered around. Clean and welcoming, the double room we were allocated was of a good size and contained all the neccesities including CNN and BBC World. Bathroom was spotless, although the shower was not working, the bath was deep and the water was hot. Towels were changed everyday, so too were the cotton sheets. The owner of the hotel reminded me of an eastern Basil Fawlty, if you asked him for anything, it seemed to be a big deal for him, avoid him if you have a short fuse. We found him entertaining though. A filling hot buffet breakfast was served until 10am, with all the usual german breakfast treats. The breakfast room was bright and clean with a selection of various european diners and a group of our American cousins. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the cental attractions of Frankfurt and a 2 minute walk to the beautiful river Main. There is a hidden gem of a park directly behind the hotel. Take your own travelling iron, because to my cost they informed me that the maid had lost the hotel one!
