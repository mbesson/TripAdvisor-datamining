Instead, the hotel messed up our reservation and gave us probably the nicest room in the hotel. We had a queen bed, a private bathroom, a TV, and a lot of space. And we paid the same rate we had booked for. Oh, and we were supposed to have to haul our luggage up to the third floor, but this room was on the main floor.The staff were friendly, but not always easy to communicate with. The night man, while very friendly, spoke no English, and apparently my Italian was nearly unintelligible to him (probably true). The woman during the day spoke a lot more English, and was very helpful. She booked us a day trip out to Siena and Pisa, which was a highlight of our trip.Overall, we had a great experience. The train station is two blocks away, the river is two blocks away, and the old city centre is no more than 10 minutes walk away. It was a great place to stay, but then, we got a little lucky on the room switch. If we had gotten the room we were supposed to, I doubt we'd have liked it as much.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR532354336", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cfrydj"}, {"Content": "This was a great hotel This hotel is located just about two blocks from the train station.

I think that is really good value frankly. I regularly stay in London on my own and my company limits me to a maximum of \u62e2100 per night for a hotel and it is extremely difficult to find one for that price. Anyway, the hotel wasn't dirty but it could have done with a spruce up. The air conditioning in our room didn't work. A trip to the desk got a very helpful caretaker to come and look at it and fix it. Silly us for not realising there was an on/off switch hidden behind a curtain on the other side of the room. Doh! When it was working it was quiet and effective. The TV didn't work very well. Grainy picture and no obvious way to change channels (no remote). But I didn't go to Florence to watch the TV so I really didn't care.I saw the bathrooms that other reviewers have mentioned, the ones where water goes everywhere. Our room was en-suite (for \u62e245 per night!) though and the shower was a perfectly decent cubicle type. I think the wet room ones are just the communal ones (yuk!). I didn't bother with breakfast as I was always too full of wine and pizza from the previous night. My partner did though and she said that the coffee was nasty and cold. The food was prepackaged buns and stuff. Glad i didn't bother really.The location of this place is definitely a winner though. It's 5 minutes from the train station and 10 minutes from the centre of Florence if you stroll gently past the many restaurants and bars and interesting shops. Brilliant location.All in all I think it was fantastic value if all you want is somewhere to bed down for the night. If you want a hotel room to live in, pay more.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR608520127", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "carlyoungcat"}, {"Content": "Budget Hotel, but it was OK this hotel was definitely very budget, but was only 2 blocks from main train station, and walking distance to Ponte Vecchio and other main attractions. My husband  I stayed here, we're in our early 30's, so it wasn't bad for us. The neighborhood isn't the best, but had a great little market on the corner, and a local bar down the street, Public Place, where the local college exchange students hung out. They served a decent breakfast every morning, and had an A/C with decent size rooms. Yes, the shower is completely open and is part of the whole bathroom, but it wasn't a problem for us. For the price, it's OK. If you're looking for something budget but decent, this will work for you. We were there 2 days and experienced no problems. There are a flight of stairs to get to the lobby, so you'll have to deal with that. Otherwise, it was cool. It's different, but then again, added to our overall traveling experience.

I recommend you ask for extra towels to block the door so the water doesn't seep into the room. The hotel is very near the train station, which was convenient for arrival and departure.
