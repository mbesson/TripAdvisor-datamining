We arrive to a tight, overheated room (yes, we did let the staff know that the room was exceptionally warm) with no working television, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. We consider our troubles to have begun the next morning, when we woke up early to see a little more of the town and then catch our flight out. Instead, my clothing was soaked and stained from the radiator busting overnight. I called down to ask what can they do, can they clean my pants, I was only traveling with one pair. No, they said they could do nothing. They didn't even show concern for the water in the room. A hour and half later, I gave up on trying to try the pants with a hair dryer (as it had stopped working) and left the room in thermals. I went down to speak to the front desk while my boyfriend was still in the room. The ladies at the front desk all told me they could do nothing. I asked for their manager and waited almost an hour for him. His first words to me were, \"What are you doing to flood the room\". It didn't get any better from there. During the time that I waited, the manager had sent personnel into the room (keep in mind, I had reported the problem 3 hours prior and they hadn't sent anyone and at the time they did send someone, we had still not checked out). Despite having already sent someone (again, unbeknownst to my boyfriend and me), he asked that he be shown the damage in the room in addition to the damaged clothing I was already displaying to him (another stall tactic). He acknowledged that the radiator burst but took no responsibility for the damage it caused. What's worse is that he said that there was nothing he could do about it. When I directly asked that we not be charged for the room, he laughed at me and said, \"You are joking\". I asked him why we were made to wait for over an hour on his decision if he had no power to correct the problem. He then gave an e-mail address, no name, of someone who could be contacted for resolve. As you can image, that his statements all came across as rude and disrespectful, no apology or acceptance of responsibility. We lost 3 hours of our time in London and I caught a cold, presumably from walking around, in the cold, in long-underwear. A week later, I haven't received a response to the polite, professional e-mail my boyfriend sent to the given address, but I pledge to update this post should there be a reply (but I think we all know that an email address is a brush off). While I waited in the lobby, I heard one customer complain about the nature of the food and the hotel receptionist respond that that wasn't their fault because they had order food from an outside restaurant since their hotel was under renovations. Three other hotel guests were appalled they were asked to pay 15 pounds to hold their, in total, 3 small bags for the day. During a common check out time, not one customer had anything nice to say about their stay which let me know that our incident was not an unfortunate coincidence but the result of bad management of a subpar hotel.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes", "Title": "\u201cVery basic\u201d", "Author": "ldeayton", "ReviewID": "UR120588472", "Content": "In fairness my room was clean, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine although there was no water pressure.

Beware that 3 star in London or the rest of the UK is not the same as 3 stars in the U.S. We knew this going in, however we were still disappointed. We had a triple room, and just wanted it for a place to sleep and shower. It's small, like all rooms in London, and outdated decor. Those things I can deal with. The bugs on the window sill that were there on arrival and never cleaned throughout our stay is another matter. The toilets would not flush completely, and there was mold in the heater next to the window that caused our allergies to go ballistic. Staff knocked on our door at 11:10 a.m. the last day of our stay when we were gathering our bags to check out, and said in a threatening manner, \"check out is at 11, and you need to leave NOW!\" They also refused to print a confirmation for our travel plans, saying they did not have a printer, which we know wasn't true. The bar is unaccomodating and the front desk staff is unhelpful. You have to buy a drink to use the Internet kiosks, but aren't told it is for 30 consecutive minutes. I logged off after 10 minutes thinking I could save my time for later in the evening. When I returned in an hour, the bartender said there was nothing she could do to help. The doors in the hallway slam loudly at all hours of the night, and I heard my next door neighbors doing their thing very clearly. It's not a loud location per se, it's just that the rooms don't have a lot of privacy and you can hear people in the hallway or other rooms. I even heard the throat clearing of the guy in the shower next door. They are also not air conditioned like most of London, and it's hot and uncomfortable at times. Overall, the bad reviews are true, but it was just a place to sleep and shower. It's location is good. 5-7 minute walk to Gloucester Road underground stop, which is right on the circle line. Also, there is a grocery store and many restaurant options nearby. I just think you get what you pay for, and this place is cheap for London and comparable to other hotels in its star class. You don't get a nice place for that price. It's just too bad the staff is so rude. As Americans, we have to be extra nice to represent our country well abroad, but the Ambassadors hotel does not return the favor to represent London well.

I was with my 14 year old son for goodness sake. I tried calling down to the front desk only to find out that our phone didn't work. I went down to the front desk to ask for a larger room with beds that didn't physically touch and also had a working phone only to be told that they were fully booked and I would have to wait until the next day. During this time, there was a problem with part of my vacation and I NEEDED a telephone. Since the phone in our room wasn't working, I asked if they could dial a local number for me from the house phone in the lobby. Nooooo, that phone only RECEIVES calls. So I asked where a payphone was only to be dismissed with a wave of a hand. I asked for change for the payphone...NOOOOOO they can't provide change for the payphone either. Finally, in tears from frustration, I demanded to know where exactly the payphone was and was given the answer of \"on Cromwell Road\". Beautiful. Reluctantly somebody finally dialled the number I needed (on the house phone that only RECEIVES calls) and I was able to make my call. The next day, I came down and asked if they had another room ready for me. Nope. Needless to say, it took 4 days before they changed our room. It was slightly larger, and at least there was some space between the beds. However, there was a massive ball of thread or yarn or something in the corner of the room when we checked in. Not a big deal but I decided to leave it there to see how long before it was noticed or cleaned up. Needless to say, it was still there when we checked out. Housekeeping consisted of them coming in and making the beds and folding the towels. Not once was anything actually CLEANED. I wouldn't stay in this [--] again if you paid me. The front desk guy is the rudest, meanest, [--] I've ever met. I requested a late checkout til 2 pm and they told me no problem. Just call down in the morning to remind us. I said okay. I called in the a.m. to remind them of the arrangement I had made the night before for a checkout of 2 p.m. \"No problem\" I was told. So the day of checkout, my son and I are out and about doing our last minute London things. We get back to the hotel at 1:15 to a yelling front desk clerk. He said he's been trying to call my room and there has been no answer. No [--] sherlock, we're just getting back. He is absolutely livid that I was supposed to be gone at 11 and I'm still there and if I don't check out they are charging me 135 pounds. I told him I had an arrangement (with him of all fricking people) to check out late. Anyway, he rants and raves for awhile. I go upstairs to finish packing and now it's housekeeping banging on my door telling me to get out. OMFG!!! These people are whacked!!! So I finally get everything packed and we're downstairs in the lobby by 1:30. Mr. Personality at the front desk is still ranting and raving. I told him that obviously there was a miscommunication and that I was out in plenty of time for housekeeping to \"clean\" the room. He did not charge me 135 pounds (but even if he did, I would have disputed the transaction with my credit card company). And get this, I get back home to Canada the next day and there is a message on my answering machine from the nutjob at the front desk telling me if I'm not out of the hotel by 2 pm they are charging me 135 pounds. Now seriously, what are the fricking chances that I'm actually going to receive a message left for me in Canada when I'm in LONDON!!! I would never, ever, in a million years recommend this hotel to anybody, not even my worst enemy.

Mould was growing from the walls and the skirting boards were rotting, which affected my asthma. We went to reception and the receptionists looked worried but agreed to move us to another room. This was a triple, and had no heating apart from one small electric heater which took nearly an hour to heat up. We could have dealt with this if it wasn't for the shower also not working (only cold water would come out of the taps!). Again, we got moved to another room, this time on the fifth floor, which was the worst of the lot. There was mould growing from the ceiling, tiles coming away from the bathroom floor, blood on the bedsheets, womens hair on the towels and beds (this can't be ours as i have short hair and my friend has blonde hair whereas this is long black hair). My friend and I couldn't be doing with another argument with the very rude management so decided to put up with the room as it was only for one night, only to find that after Id showered, the bathroom floor was flooded in about an inch of water, ruining my clothes (which i hadn't expected to be in danger when i left on the floor!!). When we went downstairs to speak to management, we were told that there was only one member of staff until nine the next morning, who was a newly trained, obviously very nervous reception who ddn't speak the best english. We cleared the water up best we could with the few handtowels we were given and wentt out. In the morning we had out \"full\" english breakfast which consisted of, on my plate: 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 hash brown, 1 quarter tomato and on my friends plate: 1 bacon, 3 button mushrooms, a tiny slice of tomato and 1 hash brown. Although our breakfast was included in the package, some people would've paid \u00c2\u00a37.50 for this! Before we had a chance to even eat the little we had, I found a hair on my sausage and it was pink in the middle so we left, hungry. The waiting staff were also extremely rude and made both my friend and I feel extremely uncomfortable, by speaking not to our eyes, but to our chests (& we were still in our baggy pyjamas! not sat there in our underwear!!) Management had not arrived at nine, as we were told but we had to wait til we collected our luggage (from the unlocked, unguarded cupboard!) when we finnally got to speak to someone. The way I was spoken to was nothing less than disgusting! I was spoken to as if I was 5, and accused of leaving the quite obviously old blood on the sheets and putting my hair on the towels and sheets.

I called someone who lives in London whom told me i could only get a train or bus as there is no tube stop and Battersea is over the river, not far but very incovinient. The manager could see i was distressed and offered to send a taxi to take us to covent garden at 510, so we reached Battersea at 5:00 with no time to change (after a long day urgh), - The travel lodge was next to NOWHERE (and a scruffy one at that)and more in Clapham(i think) than Battersea, the taxi wouldnt wait as another had been booked and we rushed to get changed in 5 mins thinking we mayas well/ Several times we called the hotel and the taxi had not arrived (amongs a comedy of errors), finally at 610 it got there, we had to phone the restaurant who were understanding, we got there 650 and had to explain that we needed to be seated at 720 in the theatre 10 mins away. They were really good and got our food quickly, but the whole night and the whole point of visiting London was ruined for us both. Not to mention after the show we had to have a drink in CG when the plan was to get the tube back to gloucster road where we had already cased bars out by the hotel (as there was NOTHING by our travelodge)- we then had to get back to battersea and as we had no idea where we were in comparison to buses and trains (as hotel didnt know and we had no time) it cost us \u00c2\u00a320 (And the taxi driver deducted \u00c2\u00a35 as he felt sorry for us) to get back, which was money we didnt need to spend if we were at GR. anyway after all the waste of time (shows is good by the way) and alot of complaining the hotel manager agreed to refund us and offered a free nights stay. - with that she was really helpful and understanding.

Hotwire advertised it as a 2.5 star, a notch below the self-procrlaimed 3 star rating on the hotel's website, but still well above the half star rating it actually deserves.

I was ignored by the staff of three for about 5 minutes, as they collectively struggled to check in a single guest who had arrived right before me. When it was my turn, no one welcomed me or even said hello. The woman behind the counter just demanded my credit card. When she found my reservation, she pulled a piece of paper from a drawer, pointed to an amount at the bottom and said, \"You pay this.\" I explained to her that my reservation would have been prepaid by hotwire. She checked with her collegue who explained to her that I was correct. She made no apologies and finished checking me in. When I asked for help with my bags, she looked at me like I was an idiot and said, \"We don't do that here.\" Imgaine that!

I closed the window and looked for a thermostat. There was none; just a radiator with the knob that adjusts the temperature taken off. The radiator was completely cold. I called and asked for a space heater, waited 2 hours for it, then called the front desk. At that point I was informed that they only have central heating and they don't have space heaters.

The furniture was made of press board/cork board and is full of holes, scratches and water/rot stains. There were black scuff marks all along the walls, particularly on the wall up against which the bed is placed and in the hallway area. The bathroom was tiny and didn't look like it had been cleaned. The towels were thin, stained and worn. The foot towel that you throw down on the floor when you take a shower was thrown in the bottom of the shower stall and had black hair on it.

From our initial check-in attempts to our eventual check-out the hotel never failed to disappoint. I would question the reviews on this site that give it a positive rating. The 'Star' system (3-star, 4-star, 5-star, etc.) is generally trusted and implies certain standards, and should be applied correctly to hotels advertised on a site to give an honest interpretation of the level of facility and service that can be expected from an establishment. This hotel claims to be 3-star. This is clearly a mark it has given itself, as it does not measure up to the level I would expect from a 1-star establishment or a hostel for that matter. I hope this review might help to prevent another traveller from being misled in such a manner and might eventually lead to a tightening of the descriptive language used for a hotel on the site to ensure that a traveller is fully aware of what value. >>>>> Upon arrival when advising that we have a reservation and would like to check in, we were immediately told that check in is not until two pm. The man at reception did not even wait to ask our names and then proceeded to (very rudely) insist that we go away until two o'clock. At which point he returned to stapling papers and ignored us. We were not the only guests subjected to this treatment. One guest arrived at 1.54pm and was told to go off and sit somewhere until 2 o'clock. When we eventually checked in, we went up in the elevator (with carpet on all the walls) to a dark, musty corridor that smelled of water damage and the effects of age and neglect. Our room was small, and had a similar sense of age about it - many of the wooden laminate surfaces had water damage and discoloration. The stale smell was not so pungent here, but was still in the background. We left our bags in the room and went out for the day to a prior appointment for which we were late because our check-in must not take place before 2pm. When we arrived back to the hotel later that evening, the bathroom floor was covered in water. The pipes in the sink leaked. It was too late to do anything about it and we went to bed. In the morning, the leak was worse and the bathroom floor was flooded. Drying the floor with our towels we went about showering - only to discover that the shower was covered in mould and dampness. Upon starting the shower we discovered why - the extractor fan was not working. This meant that anything left in the bathroom was covered in steam and condensation - absolutely everything, from towels to the walls and floors (that were flooded) to the toilet paper. This hotel is far from the standard that anyone should expect, and I would vehemently recommend that people be discouraged from using it. I understand that certain hotels are aimed at a specific price point, but certain things should not be excused in the search for this price point. It should be expected that staff at a hotel would be courteous and helpful. This hotel was lacking in so many of the basics and the simple things that it should not be recommended to others until some of the fundamental flaws are removed from it. I also think that it is very misleading to label it a three star hotel is extremely misleading. <<<<<< Lesson learned for me ... check with TripAdvisor before booking a bargain.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnsley England", "Title": "\u201cPlease Stay Away\u201d", "Author": "DelBarnsleyEngland", "ReviewID": "UR7872197", "Content": "Please please stay away from this hotel.

There was no bath in our room only a shower which only dribbled water, the shower head would go no higher than my shoulder hieght ( I'm 5ft 9in). There was plenty of hot water but in truth I was reluctant to stand in the shower at all. The bottom of the shower curtain had some seriously disgusting stain on it. There was no extractor in the bathroom which left it smelling very damp and unpleasant. The bathroom door banged into the toilet so it would not open fully. The window would not open properly, the curtain rail was hanging off the wall, the reception on the TV was bad. We had to constantly go to reception to sort out our key card.

The corrodors and rooms were belting hot which is not funny when you are stood for half an hour with sweat dripping off the end of your nose waiting for your key card sorting out. There was only one small lift which bounced disconcertingly and had grafitti scratched on it. Breakfast was standard fare, but the tables were stacked so close to each other you could not get up without sticking your backside in some poor unfortuates face. Even the staff were rude and off hand( especially I noticed with poeple who had a language barrier). One member of staff burst into our room without knocking and waiting for an answer in the morning whilst we were changing. The thing that summed up the staff for me was when we were finally called to breakfast from the seating area by a young man who shouted 'Hey you, you and you' at us and then pointed at the dinning area. I know this sounds like a long winded whining session but I truly feel badly done to by the staff and the hotel. Both me and my partner were left no wanting to go back to the hotel during our stay.

For the price of $130 a night you wouldn't expect hostel quality from a hotel. But that's exactly what this \"hotel\" is. I've seen student hostels for better value. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their money on this place. They call themselves '3 star' which clearly is a self-invented title to charge more. Fact is they are more comparative to a 1 star. First, the hotels own photos are highly retouched in photoshop. The lobby itself seem clean and spacious on first appearance but the rooms are several notches below (the hotel seemt to be decorated with the cheapest, second-hand Ikea furniture in each room, including the lobby). On my arrival I was given the key to a room that simply left me baffled; carpets were dingy, very old and stained, and the bed was elevated with steps like an old bunkbed. It had an old, dingy mattress that was in such bad shape it was completely lumpy even when 'made'. $130 a night is not $30, and I simply could not accept this for the price. I then got what they described as a 'good room'. It was a 1000 time improvement to the first option, but still hostel-like. The mattress at least looked fine but was so uncomfortable I did not sleep properly a single night staying there. The bathroom was small, but the shower took the price: it had a total actual square area of 1.5 feet surrounded by a shower curtain that you were suppose to comfortably take your shower in... The shower had been elevated, meaning all water was flowing onto the floor whenever you tried to take a shower. The tiny space made the showercurtain stick to your body like scotchtape! The layout made no sense since the elevated step could have provided ample space for a good sized shower. To add to the list of ridicules from this English \"hotel\", the soaps were so small they lasted about one day. After the first day, the elevator went out of service. Luckily, they at least had a smelly service elevator in the back that one could use. There was no baggage service and when on the last day both elevators were kept unavailable and I asked for assistance with my luggage, and was refused, I think I had enough. Again, I had not paid $30 a night here! I can live in simplicity if I want to save money and don't mind. But this was not cheap for the rate they charge and by cheating people to call it 3-star when it is clearly not. Of all cities in the world I have visited, and that includes third world countries, London has shown to be the most difficult place for accommodation whether I pay from $100-400 a night. That's why I nowadays select a lower range rate since too frequent it had made little difference. Often these hotels are owned by immigrants that have no standard of quality according to a western nation and simply don't care to adapt to the culture of their host country. They want only money and don't feel obligated to have a certain level of quality, even if basic. Second, often the descriptions of facilities are so off they don't even seem to be the same hotel. They don't seem to fall under any kind of regulations or control but can be advertised anyway the owner please. And third, you feel insulted as a client as you know you are being ripped off and treated demeaning from the moment you see what you paid for and what you get. And this don't necessarily change if you pay double than at this dump, called Ambassadors Earls Court.

The bathroom was also full of stains and silver fish were crawling over the floor. I immediately returned to the desk (the staff were very helpful) and I was shown another room which was slightly better but still very old and shabby and finally I decided on a basement room which at least had been modernised in the recent past despite being very hot and facing a brick wall. Even with the air conditioning unit on the room was unbearable and it was difficult to leave the window open being at ground level. I finally managed to get used to the noise of the air conditioning unit and fell asleep. I was woken up at about 220am with a strange vibrating noise which sounded like the fridge was malfunctioning. I got up and explored the appliances in the room and could not find where the fault was, tried phoning reception but no answer and finally decided to go outside into the corridor to investigate. You can imagine my shock when I went into the corridor and heard the fire alarm going in the next corridor. In panic I left the room to go outside with the rest of the residents while the fire brigade investigated. As you can imagine I was very concerned that had that been a real fire I could have lost my life as was unable to hear the alarm in my room. I phoned the reception to express my concern and finally the person on duty understood my concerns (he initially thought I was worried about the alarm) and I asked him to make a note that the alarm could not be heard in my room as I was concerned to sleep incase there was an emergency I would not hear. Eventually I managed to get about 2 hours sleep before having to get up for work.
