A small cafe/bar is next to the reception where we enjoyed a light breakfast and excellent coffee with a view of the street. The rooms were very clean, modern and comfortable.

Further complicating the problem, there is nowhere to park on Castlereagh St while you check in. The receptionist did not have any other parking suggestions, so we were left to stand in the foyer and google solutions ourselves. We ended up leaving the car in an underground mulit-level across the park ($35 per day), which was a 15 minute walk away. My lift key didn't work and needed to be re-coded. The room was in need of an update- the carpet was lifting and worn in areas of joins, and there were several light globes which needed replacing (the receptionist tried to replace a couple of them, but didn't have the correct globe). The bed, however, was wonderfully comfortable, with nice linen. It was fairly noisy, but I that's to be expected of the CBD. We had breakfast included, and it was pretty good! Room service only, from the little takeaway cafe downstairs. Breakfast wraps and toasties, and good DiBella coffee. The location was excellent for access to buses and for attractions.

I want to address a few issues I faced when I decided to give Park8 a try. My friend and I travel to Sydney regularly and we decided to change from our normal hotel so I found Park 8 on the internet and was happy with what I saw. I rang the hotel four times and was reassured that the rooms were of an excellent standard. When we arrived I was shocked at how dusty and dirty the hotel was and how much the rooms needed renovating. Cracked paint and mould in the bathrooms, a strong smell of old alcohol and smoke from downstairs ... Oh yes this boutique hotel sits above a pub. When I inform the staff (Hugo and Mercedes ) that I wouldn't be staying there ... Hugo disappeared and then Mercedes took over( and from the conversation) I felt she had done this before ... I asked for a refund and finally was reassured that I would get a full refund of my money so as to did accommodation in a more suitable hotel . I have jut discovered they have kept a nights ccommodation from my account and I am saddened as She reassured me that they were sobbusy they would fill the room immediately. We asked them to hold the room until 4 pm as it was 3:15pm and she informed us that she would but inwe didn't contact her by then they would give to other customers .We were able to secure the HIlton hotel for $199 which was cheaper than Park8 we were paying $255 for a run down dusty hotel for a 5star luxury room at the Hilton.

Our 4th floor room overlooked the busy Park St but I didn't find noise an issue at all. There was a bar fridge in the room and if asked I believe the hotel will stock it with minibar items.

This creates expectations that are not matched by the reality. The location is excellent for Sydney's entertainments and shopping, but it is on a busy intersection and although the traffic noise was tolerable there were emergency vehicles with sirens blaring at regular intervals all night, plus raucous revellers shouting and screaming in the street below. This could be managed by double-glazing the windows overlooking Park Street and Castlereagh Street, but the windows are only single-glazed and quite inadequate for this situation. We had a Deluxe Room number 304. The rooms are adequate. Probably furnished to a four star standard, although there was only an office chair and a small footstool and the desk was small. The style is minimalistic, which in this case just looked sparse and a bit worn in places. The bed and bedlinen were good. The website promised down pillows but the ones in the room were polyester fill. The staff were very apologetic and provided two down pillows after a couple of hours. The second room we booked for relatives didn't have down pillows either so I doubt that these are provided as standard. The bathroom was adequate as well, but somewhat short of luxurious and not overly spacious. Surprisingly, the fridge in the room was noisy and I had to turn it off at the wall - a problem I've only had in budget motels in recent years! The aircon control made a strange crunching noise every time it kicked in, so I turned the aircon off as well. After one sleepless night we'd had enough and decided to move. Many thanks to Andrea on Reception for being so helpful and sympathetic. Although we'd booked two rooms for two nights she indicated that she'd get authorisation to refund the second night back to us, whereas the hotel would be within its rights to charge for both nights. Much appreciated. I echo the comments of others that the hotel staff are exceptional, and make up for some of the shortcomings. In summary, and reading the reviews of others, I believe that if I had obtained a rate of about $165 a night I would have expected more of a budget hotel and been satisfied.

It is in the heart of things with shops restaurants, the park, public transportation, a taxi stand, etc right around it and about a 10-15 minute walk to Circular Quay. Also, the CBD free shuttle stops near it which was convenient if we didn't want to walk. The room was plenty spacious and nice for us (the rooms were a little dark with the curtains closed). There wasn't a bath tub (just a standing shower) which was fine by us but might not be ideal for someone else. In addition to the location, the other big plus was the front desk staff. They were super friendly and willing to help with reservations, recommendations, etc. - anything we may have needed help with. The one negative was the cleaning service.

The other potential negative was street noise. When we were in the room, we could hear traffic, but it never woke us up. We are also from NYC, so have a certain tolerance for that.

Yet, the hotel itself has not provided me with a satisfactory stay that makes me want to go back. I will start with the Positives: The hotel is located in the best part of town. It's right in the middle of the \"action\" on Castlereagh Street. This means that if you are a business traveller, it's a 10 - 15 mins walk to your meetings in the city centre or a very short cab ride away. And if you are a traveller, you are 2 - 3 mins away from the major shopping malls (including the brand new Westfield complex, David Jones, Myer and Queen Victoria Building), food and cafes. Don't let the initial look of the hotel location deter you. It does feel like you are on the \"gritty end\" of town at times (especially at night when the pub-crawlers are out and you have small children with you) but it's quite safe. The other positive is the very friendly staff members. Two lovely attendants Tia and Andrea made our stay exceptionally pleasant. They were helpful and caring, and one of them is a barista so she makes good coffee as well. It's a small boutique hotel with less than 50 rooms (from memory) so the service is very personalised. The rooms are a good size. There is no traffic noise once you are in the room even though Castlereagh St is considered a major street. There is also a pub downstairs but you don't hear the noise at night. The facilities provided include good storage, a mini-fridge (no contents so you can fill the fridge up from the Woolworths - ie large supermarket, down the road), iron, hairdryer, shampoo/conditioner, multiple channels on a new flatscreen TV (no movies though). There is a little coffee counter bar at reception for a quick toast/croissant, coffee or hot chocolate. The Negatives: the hotel has been recently renovated so it does has some funky additions like forest green carpet and designer lamps. However, one gets the feeling that it's a budget, cosmetic renovation. The hotel still feels (and sometimes, smell) old. We were allocated the 5th floor rooms. I had wanted 2 rooms as I had children travelling with me. The rooms were meant to be next to each other but with another common door that closes and locks so that we can leave the room doors open. However, that common door is non-existent as it has come off the hinge. We ended up with mum and dad with one child each. The 5th floor has very very low ceilings through the corridor and feels very claustrophobic. It felt like it might have been a roof space or attic prior to the renovation. One of the rooms allocated to us was an internal room, ie it has no natural light except through a small frosted glass window. The shower also leaked (this was fixed) and then the light bulb blew in the bathroom so the bathroom was very dim (not fixed). The other room had natural light but it would have been better if the window had been frosted as we got the view of unsightly city roof tops and the fire escape stairwell. The worse thing was that the strong cigarette smoke from the pub downstairs drifted upstairs into this room (through the closed windows) which made the air in the room quite unbearable. We managed to move to another room downstairs that night. So for the rest of the trip, we were on separate floors. The new room was better but again it was an internal room. The lights didn't work so the room was quite dark at night (the bedside lamps and desk lamp being the only lights, and these were quite weak). The lights were not fixed. The aircon was extremely loud and there were flying bugs in the room! To make things worse, my bedroom was not made the next day. On the very last night, all of the lights went out in my new room. The receptionist managed to find me another room across the hall. This new room was a dream. If only I had this room from the start! It had a window (no frosted glass!) to Castlereagh St below. It had working lights and quiet air-conditioning! If you want to book this hotel, I strongly suggest that you ask for the rooms that face Castlereagh Street and not the internal rooms. I also warn against staying on the 5th floor!! However, the family suites are on the 5th floor and these look nice. I felt bad for the staff who tried to fix my problems. I know that it's not their fault but it does feel like the hotel operates on a budget. They couldn't fix the lights and air-con and the rooms don't get cleaned if we miss the cleaners who come in during the day. However, I want to quickly point out that the negatives are all relative to the room rate. The rates are extremely reasonable for Sydney (at $175 per night per room) so I really have No real reason to whine about anything particularly because the staff was so nice. This review is just a heads up for those who expect a lot more than a basic, tourist-style hotel.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOk for a Short Stay\u201d", "Author": "SavvyTripTaker", "ReviewID": "UR117899326", "Content": "I did a lot of research before booking to stay at Park 8. I chose it based on its proximity to shopping and affordability (in Sydney terms that is). I only stayed one night. The location was just a 5-10min walk to the heart Sydney Shopping Heaven but the other elements of the accommodation were fairly AVERAGE. I feel this place has real mixed reviews when flicking through them all, so I will try and just portray a few quick facts. The rooms are quite small (as in there isn't really room to walk around in them) but they do have gd storage, a tv, bedside lamps which are good for the bookworms, and my room even had an iron + ironing board. The rooms are quite dark unless you request for a window room, which I strongly recommend if you need to put on makeup -but I guess you are there to sleep & I experienced no noise problems, but if you are a light sleeper, ask for a higher floor, towards the middle of the building. I only engaged with one staff member and he didn't really come across as friendly to me at all, the guy couldn't even point a tourist in the direction of the Circular Quay...mmmm. When I first arrived & opened the door to my room I was surprised to find that house keeping had not been in & the old linen was on still covered on the bed...the room would have been good if it was clean as it had a gd study desk and natural light from the window but the bathroom also had a water leak under the sink so the floor was all wet. They offered to take my bags and clean the room in the next few hours, but said water problem could not be attended to in that time. I conveyed this was not really what I expected and they offered to upgrade my room for no extra charge, but the next room they gave also had a similar dripping problem in the bathroom, so i just asked for another room to the same standard as I had originally booked, to which was clean and plumbing problem free :) Then the stay picked up & I was a happy camper. Upon leaving they even offered to hold my bags for a short time so I didn't have to lug my bags all over town.I would give this place another shot but I would probably look around first but the location is pretty hard to beat, so if you need convenience and don't need luxury, then this place fits the brief.

One such hotel, unfortunately is the Park8 in Sydney, which whilst it is indeed under some sort of renovation (little more than a cafe on the ground floor and smart black clothes for the concierge) it really does not fit the 'boutique' tag, which seems to extend only to the room rate. the room was tiny and very sparsely furnished (I have no issues with minimalism, but this was more spartan than minimalist - and the varnished tree log bedside table really did not make the room 'designer-like') the carpet remained the old green carpet that survived the renovations from the time the hotel was just the accommodation rooms above the old Windsor pub. The most dissapointing room however, was the bathroom, which by all account had not been renovated at all (I hope not in any case) but still retianed the charm of a public injecing room or public toilet. No problems at all with the service, however, because of the lack of any discerning facilities (mini bar; room service etc), service was merely confined to checking in and checking out.

The location is good if you want to go shopping, (there are plenty of shops including the new Westfield nearby). It is quite central but for touristy areas such as Darling Harbour and the Sydney Opera House, there are hotels in better locations, as it is still a bit of a walk from Park8. The cost of internet is exorbitant. There are Starbucks, Gloria Jeans and McDonalds nearby, but the internet at Gloria Jeans and McDonalds were quite slow and unreliable. On the hotel's Guidebook, it lists a few places which offer rental cars. However, the location it lists for Avis is in Kings Cross (which is not the closest). The closest Avis Car Rental is in World Square on Pitt St, which is an 8 minute walk away.

It is in a very good location and the rooms are clean. We had a 2-bedroom unit on the top floor. While it is 2 bedrooms, be aware that you will not have much privacy. The ground floor consists of a small kitchenette and living room. When you walk up the stairs you arrive directly in the first bedroom. You need to walk through it to get to the second bedroom. In addition the only bathroom is accessed rom the first bedroom. So people sleeping in the second bedroom need to go into the first bedroom to go to toilet.... Lighting in the bedrooms are bathroom is very poor. Can hardly see in your luggage when fetching something. It did not help that one light in the first bedroom and the ceiling light in the bathroom were not working. We asked the front desk to change the bulbs but nothing was done. The bathroom was not too well stocked in toiletries. One smal bottle of shampoo and one small bottle of bath gel for 4 people. There is no place to hang the towels in the bathrooms (although it is quite spacious) so they put the towels on the bed. So do not do like me and realize in the middle of the shower that the towel is on the bed of the second bedroom! Now, the worst thing is the internet ripoff. They have wireless but it is $10 per hour or $20 per day. Not cheap at all. This is how much I pay for a month of internet at my apartment. But this is not so rare for high-end hotels. However it does not stop here. At this price you can only use one computer. There were 4 of us with 2 computers and one iPad so they asked us to pay 3 times!!! $30 per hour for wireless!!! Come to think of it, maybe it was for a block of 2 hours. I have never seen this kind of price anywhere in the world.

We booked an early bird offer when the hotel first opened so the room was pretty good value. Having had a great stay at one of the other Eight Hotels in Sydney (the Diamant) a couple of weeks before I expected more from Park8, but I think the Diamant was so nice that we expected too much (albeit the Diamant was actually cheaper than Park8). Park8 was fine for a short stay, the room was a decent size and the bathroom was nicely done, with a great shower. The downside was that our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a proper window, just a frosted window which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ideal! The hotel is new (opened November 2010) and I had expected everything to be newly fitted but it is clear that the hotel has just been a refurbishment of an older building (possibly an older hotel). Simple things like old doors and handles and dodgy paint jobs were noticeable and old cupboards in the room. Otherwise the new furniture and ipod dock in the room were nice features. However, on the positive side the staff were so friendly and helpful and very accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, close to George Street and walking distance to Circular Quay and the Rocks. There is no breakfast available but a multitude of local places serving all kinds of breakfast options are close by. I would recommend Park8 for a cheap stay close to the city centre, but you might want to request a room with a proper window as that was really the main reason for not rating this hotel higher.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel bed I have ever slept in - fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "happyinoz", "ReviewID": "UR93806178", "Content": "When you search for accommodation on wotif near to Darling Harbour this one does not appear, yet it is closer to Cockle Bay than others I have stayed in that are deemed to be around the bay.

Absolutely terrific! The AC was noisy but I turned it down from the 2nd setting to the first fan speed and this helped. The hotel staff are attentive, efficient, pleasant and informative. Negative aspects and these are not significant and should not put you off staying here. *The hallways are very dark and not good if you are claustaphobic, better globes would change the feel but may not give the ambience the hotel desire. *The hotel is clearly newly renovated, our bathroom was great, the shower amazing but the grout on the lowest tile not sparklling white, also no towel rail or hooks.
