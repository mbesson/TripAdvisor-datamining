The hotel is a beautiful old building with traditional Barcelona styled architecture, but inside its sleek and ultra modern. We booked it as a secret hotel (although the description gave it away) on last minute.com so it was a great price! I've stayed here twice, once at the back of the hotel and once at the front, both room were lovely but the one at the front was stunning, and had its own private rooftop garden with seating so we could sit out in the evening with a bottle of wine in total privacy and stunning views (Sacra de familia an be seen in the distance).

Located a 15 minute walk from Sagrada Familia (tip- go in the afternoon as there's less of a line up) and 10 minutes from the high end shopping strip on the Passeig de Gracia. These are also the closest hop on/off bus stations which is arguably the best way to travel around this city for first timers. Metro station is close too. The rooms are large with 2 twin beds pushed together. I have conceded this is the standard in Europe which worked out perfectly fine as I travelled with my mum. Very clean and fitted was ikea-like furniture and the storage was fine unless you plan to stay 5 days plus. Beds were hard but comfortable nonetheless. Sparse no frills toiletry so BYO. No English channels and temperamental wifi. Made things like checking the weather difficult but we survived! Good breakfast was provided as part of our Voyage Prive package. 3 nights and return BA flights from Heathrow for \u00a3320 each. A good deal that we booked back in January. Transfers are expensive from the airport ~ \u20ac50 taxi ride. Next time, I would probably catch the aerobes then a taxi now that I know my way around the city better.

The rooms are generously sized and have a good layout. It also has everything that you need. Even the room service menu is well priced by European standards. The bathroom is great - with the most fantastic shower, and again space. The only downside of the hotel was the following: The staff at reception can best be described as sullen. Honestly no-one is going to ask you how it is going or if they can be of any assistance. There are no porters to help with bags to the room - but hey, there was a trolley available for this. The guy behind reception calmly watched as I loaded my heavy bags onto the trolley and struggled to get it into the lift. There is no iron or ironing board available - so it cost 8 euro to have a jacket pressed via the laundry service. Breakfast is not included - and although lovely, it does cost 14 euro.

I got a great deal on this hotel (under $100/night) and decided to stay here for 5 days. The hotel is in a great location! Only 3 blocks from Passeig de Gracia (which is a main street in Barcelona with tons of places to eat and shop). Barcelona has excellent public transportation so we were 2 blocks in either direction away from main Metro lines. It was a 10-15 minute walk to food and shops and and a 5-10 minute metro ride to the beach areas and the old town part of Barcelona. The hotel had a really neat and different design. It is in the quieter Eixample district where the buildings are older but all in good condition. You could tell this hotel has been completely renovated and there is a nice lobby/bar/lounge area. There is also a whole breakfast restaurant area where they serve breakfasts but at 14 euros /person/day we found food elsewhere. Our room and bathroom were HUGE for just a standard room and compared to most European rooms. It was VERY clean, very comortable (besides the bed being so-so, the shower had an awesome rain shower head, FREE Wi-Fi, and we had a pretty good selection of TV channels, however, they were mostly in Spanish. We had a view of nothing special but we could open our window/balcony and get some fresh air. The room was immaculate and the maids always did a great job cleaning the room. Overall I think this is an AMAZING hotel for the price that it is. If you are considering this hotel I would definitely book it.

We inquired on whether the hotel had a restaurant, as it was lunch time and we did not have enough energy to eat outside, and we were surprised to discover that the hotel had no restaurant, just a bar and a breakfast area. Upon checking in, the lady at the counter told us that we had a beautiful room on the seventh floor with a sea view. We took the elevator to the seventh floor, and upon leaving the elevator there was a really bad smell in the corridor leading to the rooms. The smell remained in that hallway during the entire period of our stay. As we entered our room, we looked out the window, and gazed at the buildings of the city spanning through the horizon and at the end of the stretch of buildings, not more than 2 cm of a blue line, that after focusing hard on turned out to be the sea. The room was tidy, bathroom clean, bed uncomfortable. There had been a take away menu for a pizza place on the desk in the room, and it said \"room service\". We asked for water to be sent up to our room one night, and the immediate response of the reception desk was \"look in the minibar\". After i told the man that we had already finished the water in the minibar, his answer was, \"sorry sir we do not have room service, please come down to the hotel bar and buy your water\". Enough Said ! 987 was a good place to stay because it was close to the main upscale street of Passeig de Gracia.

We upgraded to a room on the seventh floor with a terrace. We had a lovely view of Sagrada Familia. Paying the extra made a big difference to us as the room itself, whilst comfortable, was fairly small and the terrace allowed us to sit outside enjoy the good weather. Good points: The hotel could be found very easily from the Passeig de Gracia station. This station is approximately 20 minutes by train direct from the airport. As we arrived at night and did not know the city, having a easy to find location was important to us. The hotel was quiet - we kept the patio door open in the evening and there was some road noise but this was eliminated when the door was closed. We did not hear any other guests. The shower was hot and powerful. We had a large bed (kingsize) which is often difficult to find in smaller hotels in european citys. The room was kept clean throughout our stay. The staff were efficient and polite and our Argentinian barmaid was particularly pleasant. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were plenty of small cafes within walking distance. The hotel is near the stop for the tourist bus which is helpful to use on a first visit to get your bearings. Las Ramblas is a 10 -15 minute walk away. Less good points Our only slight reservation was the layout of the room. As others have mentioned, having the toilet separated from the bedroom by glass booth means that privacy is at a minimum. You certainly need to know the person that you share the room with well! Overall We were happy with our choice for this trip. Barcelona is a lovely, diverse and vibrant city.

The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia, Passeig de Gracia (major street) and La Ramblas. Three metro stations are a few blocks away. Hotel: the hotel is on Mallorca which is a quieter street with minimal noise. The onsite bar was always quiet, so much so that we never used our free drink tickets. Rooms: the rooms are modern and funky using clean lines and bright colours. We requested a bigger room and there was plenty of space. A small balcony (not large enough to use) opened to the back of other buildings so there wasn\u2019t much a view. A bar fridge, TV, storage space and a comfy bed were included. The bathroom included a large overhead shower. We did use room service a few times and recommend the breakfast (1 serving fed 2 people easily) and the prices for chocolate dipped strawberries and cava are very reasonable. One item to note about the hotel and Barcelona in general is the lack of English speaking people \u2013 it just added to the fun! A little warning: we asked the front desk for a cab the first night and they happily called one. She noted that the driver would come and get us so we could relax in the foyer. They do this so the driver can come in and leave a tip/commission for the staff.

First of all, when we arrived, it was hard to find where was the entrance of the hotel. Nobody was available to help us with our baggages, not even to open the heavy door opening on a lobby quite colourful, maybe a bit too much, and very deep going to the reception where a girl seemed to be so busy... When we arrived in front of us, she kept working on something instead of saying \"hello\" which is totally unacceptable but anyway, in Europe, it's harder to find people really implicated in providing a fantastic level of service. Anyway, she gave us the key card after asking for the passeport and credit card and she told us that our room was located at the first floor without asking if we needed help... Moreover, i'm often questionning myself why people don't smile in some hotels... Why they didn't choose an other job cause when you're working in the hospitality industry, it means that you love contacts with customers... About the room, we have been chocked by the \"flashy\" colours used by the designer to decorate the room (turquoise blue and green apple...) and even more cause i've requested during the reservation process not to have a green room... Honnestly, it doesn't look good but at least, it gives light in a room, for sure with a terrace, but facing a old disguting building on the right, a wall on the left and the room of your neighbour right in front of... it means there is absolutely no privacy and if you leave the curtains opened, you can easily see what's happened in the next room... Consequently, it's absolutely not liveable and all you want is to leave the room. About the design, we were surprised about the wardrobe as well cause no door... it's not really good to see all your clothes when you're seated on the sofa or the bed... I don't know from which school is the designer but it's sincerely not nice... The bathroom was reasonnably sized with a seperate shower and bathtub but once again, some details of decoration are weird (a bunch of wood stalks full of dust just like as glass jar with plastic lemons in the bedroom...) and only one big towel for two is a bit limited... But maybe some people can like it but it would be surprising. The main problem comes from comfort... The noise is terrible meaning the soundproofing is disastrous. At each time somebody is going into a room, the door slaps strongly and wake you up. You have to deal as well with the noise coming from the ground of the upper floor and sleeping well is becoming a challenge... If you're lucky to find a good sleep, you'll be wake up early when the sun will appears cause the blind curtains don't blind anything... An other detail: If a lot of hotels are working about comfort, it's not the case at 987 cause the pillows are the worst we had and the matress wasn't good. Air con doesn't work properly (hard to be cool in the room) as well as the TV (it stops by itself...). Finally, let's talk about the maintenance and the housekeeping... Walls in the bedroom were full of splash; we found hairs around the toilet and in the bathtub; dust is everywhere... And in the common areas, even if the hotel is quite new, it seems to be aged already meaning the hotel choosed bad quality of furniture... So, NO service... A real lack of comfort...

The free internet in the lobby was very useful, as we hadn't planned anything for the trip other than Barcelona and we used it to plan the next stage of our travel. However, it crashed several times, which was very frustrating. While the room was rather small, it was clean and comfortable. The only complaint was the mattress. My wife was fine with it, but I found it rather uncomfortable. I didn't sleep well on it and kept tossing and turning. Tip: The mussel restaurant next door was packed every night so we decided to try it on our last night. It was very good (if you like mussels of course)!", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "FHKMacon", "ReviewID": "UR43608267", "Content": "987 Hotel is exactly what one might expect, if one browsed the website.

But what stood out most of all during our three night stay was Alexandra, the concierge who started each afternoon around 3pm. She was incredibly patient, taking the time to pull out maps and explain the location of various tourist attractions, restuarants, shops, etc. for each and every hotel patron....in impeccable English no less which was greatly appreciated. She made certain that each person was taken care of in the order they came to her with questions, being firm with patrons who tried to sneak ahead of those waiting in line. But what most impressed us was the time Alexandra took to assist us in obtaining train tickets to Valencia. She pulled up the train schedule on the internet and tried to arrange for our tickets. When that did not work, she spent countless minutes on the phone with the Barcelona train station trying to book our tickets. Without Alexandra at 987 Hotel, we would have had some difficulty getting around and out of Barcelona....as probably most guests of the hotel would have as well.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "trv30", "ReviewID": "UR42816557", "Content": "Very good service and breakfast.

It took me forever to book a hotel because I really wanted to make the right decision and researched hotels in Barcelona for months. I finally decided on 987 Barcelona and could not be happier. We booked a non-refundable room directly through the hotel website for about $150 per night. We arrived 6/30/09 which also happened to be the opening night of the U2 summer tour. We asked the front desk if they could help us get tickets. Our tickets to the concert were waiting for us 2 hours later and we paid face value! The front desk was so sweet to us from the moment we walked in. They locked up our luggage while we walked around the city (we arrived at 9am, check in is at 2pm). They provided us with a map of the city. When we got back to the hotel around 3pm, there was a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room! I ultimately chose this hotel because I do not want to be in a super touristy part of town but still wanted to be able to access these parts of town fairly easily. If you enjoy seeing the city on foot and prefer to have a hotel in a great part of town yet away from the hussle and bustle of Las Ramblas, this hotel is for you. The rooms were very clean, new, modern, comfy bed, mini fridge and an awesome shower. All the main city sights are a 15-20 walk and there are near by subway stations as well.

All the public areas (including a cosy bar) are furnished and decorated in a very cool, colourful style. The twin room I stayed in was no exception - a mixture of dark wood, lime green, and white. There was a flat-screen TV, minibar, and a huge, amazing shower/wetroom which was separate from the rest of the bathroom. There was air conditioning - my only minor issue was that there was no way to control it yourself, although the centrally-set level was pretty good. Room access is by keycard, so if you're travelling with a friend, there's no problem getting two. The room was spotless - and cleaned every day (the cleaner even leaves you chocolates and a little card with the next day's weather forecast). There's free wi-fi - but, if you don't want to take your laptop on holiday, there are some Macs in quiet corners around the hotel for free internet access.

Bathroom has a good size as well but could do with some deep cleaning. There were some ants running around looking for their lunch - on the 7th floor! At breakfast, I only had fresh fruit (pineapple, two kinds of melon) which were great.

I first visited in September 2007, with \u2018the lads\u2019 to see The Police gig at the Olympic Stadium. The fact that I returned, with the wife, (apart from my credit card), obviously reveals my positive experience staying at 987 Barcelona. First off, the location. Situated in the affluent Eiample area (guys, with wives/girlfriends beware), all the major sights are easily reachable from the excellent and easy to use Metro. Turn right out of the hotel door and you are only a few blocks away from The Temple de la Sagrada Familia. Turn left out of the door and you are a short walk from the Passeig de Gracia, which leads to the Plaza Catalunya. Reaching the hotel from the airport via public transport is very easy. Directions are available from some of the other reviewers, so I won\u2019t repeat them here. The hotel itself is very clean, stylish and on both occasions I have found the staff both very friendly and helpful, with a good standard of English. The rooms are well appointed, in keeping with the hotel style. Everything you\u2019d expect from a hotel of this grade. The cleaning staff could be a little overenthusiastic at times with their vacuuming in the corridors, but they redeemed themselves with the excellently turned-down rooms. A nice touch (including the obligatory the chocolate mint) was the little card indicating the weather forecast for the next day! Some reviewers have commented on the glass door leading to the en-suite bathroom being a tad indiscrete. There was no lock in both the rooms I\u2019ve used, and there was a small gap around the glass door. Frankly, I can\u2019t see the problem. Get the fan going from the aircon \u2013 it\u2019s noisy and, um, does the trick. I could see this as a very minor grumble for those of a more private nature! But apart from that, everything else was fine. The rooms have air-conditioning which I found to be effective in both the rooms I used. Mini bar has water, if arriving late, and not too extortionate. The bar now opens to midnight. Also, very useful \u2013 the hotel has a free left luggage facility. Reception provides a free city map, which is actually very good, if you don\u2019t already have one. Breakfast is optional. If you want breakfast at the hotel, simply turn up, give the attentive staff your room number and help yourself to an excellent range of hot and cold options, drinks, cereals, fruits and pastries. You can even make up yourself a full, um, \u2018British\u2019, if you know what I mean! It\u2019s in the laid back dining area that you actually see other guests\u2026the place is an oasis from the city hubbub; clientele tends to be usually Europeans, from business to families. JUST ARRIVED? Tips for Barcelona virgins\u2026for orientation from hotel; Where to eat on arrival; take a left out of the hotel, a few blocks on takes you to the Passeig de Gracia (the busy road, 5 mins walk away). Head one block more and you\u2019ll be on La Rambla Catalunya; up or down you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice. For all budgets, any time of day. Eat outside, or inside. Recommended to get you started. Metro; get yourself a 10 hop ticket, available from the machines (cash and credit cards), and go! Once you\u2019ve fed a card through a barrier, the trip is printed o the back of the card, so you know how many are left. NOTE: the airport train is also covered by this ticket (excellent) so hop on at the metro, Paseo de Gracia, but as this is a real \u2018train\u2019 it\u2019s not as frequent as metro\u2026about every 40 mins, from my experience. Still bloody good! Note: the airport train at Paseo de Gracia has a good half metre gap from carriage to platform\u2026less enabled be aware. First trip; Parc de Montjunic: From hotel start at the Paseo de Gracia metro, get off at Paral-lel. Follow the signs within the station. Take the funicular (free); arrive. Turn right, up ramp and take cable car \u2013 highly recommended, or left, Olympic stadium \u2013 free view inside.

We printed off a map so had no trouble finding the hotel and it's only a 10 minute walk from Passieg de Gracia metro station and about 10-15 from Sagrada Familia. The hotel is in a lovely area so as two females we had no worries about walking to the hotel at night. The hotel was lovely and clean, very minimalist and funky but very warm and welcoming at the same time. The staff were great and very willing to offer any help they could. The room was impecibly clean, i always check under the beds and there was no dust to be seen anywhere :). we also had a balcony which offered a lovely view of Sagrada - we were on the 5th floor so not sure what views are like on other floors. We also checked out the other floors to find the are all lit in a diferent colour scheme, ours was pink but there is also green. orange and lilac. The only little complaint i has was that the glass door to the bathroom doesnt block out a lot of noise so you can hear everything thats going on in there.... not always a good thing!!

Check in at the hotel was very quick and smooth, although it took us a while to find the hotel, I had hoped some one might have put directions on here so it would have been easier to find... so here goes for people who would like to know. Get the A1 aerobus (blue) from the airoport to Placa Catalunya (4euros), then get the metro to Diagonal. When you come out of there you'll see \"La Padrera Espai Guadi\", go down two blocks from there and just after Louis Vuitton take a left onto Mallorca, walk two blocks down and there's the hotel on your right. The hotel was cool and stylish and in a very good location. It's in the Eixample district, which is quite a rich area hence, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Armani. But this seems to mean there's no pickpocketing and not too many beggars around and the streets are well lit at night. The Ramblas is nice to have a look, but wouldn' stay there as there are so many tramps and beggars praying on the tourists! Avoid talking to anyone that looks dodgy and keep an eye on your belongings especially on the metro and around the rambla area. It's very crowded and people seem to be looking for an easy target! We had a room on the top floor, not a great view, but then I didn't go to Barca to look out my hotel window! The room was clean and tidy, the maids did a great job. They put a choc on you pillow about 6ish and leave tomorrow's weather forcast! The best way to see the sights is on the Bus Turistic, 20euros pp for one day. There's three routes, blue, red and green. Green doesn't run in the winter months though. It's an open top hop on hop off bus tour. Great photo opportunities as it takes you to all the sights! If you take a right out of the hotel and keep walking you'll get to Sagrada Familia. There's a park at the front, which is nice for photos and a sit down, again be carful of beggars, we saw them surround one bench and the tourist had to give them money to make them leave them alone! The woman beggars seem to have scarves on their heads and there's children ones too. They carry a folder so they look like students! If you see them walk away, and don't make eye contact! All in all, we had a fab time, the hotel choice and location made it fab!

Three Gaudi 'greats' are an easy walk away - Casa Battlo, Casa Mila and the Sagrada Familia and everything else is easily reached using the metro, also nearby.

The main reason we booked via Splendia was that they took the first night's room charge upfront and their website clearly states that every room booking is therefore guaranteed and that there will not be any overbooking. When we arrived at the hotel just before midnight after a long train journey from Paris, the Receptionist told us that there is a problem with our room and they needed to book us out to another hotel. My wife and I both work in the hotel industry ourselves and it wasn't so much the being booked out we minded but the fact that the Receptionist used the oldest lie in the book and told us that there is no hot water in our room. At the same time, other guests were being checked into their rooms by her colleague. They, of course, were corporate travellers and probably paid a higher rate. As it was we ended up in a very nice hotel, though we never received an apology for the inconvenience at the time nor after writing to both, the hotel & Splendia. The few areas we did see in the 987 appeared to be very nice & stylish and maybe if we had booked directly with the hotel and paid a higher rate, we might have even got a room. As it is, I'd rather not try again in the future and go directly to the hotel they booked us out to.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOk Hotel, Not Really 4 Star\u201d", "Author": "Naraigh", "ReviewID": "UR10371043", "Content": "Went to Barcelona for a city break and stayed here for 4 nights. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is very modern and pretty impressive looking. Its a 4 Star but not of the standard you would expect if 4 Star in Ireland is anything to go by. Good Points: Breakfast was very good. View from room not bad. Location was very good - about 15 minutes walk into the main strip of La Rambla but only 5 mins to the nearest Metro, Diagonal, which will get you there in just a few stops for only \u20ac1.25 (single). You can also get to Park Guell from Diagonal Metro. Also Sagrada Familia is only about 15 minutes walk from the hotel and its just 5 minutes walk to Passeig de Gracia, the main shopping strip. Bad Points: No iron&board in the room - also not available from reception, you have to use an ironing service which requires you to leave your clothes in the morning and you should have them back by the evening but we are talking \u20ac5 for a top alone. Maybe this is ok for business people who are just there for 1 night and can charge it back to their company but it was all tourists stayin in the hotel. So i would recommend you bring a travel iron! Noise - previous review wasnt wrong, the noise from under the room door is a bit much. We stuffed a blanket down by the door every night. Water - the water in the bathroom changes suddenly from what you have set it at to scalding hot and its bloody dangerous. Also the bathroom door is basically like a swinging door with gaps around it so if sharing you'd want to know the person you are staying with very well, or you are about to!!! Intruders - there always seemed to be someone knocking on the door and they dont wait long for a response before barging in - the minibar guy got more than he bargained for on one occassion as one of us was just out of the shower! It was only just after breakfast time so he should expect some people to be in their rooms and therefore wait for a response to his knock rather than coming straight in. So i guess lesson learned is bolt lock the door or put out Do Not Distrub. Mirrors - just one in the bathroom over the sink. No full length. The room was a bit small but im sure there are bigger in the hotel. The bad points certainly didnt upset us or ruin our stay but they are issues that a 3 Star or maybe less pretentious hotel would not present and you would not be paying as much for your stay. So if you have already booked to stay here take this as a forewarning but you will enjoy your stay. General Recommendations for Barcelona: Place Reial is a square of restaurants/bars hidden within the maze of streets just off the Rambla in which you'll always get something decent enough and cheap for dinner. But just down the street on Carrer dels Escudellers, Los Caracoles has great food. You'll see the chickens on the spit outside - touristy but the best chicken you'll ever have. Down by the beach things are very quiet at this time of year but head down for a jug of Sangria in the evening until things liven up. Fill up at breakfast time in the hotel as getting a decent fresh sandwich during the day proved difficult - in Barcelona it seems they either put no effort into food or huge effort for which you will pay more. Overall service and a plesant manner are not high priority - i think if you are English speaking with just your own touristy attempt at spanish you'll prob get the harsher end of things. Very importantly know your hotel address in spanish, including the numbers - the taxi drivers have no interest in trying to help you.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c987 Barcelona Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JeffGoodwin", "ReviewID": "UR10049265", "Content": "Great hotel, fabulous view of Sagrada Familia from our terrace.

Our room was just as the hotel's website shows and was of a high standard. This is our main requirement but I have to say, we found the hotel lacking in atmosphere. Firstly, the area it is in, although only a short walk from the Passage de Gracia, is very quiet (especially at night) so just having a drink near to the hotel wasn't possible. The hotel bar closes at 11p.m. - we stayed for 4 nights and only ever saw one couple in there. Also, we neither saw nor were given any information or menus for breakfast or dinner which I think is why the restaurant seems to be hardly used in the evening. I think it is the limited use of the bar / restaurant that contributes to the lack of atmosphere - it is a shame because the hotel could easily change this. In summary - if your main priority is a high standard of room at a reasonable price and you want to spend your days sightseeing before retiring to bed reasonably early, then stay here.
