The resort features studio, one and two bedroom units, plenty of amenities & activities, many nearby restaurants, priviledged access to the amenities of the neighboring J.W. Marriott resort, free parking and complimentary in-room wireless internet. Ours was a three generation family vacation. Our two-bedroom, air-conditioned villa (2901 & 2902) was made up of a one bedroom unit with an adjoining studio unit. We arrived at 1:30 p.m. and were given access to the studio side only, as the one bedroom unit was still being readied. Full access did not come until after 4:30 p.m.. The studio was size of an average hotel room and was furnished with a king size bed and a pull-out sofa and table in the sitting area. The kitchenette included a small refrigerator, microwave oven, small sink, coffee maker, toaster and was furnished with dinnerware for two persons. The one-bedroom unit was nicely furnished and included a washer/dryer, full kitchen with oven, all basic appliances, cookware and dinnerware for six persons. There were two minor maintenance issues (no signal on one of the televisions and an unworkable safe); both of which were resolved within 15 minutes of our phone call. The resort offers two types of maid service: a \"full clean\" and a \"tidy clean.\" There is a charge for both services if you are staying on a timeshare ownership or exchange. One \"tidy clean\" service is included if you are paying a nightly rate. This was the first Marriott timeshare resort we have stayed at that did not include at least one mid-week \"tidy clean\" service for timeshare owners/exchangers. Resort amenities at the M.C.V. include serveral swimming pools, including a lap and chilren's pool, spas, fitness center, steam rooms, pool tables, children's playground, barbeque grills, fire pits, mini-market, restaurant (bar & grill) and activities desk (scheduled activities for all ages occur throughout the day). Amenities at the neighboring J.W. Marriott include golf (two courses) several restaurants & lounge, nature & preserve trails, tennis courts, and four acres of waterways including swimming pools, whirlpools and a \"lazy river\". It should be noted that access to the J.W. Marriott pools may be restricted for M.C.V. guests if the occupancy rate on the \"J.W.\" side is at or near capacity. A free shuttle bus operates between the two resorts on a regular schedule. The M.C.V. is just a short drive away from numerous restaurants, a large grocery store (Albertson's is less than a mile away; Costco is about five miles away), movie theater and cultural landmarks. The Desert Ridge Market Place (less than two miles) is a premier shopping, dining and entertainment destination. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the M.C.V. and highly recommend the resort for families and couples alike.

We did arrive early that day (check in at 4:00 p.m.) but they took our cell phone # and we went across the street to the J.W. Marriott property so our son could enjoy the lazy river. Our room was ready promptly at 4:00 p.m. Check-in was a breeze as usual - very friendly staff and concierge has lots of information on local happenings. We were in a studio which we felt was rather small compared to other studios we've stayed in but nonetheless very impressive: sink, microwave and min-fridge. Enough to store pop, chips, lunch meat, bread etc for breakfast and lunch meals. We went out for dinner each night at the nearby Desert Ridge Shopping area. The resort was beautiful - pool area spectacular and clean. We spent a few relaxing days at the pool and our 11 year old son made some great friends while there! Food at the pool was pretty good and priced right. Drinks were wonderful as well. The location of the resort was close to the highways and best of all was the Desert Ridge shopping area just a few blocks away: Albertsons (grocery), Target, Kohls, Old Navy, AMC Movie Theatre just to name a few. Restaurants galore: Mimi's Cafe, Wolfley's, Rock Bottom, California Pizza Kitchen, In & Out Burger, Dave & Buster's...too many to mention.

And I was right -- we loved it. The villas are spacious, well laid out and very clean when we arrived. I'm not sure there's a \"bad\" villa location since the complex is well kept all over and not as large as some we have visited. It just depends on what is important to you -- golf course view, right by the pool, quiet area, etc. It's any easy walk from most any villa to any one of the pools. Main pool area with waterfall, by the way, is very nice! Plenty of chairs/towels, with even quite a few chairs in the shade for those that aren't \"sunworshipers\". Plenty to do even around the perimeter of the pool (foosball, table tennis, snack bar, etc.) if you get tired of sunbathing or swimming. Staff was excellent -- very friendly and helpful. Shuttle left every half hour to the main JW Marriott hotel that is adjacent to Canyon Villas. You have full access to the hotel and facilities staying at the Canyon Villas. And what a beautiful place it is. Many pools, lazy river, restaurants, entertainment, etc. Back to the shuttle, it leaves every hour for the shopping center/restaurants, movie theater -- about a 4-minute ride from the Villas. So if you didn't plan on doing a lot of sightseeing in the Phoenix area and just want to relax, you could get by without a car by using the shuttle or sign up for one of the many tours the Villa offers. Also, the golf course is right there with shuttle service to that also. Several mornings complimentary \"get togethers\" are offered in the Main Reception area, e.g., coffee/doughnuts one morning to acquaint you with the area/tours; cereal breakfast another; fruit another; salsa tasting in the p.m., etc. All in all, a delightful place to stay with lots to see and do -- or do nothing but look at the beautiful scenery and enjoy the complex.

Only buildings 2300 and 2400 have non-lockoff 2br units. Two big groups of guests were the baseball fans in town for Spring training and the golfers here to tee it up in advance of the golf season up North. Look at http://www.cactusleague.com/ for more baseball information. Look at golfnow.com for course information and discount tee times. The Vacation Club resort was built in phases from 2004-2008 and units are still pretty new and at the higher Marriott standard of this recent period. The main pool is very nice, as a large fake rock formation which provides some shade seating, privacy, and a waterfall. There is a small shack for drinks and food; expect to pay too steep hotel prices for the convenience. But hey, if you care about your budget, buy some 12 packs of pop (beer?) at CVS and some plastic cups. Behind the rock formation is a small private waterfall and sun-bathing area and a hot-tub. This would definitely be the topless area of a European resort, but this ain't Europe. There are two other water areas. One is a two foot deep wading pool called Lizard Lagoon and the other is a small 4 foot deep almost hot-tub pool for soaking and talking. Temp is kept around 90-95 degrees. This is probably Sweeeet in February when the outside temp is 45-60 degrees. A new lounging courtyard has been installed between buildings 2400-2500-2600 and is my favorite place at the resort. Five seating areas are under large sun-sails which provide a filtered shade. There are also two seating areas around fire pits. The courtyard is home to shuffleboard courts, a herb garden, and a stretch of lawn used for Yoga and exercise every morning. You get full access to the pool, lazy river, restaurants, and spa at the JW Marriott next door. This is a big plus. The Wildfire Golf Club has two courses by Palmer and Faldo. The LPGA has a new tour stop here and the play next week and will play 18 holes using the back nine of both courses. It is a 6-7 minute walk or you could take the shuttle or drive. The Desert Ridge Marketplace has around 15 restaurants, 30 stores, CVS, Albertsons, a Bank os America and Starbucks. We seemed to be at the Paradise Bakery and Einstein Bagel a lot. I walked both ways to get breakfast in the morning. The shuttle will take you and pick up up. Albertson's and CVS is a must see because the Marriott Marketplace is the smallest I ever saw and prices are always better at a real store. Unit selection tips: Consider your favorite activities and the temperature/sun direction. The units by the pool are very convenient to the lobby, fitness center, etc. I like the courtyard and the shade. The East facing villas have a golf course view and morning sun. The South facing villas sound like a bad idea after April when temps are 100+. Building 2900 South facing units watch the traffic on the entrance road and the lobby parking lot. If you have not spent time in Phoenix, pay special attention to temperatures and clothing layers. Mornings are very cool in February and March. We had some days around 60 degrees and some days in the 80's. The air is very dry and we had a lot of allergy problems from dust and spring pollens. (Spring here is the end of February) This review is only for the second week of my stay.

Overall, I like the facility, although some amenities and service issues could be better. Main pool area is nice and has a variety of sitting areas, although depending on where you stay in the resort getting there means either you have to cross multiple parking lots or simply walk along paths, which of course is more preferrable. A nice \"quiet pool\" lies on the far edge of the property; it's a smaller area and is more of an expanded, free-form spa than a pool; no deep end, not enough room to swim but larger than the typical round hot tub. It was much more relaxing there than at the main pool where it can tend to get crowded and noisy. Regarding technology, their WiFi AND guest computer terminals in the lobby were down for 3 days; I deliberately like to travel light and therefore if a reputable hotel and resort has its own business center or computers, I'm going to take a chance and leave my own equipment at home or in the office. I'll use theirs instead of taking my laptop or have to rely on my smart-phone. Lesson learned: even in a good facility such as this tech problems can occur, which they did. Note to self - and others: bring your own so you're not without that medium of communication if you were depending on it. Inside my guestroom, the functionality of the TV remote was a joke. Buttons were sticky, many simply didn't even transmit a signal. I should've asked for a better working one, but by the 3rd I was so frustrated with that and their computers being down I just gave up. Another issue had to do with service. Being a timeshare owner (not in the Marriott family0 I successfully exchanged into the Canyon Villas. My stay was in the middle of October, not exactly peak season like Jan-March, or through Spring Break, which to us Northern Mid-Westerners, goes into the 2nd week of April. I called the Canyon Villas directly a week ahead of my stay and asked about the possibility of obtaining a larger 1-BR instead of the smaller one I had exchanged into. I received a very curt response of \"No, we're absolutely full.\" OK, I can buy that. I can also completely accept the limitations of my exchange. The only problem I had was that once I got there, the place was half-empty. If the hostess answering the phone the day I called would've taken the time to simply explain their policy of limiting exchangers only into smaller units, I could've accepted that as an honest, professional response. I remember thinking once I was there: if this facility is full, it means alot of people must've walked here or taken cabs from the airport, because some buildings on the grounds had NO cars in their dedicated parking lots. But to get there and find that her response was just one of convenience and untrue, it did leave alot to be desired as to Marriott's integrity. In thinking about it, whether or not I was in the large or small unit, it's arguably the same maintenance costs on their end: I'm going to use the same amount of linens, towels and soap regardless of which size unit I'm going to stay in. The units themslves are nice enough, although Marriott could take a page or two from Westin, Hilton or others when it comes to updating room decor. Interesting to note that as a Marriott member (hotels, not the timeshare division) I've stayed in newer Marriott Residence Inns which had nicer interiors than at the Canyon Villas. I still like the Canyon Villas, especially for its north central Phoenix location and the JW Desert Ridge, which is right \"next door\".

We could hear traffic very clearly early in the morning for rush hour and late in the evening past 11pm. It was almost a constant hum of the cars and horns honking, etc. We did not complain to management so I'm not sure if they would have moved us or not. Other than that, the grounds were extremely nice and well taken care of. We used the pool once and there were plenty of chairs and towels. There is also a separate kids pool with sprinklers located away from the main pool. By staying there you also get access to use the JW Marriott pool. They have a shuttle that will take you there or it is a short walk over. The JW has several pools including a lazy river that was so relaxing. We got there after 9 and it didn't really start getting crowded until closer to noon. The pools open at 7 so if you get there at that time you will probably have it to yourself for awhile. The location is perfect if you are going out for spring training baseball. All the stadiums are within about a 30 minute drive. There's lots of shopping and restaurants close too.

It was our first stay in America and we loved it. Our stay in Canyon Villas, was very enjoyable, we did not use the Golf Course but our room overlooked the green and it was a lovely view. We only visited the main Hotel in the evening for Dinner, all the Restaurants were very good, we did rather prefer the Restaurant called Tuscany. They all did a Glutton free menu which was helpful to me as I have an Intolerance. The shuttle bus was good to use to go over to the main Hotel, but it was only about a 12 minute walk and we did walk back sometimes. We also had a ride back in one of the larger Golf Buggies which for me a 62year old English lady was great fun. The swimming pool at Canyon Villas was very nice and although on our last day, we ventured over to use the one at the main Marriott Hotel, and that was very nice too. The Desert Ridge Market Place was, great too. We used the nice Shuttle buses to go over and sometimes we walked (25minute walk). We had the phone number of Reception and we were able to phone through from the Market place if we had walked over there, I think we confused the issue though when we walked as the driver did not know we had gone over, hence the phone call. The Shuttle go over to the Market every hour, I do not think many people walk over there. Detours was the tour people that Reception put us in touch with for our visit to Sedona, and also to Tombstone, they were very good. We used another driver, that Reception put us in touch with and I cannot praise this man enough, his first name was \"Richard\" and he was brilliant. Our holiday was very good. We did accept the 90 minute sales talk, this was not forced on us at all, and for listening we were given a $100 voucher to spend in any of the Restaurants at the Hotel. As we live in England and not in America we would not buy into this holiday, (We 2 apartments we have bought into in Malta) Although we have bought a weeks holiday here, which we will enjoy again in 2013. I loved the scenery. When we return, we will know to add another 2 hours to the 6 hours when we put our watches to Phoenix time. when we first arrived in Chicago, we put our watches back 6 hours.

We knew it was going to be hot, but we figured we would do all the pool type activities in the morning and travel about to air conditioned venues in the afternoon, and then come back in the evening when it cooled down a bit. Well every day averaged about 104-106 degrees. And while it is dry, my oven is dry and I don't stick my head in the oven. The one good thing about going in the summer I suppose is that the resort is not quite as busy. Unfortunately our stay did not start off on the right foot. After a nearly 6 hour flight and shuttling a ton of bags (there were five of us) from the airport to the hotel, all we wanted to do was go to our room, change and relax. Check in time is 4PM. We arrived shortly after 4 PM and our room was not ready, and they said they could not accommodate our request for a high floor. They finally found a room, but they said it would be about 2 hours before it would be ready. We were told later by one of the staff that during the summer, when it is much slower at the resort, they do not hire on their entire staff and this could have very well been the reason it was taking so long for the rooms to be ready. One good piece of advice is to definitely rent a car. Because we were four adults and one child, we did not rent a car at the airport because we would have needed a large car or SUV to fit all the luggage. So we rented a car at the Hertz rental agency connected to the JW Marriott Desert Ride on the other side of the street ( One of the perks of staying at the Villas is that you have access to all the facilities at the JW Marriott). We actually hired a Super Shuttle van exclusively for our family to take us to the hotel. It was very reasonable and we were all very comfortable with no problem handling the luggage. Because it was an exclusive rental (about $69 one way for all of us), there were not stops or drop offs to the hotel as there would be had we taken one of the \"regular\" Super Shuttles. Then we rented a much smaller and affordable car at the hotel for the rest of the week. This allowed us to try many of the great restaurants in the Scottsdale area and well as visit some great museums. One of the best museums we visited was the MIM (Musical Instrument Museum). If you like music, this is a must visit. It is a beautiful museum and very close to Canyon Villas. The facilities at Canyon Villas were ok, but not as nice as some of Marriott's other vacation club properties. We found ourselves spending more time at the hotel across the street which is magnificent. It has more pools, lazy river, choice of fine restaurants, etc. Our two bedroom villa was clean and roomy and pretty much a copy of other Marriott Vacation Club villas. All in all, we had a great time. My six year old granddaughter had a blast as well.

A list of activities for the week was included at check-in, and there is a little bit of something for everybody going on throughout the resort from early morning to late evening every day. We had booked the one bedroom unit which was small but adequate for two people. I travel with a blacklight to examine the room for \"hidden\" stains on beds/floors, etc., and to my surprise, the unit was extremely clean (I almost always find something)! These kind of things always skeeve me out, but I'm happy to report that the sheets and pillowcases were spotless! Only a couple of random stains on the couch is all I could find. The fridge and microwave came in handy, the bed was comfortable, the deck overlooking the pool was nice, and the high-speed internet was fast. Also, the parking lot had covered parking spaces, which proved extremely useful when going out in your car after a day sitting in the hot Arizona sun! The next morning, we discovered our unit didn't have a hair dryer, but after a quick call to the front desk, we had one within minutes. A visit to the concierge was extremely helpful in planning activities for us in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and she had advice on everything from dining to hot air balloon rides to Jeep tours in Sedona. Plus, she handed us a Marriott Vacation Card and a sheet of paper with local establishments offering various discounts when you displayed the card. The workout area is amazing -- from free weights to cardio machines -- you'll feel like you're a member at a gym. The pools are nice and stay open until 11PM. We did go over to the JW Marriott side of the resort, and it's even nicer over there! Free valet parking for Canyon Villas guests, and free access to the pools and the lazy river! You don't even have to carry cash or credit - everything gets billed back to your room which is nice. Never had a chance to go golfing, or check out many of the restaurants at the JW Marriott, so I can't comment on that, but we did volunteer to attend their 90 minute Vacation Club presentation at the suggestion of the concierge in order to get a $100 credit to resort. While the presentation was very interesting, and the vacation club seems like a good value, it wasn't within our budget at this time. Although the presentation was not high pressure, it did last nearly an hour longer than advertised so be prepared to sit there for 2.5 hours if you attend. We also chose to get 15,000 Marriott Reward points added to our membership account instead of the $100 Resort credit which basically amounts to a 1-2 nights stay at a Marriott-brand hotel (depending on the brand).

The hotel grounds are desert like (OK, yes well we were in the desert, but compared to Palm Desert grounds which are beautifully tendered, well there is no comparison. Our apartment was at the far end (future development/expansion area), near to the \"quiet pool\" which was in fact a spa pool, and overlooked what I would describe as scrubland.

There are two pools at the Villas but the area is smaller and it feels more crowded. The hotel also has a few restaurants, including a Roy's with patio seating and happy hour from 4 to 6pm.

Yes, it is hot, but I love the desert & it is a relaxing, elegant vacation. Go for the Marriott tour & we encourage you to buy into the program. It is a great program for families or couples to vacation. Marriott is not high pressure & if you are not interested you will still get a gift, like $100.00 for the JW restuarants across the property. There are 2 golf courses here, Wildfire & another Faldo course i think. I don't play golf, but the courses are pretty. The Marriott landscaping is fantastic. I love the variety of desert landscaping, it is so pretty. There is also a lot of wildlife on the grounds, many birds including quail, rabbits, owls, etc. The villas come as 2 bed, 2 bath unit with washer/dryer, etc. You can also rent just 1 bedroom, or just a studio unit. Four people should have at least a 1 bedroom. Studios are good for 2 people, but don't have washer/dryer & have only mini kitchen with microwave / coffee maker, etc. We travel a lot & we own a Marriott week at Grand Chateau Las Vegas, and a week at Shadow Ridge, Palm Desert, with both being 2 bedroom units. We have stayed at Canyon Villas more than anywhere else because the Villas are roomy, the area beautiful & the choice of pools is awesome. The pools at the Villas are wonderful & there are several, but you can also go & use the pools at the JW Marriott next door. There is an exercise room on site & other amenities. We go to the Albertson's market in the Desert Ridge Center & stock up on food to cook in the villa. The villas have granite counter tops, & the Master bedroom has a room with a shower, toilet & sink, then there is a 2nd master sink counter area, & a large soaking tub. The rooms have balconies or patios with tables and chairs on them. There are BBQ's scattered around the resort you can use. There are activities you can sign up for. Free parking & free WIFI. The beds & bedding are wonderful! Also, the studio & the living room both have sofabeds. Marriott is putting in new sofas in all villas across the globe that have memory foam mattresses.

I almost became overwhelmed with thinking that I would be the exception...but, happily...I wasn't. Marriott's Canyon Villas is a GREAT resort with everything you'd want in a vacation. We stayed in a two-bedroom villa during the first week of June in 2011. Our room number was 2705 and we exchanged in via the Marriott Destination Program on a Thursday-Thursday stay. I'll give you the low-down! The resort: Canyon Villas is an exception resort located on a property that is shared by the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. As a guest at Canyon Villas, you have unrestricted access to the JW, which is AMAZING. A Shuttle bus runs every hour on the hour, but the walk isn't bad at between 5-10 minutes. A good, brief walk before you lounge at the pool is ok! Just stay hydrated. The room: The room is well appointed with a nice water fountain as you enter, full kitchen, dining area, living area, master bedroom suite and an efficiency lock-off. The master bathroom has a tub/vanity combo, as well as a seperate toilet/shower area. The kitchen has a breakfast bar that crosses into the dining area, which includes a full dining table. Pools: Everywhere! There are two main pools in the central resort area, but close to that are smaller spas and other pools. There is a quiet pool at the end of the resort which I frequented, but I am not into the kid thing while I am trying to relax, so, it's cool. The quiet pool is warm, but very refreshing when you get out. There is also a kiddie pool area on the northern side of the resort. The Canyon Springs pool bar is cool...nice people, good food...a little overprices for a pool bar, but well, ya know how it is. Fire pits were located around the property in the pool areas for after hours enjoyment. Sometimes you had to deal with the family smores-a-thon as an evening way to entertain the children, but once that cleared out you can sit by the fire and stare at the stars, which is awesome. Resort Grounds: Impeccably maintained. There are grills in the main resort area, and inbetween a set of buildings on both sides of the property. Near the grills on the south side of the property there is a nice herb garden where you can pick some herbs to accent your dishes...a nice and simple touch. Fitness: Two nice fitness rooms on either side of the main lobby, one for cardio and one for weights. The weight machines were good, but somewhat limiting. Dumbbells up to 50lbs. Remember though, you also have access to the JW weight room, which is a short warm-up run away. At the JW, the weight room has older equipment, but a little more variety, including a Smith Machine, which was good to switch it up. I used both and it worked out ok. All the cardio equip was relatively new and state of the art. There are tennis courts on the grounds as well. Location: Literally at the edge of the desert, which was great. You aren't in the downtown Phoenix area, yet you have access to the Desert Ridge Marketplace, Scottsdale, etc. We found it to be extremely convenient. Originally, we had toyed with the idea of staying in Sedona, but am extremely happy it worked out this way. Sedone is less than a two hour drive, and is perfect for a day trip, or a two-day trip. Anything more than that, I think I'd get red-rocked out. There is much more culture, fine dining, and things to do in the greater phoenix/scottsdale/glendale area...so, this resort location gives you access to it all. Room location: If your goal is to relax and enjoy vacation, try to shoot for a room facing the Golf Course on the second or third floor. We loved the location of our room, but it was on the first floor, which was fine for the beginning of our stay. But, on Sunday, new tenants moved in down the hall and they seemed to want to use the back of the villa as their access to the pool, which is weird because that is where you bedroom is, your private patio, etc. The back is the part that looks onto the golf course (if that is your room view) and it has a large dividing area of plants, rocks, and dirt to seperate it. So, it's nice to look out the door and stare, or sit out on the patio in the morning with coffee...which is why it was so ODD for people to use the back of the villa...it was kind of unsettling. We said something to them, but they were a little thick. Odd, given that they can just go out the front door and take the real hallways to the same location and not have to walk through rocks and plants. So, long story, but it helped remind me of the need for a second or third story room. The JW: This resort is amazing and beautiful. What's truly awesome about this is that you get the beauty and spaciouness of the villa...but, the beauty and grandeur of the JW. This answers some of the indulgent needs of the timeshare traveler! The JW has large and expansive pools, including a lazy river. There is TONS of space to lounge in the sun. The lobby area is huge and has tons of couches to sit out at overlooking the pond. There are fire pits everywhere for at night, and tons of space outside and inside to sit around, and that's not including within the pool area. There are multiple restaurants on site at the JW. Blue Sage is typical American fare, including a buffet breakfast, moderately (resort) priced food. We took a chocolate class here with one of the head-chefs which was awesome...look for it on Sat morning. $39 includes breakfast, class, and take homes!. Roys was by far our favorite, most notably for it's daily 4-6 happy hour where martinis, wine, and select appetizers are only $5 per. Outdoor seating, live music on Fri/Sat...this was the place to be!!! Roy's is hawaiian fusion cuisine and everything was amazing. Try the Hawaiian martini! In addition, there is an italian restaurant (didn't go...desert doesn't say italian to me, but it looked nice). There is also a great-looking steakhouse in the clubhouse to the golf course on the same property...didn't go, but looked amazing. There is a pool bar and a poolside taco bar. The pool bar service was nice...there were always employees working the pool side lounges asking for drinks and food. Try the Kokopelli drink...it's awesome. Was a little disappointed that there weren't any drink specials...but, it was the JW, and I had to adjust my brain. The JW includes Revive Spa which has full spa services (for a fee), a private gym (addt'l fee) and a restaurant. We saw Segway tours that toured the grounds leaving from there as well ($$). Overall, the Canyon Villas/JW combo is a one-two punch knockout. It gave you the spaciousness of villa living as well as the opulence of JW life. The location provided amazing vistas as well as accessibility to Scottsdale and other Phoenix area attractions. The grand canyon was a bit too far, but won't be on the next trip...there was just too much to do and didn't want to not be around the pool another day...especially since I know we'll be back in the Valley of the Sun at the Canyon Villas soon.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vail, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Mozo", "ReviewID": "UR110452325", "Content": "My wife and I spent time here for a quick getaway.

It felt a little sparse in the kitchen implements, but we were able to get along with what was available. Our unit faced the Childrens pool with Frog Waterfall. We enjoyed the sound of the waterfall so much we slept with the window open to hear it all night. Again, in the low season we saw very few people even use that pool. Movie night at the Main pool allowed us to watch the movie while sitting IN the pool, which we thought was a unique experience. We specifically choose Canyon Villas for the JW Marriott Lazy River. It is beautiful and we were not disappointed. To get there we had to drive to the Canyon Villas reception area and wait for the shuttle. During our waits, we found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. (Thanks you Sharon) The free Ice water available everywhere (Canyon Villas and Marriott) was perfect. The only possible downside was transit time to the JW Marriott. After a couple of days I realized that we were spending at least an hour of our precious vacation, each time we visited the 'other side'. And parking at the JW Marriott was Valet or a 1/4 mile hike from self parking, neither of which was attractive to us. We found shopping for groceries to be super convenient, literally just down the street.

We had a fantastic week full of swimming, sunbathing, and eating, peppered with day-trips to the Grand Canyon and Sedona. I'll break my review into sections. THE ROOM: We had a 2-bedroom villa in building 3400, which is the northernmost building, though still not too far from the front desk and the main pool. The villa is nicely decorated and is spacious enough to host guests. Each bedroom is large and features a large (37\"?) flat screen TV. My wife and I were in the second bedroom and had our own balcony/lanai overlooking the kids splash pool. We also had a separate entrance and small kitchenette area. Overall the room was great for us. If you prefer a quieter location, ask to be placed in a room on the southern end of the resort to be away from the road and the kids pool. CANYON VILLA AMENITIES: The resort had plenty to do, in addition to being a beautiful place for a nice walk. We spent a lot of time by the main pools. There were a lot of kids who were generally well-behaved, but there was still enough room to move around and snag a good lounge chair. There are two areas where lounges are placed under misters. Much to my surprise, they don't get you that wet, so you can read a book under them while enjoying what feels like AC! I wasn't impressed by the food at the Canyon Springs bar, but it was decent (and the staff was friendly). We also took advantage of the well-appointed fitness center, which has a good variety of new machines. Confusingly, however, the cardio and weight rooms are adjacent to one another, but you have to go outside (and use your key card) to pass between them. We also attended a yoga class led by a human instructor one day (on other days, yoga is led by a DVD!). We also made use of the grills distributed throughout the property. There are many more amenities but we didn't take advantage of them. JW MARRIOTT AMENITIES: We often walked over to the JW Marriott across the street (we never were able to catch the shuttle - it's a short walk anyway) to use the pools and to dine out. The pool area is very nice - who can resist a lazy river? We liked the nearby serpentine pool because it was quieter and offered natural shade from trees. The pool area restaurant at the JW was much better than at the Canyon Villas. There is chair-side food and beverage service there too. Just be sure to ask for a full menu when they come by - the laminated sheet they distribute has a fraction of what is offered at the restaurant. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion restaurant has \"Aloha Hour\" with drink specials and appetizers for $5 each - quite a deal. In my opinion, you can skip all the other appetizers and order the sliders - they're incredible and the sweet potato fries they come with are really tasty! Great staff there too. We also had dessert only at Meritage, the steakhouse at the JW. The restaurant was mostly empty and service was awkward, but it was nice nonetheless. The decor is nice but I am always weirded out by cowhide (fake or not), which adorns the chairbacks. We attended the stargazing event at the JW one night. There were a lot of kids with parents that were more interested in seeing Saturn than keeping their kids from throwing pebbles at ducks. It basically turned into a kid's program, so we left (after having seen Saturn, of course!). OUTSIDE THE RESORT: The Desert Ridge Marketplace is down the road and offers a bunch of restaurants and shops. Sadly, most of them are found in every other shopping center in America (CPK, Rock Bottom, Macaroni Grill, TGI Friday's, etc.). There is also an In-n-Out Burger which I indulged in (animal style!). Upon check-in, the Canyon Villas provides a coupon book for various stores and restaurants at the marketplace. We used 4-5 of these coupons and saved a bit of money. Sedona is a 2-hour drive and the Grand Canyon is four hours away. We visited Montezuma's Castle and drove through Sedona on our way to the Canyon, where we spent one night at a cheapo hotel in order to get more time seeing the world's largest hole. Sedona was worth a second trip, where we took (and thoroughly enjoyed) a Pink Jeep tour. On our last night we drive through Scottsdale. We wish we had thought of it sooner - we would have spent more time in downtown Scottsdale if we could have. Overall, it was a fantastic vacation made more fantastic by our stay at the Villas. We highly recommend it for anyone, especially families with children.

There is even a water fountain installed in the wall to keep the dryness of the air moderate. Between the building complexes there is a big garden space which makes the villa patio very private. We enjoyed cooking with the fresh herbs growing right outside the patio and they have every imaginable herb. There are BBQs right out to the left, close enough to take our food there easily but far enough off to not be bothered by other BBQers. To the pool areas it was a short nice walk through the garden and were luckily either to the left or the right side of the apartment. There is a quiet spool (huge hot tub but not as hot as a real hot tub). Behind the reception is the main pool area with a big nice temperatured pool with a water fall and 2 hot tubs with one water fall each plus a little lap pool. If this is not enough you can take a shuttle to the adjacent Marriott Hotel and use all the amenities there. We took the car over and some just walked through the golf course. The hotel is very tranquil, especially the outside setting with the Hawaiian restaurant and pretty pond is great for a cocktail in the evening. The pool area doesn't look big at first sight but opens up to different levels and curves around the property. This gives you much more privacy. Behind the pool is another lovely pond which has a great view over the golf corse and to the mountains. The lazy river with the free tubes are great for kids and adults as well. Floating by and watching birds, ducks and bunnies. The jack rabbits are all over and just so cute! The pools have all different temperatures from warm to hot. So no freezing anywhere around your belly line when getting in, which I loved!

I believe the outfit was called Destinations, driver was Todd. Very clean vehicle and more reasonably priced that a cab or limo service. We own at a Marriott timeshare in Myrtle Beach and this resort although set up slightly different, is very nice. We stayed in the two bedroom unit, while our friends were in a lock off efficiency unit. The two bedroom unit is furnished very well. Beds are exceptional, plenty of living space, dishes, washer/dryer which come in handy, 3 tV's, kitchen with appliances. Set up is similar to our timeshare in MB. The lock off is fairly small, but worked fine for two people with a king bed, couch and small fridge, coffee maker. All units have decks. We were in a 3rd floor unit in bldg 2700 overlooking the pool. A couple of units overlooked the golf course, others didn't have too much of a view. The activities at the resort worked out well for us. We played the two golf courses on site, both were in very good shape, alot of traps but fair off the tee and fairly large greens. We lounged by the pool several afternoons, never had a problem finding a chair. The pool bar is a good place to get a lunch and a cold beverage or two! Beverage manager Matt is top notch. My wife and daughter took advantage of the Spa at the JW Marriott a couple of times while I was golfing, and they said it was heavenly. We took one day trip through Detours to the Grand Canyon. Picked us up a 7Am returned at 7PM. Fairly expensive but definetly worth it. Don't get sold on only going as far as Sedona (beautiful red rocks), but nothing compared to the grand canyon. We ate out most everynight. The desert ridge mall is within a mile and offers several resturants and shopping. The KEG was a good steakhouse, reasonably priced and the Yard house offered about as many different beers as I have ever seen. TGIF, Maraconi Grill were also good. Went into Scottsdale one night to the Capital Grill, very good food and environment but overpriced compared to some we've been to. We went over to the JW a couple of times during the week. Only about a 10 minute walk and a shuttle is offered at times but we never seemed to match up. The JW is outstanding. The grounds, pool, spa are all top notch. Ate at Raye's, which was very good.

Since it was only for one night, I busted out laughing, it was so bad. If it had been for longer, we would have gone elsewhere.) Having never been to AZ, we loved seeing desert and the Grand Canyon and thought being able to use the resort made this a great value. I would have given it 5 stars for cleanliness, as it appeared spotless, but one night I saw a roach in the bathroom. Eeek! Maybe that's normal for hot climates, but not for a northern city girl. Still, I'd go back.

Our experience was mixed. Pros: - Very spacious, attractive, well-appointed suites at reasonable rates. We were able to host a dinner for 8 adults and 6 kids in our suite by using all of the tables and chairs provided. - For kids, there is a small playground, a shallow splash pool, and a large 3.5-foot-deep pool at the resort. - Access to the JW Marriott next door (long walk or short drive) with its \"lazy river\" pool, Roy's restaurant, and very attractive grounds. - Big shopping center across the street has a supermarket, Target, and many other shops and restaurants. - Half an hour drive away from downtown Phoenix and the airport, museums, zoo, Desert Botanical Garden, etc. Cons: - The buildings are very densely packed on the property. The 3300 building, where we stayed, is very close to a busy four-lane road. Most of the time we couldn't hear the noise inside our suite, but when we stepped outside it was very noticeable. As I walked from one building to another or to the pools, I was very aware of the housing development just a few dozen yards away, and of the fairly massive resort buildings packed fairly close together. The net result for me was that it was missing that \"away from it all\" feeling that I typically get in a high-end resort. - I could not get the climate control to work correctly. I like to keep the fan on to keep the air circulating. In both of our rooms, if the fan was on, so was the AC, and the room kept getting colder. In other words, there was no way to run the fan without also cooling the room. Eventually it would get too cold (much colder than the thermostat was set for, and the only solution was to switch the unit off. - There were bright spots (engineering was super prompt and helpful when we had some minor issues with the rooms), but overall service was mediocre. As one example, two days in a row the supply of towels at the main pool ran out. I can see this happening once, but twice in a row indicates someone's not trained or not doing their job. - The playground and splash pool are far from the main pool.

We had a 1 bedroom with a full kitchen, dining room and living room. The resort accommodated my request (left a voice mail message a week before our arrival) to have a top floor room. We enjoyed the top floor room as there was no noise from 'loud walkers' up above. However, the balcony for our room overlooked a rather boring courtyard and faced another set of villas so there was no real view and little privacy. The villa itself was very nicely laid out and we had plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 young childre. The villa was well stocked, was clean, and everything was in working order. We only spent 1 day at the villa pools and our kids were bored because there was no waterslide or lazy river. Therefore, we spent the other days at the JW Marriott across the road (it is easy walking distance for adults but the kids complained about the long walk so we generally took the free shuttle bus back and forth between the JW and the Canyon Villas). The shuttle ran on time and the drivers were courteous. The JW resort is beautiful and has a few very nice pools with something for everyone including families as there is a very nice area to lay out in reclining chairs and be able to watch your kids on the waterslide. We did not eat at the villas pool restaurant but we did eat a few times at the JW pools (wait staff comes around frequently to ask if you need anything). The food was average and prices were reasonable for a resort of this caliber. I would sum it up by saying that the villa was beautiful but the Canyon Villas Resort lacks a little bit as far as kids activities go, and their Marriott Marketplace is the size of closet with no supplies so be prepared to go off-site for a lot of things. We stayed at the Westin Kierland villas in May 2009 and would rate the Kierland 1 star higher than the Marriott. The rooms are very similar, but the Westin Kierland Villas pool area, gym, marketplace, etc, all have a more upscale feel to it.

I'm glad I didn't trade my Maui unit for this place though, because it wouldn't be worth it. My first big beef with this place was that as soon as I walked in, there was no hotel book in the whole room. By hotel book, I mean the book that gives a map of the hotel, the amenities, the TV channel list, restaurants on-site and in the area, etc. I called the front and asked where it was, and they said they were in process of printing new ones. Not a good excuse. Also, there was no Where magazine in the room, just a permanent hard copy version of the weekly magazine, which is very cheap. I found out at the JW hotel guests though were given a copy of the weekly Where magazine though- the villa guests are not good enough I guess to get this. The vacation club villas were a good 14 minute walk to the main JW Marriott hotel, since our villa was the farthest from the central area. Although I don't mind walking, I found the walkways to be awkward and disjointed, and there were no signs on how to get to the JW. The lighting between the 2 resorts was truly awful- way too dark to be considered safe. There was no \"welcome owners\" reception, and the activities at the JW were not readily shared with the villa guests. I found out at the JW about a nature walk given on Saturdays at the hotel, and I'm glad I went (it was great), but this wasn't advertised at the villas section. The market pantry was poorly stocked and pretty pathetic, with no decent magazines. Our TV turned itself on and off mysteriously (I think it had a broken touch sensor), and after I told the front desk, she said someone would come and look at it. Nobody ever came. No room tidying was ever done, so I can't speak of the housekeeping. The location was very good, but the resort just isn't good enough to be a true destination. The JW however was very nice, but I felt so separated from it with the lack of signs and lighting. The villa guests seem second rate to the hotel, and I would never buy one of the villas. The shuttle that ran between the two resorts was never useful for us, since I didn't want to stand and wait when I could just walk and get there faster. The spa was excellent and the on-site hotel restaurants were very good. I loved how they had cold water available all around the hotel, villas, and pools. The resort was very nice, with comfy beds, good towels, etc...everything you expect from Marriott. The flair was all at the JW however, but the main pool section at the villas was a good size and had a fun waterfall in the center of the pool. We saw tons of rabbits on the grounds, which was cute, and some interesting birds. We hiked up Camelback Mountain, which was awesome, and I would highly recommend it. It is was strenous though, and you need to be adventurous to do it. We ate the the breakfast restaurant at the JW and at Roys also, they were very good. The villas has no restaurant, but there is a shack at the pool area that serves typical fried food wonders. I though the Phoenix area was wonderful, with a great climate, and beautiful scenery. There are lots of day hikes to do, so it was hard to choose just one due to our time contraints. The airport was only about 20 minutes aways and we didn't encounter any big traffic tie ups.

My mom, 11-year-old daughter, and I stayed in a two bedroom unit, and it was fabulous! The units are furnished very nicely, large flat screen TV's in the living room and both bedrooms, beautiful landscaping throughout the resort, etc. We did go over to the JW Marriott next door to visit the pool and lazy river. The JW is lavish both inside and out, landscaping is fantastic, and there are several ducks wandering around outside - very cute. However, we didn't feel the need to go back again to its pool & lazy river. ( We don't care for lazy rivers where water squirts on your head a few times as you go around.) We actually found it to be more enjoyable at the pool at the Villas. The only drawback to the pool at the Villas is that there is no shade where you have to stand in line to get food and drinks at the pool bar - also no mat to stand on, so if you're in bare feet on the hot concrete, watch out! Another great thing about the JW next door is that we ate at Roy's Hawaiian. I'm a big fan of this restaurant (have eaten previously at the one in Philadelphia), so I made reservations. It happened to be Restaurant Week in Phoenix, so we got a 3-course meal for $29! And most of the seating is outside with wonderful landscaping and tiki torches, so the atmosphere is just wonderful. OK, back to the Villas - not only did we enjoy the condo itself, we also enjoyed going out in the morning just beyond our patio to a large paved area with a waterfall, foliage, gas grills, tables & chairs, and a playground with a slide, which is formed as the tail of a gigantic lizard (or gecko??). There are even pails and shovels in case the kids want to play in the \"sand\" (it doesn't look like beach sand, but it's sandy-ish). We didn't have a lot of interaction with staff, but they were very responsive if I had a question or needed anything. We had a lightbulb out, and they replaced it within minutes. As previous posters have said, the Desert Ridge Marketplace is very close and has tons of restaurants, shops, movie theater, gas station, etc. - also an Alberton's grocery store so you can stock your fridge. (You can look at website for Desert Ridge Marketplace to see what shops it has.) We don't cook on vacation, but we always get soft drinks, snacks, and breakfast items - we use just the fridge and microwave. Oh and we also used the coffee maker, but we didn't particularly care for the complimentary Yuban coffee - but it was nice that they provided it. Also, daily maid service was provided at no extra charge like at some timeshares. I know there's also a little market shop in the lobby of Villas, but we weren't there long enough to use it, so I can't speak to what it carries. We really enjoyed the covered parking at the villas - keeps your car much cooler. No charge for parking, and there seemed to be plenty of it. The villas were actually pretty full when we were there, even though it was after all kids had gone back to school. They said it was because JW was full and Villas were taking overflow. But it didn't seem crowded at the pool, parking, etc. We enjoyed the misters at the pool, water basketball, and the games around the pool area - air hockey, ping pong, billiards, and the big checkers/chess board on the deck. On this visit, we took the 1-day tour to Grand Canyon with Detours. They picked us up at Villas at 7:30 a.m. and we returned about 9:15 p.m. (a litte behind schedule, not due to anyone's fault). It was a very informative tour, and we even decided to do the optional helicopter tour with Maverick Helicopters at the Grand Canyon. You can get more info at Detours website. We also visited the Heard Museum, which is very nice (AAA has a small discount for this museum). We had lunch at their outdoor cafe - wonderful food and very nice little courtyard area. You can view the menu at the website for Heard Museum. One last bit of info - there's not really a convenient place to get gas close to the airport, but you can gas up your rental car at the Shell station at Desert Ridge Marketplace, and your tank will still show \"full\" when you return it at airport. Try renting from National - that's where I found the best deals because you can stack contract ID's and coupons.

There is a complimentary shuttle every 20 minutes to take you to the JW Marriott Desert Ridge where you can enjoy the busy 2 story lobby, spa, pools and Lazy RIver.

My husband and I (just shy of our 40's) traveled, as guests with my parents to the villas. They had the main room with the kitchen and living area and we had the \"lockout\" second bedroom. Everyone has commented on the cleanliness of the villas and we concur! Loved having our own balcony, fridge and microwave in our unit., as well as the separate entrance. Pool area at the villas are nice, however, don't sit by the gated entrances, as the gates slam quite loudly all day long with people running in and out of the area. They really need to change this in the very near future! Also, would be nice to have drink service while you lounge...they don't. But is not a hike at all over to the outdoor bar. See Kelsey, she is awesome!! Must go to the JW Marriott pools!! Property is gorgeous with impeccably groomed landscape, huge palm trees and little streams running everywhere. Pools are quite nice and most lounge chairs have a red flag that you can raise for service~~ excellent. Their sandwiches by the pool are fantastic and only around $12. Domestic beer $4.50 and imports $5.50. Mixed fun drinks are around $9. Order the Waterslide Splash~~ smirnoff raspberry vodka and Citron vodka, Chambord, cranberry juice and lemonade. Lazy river is free and quite nice. As others have written, we did have a problem with our key for the pool, but the front desk at the JW was more than helpful to rectify the situation. Did do the 90 minute presentation for the timeshare and was given $100 in Marriott money. 2 tips: One, the presentation went to 3 hours!!! So, be prepared to say no to both the initial person and then the 2nd person they say they are sending in to do the survey. Noooo, she is there is push another type of deal. Anyway, just be firm if you are not interested, although, in all fairness, it IS interesting!! Two, use the $$$ certificates during your stay at the restaurants or spa. We tried to use them at checkout because we had $400 in food bills and they would not accept them! Thank you to George, at the front desk who tried for us! My Father had to hammer it all out with the sales staff the next day, but we should have just used them during our stay. Did not use the spa, although I did walk in to check it out. Very nice. Numerous restaurants at the JW Marriott. We ate at Roy's, Meritage Steakhouse. Both very good. Prime rib is smoked at Meritage, so if you don't like it smoked (like myself), then order with caution. All others enjoyed their selections. Oh yes, choose the prime rib sliders( three of them) which is a $15 appetizer! So worth it and you won't need an entree! After dinner sit on the outside patio, with the guy playing the guitar, tiki torches lightly burning over at Roy's, palm trees lit with white/lavendar lights and the grassy area with flowers encircling it. See--happiness!! We also went over the the MacDonald Ranch and went horseback riding for an hour ~~ I believe it was only $40 per person. Our young authentic cowboy, Colt, was very nice and grew up w/ horses. They also recommend the moonlight trail ride which we were going to do, but I chickened out thinking bugs would get me. He said it is one of the best rides. My horse, Azul, was so gentle, a 5 year old could have ridden him!! Please tip the wrangler, as he was SO grateful! And as numerous others have written, the Canyon Villa bus is excellent to transport you to various locations.

We were put in room 3331 which is feet away from a six lane highway intersection. The highway noise was so loud we could hardly hear each other talk. I felt like I was staying at a motor lodge, not at a vacation resort. At night you could hear trucks and motorcycles rolling by. We asked to switch rooms, and were given a bit of a run around at the front desk, and eventually told they did not have any rooms to move us to. The block of buildings we stayed in had a small wading pool nearby which was about 1 1/2 feet deep, but my kids got bored easily with that. That meant having to drive to the pool at the canyon villas or drive over to the JW Marriott. If you go to the JW Marriott pool, be prepared, you will have to park far from the front entrance and it is quite a hike back to the pool. There are shuttle busses, but because of our building location we had to drive to the bus stop anyway. I think that if you stayed in several of the other buildings you might be able to walk to the canyon villa pool, but if you are in the outer building near the highway you will need to drive. We also experienced some disatisfaction with the desk clerks. I called 7 or 8 times down to the lobby, and the phone had to ring 10-12 times before someone answered, or there was no answer at all. I am sure it was a busy weekend, so perhaps that is the reason for the slow responses. But they were unable to help us with even the simplest questions, and then told us they would call us back with an answer and never did. We also had problems when we checked out with the kids club charges not hitting up, and an issue surrounding the use of our Marriott gift card. We have checked out of the hotel and I have made six or seven calls and am still working to get this resolved. My kids loved the kids club at the JW Marriott.

Before I could say \"no\", my wife said \"yes\" so we booked flights on Southwest to Phoenix. The Canyon Villas are about 20 miles northeast of the Phoenix airport and are very easy to find - with the help of bro-in-law's Magellan GPS with the nickname of \"Maggie\". The Desert Ridge shopping center is about a mile from the resort and has every kind of restaurant you could want - from In and Out Burger to microbreweries to high end restaurants. There are also the usual stores like Old Navy, Gap, etc and the all important grocery store (Albertson's) which has a great supply of beer, wine, and liquor. We had a 2 bedroom unit which was perfectly fine. It did not have a great view of anything from the balconies but was very nicely furnished. Marriott has gone away from the glass-topped dining tables because they were just too messy with fingerprints and also with food in the space between the table top and glass. The dining tables are now wood tops and have been \"weathered and distressed\" at the factories so little scratches do not show up from visitors. Good thinkiing! The lockout portion was very nice with a great king size bed, sofa, flat screen television, dressing area, and good sized bathroom. The master bedroom had a very large bathroom, double sinks and whirlpool tub in the dressing area, a king size bed, chairs, and a television. The kitchen had an electric stove, microwave, coffee maker, dishwasher, and good sized refrigerator. The washer and dryer were behind a kitchen louver door and were the only drawback. They were extremely loud when running - so we used them just before leaving for the day. Canyon Villa guests can use the facilities at the JW Marriott resort and the shuttle bus to and from the resort. We really enjoyed the swimming pool at the JW and the Lazy River area. There is a beautiful golf course (expensive at $199 for guests) but we enjoyed walking the cart paths before golfers got out there. The wildlife was great to see. There are lots of rabbits, coveys of quail, several hawks, lots of cactus wrens, and quite a few hummingbirds to see every morning on the walks. We used Canyon Villas for a base to explore other areas of Arizona such as Prescott, Jerome, Sedona, Mesa, Scottsdale, and Cave Creek. Be sure to go to the red rock country of Sedona and take the famous Pink Jeep Tours. We did the Broken Arrow Trail tour which is 2 hours of off-road trekking over a trail you could not believe a mountain goat could traverse - but the jeep had no problem. Outstanding views! Attend the 90 minute sales presentation and receive a $100 voucher for Roy's (Hawaiian fusion) at the JW or a $100 American Express gift card. No sales pressure and an excellent meal at Roy's. We ate at some other great places, too. I recommend Las Dos Molinas on Central Avenue for a \"locals\" place which has excellent New Mexico Southwest food (no mild served!) in a casual atmosphere. I recommend reading and packing the AAA Guide for Arizona, taking a good roadmap and a GPS with you to find your way around in an easy way.

However, the hotel facilities make up for the villas as it is absolutely beautiful.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot What I Expected\u201d", "Author": "disneyfanandmom", "ReviewID": "UR16778598", "Content": "We stayed at the Marriott Canyon Villas from May 31 to June 6. We checked into the hotel around 11:00am and our room was not ready, which was fine because we had requested a room on the third floor overlooking the pool. However, we came back to check in we were given a second floor room not quite overlooking the pool. However, when I went to fix the kids a snack, the dish area was crawling with ants. I called the front desk and the maintenance man sprayed for the ants. The smelled bothered me and I requested another room. We ended up in building 3300 (the farthest area from the pool) on the first floor looking at the desert (as described, but really some desert plants and a dirt road for the maintenance men.) Our next incident with bugs came after my son took his bath. There was a cockroach behind the toliet. Again the room was sprayed. (Bug season in Arizona is what I was told, haven't had these issues at the Marriott resorts in Florida) I then awoke at 4:00am to use the bathroom and the door was locked. (I closed the door to not smell the spray and the door ended up locking.) Unfortunately, there were no other rooms. During the rest of our visit, we encountered the following items: a missed wake up call, keys that did not work at the JW pool area and an unannouced visit to our room (a request was made for new towels in another room, but our room was changed in error - did not expect someone to entry our room while we were away.) Overall, we enjoyed Arizona. We took the AZ Hummer Tour which was awesome. The best part of the resort was the pool. It would have been nice if an attempt was made to reconcile the issues that we encountered.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "AuroraIL", "ReviewID": "UR15996514", "Content": "WOW! What a timeshare property. I have stayed at a couple of timeshare properties in the past and they have been OK, but nothing like this. I might have to consider purchasing a place here. Before Our Trip: We were contacted by the resort a week prior to checking in to see if there any special requirements that we had. This caught us off guard because we has exchanged through interval to stay here, and we are not even Marriott's owners. We had told them that we would be arriving the morning and they said it would be no problem to drop off our bags at the front desk and get started on our vacation. Check-In: Check-in was a breeze, we arrived about 11am. The guy at the front desk was extremely friendly. Gave us a detailed overview of the Villas and the JW Marriott across the way. Also gave us recommendations of restaurants at the Desert Ridge Marketplace that was close by. He then realized that our room was not ready yet, but checked to see if anything else was available. The was an available room and he let us check-in to that room right away. Room: We were only able to find the efficiency available when we booked on interval, but it was just fine for the two of us. It was just your standard Marriott hotel room that was clean, comfortable, and enough space for the two of us. It did not have a full kitchen, but had a small sink, mini refrigerator, and microwave. If traveling with a family I would recommend at least getting the one bedroom unit. That has more room and a full kitchen and dining area. Pools: I found the pools at both the Canyon Villas and the JW Marriott to be very nice. They were both clean and had plenty of towels to use. I thought the pool at the Canyon Villas was not nearly and busy and cramped at the one at the JW, but the one at the JW did have the benefit of having a lazy river. At the Canyon Villas they gave us a key card to access the pools at the JW. None of them worked, but if you go the the front desk at the JW they will exchange it out for one that will work. All and all it was a fun and relaxing vacation that was further enhanced by the helpful and friendly staff at the Canyon Villas.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLoved Marriott Canyon Villas\u201d", "Author": "EastCoastGirl1", "ReviewID": "UR15667175", "Content": "We traded through II into this property. We stayed from April 26th to May 3rd. The weather was perfect - high 80s to high 90s during the day and at night you needed a light sweater. We didn't see one cloud the entire week. The villas are only 20 minutes from the airport - very easy access to the highways. We checked in around 5 pm and the staff were very friendly. We were in unit 2959 (the third floor). The units are very nice and comfortable. The bed was great. We had a walk in shower and jacuzzi tub. The balcony was small .. had a table and 4 chairs, but it was a squeeze. The resort offered a few activities as well as activities at the JW Marriott, where you would walk to or take a shuttle. The shuttle also went to the Desert Ridge Marketplace - plenty of shopping and restaurants as well as an 18 screen movie theatre and a supermarket. They are building a new shopping area (right next to the Marketplace) called City Place that will open in the next few years. It will be a more upscale shopping center with Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. I've been told it will be similar to Kierland Commons (near the Westin Resort). We ate dinner at Kierland Commons twice .. once an italian restaurant called North and at a french bistro called Zinc. Zinc had a nice courtyard room where the roof retracts in nice weather. Both had very good food. We went to the Chart House for dinner one night and had a great meal. Their chocolate soufle was wonderful! We also had dinner at Roys over at the Marriott Hotel - very nice. We had dinner on the patio - it was lit with Tiki Torches and they have a firepit. If you dine there on Friday and Saturday nights, you can hear the music from the band that plays outside on the Marriott patio. The pool areas at both the resort and villas was very nice and kept very clean. My husband golfed every day. He loved that he could get out very early in the morning - just after 6 am. We bought the par n'pamper pass for $500 which entitled us to 5 rounds of golf, 5 spa treatments or a combination of the two. Good deal - especially in the high season months! The spa was the nicest I have seen. It had it's own pool with a jacuzzi and very plush lounge chairs. The spa has it's own restaurant and the two services I received were WONDERFUL!

This was our first time staying here a full week. We booked the 2 bedroom villa so our grown kids could stay with us. We requested a golf course view, top floor, quiet, away from construction and that is exactly what we got. Check in was easy. We arrived early, around 2:30pm, and our villa wasn't ready but all we had to do later was come back to get our keys. They took our cell phone number so they could call us when it was ready. The staff there is great and always want to help. We took that time to grab a late lunch and stock up on some supplies at Albertson's. The villa itself was exactly as I remembered and the view of the mountains and the golf course was gorgeous. So, were there any problems? Not really, but there were some things I should mention. I love the Marriott pillowtop beds. The master bedroom and the lockoff beds, however, were not that bed type. They were new but fairly hard mattresses. Not uncomfortable at all. I never woke up with a backache. These must be what they use in all of their timeshares as it was the same at one of the Florida properties we stayed in last year. The sofa bed in the living room was another story. The mattress was incredibly thin. The mattress cover and fitted sheet we got from the closet were too big and bunched up. The top sheet had small tears around the hem. Not what I expected from Marriott but my oldest son wasn't bothered that much. Oh, here's one thing that really bothered me. I like to sleep in a totally dark room. The drapes in the master bedroom and the lockoff were fine, they did close all of the way to block out the light. The problem was the smoke detector in all of the rooms. It had very bright blinking lights. They blinked every 3 seconds. It drove me crazy. Same in the living area and the lockoff. You never notice it until you turn the lights out. I never really got used to it. The pool area was nice and only really crowded the first day. Never any problem parking near the villa either.

It was dark when we arrived, but the resort was colorfully decorated for the holidays. Check-in took less than a couple minutes and we were on our way to our 2-bedroom unit for some much needed rest. The suite seemed very new and was spotless. Each bedroom had a king bed, comfortable bedding, and lots of storage space. The main bedroom had a large soaking tub along with a separate large shower. The suite had three flat-screen TV's each with a DVD player. Lots of channels along with a few HBO and Encore channels. The kitchen is functional with full-size frig (there's a small one in the guest bedroom), microwave, full stove & oven, dishwasher, and washer/dryer. They give you enough dishwasher soap, but you'll need your own laundry detergent. A nice touch was a water feature on one of the walls which added to the relaxing ambience. We were on the first floor so we were only steps from our car in the parking lot. The property itself is quite large. To the east (which is the direction our villa faced) is a golf course and the JW Marriott is probably less than one mile away. To the north is some more of the golf course and some desert landscape. To the west over a wall are some homes, but you hardly notice them. To the south, they've begun construction on the next phase of the resort so I would imagine the villas at that end will be somewhat noisy in 2008. The hotel provides a regular shuttle to the JW Marriott and Desert Ridge Marketplace. The small gift shop really has very little in it. There's also a nice pool area with two waterfalls, whirlpool, large scale chess set, outdoor barbecues, playground, grass volleyball court, pool table, and ping pong table. There is something scheduled at the resort every day for every age group so you can choose whatever you might be intrested in. Being so close to the Desert Ridge Marketplace was a big plus. We ate there, shopped groceries there, saw movies there, and did a little last minute holiday shopping. The resort is close to the freeways, but still feels like it's in a very quiet area which was nice.
