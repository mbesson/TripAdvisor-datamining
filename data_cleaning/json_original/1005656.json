The main building is beautiful although we were staying in one of suites in the garden. Another review here mentions the smell of mould in one of these, but this problem had gone by the time we came here in autumn 2011. The suite itself was beautiful, huge bedroom, flatscreen TV, small private patio area screened by shrubbery, beautiful and large bathroom with spa bath. And so quiet and peaceful, with a walk through the garden in the morning for breakfast in the conservatory. It was also spotlessly clean. It didnt serve evening meals but had a bar. 10 mins walk from Bologna station but so what? Nothing much around the area to speak of but we found a nice local restaurant (can't recall the name!). It was only a few minutes on the underground into the centre of Rome.

The hotel is very clean and modernized inside. The staff were fluent in English and were very helpful. I'm not sure if our room was standard or upgraded fro honeymooners, but everything was sparkling clean and the bathroom spacious. The fridge however wasn't working and one of the staff members tried to make it work but something just wasn't right. Also the shower-head wasn't switching modes but couldn't care less about that. To my surprise, the area seemed to be fairly safe, as we constantly made trips back and forth at night with no incident. But it CAN appear intimidating owing to its very quiet neighborhood. The walk to Bologna subway station is at least 10min (unless you make a run for it) and the buses take longer to get to the center, so I recommend the subway. The full breakfast was great, something we really missed in some of our consequent hotels. Overall, if you don't mind the walk to the subway, this hotel is an amazing find! PS: do your research on what's closed on Mondays in Rome and what season is the \"vacation\" season for the locals - it would save you a few surprises when you face the closed doors of a certain attraction or restaurant", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cTranquil atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Jen0904", "ReviewID": "UR116147496", "Content": "I booked Prime Hotel Principe Torlonia for three nights with Expedia as an arrangement including flights for me and my family to visit Rome during the last weekend of July.

Still, for such a distant location it is an expensive hotel. Upon first view I tended to understand the steep price, because the Principe Torlonia looks great from the outside, and the garden, while not big, is also very nice. The big problem came when entering the room. I should point out that we didn't stay in the main building, so I cannot comment on those rooms. We stayed in one of the special hotel suites in the little, separate building in the garden. While these suites were comfortable enough, the smell of mold and fungi was so strong that one could barely stand it. Ventilation did not solve it, so it must be a persistent problem. For this price this is really unacceptable.

What started as a wonderful stay ended not so great and I am really disappointed it ended like that. Initially we thought the hotel was in the middle of nowhere but we hired motor scooters which made our time in Rome a lot more enjoyable and made the hotel in an excellent location! The hotel is close (5-10 minute walk) from a metro stop and is just off Via Nomentana, a fairly main road which connects you quickly and easily to the centre of Rome (very easily on a scooter!). The hotel was refurbished only a few years ago and the rooms are well appointed, some smaller than others but a good size given you are in Europe. The garden is lovely if you are missing a bit of green and sitting outside on the patio is wonderful after a hot day sightseeing. Some of the staff left a bit to be desired. Simon and his Manager were outstanding and despite Simon having only worked there few a fortnight when we visited he was friendly, helpful and he made our stay very good. Luckily the rather arrogant attitudes of the women working there had not rubbed off on him yet. Example, on the night of the FIFA World Cup final, we decided to watch the extra time period in the bar at the hotel. When we politely asked her to switch the TV on she said it didn't work. We knew this not to be true and her just really being too lazy to get up walk ten metres and switch it on because it had been on the previous evening. Slack. She did however feel it necessary to bark at our friend when she was reading a book on the couch (sitting not lying) and tell her that she wasn't allowed to fall asleep! Crazy. Another lady there sent us out with wild directions to a place we had asked for and that she had offered to print out for us (good so far) however she printed them in Italian (English Speakers) and it wasn't even to the right place! Hopeless. Unfortunately as we were checking out, there was a hidden charge for parking our scooters there which we were not told about nor did we think we a valid charge. The scooters were not valet parked nor did they take up much space yet it was a dispute which left us thinking not so great things especially after staying for a total of eight room nights. At least the girl on the desk managed to have a laugh at this one and at the non-sensical nature of the problem! Despite this, Simon and the property made this a good place to stay in Rome. Just don't expect all of the staff to go out of their way for you, in fact don't even expect them to get off their seat for you!", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA gem.\u201d", "Author": "SevenNights", "ReviewID": "UR52052139", "Content": "The danger in writing a well-deserved, glowing review of the Prime Hotel Principe Torlonia is that too many people will discover it and it will not be available when we want to return! This hotel is a gem nestled among an up-scale neighborhood outside the Historic Center of Rome. While that may not appeal to some, the Bologna Metro B line is a few short blocks away and the distance from the tourist circuit gives the willing traveler a taste of daily Roman life. The restaurants in the area were all outstanding and the nearby supermarket made picking up picnic supplies easy. The staff were all warm and friendly and Ramona, in particular, went out of her way to arrange for tables at restaurants during the hit and miss Christmas holiday. We are particularly grateful for her assistance with our trip. If you want to be in the middle of the Historic Center of Rome near all the tourist spots and everything that goes along with them, this is not the place for you. If you are able to navigate yourself on the public transportation system (or have a rental car or pockets full of cab fare) and want a quiet place to start and end your day in Rome, give this hotel serious consideration.

So, I booked this charming htel which is a residential area with a school. The rooms were nice and modern. A few tips: The key needs to be turned chip-side up to open the door. Then, insert the key in the slot on thewall next to the door once you are inside. You cannot turn on lights until then. The phones had no buttons for the front desk and \"0\" did not work either. The staff was helpful. They ordered a taxi for us the night before and sure enough, a Mercedes was waiting at exactly 8 after we finished breakfast. The breakfast area is nice and the hotel is very clean. The decor is nice and they even allowed 12 noon check-in for us., The staff was nice and helpful to us. The Metro was only a 5-7 minute walk. If you are wanting to go to the center of Rome, then take the Metro train from the Bologna station and go in the direction of Laurentina. Five stops into the ride is the Coloseo stop. The Coloseum is actually right outside the train station as you exit there. You can walk to the Trevi Fountain, the Palantine, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon ...all from there. There is a GREAT ice cream place just to the left of the Pantheon exit on the corner called NICE ICE. The chocolate ice cream is awesome and NON-DAIRY. No milk. All chocolate. It was awesome. This place has won an international competition fr ice cream. The breakfast starts at 7 am in the hotel. It is a good one. There is a breakfast room and a rooftop open seating area. Go up and take advantage of the rooftop if you can.
