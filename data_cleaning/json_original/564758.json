We requested two rooms as we were a party of 3 guys and 5 girls and this couldn't have worked out better as we were accommodated in a flat with two rooms, bathroom and a kitchen just to ourselves. Obviously, if we were to share the flat with other tourists the experience would not have been the same, but for us it worked out pretty well. In terms of the actual facilities the place was basic, but we had everything we needed. Towels were provided although at an additional charge, there were basic toiletries in the bathroom and there was simple breakfast (biscuits and croissants) provided every morning. The coffee making facilities and the ability to prepare our own snacks in the kitchen was also a plus. I remember, however, that we had some difficulty locating the place - I think there are two buildings under the same hostel name - they are both managed by the same staff but can be a bit confusing so make sure you double check on the phone where you're meant to be going. Our flat was in a block of flats - I even got the impression not all of them were being rented out to tourists so it felt a little bit like living in a residential place but we didn't mind, however, this may be a downside for those travellers looking to meet other people. In terms of the location it was excellent only a few minutes' walk away from the Termini station, the tube and all the shops in the vicinity. Staff were also very helpful and polite with better than the average( for Italy) English (which proved useful when the fuse switch tripped and we had troubles locating the fusebox!). All in all I would recommend this place as ideal for groups of friends and young travellers looking for budget accommodation in the very heart of Rome.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Grinstead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended, good value too!\u201d", "Author": "BC20", "ReviewID": "UR120786248", "Content": "Convenient location, secure too (you need quite a few keys to get in!).

There are a total of 5 rooms and a shared bathroom that has 2 private toilets with private showers. The rooms are basic - single beds with a desk and night stand. The place is decently located. A very very short walk to Termini Station (less than 5 min) and about a half-hour walk to all of the famous sites in Rome (45 min at the most). Diana, the woman who keeps the place, is very helpful. She's Romanian and speaks English. She is knowledgeable and willing to provide assistance. The only downside to this place is that the walls and the doors are paper thin. If you're able to wear ear plugs then this is not a problem. My ears are easily infected so I can't wear them and had a difficult time sleeping. I'm sure part of the problem was jetlag but I could hear the traffic and people outside until early in the morning... And anything that someone else is doing (who is staying here), I can certainly hear them. Overall, the place is very clean, well-priced, and easily accessible to the transit and major cites. It also includes a very basic breakfast of coffee, a bun with jam, and Melba-like toast. If you're on a budget, definitely stay here.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever again!!\u201d", "Author": "ScreamingLordMark", "ReviewID": "UR116000929", "Content": "This is a horrible place!!

A couple of problems (not big), though. first, i booked a room with two twin beds, but they gave us a double...the woman said most of the time people are happy when that happens, but i doubt those people are travelling with their cousin like i was. also, the wireless \"wasnt working\". since we were staying in a different building from the initial address, i really think they just never have internet over there anyways. fortunately, we were able to pick up an open network from somewhere else. overall, it was a nice place with an accessible location that i would go back to!", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Z\u00fcrich", "Title": "\u201cUnprofessional and liars\u201d", "Author": "alog1977", "ReviewID": "UR110117332", "Content": "I booked a room there - but i can't really rate my stay, since i just couldn't get in. I told them i would be there at a precise time in the evening, and i kept ringing for hours. No one opened the doors for me, so i had to find another place to stay - which wasnt easy, considering how late it already was. What really upset me is that i couldnt even get a refund, because the owner of the hotel refused to admit he wasn't there that day, but mostly because he said he called me to know what i was. He never called me, and therefore i never answered his hypothetical phone call.

However, Antonio - the owner - offered us a more private room in a downtown flat. He did this because there was a larger group coming to the B&T Termini and since there were only two of us, he offered to relocate us, without extra-charges. When I say downtown flat, I do mean downtown. It took us roughly 10 minutes to walk to the Colosseum, about 20 minutes to walk to the Vatican and 5 minutes to the Vittorio Emanuelle Memorial. In fact, all the time we spent in Rome, we walked everywhere because all the Roman landmarks were very, very close. Our experience with B&T was great so, from our point of view, Antonio and his colleagues get 5 stars out of 5.

As previously said by the earlier reviewer, we were whisked away to another location on the next street, to find a more spacier more airy condominium with nice yet simple decor and cozy rooms. Fortunately for us, it was autumn, so the room was constantly cool, if not a little bit chilly at night (a problem solved by closing the window). Antonio and his son, Daniele were nice enough to help us with our trips around town and little questions and requests that we have regarding the room. Again, you have the privacy that a dorm room would lack, and the condominium places you right in the middle of a little community, so you feel right at home with the rest of the occupance of the building.
