Not really luxurious but certainly does its job without issues. Review based on a one night stay in December\u201911 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe) Location: Location IMHO very good for an airport hotel, close enough to avoid lengthy travel from/to the airport but still middle of a major shopping (Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, REI, Best Buy etc) & eating (such as Outback Steakhouse, Sizzler, Simply Thai) offered by the Southcentre Mall, including also big movie theatre. Of course it would be faster to a hotel directly attached to the airport, but this one was still accessible enough with the big advantage of being easily use also other means of wasting your time than just sitting in the hotel bar. Shuttle bus to the airport runs every 30min, taking about 10min to get there. Room: Room was large with separate living & sleeping room sections, though the bathroom was very small. D\u00e9cor was rather outdated, no major stains of usage though. The room was very clean. Some noise from the highway close by, otherwise the room was a quiet place. Etc: Quite good breakfast with a decent selection. Nothing really special as such but certainly enough to get your day started. Atrium design of the hotel offered an interesting point of view to the lobby & restaurant. Would I return there? Yeah sure if I ever need to stay a night at SeaTac ever again.

Never having stayed at any Doubletree before, my Mom and I both agree what an excellent choice it was. I picked it for proximity to Southcenter and to the airport, as I was seeing my mom off on a flight the next day. We wanted to shop and have comfort, good food and a good rest before she flew out. The first thing, upon check in, that we wanted was good food. We had driven 3 hours and were tired/hungry. We were informed the dining room didn't open till 5. We weren't informed about any other food option, not that we would have taken it, because mom was tired and just wanted to eat in the hotel. So I went to the bar area for some wine. I sat inside the bar area and eventually caught the interest of the bartender. There were two people, a man and woman, floating around and in and out of the bar area. Both ignored me for a few minutes. They were, however, very interested in all the bar patrons ordering food/appetizers. Finally the man took my order. Then, I unknowingly took my wine outside the bar area to sit (officially the lobby area I guess.) This was a serious break with protocol apparently. The bartender/gestapo agent informed me I was outside the boundary and to give him a credit card for the tab and that the bar was inside the little fence. Excuse us! By that time my elderly Mom was there and we moved inside the fence for our wine. All in all - not too impressed with the bar. Please have your bar staff be more attentive if a customer shows up. Acknowledge us right away! And if a person if having wine quietly, six inches outside the fence, call off the dogs and leave them in peace! Don't assume they will run out the door without paying or whatever. Then we moved into the dining area where everything was without exception excellent! The waiter was so personable, friendly and accomodating and smiling. His whole demeanor exuded friendly customer service, \"we're so happy you're here dining with us and how can we help you.\". The food was excellent. We asked why no one else was there. He wasn't entirely sure. But he waited on us, his only patrons, and he was superb that night. Our food was excellent. It was expensive, but worth it. We knew things were pricey there. We were happy to pay for good food and a good place. I would suggest to hotel patrons to eat right there. Awesome waiter - worth his pay and his generous tip! Now let's talk about Steve Messer the manager. Steve was absolutely awesome. When I showed up at the desk, he was juggling two phones and what sounded like plenty of confusion. He was busy. Still, he was patient, friendly, concerned and diplomatic with the other demands of people standing there. He was above and beyond with excellent customer service. All the desk staff are also excellent. They helped us and reassured us about our shuttle needs to the airport. That I was accompanying mom on the shuttle to the airport, but that I would return to the hotel also using the shuttle and how to do that. Our room: Was excellent and comfy. I slept on the hide-a-bed due to have privacy and my own TV. It was comfortable. The fridge was humming too loud so I unplugged it. I did get some sounds and noise from the lobby area - not bad. The only thing is I wish we didn't get stuck with the room with the HVAC view out the window! We tried to see a \"view\", pulled back the curtains, only to see the HVAC equipment and hardly even any sky. Bummer! Overall, our stay was very good. Thank you.

Conference has been held twice here and it is due to the location for attendees from North County to the South County area. Sea Tac Airport is about 10 not more than 15 minutes away. Upon checkin they give you a warm delicious choc chip cookie. A nice touch. Having a suite for your room is so much nicer to spread out and you actually have a work space in another room. Also its nice to have a \"living room\" as such to entertain and visit with other attendees without always having to be in a common area downstairs. The beds were wonderful and the alarm clock was even user friendly! The bathroom was small but probably because it only contained the tub and toilet. The shower head was great and had enought water pressure. Can't say that for the toilet tho. The sink was outside of the bathroom in the room. Nice if you have two people getting ready at the same time, although I did not have to share. Granite countertop sink. My only negative is that there is no towel rack or hook by the sink for your washcloths. The towels were nice and big and soft. The windows open in the room, but there is a lot of noise, but the fresh air was nice. Conference room was roomy. Food could be improved, but then again feeding a large group I am sure is difficult. There is a bar in the lobby which is nice and roomy, but the service was not that great. Only one person working at the bar. Southcenter shopping mall across the street as well as other restaurants you can easily walk to. Parking Lot is dark at night and they really need more lighting out there.

The staff are very helpful - Steve the manager is very, very good. I stay in hotels well in excess of 100 nights per year and the staff behind the front desk make all the difference.

I came along as his escort. A buffet dinner, a reception as well as a banquet were all hosted by this hotel, so we had ample opportunity to not only sample the cooking but also the hospitality shown to an older crowd (Vietnam era vets and earlier). The hospitality started when I first called to book the room. Jenita, the manager at the front desk, made a point of booking the reservation and giving me her name so that I could call back shortly before arrival to arrange for adjoining rooms. I later called and talked to Jeremy, who confirmed the rooms would be adjoining. Both were very helpful. We took the free shuttle from the airport after a long cross-country flight, and it was a clean and quick ride with a friendly, attentive driver helping the older passengers. Check-in was very smooth (great front desk on Sept. 30th!), and we were even able to check in early to allow my Father-in-Law a chance to rest. The meals were excellent; my Father-in-Law is a retired chef (and former Navy cook), and he was very complimentary of all the meals received at the hotel. It takes great food to impress him -- the one night we ate out (at the Cheesecake Factory across from the hotel) he complained about the food quality. The staff went out of their way to make sure everything went well, and I was especially touched when the wait staff was moved to tears while listening to the stories of departed Navy comrades. To a person (and there were nearly 40 of us) I heard nothing but compliments about the quality of the rooms. They were impressed by the suite design and the affordable rates granted to our group -- especially important to many on a fixed budget. I personally witnessed the quick, caring actions of the hotel staff when a guest (not with our group) experienced a medical emergency the last night we were there. They actually stationed people along a route to guide the emergency responders directly from the curb to the room of the person in distress. The proximity to a major shopping mall, as well as light rail transit and the airport, simply added to the satisfaction our group felt for having spent three days here.

At check-in we didn\u2019t get an upgrade for being Diamond HHonors members, slightly disappointing. They also didn\u2019t put us on the highest level.

There was a living area with sofa, easy chair, side table and working desk with chair, also a unit with refrigerator and microwave. The bathroom was very small, but it was clean and the sink was outside. The sleeping room had a good quality King bed. Here we had a window with a nice view on a park. The business center is an open area next to the sandwich shop. There were three computers, I had to wait several times, they were mostly in use as it was busy in the hotel.

There I could find nice seating to relax and read my book. There is a large Mall on walking distance and also a Target very close by.

Although the hotel is not to blame for the standards of their guests, we didn\u2019t like it that many people came crisscross to the restaurant area on their way from and to the elevators. There were one or more groups who had their breakfast in the conference center; many people packed their items to bring it back to their room, they all went through the restaurant.

The TV in the bedroom was maybe a 19\" - it seemed quite small compared to other hotels I've been to recently. The worst part of our stay started at 6:15 a.m. on the Saturday morning. We were awakened to an alarm beep going off. In trying to figure out where it was coming from, it kept getting louder and faster beeping. This went on for about 5 min., until I finally realized it was coming from the neighbor's suite next door. We called the front desk thinking that either no-one was in the suite or they were dead. The clerk could hear the noise through the phone. The front desk sent up the bellman who knocked on the door - they slept through that as well. Finally after another 5 min. of this annoying noise, it went off. Only to go off another 10 min later (they must've hit snooze). Since I was up anyhow, I went to the gym (which is the only thing nice about this hotel). My friend then said she could clearly hear the neighbor's conversation, coming through our walls. Meanwhile, I then spoke to the two girls at the front desk. I told them they have to move us if the people next door were not leaving today. The clerks said no problem they could see if there was anything on another floor. Upon getting to my room, I phoned to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. I was asked what it was regarding so that she could put me in touch with the right manager. She transferred me to Michael, who we later found out was the Food & Beverage Manager and not the Room Manager. Michael was very nice and apologized and assured me we would be put in another room upon us coming back to the hotel later that night. When we got back, we talked to Steve at the front desk who might've been a manager. His customer skills definitely needed work. He didn't smile once. He didn't apologize. In fact, he didn't even hear of our situation and seemed quite choked that we were making him move us. All he said was that he was looking for another room for us. We were not impressed with Steve! Upon getting our new room, the sink tap came right off, and there was no knob on the temperature control (we cooked all night) to turn. So much for a nicer room.

The rooms are two room suites and the food is okay but not great. The problem is that our car was broken in during our three day stay.

I asked to speak to the Front Deck Manager and he never returned my call. obviously didn't care about our problem. After talking to some emplyees I found out that car break ins is quite the problem around this area. The property hires offsite security that only does a drive by during the late evening hours.

No information was taken about my vehicle so that they could check on its security while I was gone When we returned one week later my vehicle was gone . It had been stolen and severely vandalized. The employees had no apologies and when I called down to speak to the front desk to ask them to save the tapes of the video surveillance for the week, they told me there was no surveillance of that front area . The manager later defended what the employee had told me as being true for their back lots and further seemed irritated and annoyed with my phone call. I saw that I was getting nowhere with him and was ready to hang up when he offered to check some other video records and get back to me . He never called me back .

We only stayed two days this trip through and it was as expected. Room was clean and very comfortable. This hotel caters to the business sector and therefor is not marketed towards the tourist.We got a good rate by dropping in late one night but when we tried to extend our stay the price jumped beyond what I was willing to pay. That is too bad since they lost revenue when they had lots of rooms available. The business center is great and we used it a couple times. I am Hilton Honors and did not receive any extras.
