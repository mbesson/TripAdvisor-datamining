Our room was beautifully decorated and very big with a lovely view to the canal. The owner was very helpful especially by climbing 2 flights of stairs (very narrow) to take our luggage to the room (there's no elevator). The hotel smelled pancakes! Unfortunately we didn't try its breakfast. Liked the hotel's location which is close to the museums and restos, the friendly service, and the selection of English-speaking tv channel options that are not available at many hotels. I was a bit bothered with the bathroom that didn't have ventilation/window therefore was a bit smelly, the bed and pillow which weren't firm enough to our liking to give us a good sleep and the lack of snacks (although they provided me a banana, there were only beverages and chocolate bars).

The only downpoint really were the draughty windows, perhaps due to the building being an original old town house, we had to put a towel at the bottom of the balcony door to keep the draught out.

I did warn my partner that I booked the top floor and their would be lots of steps and being Amsterdam the we're narrow and steep.

It was amazing how Natalie seemed to lift our luggage above her head with ease(although she did tell us she was a roadie for many years). So as long as you ok walking up and down stair their shouldn't be an issue. I booked a small deluxe room so was wasn't expecting anything big. And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised the room was big enough to fit two full sized suit cases and carry on bags. It had basic facilities but there was no mini bar.

It's a cosy little hotel which to me is more like a home than a hotel. Our room was on the third floor and yes, getting up those 3 flights of stairs was indeed a challenge (no hotel lift) especially after a night out. Did I mention how very narrow and steep those stairs are? In any case we had a laugh each time climbing up and down holding on to the railing for dear life. Don't worry about carrying your suitcases/bags up/down. There will be someone there to do it for you each time. Once we'd opened the door to our Deluxe Room there was more than enough space to relax and unwind (we didn't trip over our suitcases once!). The window-with-canal-view was not quite what we expected - the view was beautiful but the window was smalli-ish (read: tiny) - you'd have to contort your body like an acrobat to peer your head out (the other rooms had much bigger windows). Nevertheless, it was a wonderful view. Hotel's location is excellent - 2 mins by foot to Leidseplein and walking distance to many restaurants, cafe's, bistros, shopping, etc. Easy access to tram/buses, less than 10 mins away to Central Station. The room/amenities were basic but clean and tastefully decorated. The beds - one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on. Nice finishings. Nathalie, our hotel manager/front desk manager/chef was fantastic. She's warm, kind, witty, helpful and very very strong (she carried our luggage over her head up and down those stairs like it was nothing). Nathalie also makes the best pancakes for breakfast and really went out of her way to help us with directions, tips and flight inquiries (our flights were delayed/cancelled). Nathalie was even quick to tell us that there was a Dutch celebrity staying at the hotel; after showing us his picture on the internet, we tried to organise a stakeout but to no avail. The rest of the staff were also welcoming and helpful - this includes two cats and a dog named \"Kutty\". I'm not a big fan of cats especially neurotic ones but these two were friendly, warm, gentle and contemplative (they would sit by the window and stare into space lost in their idle reverie) Kutty is nothing but adorable. The three just added to the character of the hotel. All in all, a really nice experience staying at Boutique Hotel View.

The decision to go was random so I relied on Tripadvisor reviews on which hotel to take. I was only spending 24 hours in Amsterdam so I needed an affordable hotel in a central location so I don't waste time traveling, and at the same safe for a solo female traveler. And boy, I was beyond happy with the decision. Location - easy to find, located on the same block as some good restaurants, cafes and theaters. Less than 2 minute walk and you'll find a tourist information center. It's right next to a beautiful canal that you can view from some of the rooms. 3 minute walk to tram station and Leidseplein (for some nightlife and a variety of restaurants from fine dining to fast food) Rooms - most rooms are overlooking the canal. Their cheaper rooms are tiny, just enough for a double bed, a cabinet, and some room to walk around and place your luggage, but this is expected of hotel rooms in Europe. I got a chance to peek at the bigger rooms and they were surprisingly spacious. My tiny room (around 130Eur) was clean and the bed very comfortable. The windows were adorned with 2 layers of curtains - a sheer one and a thick one to block out the sun. Flat screen TV on the wall showed only 2 english channels but I didn't really care since I was out the whole day anyway. Bathroom - small but clean and adequate. Adequate supply of towels and toiletries. Shower was big enough to move freely, not cramped. Hair dryer available. Service - it's the best thing about this hotel. Check in time was I think 1pm but I was there before 11am, so I asked if I could just leave my bags and walk around the area first to kill time. Nathalie, who greeted me like a long lost sister, told me not to worry, my room is ready! She even wanted to upgrade me to a much bigger and way more expensive room (after she saw my huge luggage), however that room was 2 floors higher than my cheaper room so I had to decline the wonderful gift explaining that I'm a couch potato who never exercises and hates stairs (esp after a tiring day of exploring the place). After hearing that Nathalie took my luggage and carried it to my room! She and other Staff helped me with suggestions on where to go, how to get there, which trams to take, approximate price of tours, etc. They booked my taxi for me, and Nathalie served the taxi driver coffee while I was busy getting my stuff ready. She even went up to carry my luggage again! Breakfast - located in the dining/reception area. The place was cozy and the breakfast was good and fresh. There wasn't much variety but there's enough choices, food was delicious, and the housekeeper cooked nonstop at the end of the room (which gave the place a very homey feel) and kept offering additional food that she's cooking. The only negative thing about the hotel is the very steep stairs, which is forgivable. Also just be warned that there are resident cats in the hotel who freely walk around the place.

We happily waited in the dining area which was a lovely comfy, cosy room overlooking Amsterdam, drinking our yummy hot chocolates and petting the hotel dog! The hotel itself was clean, stylish and spacious. The rooms were decorated beautifully and had everything you needed - shampoo, shower gel and a tv with many channels. We had a small room but this was ample space for us (a couple) and instantly felt like home. Every morning we would awake to the smell of fresh baking in the kitchen - Things dont get much better than this! After hearing the rave reviews on the hotel pancakes and omlettes we had already decided to have breakfast here each morning and for 10 euros it was fantastic value. On offer there were self service cheese, meats, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, fresh croissants and breads and the offer of something freshly cooked. Nathalie was on the day shift so was not there to make our pancakes but her brother (again a lovely friendly guy) was- and let me tell you these pancakes were DELICIOUS! In fact the breakfasts were SO good they alone were enough to secure us a return visit hopefully in June. I have never been to a hotel so intent on making you feel welcome and I am not talking about overly selling places, trips etc or being bombarded with suggestions or opinions- you are treated just as one of the family, if you want to sit and chill- this is fine.. if you want to have a beer and chat..this is fine, in fact we never at any time felt at all awkward- it was like visiting friends we had not met before. Even the hotel dog and 2 kittens were so lovely adding that home from home feel to the place - I have never met such well behaved pets either I might add.

Once you've mastered the public transport network, you'll realise that all accessibility options are available just a 3 minute walk away. Eateries and coffee shops are plentiful closeby, including a local jazz club where the famous Hans Dulfer is the resident entertainer as entertainment dessert. Tourist hotspots such as the Ann Frank house, Madame Tussauds, Van Gogh museum, the Heineken experience and the Rijksmuseum are either walkable or just a short tram journey from the hotel. Whilst the more popular hotspots are accessible, it's also easy to venture into the 'real' Amsterdam living/working areas either on foot or by bus/tram too and sample non-touristy architecture and everyday life. The rooms are spotlessly clean and I don't say that lightly! Must admit, I do go a hunting for faults, but I couldn't find any at all with any aspect of the cleanliness. The lobby however is home to the two affectionate resident cats who are adorable but maybe not everyone's cup of tea. The owner of the hotel works the front desk some days and can't do enough for her guests - whether that be offering advice on local shopping, directions or gigs etc. A very lovely lady :o) I guess the only issue we had was the stairs - they are really steep and winding (as in all canal houses) and as I'd had recent knee-replacement surgery this proved difficult to negotiate which we hadn't really contemplated prior to arriving. In all fairness to the manager, she did offer to swap us rooms the following day to the ground floor of her neighbouring property but we loved the loftspace we'd already been given so climbed carefully and stayed where we were for 4 nights. Unless you're willing to spend the big bucks in the American Hotel up the road, I'd be really surprised if there's another hotel in such a splendid location that can offer lift access, so plan ahead. We didn't eat in the hotel but I did see the breakfast food platter and it looked fabulous! We thought that at 10E it was a tad expensive but when compared to the other eateries in the locality its a fair and comparable price and had a really good selection too, with a wide range of eating times to suit.

Upon hearing our story, she took us to her home a few doors away, where she operates a B&B and let us use an empty room. We tried to keep our usage light, but we did sleep in the bed and use the restrooms. I badly wanted to give Nathalie payment for her kindness (at least knowing the room would need light housekeeping again), but she refused. We will never forget Nathalie or HBV for this reason alone, but then on top of that, the room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. And breakfast the next morning (extra charge) was delicious-- quick, hot & fresh, cooked to order with as many helpings as requested! Nathalie is an amazing cook :) Eating in the hotel was perfect for us ( although pre-kid I would've likely used breakfast as an opportunity to explore the city, Lonely Planet guidebook in hand!), as we could let our jet-lagged toddler sleep in while we took turns going downstairs for breakfast. The hotel is only a block from Leidseplein Square and we paid roughly $200/night, so I feel the value (having done a little bit of research in my hotel search) was tremendous! Amsterdan was our bridge between Seattle and Geneva and then again from Geneva to the Middle East, so we had two 1-night stays planned four days apart. The second time, we knew exactly the hospitality and graciousness that awaited us. Given the weather was cold, and our daughter was having too much fun playing with the hotel cat, we spent a lot of time in the hotel's dining area during our two stays. So we got to meet Nathalie's mother, brother, and his girlfriend- this really is a family affair! We heard life stories, our daughter was doted over, and it felt like we were staying with OUR family! Hotel BV is our only choice in Amsterdam from here forward. We won't stay anywhere else!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "Morrisandhemi", "ReviewID": "UR123868267", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at Hotel Boutique view for 4 great nights.

It's in a great position, round the corner from a bustling square, but quiet enough in it's position to get a good nights sleep. You can walk everywhere, no need to get trams if you don't want to. My disappointment arose due to the fact that we did not receive the room we had paid for. I had booked this weekend as a birthday surprise for my partner, it was also made more special as it was our last weekend together before he had to go away for 6 months to work. I had booked a deluxe double with canal view, the money for this was taken before we arrived, however on arrival we only received a small double with canal view. Whilst the room we received was fine, and really rather nice for a \"small double\", it is not what we had paid for. We arrived on a Friday night and only stayed until the Sunday. We rushed in on friday night, did not pay much attention to the room and left again to have dinner/drinks, on the Saturday we went out to sight see. Whilst we were out on the Saturday, I checked the website to ensure that I was correct in the fact that we hadn't received the correct room and on our return to the hotel we brought this up with the guy on the desk. He unfortunately did not deal with our complaint very well and made it seem like we were to blame for not realising sooner. The matter was eventually resolved the following morning (Sunday) we did not get the room we had wanted, but did get a refund on the price we had paid. Whilst this was fine, it would have been nice to get what we had paid for in the first instance. I could understand the mix up if we had booked through a third party, however we booked through the hotel's own website and therefore I really do feel there was no excuse to be given the wrong room. It did feel in a way that the guy that directed us to the room in the first place was attempting to take advantage of us because we were a younger couple. You might think I would not return, this is not the case, as I stated before, the hotel itself was lovely, and in a great position.

Based on Trip Advisor recommendations, we decided to stay at Boutique Hotel View. What a wonderful place. The location is excellent--located on a beautiful canal but walk 2 short blocks and you are in the middle of rocking Leidsplein and only a 5-10 minute walks to the Museumplein and Vondelpark. There is a bus that goes directly from the airport to this square, which we found out about for our return flight. 5 different tram lines are available in Leidsplein, although we walked everywhere in the city after we got our bearings. The canal house in which the hotel is located is charming. Natalie, the owner, is amazing. She flips fluently from English to Dutch to German (I'm sure she speaks other languages as well) and deftly cooks you a lovely breakfast to order while she sees to the front desk. At first I was a little disappointed that I got my coffee (and tea, Cappuccino, hot chocolate, etc.) from a machine but it really grew on me and I ended up really liking the Cappuccino. It uses fresh milk and good quality coffee. Obviously a state of the art single cup maker. Our room was a triple, which was snug for 3 women (one of us slept on the pullout couch) but clean and comfortable. The bathroom is tiny--be prepared for the shower to be stall-less. In other words, you pull a shower curtain across half of the tiny bathroom and take your shower just standing in front of the toilet, there is a drain in the floor. Worked fine, just a little strange to adjust to, since we are used to shower stalls or tubs. I have encountered this before in Europe. The room was a little dark, but we spent so little time in it, no big deal. I would stay in this hotel again in a heartbeat--it was very inexpensive and a fabulous find.

We arrived a few hours early and our room was not ready. Natalie, the very friendly girl who checked us in, offered to hold our luggage for us so we could go find some food while they prepare the room for us. When we returned she informed us that we had been upgraded for free. She immediately grabbed 2 of our 3 bags and insisted on showing us to our room (the only hotel to do this out of the 5 we visited). First she showed us the original room we had booked, then the upgraded room and let us choose! We opted for the larger upgraded room, naturally. The room and the hotel in general was clean and the decor was classy. The beds we comfortable and the towels were nice and soft, two important things that can be taken for granted when booking a room. I believe there was free WIFI but we did not bring our laptops. However, we were in luck as there are 2 computers available with internet access. The location was great. A quiet street along the canal. Very close to Liedsplien where there are some resturaunts to choose from, close to some shopping and more fast food type choices (i reccomend wok to walk) and smaller cafes, and close to tram station making it easy to get around the city. Quiet neighborhood, great for sleeping in or those early to bed. The hotel itself was always a peacful environment and the staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and such. I feel the need to mention inparticular our friends Natalie and Puck who greeted us every morning. One morning in particular Natalie took the time to get online and help us plan out a day outside of the city which required taking a tram, an underground train, and a bus, as well as some walking. After researching and finding us a route she printed it all out for us and reviewed it with us making sure we understood the directions. It turned out to be a great day and we found our way just fine thanks to Natalie's help. Last but certainly not least, they do serve a breakfast there in the morning which consists of the usual coffee, tea, juice, meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, cereal, croisants and bread. But every morning Natalie offered to cook us something as well and everymorning we took her up on it. Pancakes with cheese and bacon cooked into the pancake! Delicious!!! She did offer other varieties but after trying this one we continued to ask for it every other day! And she was happy to do it for us. Best breakfast of the whole trip!

The location is fantastic - even with our big bags it was very easy to get to from the airport, and only slightly more difficult to get to the train station on the way out. It's near lots of bars and shops and for most of the trip we just walked everywhere - it's close enough to all the touristy / interesting things to do so. Also I recommend Cafe George nearby for food or drinks - very nice :) Our room was spacious and had a fantastic view over the canal. We even had a balcony that looked out onto the water which was awesome. The people at reception were very helpful for any queries we had, helped us get our bags in and out, and they offer 24 hour room service with a number of reasonably priced snacks that can just go straight onto your room bill. The other (more positive) reviews of this hotel are accurate, including the downsides. There is not much in the way of amenities in the room (no tissues for example), but they do detail what they have on their website, and the free wi-fi is a godsend. And they are very reasonably priced for central Amsterdam so it is understandable. Also take note of the lack of air conditioning - I was glad to know about this before we went, so we could factor it into our decision, but it was fine. Amsterdam is not usually a warm city, and so when our room did get too warm we just opened the window and let the fresh air in (which was lovely anyway). If you're worried about bugs like another TA reviewer, you can leave the light curtain across the window to stop them coming in. Also the staircase is VERY narrow as other people mentioned, and there is no lift, but this is central Amsterdam and is the norm for little places like this! It is something to be aware of if you have a lot of luggage, but not really something to criticise the hotel for. We slept really well while here - while being central it is a quiet street, and we were not woken by any noise during the night. One last thing to note - our bed was actually two singles pushed together. Because we'd seen this in other reviews we knew what to expect, and it was fine! We would definitely come and stay here again if we came back to Amsterdam.

The location was perfect for us. Central, yet on a quiet street away from the loud and busy streets. The service was attentive and friendly. The manager (which I think was also the owner as she asked us our opinion on some bath room re-fits she was about to undertake) insisted on carrying our luggage upstairs. The breakfast was amazing (home cooked meal of bacon and eggs). The room itself was quite small from an Australian point of view, but it was more than adequate for European standards. If you travel to Europe, then you need to expect rooms to be slightly smaller than what you're accustomed to in Australia, or regional America. No air-conditioning in the room, but provided with a fan, luckily it was cooler than expected in July. The bed was very comfortable. From a cleanliness point of view I couldn't fault the place. Very clean. One thing that bothered us a bit was that we were on the 3rd floor and the stairs were very steep. However, again this is a characteristic of all buildings in Amsterdam, so if you are not able bodied then I'd recommend a 1st floor request.

With travel comes unexpected twists, and we experienced just that when my husband's wallet (w/ passport, traveler's checks, a memory card, credit cards, ID and $300 euro) was stolen on the train in Rome. It happened on a Sunday, which meant that the US Embassy was closed. Unfortunately, the following day was the 4th of July, the United States' Independence Day = US Embassy was closed. We were scheduled to fly out of Rome to Amsterdam at 6:20am on July 4th. We were unable to travel without my husband's passport, and we had to miss our Amsterdam trip completely. Although Italy was amazing - beautiful culture, great food, amazing sites - we were looking forward to Amsterdam the most. This brings me to my review of Boutique Hotel View. What first struck us about this hotel is the aesthetics - the building itself, rooms, lobby are adorable! Beyond that, their website is professional and their prices are just right. I emailed Boutique Hotel View, explaining that we will be a no-show in Amsterdam. I lamented about our experience, and to my surprise, the General Manager reimbursed us for our stay. This literally brought tears to my eyes since my husband and I lost about $1500 in this experience. After going through the authorities in Italy - feeling (unfortunately) helpless - it is so refreshing to come across someone that has compassion. My husband and I do plan to travel to Amsterdam in the coming years, and we plan to stay with Boutique Hotel View.

In the end, I finally decided on Boutique Hotel View. I chose it because of the reviews and proximity to Leidseplein and various tram connections. To be honest, we experienced one of the strangest moments out of all our travels during check in. Upon arrival, we noticed this sketchy guy lingering outside the hotel. We went inside, and he followed and he went to his room. When the hotel cleaner came down, they were complaining there was blood and weed all over the hotel room and the strange guest was to leave immediately. There was a small altercation since the guest seemed pretty wasted and agressive but he eventually left. The hotel staff apologized for the noise and repeatedly asked if they could do anything for us while we waited. They helped us get our things to our room after the strange guest had left and gave instructions on internet usage etc. Please don't form a bad impression of this hotel because of our experience. I am including it to show the hotel staff handled it perfectly by always were asking if we were OK. We did not not once feel as if we were in danger. Some people travel to Amsterdam thinking they can smoke weed, drink anywhere and do whatever they want. Because the hotel would not tolerate such behaviour and obvious use of drugs speaks volumes about the type of establishment they run. The hotel is sweet on the outside, very much what anyone would expect in Amsterdam. It's right on the canal and the lobby/breakfast/check in area is quite lovely, albeit small. Our room was small, I mean really tiny. I've travelled all over the world including many places in Europe but this is the smallest ever. The decor was brown and bright pink, but I liked it. There was a double bed, a small desk and a closet for hanging clothes. There was also a place to put your suitcase. With all this laid out, there really was no walking around space. The wall opposite the bed was literally 2 feet away. Although small, we did not mind it and managed to settle in. The bathroom was ok, just a walk-in shower with a curtain and the floor tended to get wet while showering. There was free wifi, which was great and appreciated. Hotel location was excellent, right on the canal with a nice view. There was some construction going on in the area while there and the noise was tolerable. It was unfortunate to see a portable toilet on the road every time you looked out the window but not the end of the world. Hotel was a 3 min walk to Leidseplein square with many restaurants, shopping and bars. The tram connections are amazing from Leidseplein and you can pretty much get anywhere from there. I would recommend getting a tram pass to cover the amount of days you're in Amsterdam. The tram personnel monitor whether you are passing your cards when entering and exiting the tram and will confront you if they don't see you swipe accordingly. We got the tram everywhere and adored the hotel location for this very reason. Breakfast was great and tailored to the small amount of people staying in the hotel. It was not a massive spread but there was always enough each time we went downstairs. The view over the canal while eating was lovely. Breakfast included fresh croissants, breads, meat, cheese, yogurt, fruits and cereal. It's unfortunate the breakfast is 10 euro extra but we didn't mind paying and appreciated the convenience. In the end we only had to pay for 2 mornings of breakfast. The hotel covered the rest given our strange check in experience. We appreciated this very much; a nice gesture on their side. Hotel stairs are steep so keep this in mind if you have mobility issues or large suitcases. The staff will help you however. The stairs are quite typical of Amsterdam homes and I liked them. It really is a nice hotel and I'm glad to see it getting more reviews, and good ones at that.

You'd be hard pressed to find a better located place to stay, smack in the middle of everything. So easy to get there from Centraal Station, which in turn is so easy to get to from the airport. Situated about 100m from the main square at Leidseplein which has so much going on at any hour, on any day of the year. In easy walking distance from The Dam square and all major attractions, theatres, bars, eateries and the wonderfully intimate jazz club, Alto. The hotel is in a typical Dutch canal side building which means narrow and tall. The hotel has just been completely refurbished to very high standard. As pointed out in other reviews the stairs are akin to scaling the North Face of the Eiger. Clamp-ons optional. The room we had, 101, was clean, tidy, well made up every day, modern fitments but, and a big but, very cramped. We had a glimpse into the next door room, 102 and it was quite vast, so I'd suggest you check when you book as to what you are getting. We were invited to a party in the hotel the first night we arrived and were greeted as friends and shown the utmost hospitality by the owners. On the subject of which the owner/manager was the most incredibly helpful, generous and kind person. I cant think how she could of done any more to make the stay better. I would of been quite happy to mark this as 5 for all aspects but the size of this particular room (101) was a let down, as was the view of every-ones back yard. The rooms facing the front are right on the canal front so you'll have a great view, maybe a better view would of made up for our small room?
