To echo what many others have said: Location - perfect! Easy walking distance of just about everything a tourist wants to do in Madrid: all the museums, Plaza Mayor (starting point for many tours), the train station (take it to visit Toledo), the bus station (take it to visit Segovia, though this is a bit farther of a walk, about 2.5 kilometers, I believe), the Palace, La Latina (popular tapas district)... and Plaza Santa Ana is just steps away, providing a really wonderful place to eat any time. Rooms - also perfect! Modern, sleek design. Wood floors. We had a first floor room on the street side, so I was a little worried that it could be noisy, but it was not! The glass windows and doors are double-paned and we had complete silence (and darkness, thanks to high quality drapes) whenever we wanted to sleep, regardless of how many people or cars were on the street outside. Bathrooms are very large. Agree with other reviewers that there's a bit less privacy than some rooms, because the bathroom doors are frosted glass, but you couldn't see in or out. We wish they would put kettles in the rooms for hot water, but the staff was very accommodating and brought us a carafe of hot water when we needed it. (We bought a cup of coffee at the same time, but I assume they would do this even if we had not purchased the coffee.) Service was great. Everything was sparkling clean and everyone was happy to help. Gym is pretty small and sparse -- just some cardio machines (bikes, a rower, and an elliptical, I think), but space on the floor to use for yoga or ab work or whatever.

The only problem was that the room was so dark, lit by a series of little spot lights that where impossible to apply my make-up under. There was a sort of dressing table, but the TV was positioned over this, the mirror was alongside the bed so to enable me to style my hair I had to unplug one of the valued bedside lights so I could plug in my straighteners and sit on the floor to style.
