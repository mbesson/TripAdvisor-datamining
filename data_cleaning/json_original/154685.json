The personnel is very nice and willing to help. If you prefer they also give you a tour and show you arround in the hotel. The offer is very complete, you have a well equipped gym, a pool and garden area, which is really appreciated in this crowded city, a restaurant and very nice and calm rooms despite the fact that it is located at the Perif\u00e9rico. The only thing is that the hotel bar is under construction and according to the personnel it still takes until 2012. Rooms are very clean, calm and cosy. In comparison to other hotels in the city, the windows can be opened. The bathroom is also nice and the closet contains a small safe, which is a common feature also in Mexico. Prices vary and depend on the time of stay, if it is during the week or at the weekend. Companies can also get a corporate rate, which really pays off!", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Atmosphere, Nice People\u201d", "Author": "itsaboutthepeople", "ReviewID": "UR91950861", "Content": "This was a great location for the purpose of my trip (business) and I didn't spend an overwhelming amount of time there. If I had been there for vacation, the location probably wouldn't have been the best. The room was nice. Spacious, clean, and had everything I could possibly need. It was quiet and I slept well. I wrestled a little with the temperature control, but I suspect that was more a problem with me than the system. The people were extremely nice and very efficient.

We booked 7 rooms at this location primarily for its convenient location and because it appeared to be a good value. They had a bit of construction going on (I hear they are becoming a Sheraton) but dust & noise were not an issue. The kids made full use of the pool and the workout center was excellent. The morning buffet had both Mexican & American favorites which allowed my relatives to sample new items at their own pace. Overall I can't think of anything this hotel could have done better. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a bit of sanctuary in the big city.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Maria Barbara", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154685-Reviews-Hotel_Maria_Barbara-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$90 - $120*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Blvd A Camacho 2300</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">54050</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "154685", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/66/cb/66cb88bf740febab25fef25797df017d1large.jpg"}}
