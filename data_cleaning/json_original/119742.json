I requested a king bed instead of two queens and the very friendly front desk employee said they had reserved a king bed room for us. It was obvious the room was made for two queens because it was HUGE. They could have fit a table and chairs in there easily. I also didn't realize we'd have a mini-fridge and microwave. That was a nice touch. I am not super picky with cleanliness of rooms. Basically if there's no mold or bugs, I'm happy. I was happy with the room. The bed was sufficiently comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet. I expected noise because the airport was so close but we weren't bothered by any noise in the room. The underground parking lot was a bit tight, but there was always plenty of parking. We bought discounted zoo tickets from the front desk as well. I didn't check out the breakfast. The front desk employee said it's pretty much coffee, pastries, and juice. We went down the street to \"The Living Room\" instead. We figured with the $80+ a day we saved by staying at the Western Inn, we could splurge on getting a $15 breakfast for two. And they offer breakfast all day. Checkout was very smooth and quick.
