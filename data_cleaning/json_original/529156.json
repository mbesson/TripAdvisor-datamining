The hotel is small but delightful, lovely marble staircases and mosaic floors and glass chandeliers. My room was a double and had plenty of room, it faced the main street and was totally quiet with the windows closed. The bathroom was small but just right, the hotel and rooms were spotlessly clean, the air con was perfect in the Venetian heat. And not a mosquito to be seen ! All staff were wonderful and Elisa was so charming at breakfast and on the reception, I had no complaints at all about this hotel five stars all round from me. The breakfast was lovely and at least 5 choices of cakes ( my favourite ) cereals, bread and cheeses, coffe was also very good. I will certainly recommend this hotel to friends and family, and most definitely return, I got such a great deal with Hotelclub/Orbitz absolutely delightful", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA cosy and comfy hotel hidden in an old building - a perfect service\u201d", "Author": "rumaribeiro", "ReviewID": "UR117738784", "Content": "I've been on a business trip to Venice (for the Venice Film Festival) and stayed at the Caretoni.

The rooms are very clean and the cleaner (a shy oriental girl) is very efficient. I've had problems in receiving an important fax and e-mail needed for the Festival and Elisa who is the Receptionist was extremely helpful, she did what she could to help me and finally, due to her assistance, all went well.

Thumbs Down ---------------------- 1. Mosquitoes - Too Many. The hotel staff care a damn to help by giving excuse of \"Venice Problem\". They do not even provide a repellant. Pathetic!! 2. Room Size - Too Too tiny (See my Pic). French Bed. we are thin and still could not fit in. Even 2 suitcases cannot be kept. 3. AC/FAN - No Fan. AC Does not work. They ask us to keep windows closed to enable ac to switch on. But it never switched on. Summer nights were horrible. All 2 nights we could not sleep. 4. BREAKFAST - avoid.. looked like it was just a formality. No Choices. Breads were bad. 5. Staff - keep changing frequently. saw 5 receptionists at 5 diff times. Few were very rude/unhelpful/uncourteous. DEPRESSING 6 INTERNET - No wifi. They provide LAN cables and that too take 10Euro Deposit. What the heck!!! Thumbs Up ------------------ 1. Proximity - Just next to rail station and to bus station 2. Location - On the main street of Lista Di Spagna - Always buzzing with activities Avoid this. It was disastrous.

Everything you want to see is within walking distance including Ferrovia station for water taxis to San Marco square and Rialto Bridge.

Otherwise you'll have to lug suitcases up and down bridges to get to your hotel. I saw many people lugging huge suitcases around Venice whereas I only had a 5 minute walk. The hotel appears to have been completely remodeled and it is very nice, but a few things to be aware of : 1. There are no elevators. It was not a lot of fun carrying a 40lbs suitcase up three flights of stairs. 2. The rooms are nicely priced but you get what you pay for. The room was really really tiny. My wife and I could barely stand up in the room together. All in all it is a nice hotel at a great price.

It ticked all the boxes we were looking for in hotel. Comfortable rooms, gooood breakfast incl in price, clean bathroom, helpful staff and above all it was stone's throw from St Lucia Station. If you are travelling to and from station this is the place to be in. We have seen numerous tourist carrying their suitcases over the canals and on the cobbled streets searching their accomodations through confusing streets of venice. I think we made a great decision by selecting Antica Casa. Oh and we could see grand canal from main window of our room (had to lean over to get that view)!!! Negative thing is if you're travelling with heavy suitcases, you will have to carry them up a level to reach reception and then one/two more levels to your room. Secondly they do not have wi-fi in rooms. However they do have cable connections and you have to get the cable from reception and return it on departure. Wasn't a negative for us, just thought of letting people know.

The train station, or bus station too, is a scant minute or two away from the hotel. To get the keys for the room you need to stop at Zechini first which is beside the hotel. Can't comment on the breakfast as we always ate out and about.
