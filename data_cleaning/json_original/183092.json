The room was spotless; the service was efficient and pleasant. We got exactly what we asked for--a nice quiet room on a high(er) floor. The requested room service arrived within moments of check-in. All the employees are smiling and chatty and just lovely. None of this is unusual for a Marriott. ALL Marriott Hotels are this good. What's nice about this one in particular is the location: right next to the Eaton Centre and WALKING distance to most if not all of downtown Toronto. The room was erormous. Could actually have fit a sofa or at least a love seat in there. I wasn't too thrilled about not having access to the window, but it was an oddly shaped room and perhaps the desk really couldn't go anywhere else. The only negative, if you can even count it as such, is that I loathed the \"gold/yellow/baby-poo colour of the walls in the room--but that's just personal preference on my part and nothing really to complain about, We spent most of the time walking around TO anyway, or sleeping in the AWESOME bed. We didn't eat in the restaurant but had a really good cup of coffee one morning. I would be very surprised if the restaurant didn't live up to Marriott standards.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAlways love staying at the Eaton Centre Marriott!!\u201d", "Author": "WorkinTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR126331321", "Content": "Arrived on a Saturday for a one night stay at 12:00 and was still checked into my rooms right then. I had booked two rooms and was very pleasantly surprised that they anticipated that I would like adjoining rooms even though I hadn't requested it. Also requested a high floor and was given the 16th floor! Nice to have a hotel listen and respond to requests. Check in was great, was engaged by the front desk agent the entire time, he made a point of making conversation with me while he did his work to get me checked in. Only thing that was missing and would have been nice is a quick run down on the hotel itself. But, checkin went very quickly and efficient. Arrived at the rooms and was very impressed as usual. Everything was spotlessly clean, I can usually find something to comment on when it comes to hotel rooms but the room was actually perfect. View was amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable. Did not hit the restaurants on this visit, but everything from top to bottom for this visit was first class! The staff here are so pleasant and engaging!

The Marriott met our expectations with great customer service and very nice rooms. I utilized the gym which was fairly small with 5-6 treadmills, some weight machines, a few ellipticals and 1 bike. It was definitely good enough for me to get in my daily workout. I walked through the pool area which was separate from the gym, it also seemed pretty small but well maintained. Unexpectedly our stay was impacted by the noise level in our room. I am usually a very sound sleeper, and after the few drinks I enjoyed with dinner I was expecting to sleep the night away. We both had a restless night and were actually annoyed with the sounds of the hotel. I thought it sounded like a vacuum cleaner being turned on and off repeatedly, she said it sounded more like a hair dryer. It was emanating from the air vents and continued all night long. On top of that there seemed to be regular noise from the bathroom plumbing and a continuous tappin. In the middle of the night we both got up and put on our iPods so the music would drown out the noise and allow us to sleep. We are both very easy going and were surprised it affected our stay to the extent that it did, but we both agreed the next morning that we should have returned to the hotel we had stayed at a few months earlier in the same neighbourhood of Toronto with better value. Perhaps it was just our location in the hotel, but the noise definitely left a lasting and poor impression with us both. We keep asking ourselves, was it just us???

It's located right beside the Eaton Centre mall (in fact it's directly connected from the inside). Nathan Phillips Square (along with it's outdoor ice skating rink) is just across the street. The subway and underground PATH system are also very close by. For music lovers, the hotel restaurant/bar looks out onto a courtyard through floor to ceiling windows where, just steps through the windows, sits The Church of the Holy Triniity, site of the Cowboy Junkies lo-tech masterpiece album, The Trinity Session. There were 4 or 5 doormen/bellmen located by the entrance and the front desk was also well staffed. All employees were extremely helpful and pleasant. The fitness centre and pool are located on the top floor (18th). The fitness centre also looks out over the city through floor to ceiling windows and is very well equipped with all the latest machines. There were no waits during my entire stay (and I exercise at \"prime time\" - at the end of the business day). In addition, all machines were equipped with personal TVs. There was also a basket full of new complimentary headphones that were yours to keep. The pool was very clean and well maintained but very small. There was no way you could swim laps in it. The hot tub was large and also very clean. It was also nicely separated from the pool by a translucent barrier. My room was a good size with a convenient corner for business and all the plug-ins you could possibly need to charge your electronic devices. The HD TV was an older model, judging from the picture quality. The housekeeping in my room and the rest of the hotel was impeccable, with ONE exception. Like most hotels these days, sheets are changed after a certain number of nights (or every night, upon request). This hotel said the sheets would be changed after the third night (and, of course, with every new guest). Well, when I turned back my sheets while going to bed on my fourth night, the same sheets were still there (I could tell by a slight smudge that was there at the beginning of my stay). This got me to thinking, if the hotel didn't live up to it's first promise (new sheets after the third night), did it live up to it's second promise? (new sheets for each new guest) Looking back at the smudge that was there when I arrived, I now can't be sure that I was sleeping on fresh sheets the first three nights. I however, have stayed at this hotel before and believe this was an uncharacteristic mistake. The sheets were changed the next day, after I left a note for the housekeeper. The second blip occured with the air conditioning. The first night, despite the fact it was below freezing outside, I could not get my room cool enough. I put the thermostat down as low as it would go (60 F or 16 C), however the room would not even get close to that temperature. The next morning I asked for it to be looked at. I was told a service person would check it and that the staff would leave a message on the room telephone to tell me what they'd done. When I got back to the room that evening, there was no message. However, the room did seem slightly cooler. That night, the room still didn't get even close to cool enough, despite the thermostat down as low as it could go. I gave up trying to get it fixed properly or change rooms, because the room was marginally comfortable at night, and I didn't want the hassle of changing rooms. I believe this was uncharacteristic as well, however, I was not pleased about not getting the promised phone message. Bottom line is my sleep experience was not nearly as good as it could have been. On the bright side, the bed was extremely comfortable, and there was no noise. Other than those two things, the hotel was perfect. Since I've had a good experience here on a previous stay, I will give this hotel another chance.

We are a couple in our late 40's. I usually pick hotels that are at least 3.5 stars, preferring 4 (or more), if the price and location are right for city stays. In this case, price was a bit high, but location was key. I would rate the hotel an easy 4 stars I am rating excellent however, as the service was just perfect. From the front desk, restaurant, door-man .....everyone seemed to be trying very hard to be smiley and attentive. I have Marriott points, and wanted to earn more, so I choose a Marriott for that reason. I also like the consistency of Marriott Hotels. WE had a King reserved and it was received at the CAA rate of 179.00 per eve, on their website. Actually, it was cheaper to reserve on the website as opposed to Hotel.ca and Expedia....so check the property websites! The front desk person, at the members desk was a natural! He was extremely helpful, genuine, and professional. A younger man who just seemed to have a knack for helping. This is so appreciated, as I repeat over and over, the front desk is the first experience of any stay, and is more important than some companies understand. This company gets it!!! The room was a corner room on the 8th floor. Very spacious, for city standards, but dark, because it did not have as many windows as some other rooms-being the corner room. Flat-screen TV, coffee maker and all of the wonderful bath products you would expect. The pillows were dreamy, as were the sheets, so much so, that I am thinking of ordering some for Christmas presents off of Marriotts website...down pillows. I am also rating excellent, as this property was spotless. The entry to the hotel, the restaurant, and more importantly, the rooms...spotless. The bathroom was smaller, but so clean, the size became less important. We had cocktails in the restaurant. Service was wonderful. Lounge/restaurant was \"hotelish\" but very pretty. The doorman was quick and smiley and had a great sense of humour ....each time we needed him. We ordered rooms service for breakfast our last day. The breakfast was plentiful, and eggs were done just right. All condiments we asked for were brought, and right on time as well. Pricey ($45,00) but delicious. The pedway to the Eaton Centre was my fav extra here. It did rain when we were in Toronto, so shopping...which was a goal of mine during this stay, was made easy with this entry into the Eaton Centre. You enter into Sears. Easy to find again as well, to re-enter Hotel. We will definitely return here, looking for weekend specials...as I would like to see a price drop for longer stays (more than 2 eves)...at the 160 mark.... as similar hotels in the area....upon checking, were lower. WE would also like to see free internet. The price of the stay should easily include this. Just a note ,,,the Marriott website is one of the easiest to navigate compared to other hotel companies.

Also, no WIFI in the rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 However, I was happy to see the luxurious bedding system that I have to come to expect from the Marriot (down comforters, custom duvets). The hotel is situated in an amazing spot, a quick pop out the side door, across a small courtyard (Trinity Square) and you have entered into the lobby of the Toronto Eaton Centre, absolutely perfect for shoppers, also, as we were in Toronto visiting a family member who was staying in St Michaels Hospital, I was happy to report it was a mere 4 minute walk from our hotel to the hospital. Perfect location. As for the hotel itself\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Only one (1) restaurant, which we did not take the opportunity to try, the awful smells (think Burger King) wafting through the front lobby, turned our stomachs away from even trying, also, I wanted to mention the Room Service prices were absolutely ridicules, so there was no way, we would have considered trying that either. Pool and fitness center are on top (18th) floor and make for a great view, however, again, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance to participate in either, however, I my daughter did report that the pool was very small, but the elliptical equipment was in good repair. High Speed internet is available for a charge of $15.00 CDN per day, however, the guest rooms are wired only, apparently the lobby and public areas are wireless. On site parking costs $25.00 CDN per day, or $30 CDN for Valet, which for the extra $5.00 we thought the Valet was worth it. Again, due to the location, I would recommend this hotel to those who want to spend a few days shopping or visiting the downtown core of Toronto, however, please note, this hotel just offers a basic place to rest your head and not set to the usual Marriott Standard.

The room was never charged until our stay though. I found all the staff very friendly. The hotel's public areas are very nice. There's a sitting area with beautiful cosy fireplace and a bar with overpriced drinks costing around $7 each. We were there on a Friday night. The bar wasn't very busy. The room was clean, nice good quality furnishings and comfortable. No complaints here. I looked all over the bed for bed bugs....none found. Eaton centre was a minute walk away. I'm not sure if there was indoor mall access but we just went out back, through a little courtyard with an old church in it. Lots of security around this area. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance including Eggspectations where we went for breakfast which was really good. In room internet cost extra, which I find ridiculous since most moderate price hotels include this in their price today. The only drawback to staying here is getting to the hotel.

Behind that veneer is some pretty bad food and service and really incompetent management that is defensive and obtuse when problems occur. Some examples: 1 Greasy food. I ordered the Trios Benedict and had to run to the bathroom five times after breakfast 2. Housekeeping broke a ear piece of an audio set which I had borrowed from a colleague as well as disconnected my laptop from the power source. As a result, I lost some files and had to spend five hours having to re-create those documents. Further, when I complained, I had to deal with several layers of really defensive and obtuse management with comments such as \"Oh, housekeeping does not do such things!\" Even more frustrating was when the Event Planning Manager Jack H (muttonhead) arrived along with a security agent(chucklehead) to my room to take a report of the damage done. Muttonhead was very irritating, trying to tell me that the breakage was only cosmetic as well as they would have to check with housekeeping which could take a day or two before confirming the incident, i.e. after I departed from the hotel. I find it hard to understand how a housekeeper on minimum wage with poor job security will admit to these mistakes. More interestingly, it has been a week and I have not heard from the hotel. Muttonhead was so audacious, that despite my obvious frustrations with him, he told me that he hoped that the hotel would welcome me soon once again! 3. 'The suits and smiles' protect the higher layers of management from hearing the real issues that guests face. When I tried to speak with either the General Manager Mark or the Service Director Steve with regard to a problem with booking, I was given various excuses by different people which were inconsistent. i.e. one person said that the Service Director had left for the day and another said that the Service director was in a meeting and would call me when he was out of the meeting, which of course never happened! I have platinum status with the Marriott brand of hotels, and if this is the experience that I faced, I can only shudder to think of how other guests get treated at this hellhole. 4. The hotel did not inform the guests of the \"nuit blanche\" or festival night that was occurring all around the hotel and resulted in barricades being raised, such that taxis could not reach the hotel. As a result, my very frail mother had to walk seven blocks on the Saturday night to get back to the hotel, only to find that our room key would not let us into the side door of the hotel. Thanks to another guest who saw our plight, he approached the door from the inside of the hotel and we were able to get in. The night management led by Mr Suda and another associate at the desk provided similar obtuse comments claiming that some of the revellers had jammed the door.

When I asked how long I would be waiting I was given a very vauge answer, \"it could be 10 minutes, it could be an hour\" again with no apology for the wait. I waited in the lobby and watched as serveral guests who arrived after me were given keys and did not have to wait to get a room.

I waited until 4:55 and went back to the front desk to ask how much longer I would have to wait because I had dinner reservations. The woman laughed and said, \"it hasn't been long enough for a room to be cleaned yet.\" I asked if there were any other rooms available, so she checked and all of a sudden they had a room for me. However she was reluctant to give it to me because it offered \"more amenities\" (I still haven't quite figured out what those amenities were, because the room I ended up in seemed standard). What horrible service, to not get a room until a full 2 hours after the stated check-in time with no apologies is ridiculous, especially when it is getting closer to dinner time and people have made plans. I have never experienced this lack of service at any other brand of hotels.

We drove in from Ottawa and had a difficult time finding the hotel since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a difficult street to turn onto when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re downtown. There were lots of no turning signs as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to get to the hotel, which can be frustrating. Once at the hotel, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off parking at the Eaton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Centre indoor parking lot next door ($6/day on weekends/holidays), which will save you a lot more money then parking at the hotel. The hotel building, grounds, and lobby didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really impress me much, but we also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time at the hotel either. The location is attached to the mall; interior access is a 5 minute walk and takes you into the 2nd floor of the Sears women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department. It really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned well as the hallway can appear dark and isolated between the hotel and mall. But at least you have that option if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go outside. We ate at the restaurant, which was standard for this quality. It had high prices, decent food, and average service; nothing out of the ordinary. Lots of televisions at the bar for when you want to watch a game. Free Wi-Fi internet access in the lobby, but not in the hotel rooms (cost extra). The elevators are only busy during morning and afternoon. This hotel is a business hotel, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a lot of leisure luxury (such as quality shops, restaurants, spa, or pool). The workout gym is quite nice, with individual television monitors, water cooler, and free earphones. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 24 hours, which I love for business travellers. I really enjoyed the apple platter they had there, which was a unique touch to a workout gym. The pool is very disappointing, which appeared to be a small cube shape so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother. The room is standard for this quality, but lacking in view if you get the wrong side. We had two rooms, a court yard room (quite nice) and a standard room facing another building; ask for the rooms with a nice view! It was clean and I never had any noise problems.

It's right in the center of downtown Toronto, close to the financial district just to its south, the cheesy/sleazy (by Toronto standards) Yonge Street commercial strip and the elegant Yorkville area to the north. Chinatown and Kensington Market are a few blocks (or short streetcar ride) to the west, the harborfront to the south, and everything is easily accessible by public transit. The hotel has a handsome, relatively understated lobby. It's Porte Cochere is off Bay Street, and it's linked to the Sears store in the Eaton Centre. The large, comfortable rooms are very Marriott in appearance, with soothing taupe color schemes. They also feature great flat-screen TVs, and large bathrooms with the standard Marriott toiletries. The Marriott beds are uber-comfortable. But you could wake up in just about any Marriott anywhere and not know the difference. I didn't eat in the hotel restaurant or order room service - not in the multicultural, ethnic dining sensory overload that is Toronto. (For breakfast, go to Eggspectation in the Eaton Centre.

The weather was beautiful in mid-September.

There are many casual restaurants in the Dundas subway stop area and a Scotiabank ATM for which there is no charge for Bank of America customers. Also on the second floor is a combined business center and gift shop that is open from 7 am to 11 pm. Although there is a charge for use of one of the computers, I believe it is only $2.99 for up to 5 minutes. Our room looked like it had just been redone with new looking carpet, furniture, and wallpaper and the airconditioning worked perfectly. The beds are the Marriott latex beds with feather toppers and were very comfortable. Perhaps the earlier reviewer got the room that had not been redone. There is a buffet breakfast for $21 per person but the room service Canadian breakfast is only $17 per person and there is no automatically added service charge. We enjoyed this all three mornings and it always came on time with the food hot. A Globe and Mail newspaper is delivered every morning and another Toronto newspaper and USA Today and the Wall Street Journal are available for free at the restaurant entrance. There is a large countertop for the sink in the bathroom and plenty of hot water and sufficient water pressure. In Toronto the subway goes to most places tourists would like to visit. We walked from the hotel to the Toronto Art Museum. We took the subway to the Royal Ontario Museum and the Gardner (Ceramic Museum) across from it, and also took the subway to Union Station where you board the trolley for the harborfront which has several attractions including the new Inuit art museum. Across the street from the Gardner Museum is Bloor street where the deluxe shops and many restaurants are. Downpoints were minor: 1. If you pour yourself a cup of coffee at the restaurant to take back to your room, they ask your room number and charge you for it; 2. When we went to the restaurant about 7:30 pm for coffee and dessert, the waiter seemed too busy chatting with the other staff to take our order and bring it, and bring the check. Needless to say, he got no tip; 3. The Eaton Centre is enormously big but really just filled with chain stores and rather basic food court type restaurants.

The Marriott Eaton Centre is a large property right in the heart of downtown Toronto, where my wife and I were attending a wedding. I chose it because I generally like the solid build quality of Marriotts (the rooms are usually nice and quiet) and the service is professional. The tone of our dreadful stay was set right from the start, when the front desk clerk informed me that someone had cancelled our reservations. I had requested two adjoining rooms with a connecting door but these were now gone. The only ones she could offer me that had the connecting door were still not clean, so I accepted her offer of two adjoining rooms. In my world adjoining means right next to each other. In Marriottland it means two rooms separated by the entrance to the emergency staircase. There were about seven yards from one door to the next. The rooms were clean and quiet, but short on amenities. There wasn't even a shoe shine cloth, while the shampoo and soap were basic and the towels were pretty small. Right away one of the room keys stopped working, so we had to get it replaced. The elevator doors are about as friendly as sharks' jaws and we had to jump in and out each time to avoid being hit by fast-moving metal. At 5:20 am the next morning the fire alarm went off. We stumbled downstairs and were mystified by the completely incomprehensible announcements over the intercoms on each floor. I mean, the bells were ringing, the place could have been on fire, and all you could hear over the intercom was \"Attention mumble splutter garble fire mumble mumble fizz wait\". We made our way to the lobby and found no one in charge. One poor front desk clerk was answering guests' calls one by one and was too busy to talk. So we all milled around waiting for the fire engines to arrive. After a while I could see people lining up for the elevators so I asked the clerk whether it was safe to go back up. Yes, he replied. Yet the hotel did not make a single announcement to this effect. Overall, this was a hugely unimpressive performance. The next day there were huge line-ups for breakfast, since the room set aside for hungry guests appears to be pretty small. One of the other guests told us that he'd read on another traveller's forum that this hotel has had problems with the fire alarms going off. By this time I was super keen to leave, but we were having more trouble with one of the room keys, which also doubled up as the exit ticket from the downstairs parking lot ($22 Canadian a night for self-parking). So of course, when I tried to get our car out of the garage, the boom wouldn't open. I pressed the intercom and when the other person answered, I explained my problem. They asked for my room number, which I gave. \"No, not the tag number, I need the room number.\" So I repeated the room number more loudly and very slowly. \"I need the room number,\" she repeated, and round and round we went before I bellowed the number into the intercom. \"Thanks for shouting,\" she said sarcastically.

We're a family of 4, including 2 young children, so we stayed in a room with a king size bed as well as a sofa (with sofabed) on the 12th floor. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of downtown adjacent to Eaton Centre. The lobby is is stylishly decorated and modern as are the hallways and rooms. All of the furnishings including the carpeting seemed new. The room included a 42\" flatscreen TV as well as a desk with an \"In-drawer\" safe. I found the room to be a tad small and drawer space was limited, but comfortable enough for a family of 4. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. Requests for pillows and blankets were responded to within minutes. We used the rooftop pool which was small, but very nice. The pool offers an \"adult swim period\" later in the evening. Most days, there were very few people at the pool. The subway is located nearby, as is Chinatown which is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The CN Tower is an approximate 20 to 25 minute walk. I used Marriott Points for my stay, but this room seems to be priced at roughly $200 CAD nightly, which is fair price for a hotel of this quality. We opted for the breakfast buffet one morning which was excellent and included a wide variety of fresh items, including fruit, pastries, an omelette station as well as my favorite, eggs benedict. Beware -- it's very expensive. It cost our family of 4 (including two young children) over $70 for breakfast.

Check in was very easy and Marsha, who checked us in, even went up to the room with us to make sure it met our needs. What wonderful service. The room was 1228 and had a lovely view of the church and courtyard on the side of the hotel. No noise from Bay Street, large windows and of course a wonderfully comfortable bed I have come to expect from Marriott. I met a housekeeper in the hall and ask for another pack of coffee which I was cheerfully given and every morning their after, our smiling housekeeper, Aprilyn, left extra packets of coffee, cream and sugar. After touring/sightseeing/visiting with a relative during the day it was always wonderful to come back to our accommodations for the evening knowing how nice they were.

I have to mention the housekeeping staff who were very efficient, and cleaned up our room almost as soon as we left it. All the hotel staff were friendly and courteous.

The hotel walkway to teh eaton centre goes yes, to the Sears Women's lingerie department.

The hotel is right beside Dundas sqaure and the main stop for our tour. ShopDineTour, which was very good. Look for the yellow double decker buses. They bring you to all the major attractions and you learn alot about the city this way. We had breakfast for 2 days of our stay for $10. Be careful if this isn't included in yoru room because it costs $22 a person for the buffet. The food is excellent, lots of selections and the wait staff is spectacular. Toronto itself is an amazing and diverse city. You will never run out of things to do, we had to stay an extra night and we still didn't finish everything on our list. If visiting in the summer, check out Harbourfront for a nice afternoon at the water. Walk, take the bus, or the subway from the Eaton centre Dundas stop and you're there in a few minutes. We did the CN tower, which is amazing but very crowded. We went around 8 so we could see the city with the sun, the sun setting and then the city all with its lights on, very nice. We also went to the Caso Loma which isn't that great at all. We went during a festival we did not know about and the castle was very crowded. There had to be a thousand people in the house.

The difference was night and day. We were able to access the hotel through the Eaton Centre itself. The path is a bit hidden the first time you try (you have to go to the second floor of Sears/Eaton's and next to the woman's swimwear department there is a small hallway leading to the hotel), but once found is a convenient way to access both the mall and hotel without having to go outside. Once at the check in counter we were warmly greeted by the check in agent and were surrounded by one of the nicest hotel lobbies I have been in. As per usual with me I asked if there were any upgrades available. Unfirtunately there wasn't but I was told I would have a nice room with a courtyard view. Unlike the previous hotel we were to stay at, this agent was telling the truth and we ended up with an EXCELLENT room! The room was quite spacious. Once entering the bathroom was to the right, and there was a small shelf set specifically designed to give you space to make coffee and tea. Past the bathroom and shelf you then enter to main area of the room which was equipped with a very nice LG flat screen tv, office table with safe built in, a comfy couch, and the most comfortable bed I have had the pleasure of sleeping in! Apart from the actual room itself the hotel offers many areas in the lobby as well as various hallways to relax in modern styled couches and lounge chairs. The hotel restaurant is nice and offers a great breakfast buffet (try and get the rate that includes it for free if you can, otherwise it is over $20 per person!), and the bar itself is open till 1am (drink prices are a bit high for what you get, so if you are willing to walk, going somewhere on Younge may provide better value) Overall it was a great experience and really helped make our trip memorable and a pleasure.

Of course, the room wasn't ready when we first got there, but the staff was very cordial and offered to rush the room cleaning and give us information on local attractions in the meantime. We parked the car and returned at regular check-in time after a full day of touring. One note about the parking: be careful of the sharp turns and steep driving you'll have to do for the self parking ($22 per night). The garage is a little bit difficult to navigate, with some spots that are virtually impossible to get into with a larger car. When we returned to check-in, we found the staff very pleasant again. We booked a regular 2 doubles room with rewards points plus a paid $30 per night upgrade to the concierge level. In the computer it was showing up as a $50 upgrade. After showing our confirmation, the desk staff was more than happy to make the adjustment, no questions asked, no need to deal with management. This impressed me. Our room was on the 7th floor. I believe that this level used to house the concierge lounge. Since renovations have been going on, it has been moved to the lobby level next to the restaurant. When we got off of the elevators (which were surprisingly fast our entire stay), the floor seemed to be under construction. There were sections of the wall that were blocked off and the carpet was covered with plastic in some areas. However, our room was further down the hall away from all of this and we didn't hear anything or have any problems with the construction. The room was gorgeous- everything was brand new. It was decorated in the new Marriott theme of golds and reds and the beds are some of the best you will find in the hotel industry. The tv was one of the largest I've ever had in a hotel room, and the desk area was large and had a nice array of power sources for the business traveler. The bathroom was on the small side, but still very functional and nice. The room itself was above-average in size for a city hotel room. Our view was of Trinity Church and other buildings in the area. It was probably one of the best views available- no room has a truly \"great\" view. We didn't use the indoor pool or fitness center, but I looked at both. They seemed pretty standard for a city hotel- nothing extraordinary, but definitely adequate. The concierge lounge is now located off of the lobby by the restaurant. The staff in there was wonderful- some of the best I've had at any hotel. The lounge was large and had nice hors d'oeuvres and snacks all day. For the breakfast, they allowed us to get the full restaurant buffet, which made upgrading a real value! We were treated exceptionally well by all of the staff- we even received a free tray of room service snacks at one point with a note welcoming us to the hotel. It was such a nice touch that made us feel welcomed and appreciated as Marriott Rewards members. The hotel location is great. It is across the street from City Hall and connected to Eaton Centre and Dundas Square (the indoor walkway was closed during our stay for renovations). As tourists, we found it very convenient to everything we needed to see. There is also a subway stop right at the hotel. We did the double-decker bus tour of the city through Grayline on both of our days in Toronto, and there were 2 stops within walking distance of the hotel. I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. Everything was perfect, despite the fact that renovations are occurring. Every improvement the hotel is making seems to be for the better. It is a great property that I will return to: a true 4-star experience.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worksop, England", "Title": "\u201cHotel as expected, but great staff\u201d", "Author": "theoldwoman", "ReviewID": "UR18337459", "Content": "The hotel is just about everything you expect of a Marriott.

It enters sears, and on your way through this hallway there is a giftshop and a cafe down the stairs. Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes. The only downsides are is that for $250 a night, you dont really get your moneys worth. The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced. Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.

The hotel was very busy as the CFL Grey Cup was being played at the Rogers Centre on the evening of Sunday 25 November. Being from England, we didn't know a thing about the Grey Cup until we got to Toronto and people kept asking us if that was the reason we were visiting! We paid a shade over $100 Canadian dollars per night and our room was great.

If you don't say anything and get a pre-paid ticket you pay each time you go in and out of the garage, and if you are parked longer than 24 hours, you are charged a premium. After learning this the first time we were charged, we asked the hotel to help us figure out how to get back what the \"overpay\" was and do it correctly moving forward. We were told that it was too late, and it had to be done our first day. So no help there. We had to change rooms within the first 20 minutes we were there. The walls were paper thin and we could hear every conversation (and argument) in the room next to us. We called down to the front desk to request a change and were told they would call us right back. I had to call back 30 minutes later, and they had no record of me calling the first time! After I explained it all again, they finally got us another room at the end of the hallway (ask for an end or corner room - it was twice as large), and had someone bring us our new keys. The breakfast buffet was decent - a bit different than other Marriotts we have stayed at, but overall ok. We had a great rate - $159 CAD, which included our room and breakfast. Other than that, there wasn't much to write home about at this hotel. It needs updating, but I will say that they were installing a new fitness room with very much updated (and needed) equipment in it - looked like it would be ready soon for the public. Honestly, if you are going to Toronto and want to be near shopping, this will be ok for you (but so would the Sheraton). If you want to be near the Lakefront, CN Tower, Yonge St, and the theatre district, the Renaissance would be a much better choice.", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME PLACE TO STAY !!!!\u201d", "Author": "mrbjsbrb", "ReviewID": "UR6583867", "Content": "We were here for 6 nights and the staff were wonderful and friendly.

We where all visiting family in nearby Onatrio but wanted to enyoy a night out in Toronto,our children stayed with family whilst we looked forward to having some time to pamper ourselfs.This hotel was chosen because it supposedly has a good reputation and it was in a prime location.We paid $540 for two rooms for the night , this was to include the romantic package of sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries and breakfast. WHERE SHALL I BEGIN? ARRIVAL When we arrived at the front of the hotel for valet parking one of the hotel staff approached our vehcile and started speaking strangely to our friend who was driving (he is Afro caribean) our friend baffled ;explained he didn't understand what was being said and the staff member said in a jokey way I am speaking African to you,we where clearly offended and shocked by his presumptious,unprofessional manner ,my friend stated that although he was black he was not African and spoke English.Our experience with the staff didn't get any better from here BOOKING IN & ROOMS The rooms where prebooked but when we arrived we had to hang around the corridor for over half an hour because there had been some mix up with the reservation, it was very embarrassing and a waste of prescious time.Whilst waiting I asked the consierge where the washrooms where and he was very unhelpful and quite rude.When things where eventually sorted out and we where booked into our allocated rooms they where freezing,although there was a thermostate you could only turn on the air con ,we asked for it to be checked and the maintance man basically said there was nothing that could be done, along with that the view from window was awful.After complaining we where moved to other rooms which where just as cold but we decided it was a waste of time saying anything as it was obvious that the main central heating system was turned off until winter also the view was slightly better and we just wanted to make the most of the experience without constantly complaining, What i can say about the room is that they where very clean and the bed was super comfy thats where it ends.We all expected more for what we had paid for as it was very chinzy, basic and formal, nothing special.We decided that obviously we had paid for the location and thats it really.If you like shopping its ideal because its attached to a giant mall in the centre of Toronto.Unfortunatly we didn't have much time to shop or look around as the whole booking in/changing rooms scenario took most of our valubale time up. Around the hotel is very grand and glamourous but it was spoiled by numerous cigerate dimps and empty drink cans thrown on corridors and out side the lift (they where until the next day when we booked out) The nightlife in Toronto was great and we enjoyed it immensly,the following morning we had breakfast in bed which was not that great so quite a bit was wasted. THE ICE LADY Before booking out at 12 noon we wanted to enjoy a relaxing time in the health spa/sauna which opened at 6am.We went down at 10am and the woman on reception was so unproffessional its unbelieveable,she was busy small talking on the phone with a friend and had no intention of finishing her conversation, she gave us no instructions on what to do and basically ignored us.After standing around looking puzzeled we decided to enter the changing rooms,my friend went back out to ask for towels and was met by an icy glare she might of well as put up a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the desk ,there was no acknowlegment of any kind other than the body language of distane.We got ready to go into the sauna and it was cold,I went out to ask why it wasn't hot and was told I had to operate it myself when i ask how, i was spoken to like an idiot.As I have already stated we didn't want anything to spoil our time spent there so we refused to cause a scene,i went back in and after a few attempts we managed to get the sauna started, it was obvious it would take some time to heat up so we went to sit in the hot tub to wait- this was out of order and also the pool stairs could not be accessed.Whilst we discussed the disatisfaction of the facilities with other unhappy guests the woman on reception decided to butt in as she had now finished talking on the phone and wanted to get cheeky.When i asked why the sauna was not switched on from 6am as stated she said the hotel needed to save electicity-at that point i told her we had paid enough money to stay in the hotel and also that she had really bad manners and was obviously not suited to the job as she was not interested in the guests. SUMMARY Our run ins with staff ended there and we never bothered complaining it just made us think we would not recommend this hotel to anyone-especially someone looking for a romantic break. The Hotel needs to do some serious retraining on customer service for most of the staff we encountered and also update some of the facilities ie TVs , decor in rooms, Sauna/spa facilities There was one member of staff on reception who was very nice and helpful her name was 'AMA 'and she was happy to help and was the only one who made us feel welcome.THANKS AMA", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cMarriott - Eaton Center - Fabulous Service\u201d", "Author": "Generalque", "ReviewID": "UR5534847", "Content": "Just stayed here for a long weekend.

I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed. The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in. The front desk clerk told me about it, and said the hotel would pay for a calling card for me if I wished to make calls. I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in. I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue. I called the customer service person (with my cell phone!) and said that I really needed to do some work on my computer and I asked whether they could not speed up the repair on the line. The customer service person was quite apologetic and told me that she would see what she could do. A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night. I moved, and everything was then OK. I thought that the service response was great - I have never had someone come to my room to hand me another key.

The pool was quite small, but suitable for the children to use. The front desk staff were also friendly and helpful with any requests. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Toronto (we have high expectations from hotels, which can sometimes cause disappointment -not so this time!)", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery good service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3097552", "Content": "I travel to Toronto alot and always use this hotel.

I must admit, the location is perfect! Right downtown, close to everything! I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side. The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room! One was dead and under the chair in the room, and the other my husband saw scurrying across the floor. When we complained to the front desk, they didn't say sorry, they simply said they'd send someone up. Maybe this is common? Well, after 45 minutes, no one showed up so I called the desk again. They said \"he\" was called and must be busy. We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came. The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying \"Looks like we got em all\". I was so frustrated. At check-out we mentioned it again, but nothing was done. This time the clerk did manage a sorry, but it was forced. Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff. The location can't be beat.", "Date": "December 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2906124", "Content": "Great staff, friendly people, and amazing location for shopaholics!
