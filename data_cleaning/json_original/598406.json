{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful Place to Stay in Beijing I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Excellent rooms - clean, large and comfortable - they even give you an umbrella! And an excellent value. But the best part is the location in one of the best preserved hutongs in Beijing. Instead of staying in a place in a business district with no real soul, you step out of this hotel into the real life of China. The only problem is that many taxi drivers do not know how to find it. But Beijing taxi drivers are a difficult class of people anyway!", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR857070710", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Beaucaire"}, {"Content": "loved the area liked the area,set among the hutongs(little allys).hotel across from shop where you buy bottled water very cheap.taxis in beijing very cheap. a visitor must see the kung fu show in the evenings.story written above stage in english and chinese.also the peking duck was mouth watering. the b/fast in hotel was good with enough choice in english food.evening meal was excellent. would recommend hotel for stay.", "Date": "Feb 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394335296", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "chancerjim"}, {"Content": "A solid hotel, but not for shoppers       The Ning Xia Hotel entrance", "Date": "Oct 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR451840297", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "dweymouth"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d598406-r18074037-Beijing_Ning_Xia_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "598406", "Price": "$50"}}
