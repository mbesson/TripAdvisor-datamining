There was a few problems with the pressure and temperature of the shower but we got our hair washed none the less.

The rooms we stayed in contained three single beds, which were comfortable and fresh towels were in the cupboard (no additional cost as previously stated). The breakfast was basic and self service - a choice of cereals, toast, rice crackers, fresh tea/coffee and fruit juices. Internet was available in the reception area, but wifi was free throughout the hotel (again, not just on the ground floor as previously stated). Rooms were accessible using swipe cards, which also controlled access to the hotel entrance. We did not experience any excessive noise problems from other guests. Close to supermarket and tram lines, very central location. Vending machine in lobby sells tins of beer for E1,5 or softdrinks. Overall very satisfied with our stay and would reccommend to friends.

I have stayed in budget hotels and hostels all around the world (20 countries) and this was by far the nastiest, dirtiest place I have ever stayed in. To start off with, it is in a shady area of Amsterdam, though it is convenient by tram. It was easy to find, and we were buzzed in fairly shortly after we rang to be let in. The check in area is tiny. Teeny tiny. Our room was past the check in area, so anytime we came and left we had to squeeze by them, if there was even room. We walked to our room and noticed that all luggage storage was directly in front of our room (and the other 4 rooms around there). There was no one watching it, so if I wanted to steal anything it would have been very easy. DO NOT PLAN TO LEAVE YOUR BAGS HERE. Inside our room, I was completely disgusted. It was filthy. The front desk had told us \"Smoking is forbidden in you rooms, this is very important\". Well, our comforters were filthy (actually covered in dirty) and covered in cigarette holes! There were spiders and other creepy crawlies throughout the room, cobwebs everywhere, and the shelf in it was covered in dust. The carpet was coming up all over the room, and was literally taped back down with lime green tape. Needless to say, the carpet was the dirtiest carpet I have ever laid eyes upon. I never walked on it with bare feet. The bathroom was also very dirty. It had a certain grunge to it that I just cannot put into words. The shower did have hot water, but the water pressure was so low I could barely wash my hair. This was the worst I have ever been ripped off by staying at a hotel. It was seriously gross, and I would honestly suggest just sleeping on the street before going to this place.

The main positive is that it is a reasonable walk to the charming, concentric Jordaan canal district. I needed a basic rm for the night and this was it at 45 euros. This is a depressing property with a sour smell of smoke lingering in the hallways. Surprisingly, the bathroom was in very good shape- in sharp contrast to the the room itself (# 3) which looked like someone had just been evicted. I didn't hear too much noise so I slept as well as I normally do when abroad. There was reasonable internet and even Skype service at a single terminal in the Reception area. Reception shuts down at 11 pm-ish so it is essential you remember the Front door code that they gave you. I didn't make it to Breakfast or the common area; I would heartily recommend that you take Breakfast outside the hotel (there is an attractive bagel shop several blocks south on the way back towards the Damrak).
