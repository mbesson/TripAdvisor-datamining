Had a great time chilling out. Great facilities for the price - good mirrors for checking my guns out with a cheeky flex, loads of plug sockets so I could use my hair straighteners and electric body hair remover while listening to a bit of Jimmy Somerville. The gym was ok but it didn't have enough mirrors for checking my guns out with a cheeky flex, although it had an excellent ambience for yoga and meditation. Overall a solid choice (but not as solid as my guns).", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Geem1985", "ReviewID": "UR135869125", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for one night as we were had a meeting at a venue nearby. It\u2019s a very short distance from the Tetuan metro stop and just off quite a busy road with lots of shops and cafes. Despite being so close to a busy road, the area is very quiet and we slept with the window open all night without being disturbed. Although it\u2019s not in the city centre you can get the metro directly to Sol by walking a short distance. If you\u2019re staying a few days, buy a 10 trip ticket for the metro as this works out much cheaper. When we went it was 1 euro 50 per journey or you can get a 10 trip ticket for 12 euros. Our room had a small living room and kitchen with a separate bedroom and bathroom. The shower was fantastic and really refreshing after a long day out in Madrid! Breakfast was fairly standard and not included in the room price, but at 7 euros it\u2019s not that bad for the convenience of being to eat in the hotel. It was a continental breakfast but there was a lot of choice. The real highlight of the place was the friendly staff who spoke excellent English and really seemed to go out of their way to be helpful. I would happily go back again.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cvery good\u201d", "Author": "LunaRussa", "ReviewID": "UR135538133", "Content": "I was in Madrid for 6 nights with my boyfriend.

Its very clean, beautiful and has an extremely wonderful and helpful staff (which is a very good plus point especially if u r traveling with a child). its a great value for money option and is better than even some of the 4* hotels u come across in Spain.. only thing is - theres no porter.. so u have to carry all ur luggage by urself.. but all in all its a fantastic experience.

There was a small countertop stove, a medium sized refrigerator, windows that open, nice bathroom, microwave/toaster, and all of the kitchenware you need. The neighborhood it is located in, Tetuan, is safe, especially on the major streets, and you see old people walking around loose bags casually even at night. It is a stone's throw from the metro stop which will take you anywhere in Madrid with free line to line transfers and there are plenty of grocery stores around (Opencor (open late), Mercadona, and smaller places that sell Frutos Secos, one is literally right in front of the hotel). If you're on a budget this is perfect, cook up some eggs, throw in some cheese and ham and toast some bread, buy juice or yogurt drink and you have a decent breakfast. Buy some cookies to snack on (rebuenas or Principe) and you can get away with only eating out once per day (or just cook some pasta for lunch or dinner.) Tv has like 50 channels some in German, French, couple in English bunch in Spanish. This shouldn't be important though! (well, I did watch the Europa League Final Porto v Sporting Braga). The front service is great, they even printed out a couple of bus tickets I needed when I asked where I could go to print something. Very polite and caring. I didn't test their English because I speak Spanish but I'm sure they know it if they're working in a hotel. Wifi code changes everyday, just call them from your room or go downstairs and they'll write it down for you. I read that some people complained about noise at night in other reviews but we were never bothered and slept like babies. Walls are sorta thin but it shouldn't be a major problem. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone and would stay there again without hesitation. I paid around $480 for 5 nights (no breakfast).

I would say this hotel is definately not luxurious but is clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate. We had an airy bedroom with a very comfortable bed, a clean bathroom with plenty of hot water and a living area with table, sofa, TV and small cooking area. They was also lots of wardrobe space: my boyfriend and I had a wardrobe each! We had to pay a deposit of 20 euros to get a key which unlocked the cupboard with the kitchen utensils, which stuck us a a bit daft. The TV was on the small side and we found ourselves with only CNN and Eurosport to watch, but since we'd come to see Madrid this didn't matter. The hotel was situated a metro ride out of the centre of Madrid, but it only took ten minutes to get the centre and the metros were cheap and frequent. It took less than 5 minutes to walk to the nearest station, Tetuan. There are bars, restaurants - mainly spanish or chinese-, (and, bizarely, lots of banks) near the hotel, but be prepared to speak Spanish, as we found few people spoke English ( not that they should have to - its just that, of all the capital cities we have visited, we've never had to use the native language so much!). The area around the hotel wasn't especially pretty, but it felt safe and there were plenty of shops and supermarkets.Madrid itself is nice but not \"wow\", although there is some outstanding artwork to be seen.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dorset, england", "Title": "\u201cwell located friendly place\u201d", "Author": "mimisasab", "ReviewID": "UR7970990", "Content": "we stayed there for 5 days in February 2007 , my husband, myself and our 2 year old daughter.
