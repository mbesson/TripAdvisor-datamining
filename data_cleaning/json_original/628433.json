It was without a doubt one of the most spacious timeshares and lockouts we have experienced over alot of years. The facility is beautiful and meticulously maintained. We were on the fifth floor of tower five, overlooking the lazy river, which was a great view. The airport nearby was a non factor for us. We were particularly impressed with the maintenance throughout our building and we loved the fact that we got a complete housekeeping service without additional charge at midweek. In fact, we discovered if we left our towels outside of the door and notified housekeeping, they would replace them daily at no charge. The lazy river and the swimming pool make this facility into a wonderful resort. We must have been there during spring break for many families, as there were loads of children of all ages at the resort. If you didn't know you were in Vegas, you would have thought you were in the Caribbean, Hawaii or any other tropical island. There is a barbecue center adjacent to Tower 5, with five or six immaculately maintained , built in stainless grills, two built in sinks, and numerous tables and benches that were well used by the guests. I must comment on the staff at the resort, because my husband contracted an acute intestinal virus while we were there, which required him to go by ambulance to one of the hospitals. The staff was so helpful and did not leave our suite, from the time we notified them of the situation, until the ambulance departed. Anything at all that we needed was taken care of at once. My only criticism of our unit was that the lighting was somewhat low, especially in the master bathroom, and the furniture probably needs to be replaced at some point soon. Some of it appeared to be a little worn, but it did not prevent us from being extraordinarily pleased with our entire vacation at Tahiti Village. Also, it is no more than ten or fifteen minutes from the strip, to which we drove often. We did use the shuttle service to the strip once, but preferred to have our own car. There is ample on site parking and a large parking garage, which is probably a necessity in the summer. We look forward to returning to this time share and would certainly recommend it to others.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "york, sc", "Title": "\u201cTahiti Village\u201d", "Author": "jriceyork", "ReviewID": "UR126914541", "Content": "We stay at Tahiti Village, Las Vegas at least every other year.

Tahiti Village is directly off of the 15 on one end of the strip near the airport. That means you can either get in your car and drive straight down the strip to all the action OR skip around it completely by hopping out onto the 15, then coming back in at whichever exit gets you the closest to your destination. If you don't have a car with you, staying at Tahiti Village and cab'ing it in to the strip every day could get frustrating enough that it might just be easier to stay at a hotel that is serviced by the light rail line. As a quick example, cab'ing it from TV to the Wynn which is on the far other side of the strip was $25. That is about as expensive as it will get for you, even on a Saturday night. Ok enough about the location... Tahiti Village is not a classic hotel with small rooms and bathrooms, it is a time-share property but you can still rent the rooms and stay there like a classic hotel (TIP: if you have friends that own a timeshare there, they can get you an awesome rate if they book it without using up their time share points). The rooms show some wear and tear but for the most part are on the bigger side and comfortable. If you like a good value, TV will feel like a solid place to stay; if you prefer the pristine fancy feel of a place like the Wynn, Tahiti Village might feel lacking to you. We stayed in the Bora Bora suite while we were there; it was a comfortable size, the steam-shower was a very nice treat and the kitchen came in handy when we ordered some late night pizza and had it for breakfast the next morning. As I mentioned the rooms do *feel* a bit older; the pullout couch in the living room looked older than I thought it should have and we still had an old-fashion CRT TV in the TV cubby in the living room (while our friends had flat screens entirely in their room). Like I said, very minor things if you are just looking for a comfortable place to stay for a good deal, but if you have a good coupon for a nicer place on the strip OR prefer a cleaner/fancier place that has all the blind of Vegas with it, you will want to stay elsewhere. Tahiti Village does have two restaurants on-site and an awesome pool (very big and a sand beach section of it), but it was a cold weekend so we never gave the pool a chance. The restaurants are walking distance as well as a Denny's which is right next to it which is great for some cheap/tasty breakfast. Overall a solid visit; we would easily go back again with our friends and use it as a hub for our activities in Vegas. If I was taking my wife back for a romantic \"movie-esque\" Vegas experience with all the glitz of the silver screen, I would blow our retirement and stay somewhere else; just depends on what you want. TIP: Parking can be a pain because the parking right up against the hotel is limited to a 100 spaces or so which can overflow during the weekend so you need to park at the parking garage a block away. Not that bad, but if that type of thing annoys you, just be aware of that possibility. TIP: There are some pretty nice discounts available from the concierge for popular shows in Vegas that we missed until the last day; so if you are thinking about a show, check with them.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taunton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice for the Price\u201d", "Author": "leftyg", "ReviewID": "UR126807092", "Content": "We stayed here for a week for a girls birthday getaway.

Check-in - grade F Similar to other reviews the check in process set a terrible introduction and tone to our trip. There were 3 people at the desk milling around and nothing seemed to be happening. Two agents were helping one family and the other two were trying to get security down to let people in their rooms as the card programmers weren't working. When we did helped the woman didn't listen to me, just processed items and managed to make us a key. At least the bell desk was doing a great job which kept us hopeful. Bell desk A+ They grabbed our luggage which included a car seat and a few bags. They also had received groceries and a package on our behalf earlier in the day. Our bellman took us to our room where our key didn't work. He tried his and it opened the room. Both televisions were on patio door was wide open. Otherwise looked unoccupied but very suspicious. We had 3 security guards come to the room to investigate. We insisted on another room (not 100% confident that the front desk gave us the right room to begin with) - and this room was empty and clean. Service other than the front desk proved to be solid through the remainder of the trip. Accommodations - B Layout was excellent but rooms were worn. Very quiet, my husband who is very noise sensitive was impressed he didn't hear anyone beside or above and didn't hear the planes. Location - B Loved being partially off-strip and close to outlet malls for additional food options. Also was a quick walk to pick up our rental car. Pool - A Great pool set-up which was part of our choice for this stay - however we had terrible weather and only got to use it one day. Food options - B+ Convenient to have Denny's handy for breakfast; Tried Tahiti Joes but only stayed for cocktails as we found service poor and food overpriced. All in all - reasonable stay; not sure if we'll return.

My friend is an owner at a sister property so he did an exchange to stay at Tahiti Village...something he's done the last few times we've traveled to Las Vegas. Take note, this is NOT a hotel...it's a timeshare condo community. However, due to the economy, timeshare sales are way, way down, and the facility has just as many people booking rooms for a hotel type of stay, if not more, than it does from as it does from people exchanging their time or owners enjoying their purchased 1 week or 2 weeks or more. Time and time again, I am very impressed with the outdoor grounds and landscaping. They are always maintained to absolute beauty and have been every time we have stayed on the property. The Lazy River is truly the eye piece the property. It's relaxing but also very fun, and it's heated. However, if you travel during peak times (like June through August) or any major holiday weekend, the place will be packed and getting lounge chairs and just space will be difficult. This is true of ANY hotel or resort in Vegas during this time, though. Over the years, we have been disappointed in seeing such dramatic increases in the exhange rates, and the difficult of booking a room. Given we pretty much always vacation in early May knowing full well there is nothing major going on in May (kids are in school, summer is not evern close to starting, and there are no holidays for anyone), we are getting frustrated in the diffculty in securing accommodations during the off season time. Right now, as of March 2012, we still can't book a 2 week stay for May 2012, due to the supposed limitations of exchanges available. This is so sad. Meanwhile, the daily rates to stay here as a non-owner (for example, anyone wanting accommodations as a hotel stay off the street) are so high, it's not even worth consisdering. Shockingly, these accommodations are immediately avilable!!! But not for exchanges??? Ridiculous, really. We are dissappointed that what used to be so easy to book via exchange is now very, very difficult. And the exchange fee has really increased so much. It's alsmot as if Tahiti is trying to discourage owners and exchanges in favor of being able to charge anywhere from $140 and night and up to \"hotel\" guests. I understand the property struggled (and still struggle) in this economy, but come one. The whole point of timeshare ownership is being able to exchange and stay in so many places via Interval International around the world.

Finally, upon checking out early in the morning, there was no \"express checkout.\" There also happened to be a fight during the night and there were remnants of the fight strewn about the building and main lobbies.

We booked through retail, not timeshare. Sorry this a long review but hopefully helpful. PLUSES Check-in was fairly easy. We were in tower 5 on the 7th floor, non-pool side. The floor was fairly quiet but got busier toward the weekend. We had no issues with loud neighbors. Room - We stayed in the Moorea (smallest room) and it was just fine for the 3 of us. Water pressure in shower was great and hot water was not a problem. Flat screen tv's were nice and we even watched a movie on the dvd player one of the nights. Shuttle - Shuttle ran like clockwork every half hour and the drivers were awesome! I wish I had noted their names to acknowledge their hard work. Grocery shuttle runs Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8 am. It was a nice convenience and driver even dropped us at tower 5, which was far from the entrance. We also took the shuttle to Fremont Street (need to book this but no charge), which ran 3 times (5, 7 9 pm) on Tuesday and Wednesday. Housekeeping/Maintenance - we had to call three times for different reasons and were very happy with both housekeeping and maintenance. On the first night we arrived, the fridge was making this whining noise in the middle of the night. We called and they arrived in less than 20 minutes and fixed the problem. We had the same experience with housekeeping, ordered towels and more tp and you would have thought they were waiting in the hall. The items arrived in record time! Pool and Lazy river - wonderful relaxing time no matter your age. Pool was a little too cold but lazy river was the perfect temp. The sand beach at the pool had quite a few kids and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. Chairs were not an issue. MINUSES To be fair, I do have to note the minuses, not many but important to note Concierge aka Timeshare Reps - we had to book our Fremont shuttle here and was immediately given the timeshare sales pitch, which we were trying to avoid. My friend already had a timeshare elsewhere so really wasn't interested and I also wasn't interested. The rep asked if we wanted to attend a show in exchange for the presentation and we told her we only wanted to book the shuttle. She asked my name and continued her sales pitch. When we got her to end her presentation, I asked again it she had my name down for the Fremont shuttle for 3 people. She said \"yes\". When we showed up for the shuttle 2 nights later, they did not have our name. I should have known she did not write my name down. it's 12 letters long and she didn't even ask me to spell it! Shame on you, Denise!!!! Thanks to the other reps on duty Tuesday night, we were able to resolve the issue and did get on the bus. Other guests - this is not so much a reflection on the hotel but more of a beware to other guests. We experienced many rude guests especially on the shuttle. We usually arrived 15 minutes before shuttle was to leave and other guests pushed and shoved to get on first. Some were loud and obnoxious to other passengers and also the driver when he told them no alcohol on the bus. The hot tub is also open 24 hours and is occupied every one of those hours, mostly with guests drinking and having a good time. This did not bother us as our room was far away from the area but might bother others. All in all, great family resort. We would definitely stay there again.

The manager sat with me and helped me plan out an entire day of treatments for all of us. She even gave us a free foot scrub! I had the best massage and facial, and all of us were very pleased with our treatments. This really was an excellent choice for our trip. The only negative thing for us was that there was no free wifi, but if you can let go of being connected, you'll have no problems. And the only other tip I can give is plan to take a lot of taxis, or do a lot of walking for the shuttle. They drop you off in two places, but for us, walking around in heels and the weather being chilly, we wound up spending alot of money on taxis and limos. I definitely loved this place and would absolutely return!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIt Took A Paid Upgrade\u201d", "Author": "MarilynBB", "ReviewID": "UR124404903", "Content": "We exchanged into Tahiti Village smaller lock out unit but paid on arrival to upgrade to the larger unit with balcony and are so glad we did.

Here are some of my major issues with this resort. 1. They spray a coconut flavored spray into the rooms after they're cleaned. This scent gave me a major headache and made me sick to my stomach. I had to check out three different rooms before I found one that was tolerable. In other words, I finally found a room that's likely been sitting vacant for the past week to let the spray dissipate. Even the bellman agreed with me that some of the rooms smell really strong. To make things worse, the windows in the \"kitchenette\" rooms don't open so no option to air it out. I was told by the front desk that I should call ahead next time to ask them not to put the spray in my room. Why do they put this toxic stuff in the rooms anyway - I've never experienced this in any hotel I've ever stayed in before. 2. The bed did not have a bedspread. When I asked at the front desk she said \"oh yeah, we run out of them sometimes\". What??? I called housekeeping on her recommendation and they said they would bring one up to me. That was 6pm last night - still waiting for it. We slept with two sheets between a pilled blanket last night. 3. There is no wireless connection in the rooms. They will rent you an ethernet cable for $5 and $10/day in your room. Haven't looked for where the connection is, but I'm guessing it's in the bedroom which isn't very convenient - ethernet cable, I don't even remember what those look like! Supposedly there is free wireless in the lobby, maybe I should hang out there with my 2 year old to check my messages. Sounds like fun! 4. They have tiny old-school televisions squeezed into cabinets in both bedrooms and then still charge $12 for a non new-release movie. 5. There is no cleaning service if your stay is less than 5 days. Yeah, I'm on vacation and picking crumbs off of the floor so that this place doesn't look like a tornado hit it! 6. The mini-fridge does not have a freezer. What's more, I was under the impression when we booked that we had a full kitchen. Probably not their fault, but we've been eating microwaved dinners on a coffee table. The only \"dining area\" is a bar with tall bar stools - not very kid friendly unless you like falls from tall objects. This \"kitchenette\" has a mini-fridge with no freezer and a tiny microwave. Nothing else that a normal hotel room wouldn't already have. 7. The bathroom leaves much to be desired. The bath-tub was shockingly small and I had a hard time getting the plug in the bottom. While my daughter thought it was a fun game before her bath last night I was less than impressed. 8. The view out of our room was a huge neon sign advertising the neighboring hotel - it flashed... all night... I have to say though that the staff have been very nice when I've talked with them. Even though most things haven't been resolved to my satisfaction at least they're nice telling me \"no\". The bed was comfortable, but we didn't sleep well. Maybe because the A/C unit blows directly onto it. Since you can't open the windows you need the A/C because the temp is in the room is 75+ degrees otherwise. Also, I like that I don't have to walk through a casino to get to our room. In future we will choose a suite in one of the nicer hotels on the strip (for $150/night in the middle of January we pretty much can have our pick!) and brave the casino for a room with more ammenities (daily maid service, a jacuzzi tub, better t.v., etc.). This is a TIMESHARE by RCI, so be aware of that before you book. I had stayed at RCI timeshares in the past and was very impressed so assumed this would have similar ammenities. Clearly they put their money into the lobby (which is pretty nice) and their pool area (going to check out the pool... it's supposed to be heated... we'll see), but their rooms are very pedestrian and not up to par with their competitors on the strip.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kumar389", "ReviewID": "UR123305292", "Content": "Stayed at the royal tahiti room with my family and my friends family on 26/12/11 ror 3 nights.

I called the front desk and someone came up and fixed it within 5-10 minutes. I stayed in the Morea suite and was excited to see a mini fridge, coffee maker, and toaster. The fridge was turned up too high and my milk and fresh veggies froze but I did get use out of the coffee maker. The whole time I was there, the weather stayed about 60 degrees but I still had a great time in the hot tub as well as the lazy river- which was equipped with plenty of inner tubes, lifeguards on all sides, and complimentary towels. The shuttle service was a main reason I ended up booking this hotel. I was thrilled to find out it picks up every 30 minutes, despite being the off season, and stops first at the NY NY casino and then at The Mirage. This really worked out great for me (especially when I forgot my camera and had to go back to the hotel to get it). I was disappointed, however, that the last shuttle leaving the Strip is at midnight and the only way back after that is an expensive taxi. The restaurant service was slow but the lobster bisque was amazing. When I wanted to take my leftover soup, the waitress offered to fill the to-go container with fresh soup, and she waited til the end of the meal so it would be fresh. That was very nice! Finally, I must speak about the Internet service. DO NOT RELY ON DENNY'S, next door. I brought my computer to Denny's during breakfast. I could not get anything. All websites gave a server error and when I finally got on one site it died the moment I clicked on anything. In the hotel, the Internet is $10 for your whole stay if you use your laptop in the main lobby only. If you want to connect in your room it is $10 per day. Since I believe this is a bit of a rip off and I only stayed 3 nights, I chose not to use the Internet. Despite some of the small issues this is a very nice hotel and I had a great time and experience. This was my first time in Vegas and I plan to visit again. If I choose not to stay on the Strip next time, I will highly consider coming back to Tahiti Village.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha", "Title": "\u201cHappy to be Time Share Owner\u201d", "Author": "MariMac", "ReviewID": "UR121324703", "Content": "We are proud owners of a 2-Bedroom Unit at Tahiti Village, and remain been happy we are.

The check-in was quick ...no lines for us. We had a bora bora unit. When we walked in it felt like we were the first people ever to stay in there. The suite was impeccable. I own timeshare in Atlantic City and I have stayed in many resorts, but here the rooms are way better than any place I've visited. The bathroom was the room needed first after the very long flight from DC to Vegas. We were happy to see the humongous bathroom with double sinks, jaccuzi tub, shower and even a dressing stool. And all this wasn't crammed together. Believe me the baths are spacious, for a one bedroom accommodation. We needed and extra blanket and were brought a set of two within minutes of asking. We had read a lot about the washer dryers not working, but we found everything to be fine. There's just a mode where it uses seven wash and rinse cycles, you don't want that to be on. So check the settings. The dryer works fine. The king size bed was super comfortable. We slept like babies each and every night of our stay. The bedroom had a nice big hdtv and the living room had the old box type set. The decor was in keeping with Tahitian style both inside the bedroom and in the lobby , hallways everywhere. The pool area was overcrowded but still neat. The lazy river is awesome. We arrived on afternoons and never had to pay for the floating tubes. They provide towels there.We wre on a higher floor so it wasn't noisy at all. There was no sound from the a/c unit either. I used to cook full meals on some days but the exhaust was so great that when we would come back from the strip at night there would be no smell of food. Always get an extra room key because one of ours stopped working on day 2 and you don't want to waste your precious hard -earned vacation time standing in a line at the reception for a key.

LOTS of shopping close by with the Premium Outlets to the south and Town Square to the north. The resort is nicely equipped and the suites are spacious. However there were a few issues encountered during our trip that I feel must be accounted for. My in-laws gave us a week here as part of their time share exchange and we could only book the smallest one bedroom mini suite as it was Veteran's Day weekend and there was a big fight scheduled at MGM. So the cost would be the same regardless of what size room/suite we booked, but no big deal, we just needed a place to call home for a few days. Check in was fast but upon arrival into the room, I immediately found on a towel in the bathroom, a 2 inch FAKE FINGERNAIL that had broken off someones finger. Gross factor: medium. Okay, fine, I can get over that. I took a shower later that night and found myself in ankle deep water because after removing the stopper, I found the drain to be 98% full of hair and other nasties. So not only am I wallowing in my own washed off dirt, I get to splash around with backed up hair/soap/boogers/etc. Gross factor: high. I called the front desk to report this and was told that maintenance would take care of it. Okay, no problem, we'll go out to the Strip and come back and the problem should be fixed. Got back a few hours later and tried the drain: YAY! It drains fast now! Gross factor: back to medium. My wife goes to use the toilet, peeks in the trash can, and sees hair/soap/boogers/etc which came out of the previously clogged drain. Okay, it's a trash can, so Gross factor: medium-high. But wait, what's that next to the drain garbage? It looks like two or three of our green plastic knives that we had brought with us and had stored in the kitchen with our food and other items. Funny, I don't remember eating anything in the bathroom...wait a minute, did the maintenance man unclog the drain with our knives? Wait, a minute...that means he went to the kitchen to find something to unplug the drain, went through our foodstuffs on the counter and decided that our green plastic knives were the proper tool for the job? Gross factor: EXTREMELY HIGH! Needless to say, this was the last straw and we didn't want to stay in that room anymore. SO the on duty manager offered us a credit to the restaurant for our troubles, and initially did not even offer us to change rooms. It wasn't until we threatened to pack up and leave did she offer to move us and reluctantly offered to upgrade our room to the bigger one bedroom suite (which I thought was unavailable in the first place). So we took the room change (which technically wasn't an upgrade because it would have cost us the same anyway) and moved down the hall. The new suite was nice, almost 900 square feet, and had a jacuzzi tub, with a steam shower. The bathroom had two sinks and the kitchen was nice a spacious too. The living room had lots of room too so my daughter and two nephews had plenty of room to run around in. There was also a balcony to go out onto and view the Strip from which was nice at night. We stayed the weekend of 11-11-11 and we counted at least 23 weddings here at Tahiti Village, and the pool looked very nice too! Too bad they closed the pool at 4pm though. Parking is a little inadequate with the overflow parking a little distance away, but not too far. Subtract the grossness of the first room and I would give this place at least four stars out of five. The larger suite was absolutely fabulous and we wish we could have stayed there our entire trip. Alas, the ick and gross factor DID happen to us there, and I think management was a little slow to do the right thing, although they eventually did. The housekeeping manager came up to the room and retrieved the fake fingernail to investigate whose it was but I never heard anything back. The maintenance manager called me to apologize for using our personal items which was unsatisfying, but at least the effort was made. I would like to say that I would stay here again, but I just need a little time to get over the first room experience. I will say that the disparity between the small one bedroom suite and the large one bedroom suite is very large and you would be very wise to do your research before booking.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLas Vegas Convenient\u201d", "Author": "JohnP13", "ReviewID": "UR121122636", "Content": "We stayed at this \"resort\" for a week and ran the Las Vegas Marathon.

Although this is a time share resort you do not have the pressure of having to purchase one unless you want discounted tickets to shows/dinners. Better off saving your time and buying them at the discounted ticket booths on the strip. We came with our two small children and stayed in the smallest suite (Moorea) because at the time of booking our reservation they didn't have any other rooms available but a month later at check in they apparently had plenty, but wanted us to spend an extra $40 a night to upgrade to the larger room (we opted out). The sofa sleeper for the kids was horrible. I just about fell right through it when I went to sit on it after making it for them the first night. You could hear and feel every spring in the bed. There is no way an adult could have slept on that bed. The bathroom was showing obvious wear & tear (we were in the newest section) and wasn't very clean, the carpet was FILTHY. Do not wear white socks or they will be black in a matter of minutes. The sink was missing a drain plug, and there was no dishwasher like they told us when we booked it. No washer/dryer either and the laundry facilities on site just happened to be getting remodeled and were not available during our stay. The shuttle service is nice, and was very prompt. Don't be a minute late or it will leave without you. It does run every half hour. They have added extra shuttle stops (Fremont St. and I believe Hoover Dam) you have to sign up for them, they are first come, first serve. The pool area is very nice, but the kids who are lifeguards can be \"Nazi's\" at times. They don't really like to work and when they have to go watch people in the pool they act as though it is such a daunting task. Most of the time they are in there little Tiki Hut playing cards. The rooms seem to be pretty well sound proofed, we rarely heard anybody around us unless they were running down the hall. The McCarren airport is practically next door, airplanes take off every 2 minutes can be annoying and loud at times, but you get used to it. Parking on site sucks. They tell you to try and park \"in the curve\", but half of the curve spots are for unloading/loading only or handicapped. Which only left about a half dozen to park in. Your only other option is the parking garage which is as far away as possible. The parking is free. However, there is NO elevator near the parking structure so your left carrying all your luggage/groceries, etc about a half mile to your room. You can get a dolly/cart, but then have to utilize a bell boy which costs you more money. I'm sure we will stay here again sometime (if we bring the kids), as like every hotel/resort your likely to run into some problems here or there.

There is a Denny's and another restaurant onsite if you don't want to venture out to eat. There are also two malls close by with lots of restaurants if you don't want to go all the way into town.

I do enjoy my time while staying at the resort. I agree with some of the other comments on here that some of the employees tend not to want to wait on customers- no issues with checking in process. I will say its not all the staff members but only a few. There are staff members who are very cognicent of you standing in line and are prompt in helping with great customer service. Its hit or miss if you are there outside the normal check in times especially in the late evening. The concierge has always provided us great and friendly customer service. Two issues that I have is 1) they charge for internet in the rooms and 2) each of the last two times that I visited there were mechanical issues with the rooms. In one case the door would stick trying to enter the room and you have to forcefully push your way into the room and also the cover panel to the microwave lost its adhesiveness and began to hang outward. Ok, if you are staying here without a vehicle then you will need to consider taking taxi cabs. Especially, if you plan on staying out after the last shuttle returns for the night or going to an area where the shuttles dont. I took a cab from New York New York back to the resort and it ran me approximately $13. Rates were .20 per 1/13th of a mile beyond the base fee ~$3.50- $4. Available shuttles run on a schedule and there is no guarantee that you will be able to get on. We seen in two cases where the shuttles were full and the drivers called for an additional shuttle for the remaining passengers. Pool side- VERY NICE FEATURE TO THE RESORT.

It seems like they only hire people who hate dealing with customers. The front desk staff was rude and seemed like the only thing they wanted was for us to go away. All we wanted to do was check in too, its not like we were being finicky or snobby. That was the first thing that I noticed. The rooms were great. Very clean, nice, and we had a great view of the strip. Other rooms didn't have this. The view of the lazy river/strip was replaced with empty dirt lots. I can see how this would affect your stay, but it isn't that big of a deal. The shuttle service was great. On time and friendly drivers that made the experience great. There were a few times when we got to the shuttle only to find it was completely full. We just sat on the bench only to be told that they were scrambling another shuttle to take the overflow right behind the regularly scheduled shuttle! This happened twice and both times I was pleasantly surprised. The only down side is that the last shuttle pick up on the weekends is around 1:45AM at the Mirage. It seems like the shuttles should run later since it is, after all, Las Vegas. Which brings me to my next point. The freaking pool closes at 8PM. 8PM? Its VEGAS. Not South Bend, IN. Things should stay open super late. People like to party. The pool was very well lighted and would have been amazing to be able to stay in it later than 8PM. The Gym was awesome. I expected to have to pay to use it seeing as how they nickle and dime you for internet and computer access. But it was free. Luckily our room was right around the corner from it. So it was an easy thing to do in the morning. Great for exercising out the previous night's overindulgence in both food and drink. The location is kind of bad. You can see the strip, but its far away. Being an objective reviewer, I would say that if you want to be off the strip, its great, but for us, we will be staying closer next time. Its perfect if you want a quiet getaway after spending some hard hours on the strip. Its also super far away from Freemont St. We really wanted to go to Freemont, but never had the time/money to take the shuttle, plus another cab. A shuttle that just dropped off at Freemont would have been awesome. I also noticed that they had nice HD TV's, but the cable was SD. It made the picture look really weird. It was annoying. It made me appreciate my HD TV at home though. We had a few bets in on sports games and were following them while getting ready and stuff, and it was tough having to watch it on the weird distorted picture. Call me snobby, but I'm used to a sort of luxury. lol. Overall, I probably wouldn't stay here again, but you have to keep in mind, I'm a 24 year old guy. If I had a family and wanted a quiet retreat, then this is exactly what I would do. Also, the staff's hatred towards customers will really get you ready for what Vegas is all about.

I searched for a place to stay with the best pool for families, and this was it, hands down. full points all around. We are really appreciative of the off-strip location; the shuttles and taxis worked great for us and the pool and peacefulness we found at tahiti village made it totally the right choice for us. the facility is lovely, and the illusion of a tropical location i actually really convincing. if we had been able to smell salty sea air and/or flowers, we would have believed it totally. our checkin was quick and friendly, took approx 2 mins and all our requests had been met. the room was even ready early, which I was not expecting. Nobody spoke to us about timeshare ownership, which was great.the information was available if wanted, but we did not have to deflect any sales advances. thank you. went straight up to our room, which was immaculately clean and in order. we stayed in a moorea 1-bdrm jr suite, 580 square feet. plenty of room and comfort for the four of us. kitchen has cups, glasses, bowls, toaster, fridge, microwave -- enough to prepare snacks, cereal, light breakfast. the bed was large and very comfortable. the sofa bed in the living room was quite adequate; of course the grownups preferred the big comfy bed in the bedroom, but I slept a full night in the sofabed at one point, and was perfectly comfortable. we did not need more blankets that we had, but it wouldn't hurt to have an extra few in the room. another thing that could be added to the room is a small broom, since we were unfortunately tracking in a bit of sand. we appreciated the safe, iron, hair dryer, corkscrew. a kettle would be good, and some more coffee for the coffee machine would be nice. straight down to the pool! the lazy river was warm, not crowded, and wonderful. We were in it every day from 5-6pm, when it closed. My kids would have run down to be there if it opened earlier in the morning, but it opens at 10 am for what I think are sensible reasons: quite a number of lifeguards are needed to watch the pool, and before 10 am, the swimmers are mostly families with quite small children, not yet ready for the lazy river. the floatation rings are $5 each rental fee per day, but we were not charged at the end of the day, depending on how close it was to closing time. towels are warm and fluffy and plentiful at both pools. the main pool is large, warm, and has several shallow areas, great for kids, and a sandy beach. we spent every morning in it from 8:30-10. lovely. the hot tub, also appreciated. there was a movie being set up on the friday night; we were too tired to stay and watch, but it seemed like a fun idea. I don't think the movie planned was age-appropriate for our kids (6 and 9), but this was not an issue for us since they were done for the day anyway. we watched only a bit of TV, the kids appreciated cartoon network, teletoon, and pbs. the convenience store had all the bases covered; enough to get some fruit, coffee, snacks, beer, wine, souvenirs. the staff was very nice. we find it really appropriate that housekeeping comes in only on request or if you are there a week or longer. we had plenty of towels and everything we needed to manage ourselves without having the room made up daily, which I frankly find wasteful and unnecessary in most places. the only thing I would have asked housekeeping for is some more (and possibly stronger?) coffee, and/or coffee filters. the shuttle worked perfectly for us. we rode it to the strip 3 times to different locations, and found the drivers to be very nice. on the one occasion that there was an overload, the driver called right away for a backup, which came just as promised within 5 minutes. They might consider a system to manage the wait for the shuttle; it is hard for people to know who was there first, which could potentially get stressful for some guests, since the boarding of the shuttle kind of happens willy-nilly. We took cabs back from the strip because our children were tired (and/or dying to get into the pool). they were easy to find at all strip hotels, efficient, and cost approx $15-20 for the trip. fair enough. same cost as the trip to/from the airport. the concierge arranged a car rental for us with budget for our last day; we swam, packed, checked out, and were picked up at 10 with all our bags by a budget van driver, who took us to the budget location, where they set us up. We were underway by 10:45, which I think was quite reasonable, with all our bags in the car. We drove west to red rock canyon, which is amazing and an easy 30 min drive out of town, then came back to town and parked in the self-park at the mirage to visit the tigers and dolphins. When it was time, we dropped the car off at the airport car return, then onto the shuttle and zoop! to the airport. easy. btw we did notice planes flying over tahiti village, but it was not excessively loud or problematic. I think anywhere in vegas you can hear planes flying over at some time of the day. we were at tahiti joe's twice and denny's 3 times. the pizza and nachos at tahiti joe's were very good and generously sized, as well as reasonably priced. the burgers and grilled cheese also got good reviews. the beer and wine were very reasonable, and the margaritas we had we delicious. we did receive separate checks for the bar items vs the food, but this was not a problem for us; the food server simply relayed our orders to the bartender, who brought the drinks and checked on us. Really good value in the pizza/nacho/burger end of the menu. Denny's was staffed with really nice people, and the food and value were good, especially if we targeted the pico de gallo on the menu. The kids loved the pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Quick, efficient, and very, very nice staff. thank you. overall for us: the location off strip was a plus. the pools were amazing. the room was clean, comfortable, large, and well appointed. the service we received was quick and friendly. we had a fantastic experience at tahiti village and will definitely recommend it to friends and family. thank you.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sierra Vista, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cJust ok.\u201d", "Author": "plgross", "ReviewID": "UR119434816", "Content": "Nice place to stay.

We wanted somewhere that had the \"suite\" feel - kitchen, living room, bedroom because we had our young daughter with us. We got the standard Moorea room. The bathroom: One sink/vanity cabinet - where are you supposed to put all the traveling toiletries? The shower head let out a stinging strong spray that my daughter couldn't even stand under, the pressure was so strong. I can imagine the plumbing maintenance! Every time the next door occupants flushed toilet or ran their shower/sink - you could hear it loud and clear. The room itself: Carpet was filthy, dishes were only rinsed, lamps burnt out. The TV channels sucked. Not even Disney channel - who doesn't have Disney Channel? Hotel: You pay for everything! If you're in the Moorea room, you don't get a washer/dryer. The laundromat is on the 9th floor of Tower 5. If you are in Tower 2, you're out of luck. Fridge is a mini fridge (its a mini kitchen). Internet access - if you are an Owner you can get the USB internet port for $25 a week, if not its $40 a week. The Business Center in the main lobby wants a $25 hold on your credit card even if you use their computer for 2 minutes. Basically if you are not an owner, you pay 5x more then an owner. Cookie making activities cost $5 per kid for 3 Safeway cookies, duncan hines frosting, and some toppings. Lots of old/handicap people stay here. The place reeked of handicap type smell. Nothing against them, but the disinfectant or cleaning solutions they use smells up everything including the activity room and fitness center. The staff was not friendly. Answer your question, and just move on because they have no time. The parking was horrible. Just to get to our room on the 2nd floor but parked in Tower 5 we went down two long hallways. Stairways not accessible. I am going back to the Hilton. Staff nicer, their deli/Starbucks, activity center, fitness center are better. They close pool and mini mart later (hello, cause this is VEGAS!), the rooms are HUGE with a separate shower/jacuzzi, full size kitchen, Disney Channel, clean clean clean! Ohh and for all your timeshare owners - I don't about buying Tahiti Village. The RCI and other places especially in Hawaii hotels are run down under the Tahiti Village ownership. Pictures are deceiving. I know because I live in Hawaii and visit the neighboring islands frequently. They do not looks as awesome as the pictures.

It was soooo nice to hop on and off and not worry about dealing with traffic and parking fees. The facility was very clean, the pool area was large with one area being sand beach which was especially great for children. The hot tub area was separate and open later than the pool area. There is an additional pool which is a lazy river of moving water enjoyed by using tubes to relax on the water. It was a special treat especially in the evening when less bathers were using it..

We stayed in a Moorea suite and it suited us fine as we only ate breakfast in the room and the small fridge and microwave were perfect for us. These rooms have no stove, dishwasher or washer/dryers. I did do some laundry on the 9th floor of Tower 5 and the facilities were excellent. Several washing machines ($1.50) and dryers ($1.25) and vending machine for detergent and also a coin machine if you need to get change. Laundry room was very clean as were the machines. You can also ask the housekeepers for laundry detergent and they will give it to you. We went to the pool every morning when it opened and it is very clean. Lots of loungers and you can have as many towels as you want. My ONLY complaint about the hotel was at the pool and that was people letting the gates slam! I know, not the fault of the hotel, but it would have been nice to see a sign on the gate reminding people not to let it slam. After 50 or more times it gets really old! End of rant. We never used the BBQ area but every morning there were staff working very hard to clean the grills. The staff at this hotel seemed to always be hard at work. It is very well kept. We actually saw a housekeeper pull the stove away from the wall in one room and clean behind it! The hotel itself is quite large and it took us awhile to get our bearings--we often used the wrong door to get to the pool or parking lot! Even though each tower is fairly large the elevators always came promptly. There is an on-site shop for anything that you need. The local papers sell out quickly but there is a paper box outside tower 2. The shuttle to the strip was fantastic. It takes you to New York, New York or the Mirage. The shuttles run every half hour. It is about a half mile to Town Square where there is a Whole Foods Market. Lots of restaurants there, too. Nice mall. There is a roof top patio on Tower 5 which has a great view of the strip at night. We took our wine up and watch a lightning storm one night. The Las Vegas Premium Outlet Center is right across the street from Tahiti Village. Lots of shops and 2 food fairs. Also MacDonalds and IHOP. The room we had was spacious enough for 2 people. The bedroom was separate from the living area with a well-proportioned bathroom in between. The A/C unit was in the bedroom and blew right onto the bed but it wasn't too loud and we never shut it off. It didn't keep us awake.

We even found out that there was an shuttle provided 3 times a week for a grocery run at no cost to us! No need for walking to the nearby store as others complained about in their reviews. Actually, the shuttles are understated! They not only go the strip every half hour, but if you ask the front desk, they have grocery runs, but also trip to places like Freemont Street, Red Rock, and I think maybe even Sam's Town. Be sure to ask because these have limited seating and you must sign up for them before they fill up! The only thing that could use improving is the BBQ area. We found that they were pretty dirty by dinner time, and a few of them were almost impossible to light. We had to wait for someone to finish there cooking to do ours because we could not get the open grill to light. Not a problem, just an inconvenience.

We decided to stay at a timeshare resort so that we could alternate between the excitement of the Strip and the relaxation at the place we were staying. The Tahiti Village did this almost to perfection. We stayed in a large, one bedroom unit with a full kitchen. It was outstanding. Lots of space, well layed out and nicely furnished. The view from the balcony was not the best, but we weren't there to sit in the room anyway. As nice as the unit was, it was outdone by the pool area and lazy river. The pool was the largest and most beautiful I have ever seen, with tropical landscaping throughout. There was also a hot tub in a separate area, and one end of the pool was a walk-in sand beach. The lazy river was a nice change of pace from the quiet of the pool area. I must qualify my idyllic description a little bit due to the conditions at the end of our ten-day stay. Some kind of competition was scheduled in Las Vegas during the last three days of our stay. At this point, the number of people at the resort increased by about 50%, and the number of children and teenagers must have doubled. This made the pool and lazy river areas much more crowded and noisy. We would have preferred the calm of the first week of our stay, but even the more hectic period was enjoyable. The resort had an extremely nice grill area that was well maintained by the staff and heavily used by the guests. Free parking was available on site, but most guests were satisfied to use the shuttles that left for the Strip every 30 minutes. There was also a short morning trip in a shuttle to purchase groceries, although that was one of the least relaxing things we did all week. The resort staff was very attentive and friendly, and the common areas were always being cleaned and maintained. The only negative during our visit was the absence of a reliable (and free) Internet service. Hopefully, this will be added in the future. We went to the strip nearly every night, eating at a lot of good restaurants and seeing many great shows. We can understand how circumstances can cause people to not enjoy their stay at any resort, but it seemed to us that most of the guests were having a great time.

The Shuttle to the Strip ran every hour. 3. The pool (open till 10pm daily) and lazy river were great, although only a max of 4 foot deep. 4. Facilities in kitchen. 5. Size of rooms. 6.

We had to ring House Keeping to get room cleaned and bedding changed. 2 Sofa bed wasn't very comfortable. 3. Had to wait for 2 hours for room to be ready. 4. Suspect many guests came from LA at weekends. Hotel got very busy and noisy. Seems to attract different kind of guests at weekends. No other Brits at hotel when we stayed, Maybe of interest info: We used this hotel as a base and spent time in Death Valley, the Grand Canyon (staying in Kenab), Bryce Canyon and Zion (stayed in Springdale). We don't really gamble (we both lost 20 dollars each in NewYork NewYork). Our son thought all the rides in the Casinos were great. Circus circus had the best rides along with the Stratosphere.Best deal on the Strip for us was the buffet in the Wynn. Absolutely fantastic!! We also hired a speedboat on Lake Mead, cooked an egg in Death Valley (126 degrees) and visited Calico (waste of time as a tourist trap).

This is also a very large pool, lots of room for fun in the sun, and there is also a lazy river. On the other hand, since the resort caters to a wide variety of guests, the pool area is not necessarily family friendly. If you will be traveling with young children, you should note that you will likely encounter a good number of young adults who have imbibed too much and whose language is definitely no suitable for young listeners -- particuarly at the pool area. Also, I definitely suggest you spring for the larger one-bedroom over the smaller of the two, especially if you are planning on cooking your own meals.

We bought back in 2006 before the resort was even built and this was our first visit. My wife and I are firm believers that we go on vacation and travel for the sites, not to stay in a room. However, as owners, we believe we have an obligation to be objective. First the good. Overall, the resort was nice. Great location, off the strip but close enough to get a taste. Great shopping and restaurants within 5 minutes and a large outlet mall within walking distance. The shuttle service was great also and made travelling to the strip very convienent. At one point, we did rent a car and there was never an issue parking at the resort. The airport was very close and we walked to the rental car place. Very Convienent!! The room itself was clean, spacious and comfortable. The pool area was nice and the lazy river even better. Now the not so good. We rely heavily on sites such as Trip Advisor for reviews of resorts we want to visit and after reading hundreds of them, know that everyone has different views, tastes and experiences. When we read reviews, we look for things that are consistently there. With that said, the issues we had at Tahiti Village may not have happened had we been there a week earlier or later. With that said, here goes. We got in to the resort later in the evening. As we walked through the courtyard to the lobby, we came upon the smell of fresh marijuana. We observed two individuals walking a short distance in front of us who were the obvious source. NOT the resorts fault, but set a bad tone and first impression as a family friendly destination. Warning, there is no maid service if you stay less than seven nights unless you are willing to pay for it ($35.00 a day for a one bed room I think) We stayed seven nights and had room service once, half way through. If you want or need anything such as coffee packs, towels or toilet paper, you have to call. Internet service. If you are an owner, you get internet in certain sections of the resort, but not in the room. It was very inconvienent when it worked, which it rarely did. You can however, purchase a router and have the internet anywhere in the city. This was great and worked perfectly, but cost $40.00 for the week. NOTE if you are an owner, tell them and you get it for $25. Again, overall, despite the issues, I would recommend this resort.

My three sisters and I stayed here from June 13-19 and we LOVED it!!!! I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants a quieter place that is still close to the strip but not too busy and crowded. We stayed in a one bedroom (sleeps 4 with the sofa bed) room with a kitchenette. The staff were friendly and helpful if we ever needed anything. This hotel is on the strip but further down, there is a free shuttle that leaves EVERY 30 MINUTES to take you to the strip that only takes about 5 minutes to get there. It stops at New York New York and The Mirage so you can get to all the action very easily. I am not sure why the \"Pharaonik\" user said it only leaves every hour because that is certainly not true. There are two shuttles that leave from each location (Starts at Tahiti Village, drives to NY NY then to The Mirage, then back to Tahiti) every 30 minutes and the pick-up/drop-off locations are at the same spot so it is very easy to find. We never had trouble with the shuttle being too full. The shuttle also runs all day until about 12am, this could be annoying for people who like to stay out late. Also, they have another shuttle that runs on Saturday and Sunday that takes you to a shopping center about a 15 minute walk away. This shopping center includes a Whole Foods Market so if you are planning on cooking you can pick up groceries easily. The drivers were friendly and even gave us recommendations of places to get discounts and transportation tips. I also liked that the hotel is across the street from one of the Shopping Outlets. There is also a McDonalds, IHOP, Outback Steakhouse, Subway, 7 Eleven and a bunch of other restaurants and food places that are an easy walking distance. The hotel also has several outdoor grills that made it great for cooking, but they can get pretty crowded so plan ahead. The hotel has a pool, hot tub and a lazy river. The tubes for the lazy river cost $5 per person but the first day you can use it for free, and the second day we used it it was so crowded they let us use it for free again! I got the feeling they weren't that strict about charging people for it as there were tubes all over the lazy river pool so you could just get in and grab one. Also the lifeguards were mostly teenagers and weren't really paying attention to who was using the tubes. The only annoying thing about the pool was that every Saturday they have a luau in the big pool area, so they closed the pool at 4pm on Saturday and you could only get in after 6pm if you were going to the luau, which you had to pay for. The hotel also has wireless internet (not free). If you want to use it in your room you have to pay $10 a day. However, if you have a laptop you can use it in the lounges for only $10 a week. We opted to pay $10 for the whole trip which worked for us. But there were a lot of people coming up to us and simply asking for the password, which made if you can find someone willing to give you the password you can use it without paying? Plus there are so many things to do in Vegas who wants to spend hours on your computer anyway? Our room also had 2 HDTVs and one included a DVD player. Since we stayed for a week we got room service which was nice. We did encounter one problem when we called about 8am to request more towels, and did not receive them until 14 hours and 5 phone-calls later. Overall however, we loved it and will definitely be staying at this hotel in the future! Here's a quick pros and cons list: Pros: Clean, Friendly staff, big pool, hot tub and lazy river, outdoor grills, free shuttle to and from the strip, wireless internet, close to shopping center, outlets, grocery store and restaurants, not too crowded and very family friendly Cons: Further from the main strip, housekeeping can be slow, pool closes early on Saturdays, wireless in your room is $10/day, internet lounge in Tower 5 didn't open until 10am (frustrating for early risers like me). Note: If you are planning to buy groceries but don't have a car and won't make it in time for the Whole Foods shuttle, there is a company where you can order what you want online and they deliver it to your hotel room. However, their minimum order amount is $85, so its not really worth it unless you are staying for a while. Look on the Tahiti Village website to find the name of the grocery company.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangor, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant surprise!\u201d", "Author": "Mhopstetter", "ReviewID": "UR114768098", "Content": "We have stayed at many of the luxury hotels on The Strip but decided to take a Getaway through Interval International.

If you have small children you will especially like the \"sandy beach entry\" at one end which is not deep. The lazy river is fun and relaxing. They have limited people walking around to take food orders. There is a wonderful grilling area open for everyones use. They have large commercial sized grills as well as tables & chairs in this area. A Food for less grocery store is approx. 1 mile further down the strip or a Whole Foods about 3/4 mile towards the strip. The Whole foods is huge and has a great assortment of pre-made salads and everything else you could every need. There is a small convenience store on site with limited & expensive items if you need something quick & convenient. The exercise room could use improvement if you are a serious weight training person. No dumbbells, just a few pieces of equipment and a universal that is missing lots of attachments. Decent cardio equip., just not a lot of it so there is a lot of demand for it during prime time. Rooms are equipped very nicely. Even the small Morrea side with the mini kitchen has dishes and all your main needs. I do not like the fact that they make you pay for WiFi or the tubes for the lazy river, but overall a nice resort if you don't mind riding the shuttle to the strip or taking a cab.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plympton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, Wonderful worth every minute!\u201d", "Author": "YullieYullie", "ReviewID": "UR113206899", "Content": "Tahiti Village had top rate service.

We decided to stay at a time share place, Tahiti Village. This is 2.5 miles South of Mandaly Bay. After reviewing online, I would say that they lived up to our standards. Check in was quick and easy. The time share people were not pushy at all and simply said if you have any questions to see the Conceigere Desk. The rooms were very nice and clean. It is my understanding that there are only 2 size room, the smaller one and larger one. We stayed in the smaller one but the kitchen was very nice, bathroom large, bedroom set off to the side. Perfect for groups of people as there is a door seperating the living room from the bedroom and the living room has a pull out couch. Everything was key access which is nice. The pool staff didnt complain when guests brought in their own drinks. We were allowed to drink in the pool while swimming as long as it wasnt glass. The lifeguards were very kind and always asked if we needed anything. The lazy river was amazing and the pool staff had no problems with drinks while lounging through the pool. The outdoor bbq area was very nice. I never read anything about it online so hopefully Tahiti will update its page and reviews with this. I didnt take the shuttle service but i heard from other guests that it was nice and easy. Store were easily walking accessiable and while \"off the strip\" a great location. Right across the street from the outlet mall! The area was quite and you didnt hear planes fly by as it was close to the airport. The facility was always clean and the 24 hour outdoor hot tub was awesome! Tahiti Joe's wasnt the best. The food was fine but the prices were out of this world too high! Denny's is at the bottom and well, it was Denny's food at Denny's prices. Our only complaint was half way through our stay the water was being worked on and out throughout the night. However the next day there was no cold water so eveyrthing was scorching hot! We called down to the desk and they informed us there was nothing they could do regardless that we had plans to be somewhere and needed to shower. They didnt even give us ideas besides \"please be patient\". The water never got back to cold before our plans so we filled up the bathtub with hot water and threw ice in it till it became warm and bearable.

It was my first time to LV and we chose the Tahiti Village as we wanted to use our vacation club exchange. We were very happy with our check-in - the gentleman who assisted me was very friendly and asked what sort of view we would like from our room. I chose one of the strip not thinking that we would also be looking directly over the airport! However I can honestly say we did not even notice the airplanes once during our 5 night stay! The rooms are a great size, the furniture is looking tired though. The kitchen is well equipped but as with most American hotels they don't supply a kettle or anything else to make a cup of tea! We had issues finding the coffee and sugar, it was hiding in the perculator! We loved the steam shower - great if you are like us and your sinuses suffer from the change in altitude and drier climate. I found the internet access ridiculous! When in the USA you can get free WiFi just about anywhere - except at this hotel! Not only do you have to pay $10 a day for it, it isn't wireless and you need to get a ethernet cable from the reception desk. Once all of this was sorted out, I then had the issue of trying to find the port to plug the cable into! Turns out there is a small box tucked behind the DVD player that you need to pull out. This is really awkward because you naturally want to put your laptop on a table and there is no table close to this so you have to have the cable stretched across the loungeroom! We finally got all connected up ready to skype with our kids for the first time since being away only to then discover that the connection is too slow so we had a terrible time trying to see then and could only type to speak with them :( The resort is quite spaced out which is nice except when your room key doesn''t work. We were warned on check in that the keys are very sensitive and demagnitize if put near anything like cell phones or credit cards so we were very carefull not to do this. We returned to our room one afternoon with a small window to shower and get dressed to catch the shuttle into the strip to catch a show. Neither of our keys would work in our door so I ran to reception to get this fixed, she said the key were reading fine and it could be the door battery so if the new keys she issued didn't work use the in-house phone to ring and get engineering to come and fix. Of course this was the case and so by the time we ended up accessing our room we had missed our shuttle and needed to catch a taxi into the strip. (btw this is $10-15 depending on traffic and where you are going to). Unfortunately this wasn't the only time we had key issues but the next time we found the receptionist who was on the desk at the time extremely rude and unhelpful. As far as location goes we were happy. The premium outlets are very close by (walking distance) along with restaurants. We had a hire car during our stay and were able to park close to our room each time and you are able to self-park at many of the strip hotels without a charge. My husband used the pool and gym during our stay. There were plenty of lounge chairs around the pool and pool towels are supplied. The gym was on-par with his expectations of a hotel gym.

Location: we were located on the 3rd floor of tower 5 - on the same floor as the fitness center, awesome!

Nice flat screen televisions in both the bedroom and living rooms. DVD player in the living room. The check in process is quick and they give you this little welcome pack with coupons for various Vegas attractions and places to see for free. Cons: The phones are out of date and when you call the front desk, you are put on hold for quite a long time. View was of the parking lot, but considered a small price to pay for the room Wired internet for $10 per day - sort of expensive for something that only one person in one room can use - this is my biggest complaint about this property. The Spa: One thing not mentioned in previous reviews is that this resort does have a small Spa located on the 9th floor of tower 5. They are small in that there is not a sauna or a whirl pool, but they do offer massages and facials for reasonable prices. If you ask around, you may even be able to get a $10 or $20 off coupon. I had Doreen for a deep tissue massage and she was very good. Overall, professional and good value for the money (~$100 for a 60 minute massage and $145 for a 90 minutes massage; deep tissue is $10 more). The Shuttle: Fast, on time. Need your room key to board. Only runs until ~11 pm, so you'll need to take a taxi back if you're out later than that. Cost of a taxi from the strip to Tahiti village ranged from $11 to $22 depending on the taxi cab driver, route, and traffic.

Water in pool/lazy river is slightly heated. Business Center: Consists of 2 computers, which you need a major credit card to even start. Printing is $1/per page, with boarding passes printed free of charge. There is a grocery store, Food 4 Less, across the street on the other side of the strip mall.

Will probably stay there again in the warmer months for a few days.

Everything was clean and tidy and it was a really nice looking hotel. Room: We were in Tower 5 in the far end of the first floor in a BoraBora suite (1 bedroom, full kitchen). Close to the parking garage. We sleep with the fan on so noise wasn't an issue for us. We were pleased with the size of the suite. Plenty of room for a family of four. The kitchen was well appointed and very clean. I wish there was an option for two beds rather than a bed and a sofabed. The kids weren't impressed having to share the sofabed while we had a nice comfy king sized bed. I also wish they had free wi-fi in the rooms, but on the last day we saw a sign that said you could get a wifi stick for $7 for the week. We just went to Denny's a couple of times for brekkie and checked emails there. Housekeeping: There is no housekeeping unless you stay for more than 7 nights, but any time we needed anything I'd just pop my head out into the hall and ask a housekeeper for a couple of extra towels or toilet paper. If there's no one in the hall, there's a number you can call for housekeeping. I wanted 2 extra pillows and a blanket, they were there in 15 minutes. I actually prefer not having people in my room when I'm not there so that wasn't an issue at all. One thing I loved was that there is a stacking washer/dryer in the suite! Security: I felt very comfortable here. There was staff everywhere and we noticed several security cameras around the property as well. Pools: The pool and lazy river were great. They keep it very clean and are always tidying up wet towels and straightening out the deck chairs . Drinks at the poolside bar were a little on the expensive side ($10 for about a 10 oz Pina Colada). There's a sign on the door that says no outside food or beverages, but it seemed as though everyone there had their own drinks so they obviously don't enforce that rule. Shuttle: The shuttle was great - always on time and friendly drivers. It took about 15 minutes to get into the strip and they drop off at NYNY and The Mirage. Car rental: We wanted to go to red Rock Canyon so inquired at the concierge desk about renting a car. They said they had a 'deal' where we could get a 3 day rental of a mid sized car for $25 with unlimited mileage through Budget. Of course when I said \"What's the catch\" they said we just had to take a tour of the property. My husband and discussed it and the concierge promised us that it was very low pressure (of course he would!) and that they weren't the same as the ones we see in Mexico. We figured we were strong minded enough to sit through and not buy a time share so decided to do it. We set our tour up for the last day we were there so he 'pre-gifted' us the car rental (we took advantage of the gift 3 days before the presentation) and took a $200 deposit. We toured Red Rock Canyon, Boulder City and Hoover Dam. We also took the car down to Circus Circus and the Mirage - both had free parking close to the hotels. They gave us all kinds of show tickets, but most of them were for crap shows in the middle of the day so we didn't bother. We mostly wanted the car. Picking up the car was kind of a pain because they use the Budget about 20 minutes from TV, but drop off was quite convenient about 5 minutes from TV. We walked home after dropping it off - maybe a 15 minute walk. Time share spiel: We googled 'How to get through a time share presentation' to get tips on going and not being sucked in to buying a time share. (Lots of funny stuff out there!) We opted for just telling our tour guide, Michelle, straight up that we were in no way interested in buying and didn't travel all that much to make use of it. She was totally nice and said that's okay, but she has to spend a certain amount of time with us so could she use us for 'practice'. No problem as we enjoyed seeing more of the property. She actually did a great presentation and didn't once pressure us. There was a 'try before you buy' option for $5600 for 2 weeks a year for 5 years. Didn't sound unreasonable for anyone who did travel a lot, but it still wasn't for us. We were done in an hour. I think that's it!

While the docter was in the room, I had to excuse myself, because I was sick. Then my new husband got sick and my brother in law.

While we were there, it was a bit cool so none of us really frequented the pool area, but the hot tub and lazy river were used on a daily basis.

First let me describe our experience. We found the CLS shuttle near Baggage claim 16 just outside the door. The round trip to and from TV cost us $16 each. They gave us two tokens with their phone number to call 24 hours before we left. We did and the return shuttle was there on time. It only took 10 minutes to and from the terminal. We arrived at 9PM and the reception person was very helpful. I had read to switch to the new tower #5 and was able to get it. She also explained about the shuttle to the strip that left every half hour and to be on time because they are firm at leaving on time. She gave us a schedule that we used and never had any problems. It took ten minutes to get to the first stop Nw York New York and another ten minutes from there to the Mirage. The shuttle saved us a lot of $$. We had a one bedroom unit with a kitchenette; It had a small frig and microwave which was fine with us. We ate at Denny's each morning next door and except for some watered down orange juice the last day everything was great. The large breakfast kept us going until Supper. Denny's had the free WIFI where we checked our emails and researched Hoover Dam info. TV was very nice and clean. There was a small store where they sold snacks, drinks and clothing. We mostly just got drinks for the frig. The room overlooked the lazy river so that was nice but our friends were across the hall and had a blah view of sand and the airport. Tower 5 was next to the parking garage so if you park there it is close. The outlet maill was across the street from the parking garage as was Outback if you want a chain restaurant. The mall was very big and had all the big names. We didn't go in the pool or lazy river but we did touch the warm water. Being in the 50s during the day it was too cold but others were brave. We didn't eat at Tahiti Joes but it looked OK and has free WIFI as well. We didn't go to any shows but there are ticket discount booths on the street so check them first before paying top dollar. Also, we quickly discovered that smoking is allowed in the casinos and none we found had non-smoking sections like Atlantic City does. So we breathed unsafe air for four days in the casinos but not the restaurants. We ate one night at the Sugar Factory Restaurant in the Paris Casino. It was a soft opening and the waiter said they might be slow but almost an hour later they finally brought us some simple crepe and turkey sliders. The manager apologized and gave us some free food. However the food was delicious so I highly recommend the place as long as they have sped up the kitchen. If you've never seen the Hoover Dam GO! Our friends from LA drove us there and it is spectacular along with the view of the new bridge. The drive is only about 20 minutes from Las Vegas. We also enjoyed Fremont Street with the nice covering and laser shows. Go at night for free entertainment and characters who walk around for picture ops. (tip expected) We had a prime rib buffet that was outstanding. I think it was at Binions. The Cosmopolitan Hotel was beautiful and should be seen. The casino was not our favorite. Probably the MGM and Paris were the favorite places because we won there. Now back to the unfavorable reviews I read before the trip. TV is located about 3 miles south of the casinos on the same road. It tells you everywhere in the literature so don't complain about it. This is a time share place where they also tell you that you don't have everyday maid service. So don't complain about it. The shuttles leave on time so don't complain when one leaves after you get there late. The beds are medium softness. Don't complain if you like them hard or very soft. The parking garage is aways from the lobby but this place is huge. If you go to Vegas be ready to walk. My wife and i lost weight and we ate very well. Some complained about noise through the walls but we didn't hear a peep. People stayed on both sides of us. We didn't have warm weather so we didn't experience crowds like there probably are in the warmer months. If you get a free room or free movie tickets expect either a sales push or pressure when you get the time share sales pitch. No one bugged us at all during our stay. Our friends have grandkids so they can't wait to bring them back for the pool and lazy river. The outside facility looks fantastic.

The view in bld 5 over the lazy river was very nice and the airport noise was almost non existant. The great thing about this resort is that they pick you up at the airport on the car rental shuttle and take you to the shuttle hub ( where all agencies are) which is only about a block from this resort. They supply cellular broadband sticks which is interesting considering they have ethernet cables in the room. The drawback of these sticks is you have to buy them for each computer you are using.

We enjoyed our stay in the two-bedroom unit that was our home away from home. Our experience during the busiest week of the year was far more positive than negative. Check in went smoothly and we were treated in a friendly and courteous manner by the front desk staff and concierge hosts. Our concierge offered a timeshare tour, we declined, and that was the gracious end to that. No hard sell whatsoever. Our unit in Tower 5 (requested and granted) was spacious, clean and everything we had expected from reviewing the floor plan and reviews. We were on the second floor overlooking the BBQ grill area and entrance into Tower 5 \u2026 so this was a bit noisier on New Year\u2019s Eve (late night returnees) but really not a huge issue. The resort is not surrounded by much of anything except the Outlet Malls to the south; so don\u2019t expect much of any scenic view (although many Strip hotels offer views of their parking structure or the casino rooftop unless you are willing to pay a premium). The master bedroom had a very comfortable king bed and the lock-off second bedroom had a queen bed. The master bath was huge and nicely appointed with a jet spa tub and a great walk-in steam room/shower, both of which worked well during our stay. The second bath had a regular shower/tub set up. The main living room, dining area and kitchen were nicely appointed. The lock-off bedroom had a separate sitting room/kitchenette combo. My daughter slept in the sofa bed and said it was not very comfortable (sofa beds generally aren\u2019t that great). But both kids enjoyed 4 flat screen TV units in our two-bedroom. The swimming pools were apparently heated and open, but no one was swimming given the outside air temp was mid-40\u2019s in the day and low-30\u2019s in the evening. Compared to the Marriott timeshare tower next to Planet Hollywood (great location, great units, but terrible pool during the summer), the Tahiti Village pool complexes would be great during the hot summer and could truly feel like a resort. We tried out the gym on the 3rd floor of Tower 5 and found the place clean and decently appointed with 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 recumbent bikes and stacked weight and pulley stations. There were 4 flat screen TVs in the room as well. Wish they offered free weights. Our negative during the stay concerned the stacked washer and dryer unit \u2026 the washer took a long time to wash and the dryer was not that powerful. Parking around the perimeter of the main buildings is very limited and guests are encouraged to park in the multi-level parking structure that is adjacent to Tower 5. It is indeed a very long walk to your parked car in the structure if you are not staying in Tower 5 (and for some it is a long walk depending on what part of Tower 5 you are staying in). . Tahiti Village is just south of the LV Airport, adjacent to the Outlet Mall and a few minutes\u2019 drive to the great Town Square Shopping Center (outdoor \u201cvillage\u201d shopping center with a Whole Foods Mart, many chain retail shops, about 6 popular restaurants like California Pizza Kitchen and Claim Jumpers, and a Tix4Tonight office to purchase day-of-performance discounted show and dinner tickets. Freeway access was convenient and the drive to the center of the Strip ranged from 15 minutes (no traffic) to nearly 45 minutes (New Years\u2019 Eve traffic). A few minutes further south along Las Vegas Blvd is a Food 4 Less, Rite Aid and a number of inexpensive chain restaurants. Getting to the casinos and hotels along the famous Strip will require a car (or cab ride). We did not use the hotel shuttle. Those who like the convenience of a central LV Strip location or who enjoy the late night club/casino vacation that Vegas offers are better off paying for a hotel resort at the Strip. But Tahiti Village fits the bill for families or groups of friends who are looking for space and the convenience of a kitchen and washer/dryer. We all agreed that we would have no hesitation returning to Tahiti Village. Highly recommend reserving a two-bedroom unit to really understand why people have positive reviews about the place. If you only reserve a one-bedroom lock-off, then you are better off reserving a resort hotel on the Strip. We would not hesitate to return again.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "TrixieEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR91162791", "Content": "We stayed for a week in May and loved it.

Anyways after like 15-20 of speaking nicely with the front desk, they finally let me check in. rooms were great! spacious, clean, We had enough plates, cups. they pots were of low quality, yes I know not to expect the good stuff but we tried to make a simple pasta with sauce and it took over an hour to make, and the pasta got stuck to the the bottom of the pot. The dishwasher not so great, but it did the job. the washer and dryer not so much. My friend used it on our last night. The wash cycle went fine. when she switched it over to the dryer it went up in flames. thank good they were all ok. just a bit of coughing and light headed, because of the smoke and intense smell of burned plastic. but what bothered us was that there was no extinguisher in the room and the one in the hallway was LOCKED!!! The staff came up to the room quickly and called the fire department and paramedics. they had to give us a new room for the night because the smell was horrible. I even think it affected the room next to us. My friends were able to get there stuff out but had to be aired out all night. The clothes that were in the dryer were taken and the the hotel staff had it washed and dryed in a few hours. overall I think they handled the situation well, not great just well. They were nice about it, but didn't even offer us a discount on our bill or a free night or anything. The incident did ruin our last night in vegas. We were celebrating a friend's 21st birthday and we had plans to go out to a club, but by the time all was solved it was well over midnight and our clothes were not ready and we were just not feeling well to go out. the incident \"is under investigation\" so I have to call in about two weeks to get an update. If I get offer a discount or free stay.I will gladly come back again, I will just stay away from there appliances. other things I like about the place were the shuttle service. It was mostly on time.

The rings for the lazy river have to be paid for but I think they were about $3 for all day. It was well worth getting one and just drifting round the lazy river. Brilliant. There is transport every half hour from early in the morning until late at night and we found that they were more or less on time, which is a remarkable achievement with all the traffic going onto the strip. We were given a lovely room which overlooked the strip and the airport which was brilliant as far as we were concerned. The girl on reception went out of her way to find just the right room for us. I can honestly say that this is the very best timeshare we have been to and we have been travelling twice a year for many years. The staff really were the best. As well as the shuttle going down to the strip there was also a shopping bus three times a week. We were told to be early as it was on 'first come first served basis'. However, when the bus was full they just rang through for another bus. The lady driver on the bus helped everyone on with their shopping and nothing was too much trouble. If you want to visit the Grand Canyon, Sweetours are the ones to go with. Book it at reception. They took two of us there in a 4x4 Land Rover, we had a helecopter ride into the bottom of the canyon and the personal touch all the way round. Best day of our lives ever. As you can see I cannot rate this place highly enough. Every member of staff was the best. We couldn't choose one who was better than another. Well done Tahiti Village - Keep it up, we appreciate it.

The upside is we felt very safe at Tahiti Village. It is a family place - totally. So if you want a place without kids or if you're looking for a romantic getaway, this is probably not the place for you. If you want to party till all hours, you might want a place closer to the center of the strip. For convenience sake, we went to Tahiti's Joes the first night and Denny's the second. My words of warning for both: DON'T GO!!! Tahiti Joe's is terrible TERRIBLE, inedible food, highly overpriced. Table after table the waiter asked do you want to pack this, everybody said no. Word to the managers: get a good restaurant onsite!!! You're too far from center of the strip to have food this bad. Denny's smelled bad - like sulfur, unbearable. I could barely even eat the canned soup they served there. The breakfast items my daughter ordered were no great shakes either. Go to the strip for food!!! The shuttle to the supermarket is nice, except they go at 8am and give you 45 minutes, not much time to get what you need. The shuttles are great for the most part.

We stayed in a one bedroom upgraded. The room in general is very nice; the bed in the bedroom is fabulous; the pullout is Horrible. Plus the louvres on the windows let in light so my daughter was up at 6am every morning. Plus they need amenitites like oven mitts though they did give dish soap and paper towels, lots of extra grabage bags and toilet paper, tissues, etc. We were able to get plenty of bath towels and whatever we needed, no problem. Could be better stocked with dishes, maybe even a blender. The maintenance guys (they replaced our tv) were nice, very responsive, almost too much so because we were exhausted the first night and had no working tv or dvd in the living room and they were determined to fix it.

We booked thru Interval International so I don't know if that made any difference or not. I was told by a friend that the other Towers are really worn down and that Tower #5 was the newest. I did not see into any of the other rooms so I cannot confirm this. Our unit was a 2 bedroom lock-off with 1550 square feet and it was pretty nice. No great view but the balcony was nice to have even though it overlooked an empty lot. The unit had 4 flat screen TV's that were pretty big. Master bath had a stream shower that was wonderful. Plenty of pillows and blankets. Unit was clean except for our nice, new white socks were dirty from the carpets. We had one call from the front desk on our answering machine asking us to take the Timeshare tour and we never called them back because we were not interested. They never bothered us beyond that. We were told that housekeeping would be in on Tues. to clean and they did not show up so I called them for more towels and they had them to us within 10 minutes. Housekeeping came back on Wed. but then only cleaned one bedroom and did not restock toilet paper or dish soap so I called Housekeeping again and they said they would come back on Thur. and they did not. Called again and they finally came on Fri. morning and only cleaned what they had missed but they did restock everything which was very nice. The AC worked wonderfully and was kicked down to 70 degrees the whole time we were there and kept our room cool.

Pool was crowded with kids but the lazy river was not so much. There were floats around everywhere and we were told that as long as we did not remove them from the area that there was no charge. They also had large tan pool towels there for everyone to use and they said you could take them back and just leave them in your room. Any questions just ask. We were scared of going to stay here for a whole week after reading some of the reviews but all in all it was a nice stay. We have stayed on the strip at the Marriott Grand Chateau before as well as the Grandview, Club de Soleil, and Westgate.

A couple of tips: - internet access at Tahiti Village is not complimentary ($9.99 a day), you can either go to Denny's (slow service) or sit in the Tahiti Village front lobby to get Denny's wireless signal. - as noted, Denny's service can be pretty slow but if you have coupons ($5 off if you spend $20 or $10 off if you spend $40 - which can be found in any of the LV booklets) it helps with keeping food costs down - Las Vegas Outlet Mall is a 10 minute walk from Tahiti Village which can be challenging when it 40+ C but there are plenty of good shopping deals there. There are also some good restaurants in the strip mall outside of the actual mall, they are also reasonably priced. - Shuttle service is complimentary at Tahiti Village, on a bit of a side note a 'concierge' from Tahiti Village called us at our home offering us shuttle coupons so we were under the impression that we had to pay for the shuttle...

I was there to have some surgery and it was a great place to recouperate if you can not be at home. Nicer to have the amenties of a condo than a hotel room for recovering. We got a great deal through a timeshare owner so I am not sure it would have been worth paying $198.00 per night. It is well built and we never heard any noises other than children running down the hallways now & then ( and we had to be in kitchen to hear them). The suites had granite counter tops & the full size kitchen was very nice for a timeshare. In the deluxe suite the living room was spacious as was the bedroom & the bathroom. The bathroom in the larger suite had a jacuzzi tub and seperate steam shower. Flat screen tvs in the living room and the bedrooms. DVD player in the living rooms. We had a two bedroom suite which is actually their deluxe one bedroom suite attached to the \"jr\" suite through an ajoining door. The \"jr\" suite does not have a window in the living room or a balcony as did the deluxe. The \"jr\" suite had a kitchenette which consists of a sink, mini fridge and microwave. Beds were comfortable enough but I have slept in better. It is at the south end of the strip and it was nice to avoid all of the strip traffic. To the south of the resort is a lot of shopping and many different type of restaurants. Grocery stores & pharmacies were close also. There were some drawbacks as no place can be perfect. The pool was not deep enough for me. The deepest spot (which was quite small) was 4'6\" and most of the rest of the pool was 3'6\" or less. Great if you have young children but not so great for this adult. It was one of those sandy bottom pools so you do leave with sand everywhere. They have a lazy river that is not sandy but not any deeper. You had to rent tubes for the lazy river if you did not bring your own floating devices for $3.00 per day. There is not maid service daily unless you pay extra for it. They come clean halfway through the week. Anything we needed was brought right away. The grounds were nice. Someone mentioned the parking garage next to some seedy elements but they have either bought this and torn it down or the person was mistaken. On one side of the parking structure was a very large outlet mall. The other side was a field. It was close to the airport but with a CD player that I brought I was able to mask any noise and never noticed while sleeping. There is no gambling on site or smoking inside any of the buildings. The resort has a restaurant Tahiti Joe's. I was underimpressed. It was expensive and not so great. Except the seafood bisque and garlic bread. That was tasty but bread was $4.00 extra & bisque was $11.00.

We've both been to Vegas before and our trip to TV exceeded our expectations. I called the week before we left and asked if they had an airport shuttle to pick you up. They don't (it's about a $20 cab ride with tip to the resort, though), but they do have something going to the airport to do drop-offs during the week for $6 pp. When we arrived our room wasn't ready. We had requested tower 5 since it was the newest. (If we hadn't requested a specific building, we would have been able to get in.) The front desk clerk gave us a key to the pool while we waited and the bell hop took our luggage from us. On I believe, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, they have a shuttle that will take you to the local grocery store, \"Foods 4 Less\" but since we had time and knew jet lag would catch up to us, we took a cab over there and got some snacks and breakfast food for the week (F4L also sells beer and wine). There are cabs outside of TV so you really don't have to wait for one. When we returned the bell hop took our groceries as well for us and we went next door to Tahiti Joe's for a drink. We were too early for happy hour, but the prices were very reasonable for the drinks. During happy hour which is from 3-6 and 10pm-2am they have half price drinks. When we left we were able to check in and went to our room in Tower 5. I had requested a full kitchen with Interval and we were not disappointed. The kitchen here was more updated than my one at home! The room had the kitchen, a big living room, a huge bedroom and a giant bathroom with jacuzzi tub. We overlooked the BBQ area and it was fun to see all the families grilling downstairs. The pool was gorgeous with a \"beach\" on one side for the kids. There are a ton of chairs and umbrellas and I didn't have any problems trying to get a lounge chair. Tahiti Joe's Tiki Bar is at the pool and you can order food from Tahiti Joe's which they'll deliver to you if you want, but you can bring down your own food and drinks, too. The Tiki Bar has frozen drinks served in a 20 oz souvenir cup for $13, but you can bring it back to them to refill for $9. We spent one day at the lazy river which was also a lot of fun. Both the pool and lazy river have lifeguards all over the place. If you want to rent a tube at the lazy river, it's a $3 charge to your room, but we saw people with noodles and their own floats. (You don't have to have one to get in, but in case you do) The concierge was also very friendly. We wanted to spend a night on Fremont Street and they were really helpful when we asked what would be the best way to get there. (it happened to be the bus which is really easy to navigate and was only $7 pp for a full 24 hours). Since I was there with the timeshare I figured I would have to on a timeshare tour, but because I wasn't with my husband (it was girls week) they didn't ask. Because TV isn't on the main part of the strip, they have shuttles for you that pick you up every half half (on the hour and at 30 min) and drop you off at New York, New York, and Treasure Island. The shuttle drivers were also very nice and while we were driving explained how to get from New York, New York to Excaliber and Luxor, MGM, and how to catch the tram at Monte Carlo (across the street) to the Bellagio. For the people who have had negative comments, I'm not sure what they were looking for, but TV was a great vacation and the staff was very helpful in making sure things were easy for you.

The main pool was closed when we arrived due to a hawaiian dinner. The lazy river was refreshing and served the purpose of staying cool when it was 110 degrees. The location is not the best. Its about a 30 min walk to mandalay from the resort. We did not feel like having our brains cooked so we just drove. They do have a free shuttle that runs every half hr up till 11pm from the resort to NYNY. The other thing that was annoying was our room was FARRRRRRRRRRR from the parking garage. I mean it was a serious hike across the complex to the room. The bell boys just watched us carry our own luggage and did not offer anyt help. This blew big time!! Also no free wifi in the rooms was a big turn off. All in all the resort IMO is about a 3.5 star place.

Well when i went to check out they said i owed them money for my stay, mind you i'm in Las Vegas and i did lose alot of money gambling. I told the manager i never knew the payment didn't come out and that i lost money during my stay. She was very rude and very unprofessional and told me to stop trying to get away with a free room. I explained to her that i booked 3 weeks prior and why didn't somone contact me before my stay, and if payment wasn't accepted why was i allowed to check in and stay my 3 nights.

Loved it...and would definitely stay again!\u201d", "Author": "Purduegolf1", "ReviewID": "UR66736920", "Content": "Now, let me preface this review with the fact that we had toured Tahiti Village on the first day ever of timeshare presentation on a previous trip...so we already had know that the facility was beautiful. So, when i booked through II, i was pretty confident that we were going to love the place. Then i started to read some of the other reviews and was a little skeptical. But here are my thoughts. We arrived late (around 11:30pm) on Wednesday night, May 26th of Memorial Day weekend. There was no one in the check in line (of course) so no waiting. The nice lady at the counter had originally put me in a room that she called \"Mountain View\" but i asked if there was anything overlooking the pool. She checked again and found a room on the 6th floor #5610 in the Number 5 building...which was perfect because i read that was the new, nice one. Parking is a pain. The parking garage was the only area that we found to park, but that is a ways away from our room. But whatever. We aren't picky. And we could use the exercise. Took the elevator to the 6th floor and walked all the way to the end of the hallway and our room was on the right. Opened the door and WOW...it was beautiful. Huge full kitchen, dining room table, family room, nice size balcony overlooking the lazy river and off in the distance you could see the strip. The bedroom was large and the bathroom was even larger than i expected. The sinks, a jacuzzi tub which never got used, a shower with a steamer which i attempted to use once for about 5 seconds when i felt like i couldn't breathe anymore (apparently not for me). Then about 2 days later, i discovered we had a washer and dryer too. Not that we planned on using it though. But definitely nice for those that might. Overall the room was FANTASTIC!! We woke up the next morning and were told to go to the concierge desk for a parking pass for the week since we had only gotten a temp. pass the night before. So, we did so and he also gave us a little welcome packet with some coupons to Denny's and Tahiti Joe's, and some other shows and things to do on the strip. It was a nice touch. He mentioned that we could do an II presentation and get tickets to a show for free in return and we thought about it, but the 11:45 time just didn't work into our schedule. He mentioned that the resort was doing a luau on Saturday night and we could prepay and save money. We were planning on doing it because it sounded like fun, but got distracted in downtown Vegas and ended up not going back for the Luau...glad we didn't prepay. The concierge was very helpful and i'm glad he was located right on the first floor for convenience sake. I had read that the BBQ area gets pretty busy most nights...and it was...looked like fun. But never did get to use it. I did wake up one morning and use the workout room and a treadmill. It was pretty big...about 5 or 6 treadmills, weights and a bike. Pretty good. I did use the lazy river on Sunday...i was determined to use at least one of the amenities that drew us back to this place. DH however hates pools and things so i was solo on this adventure. Went down in the late afternoon, around 4ish and i had read that they charge for tubes, but there were lots laying around, so i just grabbed one, threw my sandals to the side and plopped in the water. Went around about 10 times...it took about 45 minutes maybe?? but the one thing which is just a complaint of mine and maybe i wouldn't care in the middle of summer when it is 120 degrees out but i wasn't really in the mood to get soaking wet, just wanted to float around in a circle and relax and there are all these waterfalls and shooting water thingys throughout the route which the kids really seemed to love, but me, not so much. But i just managed to paddle my way around them, hold onto the the wall and guide myself when needed and it was fine. Like i said, i didn't want to get soaking wet, maybe most might like to... But didn't get to use the pool...we did go take a look at it--AWESOME...if we had more time, i would have. But gambling was our main reason for our trip. The location is a bit far from the strip. But we had a rental car so didn't mind. We have learned the back roads to take if we needed to go somewhere faster. But the bonus is it is quiet...didn't even hear the airport noise. We did see the shuttle and lots of people using it, but again, we had the car and didn't need to. I-215 is 1 traffic light away, so very easy to get around. Ate at Denny's one morning. It was busy but convenient. Didn't get to Tahiti Joe's, but wish we had. Overall, the place was fantastic. I'm glad we traded our timeshare for this place. We thought we would like it and we weren't let down. It has everything. Great for families, great for people with cars. If you don't have a car, the shuttle might not work out so well all the time. But at least there is an option. Staff was friendly, grounds were very clean, room was spacious and very nice. I would definitely stay here again...100%!! Thanks Tahiti Village!

There is a $3 charge for tubes, and despite the sign saying that you have to rent them, they told us we could bring in our own. So we went to a nearby Dollar Tree and bought two noodles and drifted around the river. What fun! So relaxing!

The overall facility is amazing and won't disappoint. We reserved through a travel website and aren't time share owners, but that didn't seem to make a difference while staying. Check-in was a breeze and was very quick. We rented a car and it was nice that this resort is litterally around the block from the rental car center. Because we had a car, you have to get a parking pass (even though I'm not sure that anyone ever checks for it since I never put my pass on the dash). This forces you to go to the concierege which is their time-share selling side. I just let them know we weren't interested and was on my way. We rented a 1 bedroom Bora-Bora room. IT WAS HUGE!!! The amount of room was impressive, even for a time-share property. We had a full kitchen with all pots/pans/ect. We did call to get some measuring spoons though. The porch is nice, but we were looking out on a cleared lot. Not the best view, but unless you have a pool view, I don't think you are going to get a nice out side look. The bed was comfortable and the tv's were both flat screens. Bathroom had a ton of space and the steamer in the shower is great. We also had a stacked washer/dryer. Small capacity and drying took forever, but nice convience. Like most long term stay places, you don't get daily maid service. You just put your trash out into the hallway and it get's picked up. We just picked up what we needed from the maids in the hallway if we ran out of something. We were staying in building 5 and were about as far from the pool as you can get here and it still wasn't bad at all. The main pool is great. We never had any problems finding chairs regardless of the time of day we went. The pool was opened from 8am-10pm the entire time we were there except one day. The sand beach is really great and our son loved it. You get your towels from the life guards and just have to show your room key. They also have some life vests for small kids. We didn't use it since my son has his own swimming vest. The lazy river was nice. You pay $3 to use their tubes. My only complaint is that all the waterfalls can get annoying. The lazy river was opened from 10am-8pm every day we were there except one. We ate at Denny's once and it was fine. Denny's is the same anywhere. Service isn't great, but the food was. We didn't try Tahiti Joe's, but my friend did and said it was horrible food, prices, and service. They also have a couple of slot machines there. There is a small convience store on site as well which was pretty well stocked and had decent hours. The work out rooms were okay at best. They have two of them and there were never anyone in them. The treadmill speeds aren't calibrated correctly and won't go very fast. Dpends on what you do. I brought this up, but it wasn't corrected while we were there. I know they have a spa there as well, but we didn't use it. There is a large outlet mall litterally across the street from the resort. In their parking lot there is a ton of choices for restaurants and fast food it you want as well. There are also two gas stations on the corner there. They have shuttles running to the strip all day, but we never used them since we didn't have to. Overall this was a great place and my family loved it. We would stay again.

We travelled with our 3 year old and do not drink or gamble. Check in at around 7 PM took 5 minutes. Staff was VERY friendly. The pool area is great and if the weather would have cooperated we would never have left it. Our only issue was that at 10 in the morning we did laundry in tower 5 and then threw the clothes in the dryer. We did not return till 10 PM and the clothes were gone. My husband did find 1 of our daughters dresses mixed in with someone elses. We assume kids were playing a prank, mixed peoples laundry up and someone did not notice they had our clothes. Naive??....oh well, it was only some kids close that will easily be replaced. Our last 2 days were quite cold and my only suggestion would be that someone in the area carry kids DVD's to rent or to buy. We did not have a car and taxis are expensive to travel around. The village was amazingly clean and very quiet at night. We stayed in tower 1. Most activities are in tower 5 so ours did not have a lot of hallway traffic. The kids activities were awesome. The candy treasure hunt and rootbeer floats for $2 each were a hit. They have lifejackets for toddlers and loads of beach toys for everyone. I can not say enough about the sand beach/pool. I have never seen one like this before. Why everyone does not do this I can't fugure out. A pool will never be the same for us and our daughter will never accept anything less. The maximum depth of the pool is 31/2 feet. The lazy river is subtanitally cooler than the pool because it is more shaded. If your vaction is primarily to have fun with your kids and enjoying wathcing them play then this is the perfect place for you. The shuttle did take us to the strip and we enjoyed walking around. First went to Circus Circus and the Mirage. Extremely disappointing. Not sure what we expected but the air quality was discussting and my eyes were burning within 5 minutes. After that we mainy stayed outside. We were only out till around 10PM but still felt safe walking around pushing a stroller. Lots of others with kids as well. We went up the Eiffel tower then headed back to the village. When I could not find a sink stopper for the kitchen I called and one was brought within 15 minutes. Whenever you passed a staff member they were always very polite and courteous. We never ONCE got asked about anything regarding a time share or tour. Our daughter got a bad cold and fever on our first night and when I enquired at the front desk about a nearby hospital they showed great concern and gave me detailed info. Although we never needed to use it, everytime we went by the desk the lady inqured about her health. It really seemed that they cared. We had a onebedroom and it was all new and very clean. I read the other reviews and can not imagine what they are talking about and how they encountered such a different experience than ours. My only complaint (and not a great one) was the food at Tahiti Joes. The place was practically empty and we ordered steak but still had to wait an hour. For the price it would have tasted better off my barbecue. But in all fairness I am used to grass fed canadian beef and should know that it would not be comparable. We ate at Dennys several times and the food was good. The staff was also very friendly. I felt as though we had stayed in a top notch resort. If you need daily maid service this is not the place for you. We ran out of toilet paper mid week and just grabbed some (with permission) from a cart in the hallway. Everything was as advertised and we knew that we would not be interupted with daily service. It was perfect for us.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marlboro, Ma.", "Title": "\u201cSolid Timeshare Resort\u201d", "Author": "kenrabs", "ReviewID": "UR62427787", "Content": "This was our first visit to Vegas and we stayed at Tahiti Village through an Interval International timeshare exchange. The resort is on the south end of the Vegas Strip a few minutes drive from Mandalay Bay. We rented a car through price line and the airport rental car bay is right around the corner from the Tahiti Village parking garage so once we got the car we were there in about a min. We arrived early and did a pre check in at noon and went to lunch and got a call our room was ready about 1:30 and finished checking in. After visiting the concierge and passing on the timeshare tour we were never bothered by them again. I asked for a room in tower 5 the new section and was given room 5146. It was a first floor room facing the lazy river. I was worried it would be noisy being near an exit door but we had no issues with noise during our stay. The room was a 1 bedroom suite that was spacious and clean and. The furnishings were fine and avg comfort. 2 large TVs in the living and bedroom were nice and liked the breakfast bar and stools that seperated the kitchen from living dinning room. The Kitchen ad most everything needed to cook with nice appliances. There were nice sliding doors to the patio from the living room, but could use a screen slider as well. The bathroom was spacious with a shower/sauna and large whirlpool bathtub and dual sink vanity. The bedroom had a king bed that was ok for comfort but wished they had better pillows. Like most timeshares there is a midweek housecleaning. If you need items before or after the cleaning you can ask housekeeping or call them. We don't make much of a a mess in our room so we passed on the midweek cleaning. The grounds are well groomed and clean with a tropical feel. The gas grillsarea with tables are used often and clean by staff daily. The pools are nice and clean with plenty of lifeguards on duty. My only negatives with the resort deals with the lazy river only open from 10-4:30 and the pool open from 10-8. The lazy river should be open longer and does come witha $3 fee for a tube which you can only use theirs. Also a good number of the pooloungers were damaged and need to be replaced. The hot tub is open 24hours if I do remeber. There was a workout room in building 5 and also an activity room in building 5 with a pool table, fooseball table and TV. Resort kid activities take place here also. Activities have a small fee and we didn't do any on site activities. We did eat in and take out at the Denny's on site for breakfast. It was a good easy option and was well staffed and clean. We did not go to Tahiti Joes the other on site restaurant. It does have some gaming and does have pool drink service huts. Rides from the resort to the main part of the strip range from 10-25 min depending on traffic. Parking on the strip was easy at every resort we visited. We never used the free resort shuttle during our stay. For show tickets there is a Tickets 4 tonight office by the McDonalds after you pass the Vegas sign. If you want discounted tickets for that evenings shows this is a good place to visit. We got Cher tickets for $65 plus $5 service charge. They had a good selection of shows at great rates. Go early as they open at 9 or 10 to get hard to get shows. They also have restaurant discounts. The Hoover Dam is about 45 min from the resort and parking is $7 and tours run about $30. We just walked around and passed on the tour. We had a great stay in Vegas. I found a lot of the complaints about the resort are over blown. The staff was friendly, our room was in great condition. Parking was hit or miss but parking in the garage wasn't that bad. The walk from it to the rooms is a small issue only if you have problems walking and never bothered us. The clientle of the resort was a mixed bag with lots of families especially on the weekend. Check out was quick and easy. They do a $100 deposot on your card at check in and if you need in room internet cost is $40 for the week or $7 a day and you have a $50 deposit for the modem. I would have no issue staying here again. It's a greta place for families and those not wanting to stay on the strip. There is plenty of shopping near by also.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe worst in customer service\u201d", "Author": "Xbebe111", "ReviewID": "UR62315467", "Content": "This place I think it will be good if they hire new people to run this place, my experience was terrible I traveled from maryland and when I got there at 11 pm I was rol I didn't have a room since they were sold out, the girl at the front desk was rude she didn't even bother to look for another room for us, they claimed that all the area was sold out and I was Paying a really cheap rate for them to look for another room.

When I did ask about our room, the gentlemen at the front desk warned me that I may not receive a room with a washer/dryer because I booked through expedia/hotels.com. Through these sites, apparently we're only entitled to rentals, not owned suites (timeshares). I requested a room with a washer/dryer though & my request was fulfilled. Our room was ready about 2pm local, which was great since apparently check-in is 4pm. The rooms were great, we had a Bora Bora room. However I really did NOT like the bathroom. It was like our entire bathroom was a shower. There was no jacuzzi tub, but small price to pay for the washer/dryer. We received a welcome package too when we checked-in. Everything was great, loved the suite. It was convenient to the parkade & lazy river. There is gaming onsite (keno, a couple slot machines, & video poker) until 2am at Tahiti Joes.

The AceGold Bus & Deuce does not run all the way to Tahiti Village after midnight. We had to get off at the Callaway location & walk. It's not that far, but it's unlit & a tad scary. Cabs are rediculously expensive from the strip & despite asking them not to, they'll bomb over to the interstate & go the scenic route. My children loved the pool & the jacuzzi.

This year, we booked a prepaid reservation via Expedia which had an incredible rate. When we arrived at the resort, we were told that they were overbooked and had to downgrade everyone that was checking in. We paid for a 1 bedroom with full kitchen and was downgraded to a hotel room with kitchenette! This has never happened with any hotels we've used in our many years of traveling. Needless to say, we were furious and was a terrible start of a vacation. We're in the processing of resolving this \"inconvenience\" with the hotel's management, Expedia, and credit card company. We suspect that this may be a common business practice with the hotel if you booked via Internet sites. So, beware that this could happen to you. Other than this operational problem, the resort itself is beautiful and an ideal resort for families. There's a major difference between a 1 bedroom with full kitchen and hotel room with kitchenette. Pay the extra and get the 1 bedroom - more space, jacuzzi tub, steamer/shower, double bathroom sink, balcony, kitchen, DR, FR, washer/dryer, ...

The prices are reasonable and patio dining was relaxing and pleasant. We also tried Garden Grill at Circus Circus at the recommendation of another reviewer.

I was surprised that the room had not been cleaned yet so late in the day. I seen many frustrated people in the lobby and talk to one lady that had been waiting already for 2 hours for her room.

I could check back in the morning but no guarantees. I was so unhappy with the room. I called hotels.com where I booked my hotel package. I said that I wanted to cancel my reservation and go to another hotel and explained the situation. They said that I needed to check out and they would then call for my refund. I checked out about 45 min after checking in and got a room at the Bellagio. I called hotels. com in the morning to see how to get a refund from Tahiti village. They called hotel management at Tahiti Village who said they refused to give me any type of refund. I asked if I could call hotel management at Tahiti Village to explain my situation. I was probably on the phone for over 1 hour being passed around from person to person explaining my story. I finally talked to Megan (Hotel Mgr.) who said that she would not give me any type of refund. I said that I understood how I might get charged for the first night but why for the full 4 nights. She said once you checked in you lost 100 percent of your refund. I told her if I had to pay for all the nights that I wanted my room back . She said that she could not guarantee me a room because it might already be check out. I said you are going to charge me for my room even though you rented it out already. How is that fair. She said it was policy and it didn't have to be fairl. They called me back hours later letting me know they could get me my room back if I wanted. They were supposed to call me right back why it took 2 hours I have no idea. I was so irratated by the situation I did not want to go back and ruin the rest of my trip. I did not receive my refund and my only recourse is to let everyone who is thinking about booking a room that hotel management is not customer sevice friendly. If something goes wrong this is not the type of company that is going to work with you. All they care about is getting there money and that is it.

We came to Vegas to attend the MONSTER JAM finals at Sam Boyd Stadium and I purposely didn't want a hotel right on the strip. Just to add also this is my fourth time to Vegas, so I do have some knowledge of the area. Tahiti Village is a great family hotel that is also an excellent value. We stayed in a Bora Bora room which has a full kitchen and king bed in the bedroom. The couch is a pullout also. The room was beautiful and clean with everything you could need. A washer and dryer is also in the room. The bathroom is huge with a tub and seperate shower with a steamer which my wife loved. We had a balcony view looking towards the mountains. A little hint to save some money is get groceries from the Food for less grocery store which is only about a mile south of the hotel. I did this and we stockpiled our kitchen for our stay. It's expensive to eat out every meal and we saved some money. We also had two flatscreen TV's which was nice. Room was great. The hotel/pool was just beautiful and well kept. Everyday I would see employees actually cleaning the concrete sidewalks which I thought was impressive. They do keep it clean. Being from MN we swam in the pool which was great. The sand beach is a nice touch. My kids enjoyed the lazy river. The temperature while we were in Vegas was sunny and around 68-75 degrees. We had some wind the first couple days but it was SUNNY. Check in and out was a breeze. Free WI FI was in the lobby and you can bring your Laptop down and relax in numerous chairs while checking up on computer stuff. You actually connect to the nearby Denny's restaurant WI FI. It worked and beat paying for it in your room. The location was excellent for us as everything is close by. The rental car center where everyone has to go in Vegas is right behind the hotel. Very easy to drop off car and pick up when it's so close. The strip is only about a 1 mile north of the hotel on LAS VEGAS BLVD and very easy to get to. I rented a car from Advantage for 85 bucks for 3.5 days. It was welll worth it and having a car in Vegas to me is a must. For my wife she also liked the location as it is next to the LAS VEGAS OUTLET mall and she spent some time and money there.

For our purposes, the Tahiti Village was perfect. If you're looking for casinos, action and busy nightlife, you won't like the Tahiti Village. We arrived very late at night and upon arrival, the staff were very courteous and checkin took less than 5 minutes. We stayed on the main floor in Tower 5 (the newest part of the hotel) and were a short walk away from the pool and lazy river, both of which were heated to 80 degrees everyday. The pool has a small beach walk-in area which would be perfect for toddlers or young children. The lazy river is lots of fun too -- only about 3 feet deep -- with waterfalls, but it is mandatory to use only hotel-owned tubes, which cost $3/each to rent. There is a great BBQ area with large stainless steel grills, if you're into that. We did not use the BBQ, but the area was busy with others grilling everynight of the week. The accommodations in our suite were first class. We had adjoining suites with living areas in each suite, a king-size bed in each suite, complete kitchen facilities in the main suite with bar fridge & microwave in second suite, 2 queen-size pullouts, a total of 4 flat screen TVs (three 42 inch & one 47 inch) and stackable laundry. All the comforts of home. The beds were phenomenal, there were granite counters & steam showers in the bathrooms and the kitchen had granite counertops and brand new stainless steel fullsize appliances. There was no WIFI and internet access cost $10/24 hours but that did not bother us. The hotel offers a free shuttle to & from the Strip every half hour, which was most convenient to get to the Strip when we wanted to go.

In fact, the Las Vegas Outlet Mall directly across the street from the Tahiti Village would be a teenaged girl's dream-come-true. Very good shopping there.

It comes with utensils, plates, glasses, stove, microwave, full refrigerator, dishwasher, ice maker and washer / dryer (the smaller suite also had kitchenette).

We all had a blast floating around. There is a $3 per tube room charge if you want to rent tubes to float it. Try sharing first. We rented one for each of us, then realized we didn't each need one. We didn't try the pool or bbqs, but they looked nice. The pool has a small sand area with beach entry, and several shallow entry spots that look great for toddlers. There is good shopping a mile away; with whole foods, h&m and yogurtland. It made us feel like we were home in Orange County. I did have 4 complaints about the hotel. 1.

Wish I had known that before I asked for a room close to the lobby. The bathroom - the vanity was awfully small. Only a couple inches bigger than the sink - not a lot of space to place things. Shower was good, though it took a while to get hot water. Oddly enough, there was no desk in the room. I assume all the single rooms are like that.

Once they decided which one of them will check us in, it was fairly smooth. They both could learn to smile a bit even at that wee hours. No bell boy called, we lugged our luggage to 4th floor after walking to the elevators some distance away by the pool area. The room itself was very clean, kitchen very modern and more than sufficient with full stove, fridge, dish washer, dishes, forks/knives etc etc. There was a sofa/queen bed in the living room with a smaller TV. The bed room had large queen bed with a 42\" plasma TV. The jacuzzi in the the bathroom and two sinks, steam shower etc were all very nice. If only the weather was warmer (50s), we could have used the pool area which was full of palm trees. The decor in the entire place was tropical, I liked it. Maid service was only once during the week, although we were told if we dropped our used towels outside our room, they would provide us fresh ones whenever we wanted. We tried to save the planet by not using that. Fresh towels when we checked in and once when they came to clean our home in the middle of the week were sufficient for us.

Make sure you register your car at the front desk so they give you free parking for the week at the premises. The daily shuttle to the strip was very useful and convenient. They stop at 3 diff resorts, it's much saner than driving through the strip. Last shuttle was from Tropican back to Tahiti village at 11:20 pm. Didn't buy groceries on premises as it seemed quite pricey. We bought it a grocery store near by, pretty good. Whole foods was almost walking distance from the hotel. Some nice Mexican restaurants too not far from Tahiti village, the outlet mall almost next door was pretty good. Resort is very close to the airport too which is good. Our welcome package said we could get discount tickets to one of the cirque shows for the usual time share 90 min spheel. I didn't take advantage of it (should have), ended up getting matsuri show/buffet tickets. Matsuri was good (not the Cirque of course!) but the buffet was THE WORST FOOD EVER EATEN!!!

She lured us in by saying the shows we wanted to see while we were there she could get free tickets to and also free meals, etc. All in exchange for just 90 minutes of our time touring Tahitti Village. So we took the tour the next morning. That 90 minutes was more like 3 hours including shuttle rides, etc. When you are shuffled into the conference room, everyone seems real nice. But boy are they pushy, pushy, pushy. The place is very nice at first but my husband and I really could not afford a timeshare. But we felt we would never get out of there and enjoy the rest of Las Vegas if we didn't give in. So we did. The paperwork was rushed through and it was about 1\" thick. There was no way we could have read everything before signing, as it was that part took over another hour. Turns out the contract says you can cancel within 3 days of signing. But once you finish your vacation, get home and settle back in - guess what - more than 3 days have passed. The monthly payments for the timeshare were automatically taken out of our checking account. At the time, my husband was waiting the 2 years it typically takes to get on disability and I had been laid off and unemployed for over a year. So since they were getting their money, we felt no one at Tahitti Village would listen to us or work with us. So I finally was able to cancel the automatic payments through my bank for a small fee. THEN we heard - relentlessly - from Tahitti Village. Suddenly, they are concerned. When I explained that this was a spur of the moment purchase and we really couldn't afford this, the lady said she would tell their lawyers just to let it go into foreclosure then because they were in the business of selling timeshares and not reselling them or taking them back. With the deposit and payments and maintenance fees in the short 6 months we have \"owned\" the timeshare, we have invested well over $3000. We were not asking for ANY of that back. We just wanted to sign the timeshare back over to them. That's all. But they won't listen. So now we have to go through getting served and letting it forclose instead . This whole operation is absolutely ridiculous in this economic situation most people find themselves in and the fact that popular Alan Thicke from the well known comedy \"Growing Pains\" personally recommends this timeshare is very disturbing since his reputation is one of a more wholesome and friendly gentleman.

We own a Marriott timeshare and traded thru Interval to get this place. We thought this looked like a fun place that our kids would enjoy. Plus, for us, Vegas is an easy 6 hr drive. Since we are Marriott owners, we've come to expect a certain quality level wherever we stay. We realize that when we trade we might not always get something of equal value. However, we were more than impressed with the quality of the hotel, the rooms, etc. We stayed in the big 2 bed lockoff room. There was our family which inlcudes 3 kids: 5, 4, 18 months, and my wife's parents. The room was very big, and we stayed in the lockoff portion so the kids could sleep on the sofa bed. The lockoff was very big and comfortable for our family of 5. Only draw back is that it doesn't have a full kitchen (oven). But you do have a mini fridge and micro. The pool area was GREAT! We only went swimming 1 day since it was New Year's week that we went. The main pool was cold, but would be awesome in the summer. Our kids played in the sand area and wadded in the beach and didn't mind that it was cold. Personally, I almost froze my butt off. The lazy river is heated and that was pretty nice. This would be a great pool during the summer when it's warmer. Our kids could spend all day there. The only problem we did encounter were kids pranking our room. The 1st night we got a door knock at 2am and then a phone call since we didn't answer the door. Apparently we ordered sheets. NOT! My mother in law was very upset and spoke to the hotel mgr the next morning and the mgr seemed liked she didn't care. The next day had a blender sent to our room. The 4th night had another knock at our door at midnight. You can imagine our frustration and anger at this point. The hotel had put our room on the DO NOT disturb list cuz someone was pranking us. Yet, service orders still came to our room. Once again we spoke to the hotel Mgr and this time they comp'd us a dinner at Tahiti Joe's. Came out to be about $200. It was nice, but still frustrating get all those late night wake ups, especially when you have small children and an 18 mo old that woke up crying. Over all we had a great stay. We had a lot of fun.

There is limited parking close to the one elevator, but it is first come and goes fast. Unless you stay in the room all the time you will return at times and have to use their free parking garage.

We chose to stay at Tahiti village. We are timeshare owners at Westgate and wanted to stay on the strip. I called Tahiti village twice and condolidated Resorts once to request a room with either a view of the strip, a view of the pool, or a view of the lazy river ride. Although I was told that room requests are not guaranteed I was told by 2 separate employees that it should not be a problem. Upon check in, we were given a room in tower 2 on the 4th floor, view was of a parking lot, Dennys, and a motel that looked a little questionable. I asked if we could be moved and I was told that everything was sold out and to check back. Upon arrival at the condo, it looked nice. The bads: the couch was very, very uncomfortable, the telephone in the living room did not work, the light in the bathroom worked intermittently, there wasnt dish clothes or dish towels to do dishes and the kitchen was poorly stocked. After asking for 3 days, the staff was able to assist us in moving to \"get a view\"... We were moved to bldg 5, room 5360,,, This was the best.. everything was new and updated, the couch was comfy, the view was amazing (lazy river and the strip), kitchen was properly stocked, etc. Outside of the room, the grounds were amazing; beautiful and well maintained. For the most part, the staff was friendly and tried to be helpful, minus one or two at the front desk. The only other minor problem that we had, we were charged $9.99 for some internet thing that apparently works through the tv. Neither myself or my husband used the thing and we were charged but did not use it. I'm not quite sure what happened but my husband was playing with a keyboard and I'm guessing that had something to do with it. The staff refused to refund the charges, if it would have been more than $10.00 I probably would have fought the charge, but it wasnt worth the aggravation. In conclusion, I would definately recommend the place if you could be guaranteed a unit in phase 2, bldg 5 but WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it if you were staying in phase 1, bldg 2", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tstrat69", "Title": "\u201cI would highly recommend Tahiti village to anyone visiting the Las Vegas area.\u201d", "Author": "tstrat69", "ReviewID": "UR46852407", "Content": "-The staff was very helpful -Housekeeping when called was at our room in a matter of minutes. -Def. highlight was having a shuttle to and from strip in Vegas, saves you big money. -Gorgeous place to stay -A++++ rating overall", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sask, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!

The pool area is very nice, and they allow you to bring in food and drinks. No glass, although someone had, and ended up breaking it in the pool. So that was 3 days of no pool because they had to drain, clean and refill it. Some people like to ruin it for others. But I would go back to Tahiti Village again. Great location right next door to the outlets. Very close to Walmart and other shopping. I would recomment this hotel to anyone. Great time. The people who have bad reviews on here dont know what they are talking about. This is a timeshare so like any other timeshare your room doesnt get cleaned every day, only once a week. These are more like condos, than hotel rooms. And yes you may be asked to go to a sales pitch, dont go then. There is no suprise that they want you to buy, so there will be pressure.

It is pretty hard to get a parking spot around the towers of the resort, but there is a parking garage and you can enter Tower 5 which is a short walk. They have security that checks it regularly. They called us one nite to tell us we had left our lights on the car. 3. Shuttles... they give you a shuttle schedule when you check in and it is quite flexible and the wait isn't bad 4. Staff... I read a few reviews that were critical. We found that to be untrue, everyone we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. We ask for extra towels, sheets, coffee, etc. and they were very promt to make sure we had what we needed. 5. House keeping... if you are expecting daily housekeeping you will be disappointed. This is not a hotel/motel. You're on your own, unless you spend more the 7 days and then they come in on day 3 or 4 and clean. If you place the trash out in the hall in the mornings they will pick it up and as i said up above, if you need anything...ASK 6.

What a difference! It cost us $380 FOR A WEEK AND WAS WORTH ABOUT HALF THAT! This was business for my wife and \"leisure\" for me As reported by previous reviewers, the front desk is a disaster and full of the most unhelpful people imaginable. The first bad news...Internet service is $10.00/day. (but our unfriendly (AND APPARENTLY HARD OF HEARING) front desk type told me $10/wk. Are you kidding me? Free Wifi is all over the place in $39 rooms everywhere. After finding out that the front desk clerk had misinformed me, I complained to the front desk manager, and she sweetly offered that if I brought my laptop down to the end of the hallway, I might be able to find a wifi hotspot. Or I could walk a block to McDonalds. (She claimed that the homeowners association was responsible for the current system.) Give me a break. Oh well, the room was very nice. Really, very nice. We go to the pool (which requires a room key to get into) Ask for a towel, towel boy says show me your room card (which is now on the far side of the pool). Dude! How do you think I got in here? He finally relents. Also there is a $3 charge to use the vinyl inner tubes required to float the \"Lazy River\" pool. Next day, go to the onsite convenience store. Ask to charge the $15 to my room. Clerk says, do you have a room charge card? Ummmm no, just a room key. \"Well you need to go to the front desk to get a room charge card\". Hmmm we had to leave a credit card on file for room charges already. Oh thanks for telling me that when I checked in front desk. Would I need one for the lazy river pool? I didn't bother to find out. Well at least they were busy at the spa, robo-calling me every day with an almost unintelligible message about the $10 off deal (but first I need to spend $100). It must suck to be an employee with a talent and have to make dialing for dollars calls. Daily throw-away ads for pizza joints and the like offsite under the door also made us feel very special. Went to the onsite restaurant/bar but turned back in the elevator by 2 parties who both were complaining about service and quality. Maid service MIA one day (the only day we really needed it). Right under the flight path at McCarran, which is no big deal to me, I like aviation and the rooms were very quiet unless you opened the door. It gets noisy at the pool. Come back after 10 one night, and there are no parking places in front of the building, but there's an acre of pavement just 250 feet away. No problem, we park there and the next morning there's a notice on the windshield from \"security\" that this is a CONSTRUCTION ZONE and I can't park there. Excuse me? Where the heck is all the construction going on? I've been here 5 days and there hasn't been a single shovel turned or any other evidence that I could possibly be in the way. The alternative place to park is on the other side of the 25 acre property. You've got an acre of parking within 250' of my room So give me a real place to park or leave me alone with your notices. by this point, I'm so pissed off at the management, I can barely see straight. Out of the 30 or so face to face with employees, about 6 looked us in the eye and greeted us. We're salespeople, we smile at everyone and usually say hello. I even greeted them in Spanish where it seemed appropriate. So now we come to the final straw. They have this TV in the room that also serves as an internet connection if you don't have your own laptop. (For which you had better have brought your own cable.) There is a controller for the TV that looks like a wireless keyboard and it stops functioning properly. It's the only way I have to control the TV and it's very clumsy. Grab it and go down to the front desk to exchange it. Oh No! It's the \"I'm not listening to anything you say\" clerk that checked us in. She keeps referring to the keyboard as \"the internet\" to the maintenance guy. I keep trying to tell her it's the keyboard controller to the TV set, she can't be bothered to listen to me for even 5 seconds. I look around the lobby at knowing glances from other guests. I raise my voice to see if that is going to work and she points to a camera and tells me to stop threatening her. ??????? I assume by threatening her she means expecting service from her. After her little tirade though I'm thinking about really getting in her face. The maintenance guy shows up. She takes him behind the counter in the office (I'm sure to explain to him what an evil person I am). He's great, he's fabulous! And he comes to the room and asks where the TV remote is. TV remote, you mean like an actual TV remote? He starts looking and comes up with one stuffed behind a boom-box on an upper shelf with doors on the front. Nice job hiding it housekeeping, I never would have found it there, Heck I didn't even know there was a boom-box there either. You Rock Jorge!

We stayed in the studio unit side (aka Moorea) and kept the doors between the 2 units open. The grounds and the pools were absolutely wonderful! You did not feel like you were in Las Vegas, the greenery was so lush. The main pool can get very crowded at times and chairs can be scarce, but the mood is very relaxed and happy. Downside: 1) DO NOT LOSE YOUR SAFE KEY OR YOU WILL BE CHARGED $75!! Even though the guest book says they retumble your lock and replace your key, this is not the case. It took maintenance almost 2 hours to arrive at my room, and when they got there, all they did was give me a replacement key. For this key, I was charged $75. $75 for a key????? That's ridiculous!!! 2) Do not assume that all shuttles go back to Tahiti Village. Only one does, and that picks up at Tropicana. We had to wait 20 minutes at Treasure Island for the shuttle, then another 30 minutes on the bus to only be taken to Tropicana, where we had to wait another 20 minutes for the Tahiti shuttle home. Over an hour wait to go back to the Village is unacceptable; I\u2019d rather take a cab and pay the money! 3) The cleaning people came the 4th day to clean our suites, and left the pile of dirty towels on the floor of the master bedroom. 4) Without the other unit having a patio, we would have felt like we were in a cave because the Moorea studio had only one window. The bathroom sink vanity area in Moorea had very little counter space also. I almost felt deprived compared to the sprawling counter space in the other unit's bathroom! 5) The main kitchen was sparsely supplied.

There are 4 washers and 4 dryers and 2 washers don\u2019t work and 2 dryers don\u2019t work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, maintenance/engineering had been notified!!! What is wrong with this picture? You exchange a week and this is what you get. Oh and the main/large pool, I have never seen something so dirty in my life. It was disgusting, we didn\u2019t even put our toes in it! The lazy river was clean and very, very nice!!! Other than the door, the Lazy River was great!!! A huge plus for a family !!!! The shuttle, NOBODY, and I mean NOT A SINGLE staff member could explain the shuttle schedule to you!!!! That was pathetic!! The bus driver got it right, thankfully! (It left early from the strip, thankfully we didn\u2019t depend on it leaving at the scheduled time!) The managers and staff don\u2019t seem to strive for quality at this resort! The concierge, when they give you directions, they don\u2019t give you a map, they tell you what streets to turn down. No sheets with directions. Keep in mind, the \u201cConcierges\u201d appear to work for Member Services, they book tours. They aren\u2019t really a \u201cConcierge\u201d there to give you info about the area. Concierges generally have ample information to give you vs. short answers. I have stayed at some nice resorts and this resort doesn\u2019t get a even one star about the above things I just talked about. Tower 5: if you are booked in Tower 5, expect a lot of walking as you will likely have to park in the underground parking area! The pros: The Lazy River is great, the shuttle is nice (I rather drive, parking is rather easy and less time consuming) and location is wonderful! The unit was nice. The staff at the Lazy River was very nice and would smile at you (hospitality), the shuttle driver was informative nice. The location is ideal, near the strip, near grocery stores, shopping, etc. I can\u2019t say that I would go back. I don\u2019t stay in the unit for much more than to sleep and eat breakfast so too many things stood out in the negative.

If you want to be right on the strip don't stay here, you will be annoyed, but If you are looking for a place where the little ones can enjoy the pool, the adults can drive to the clubs and casinos and the grandparents can take the free shuttle to the Tropicana (which my mom did) you will love Tahiti village!", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano,Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, clean, luxurious, and a great getaway from reality!\u201d", "Author": "karissa70", "ReviewID": "UR38416975", "Content": "This is the second time I had the pleasure of staying here with my husband and our friends.

Our two bedroom villa was actually a split room and we had trouble getting into the second room (the larger side with the full kitchen, patio, etc.). Our call to maintenance wasn't responded to for about 30 minutes and with two hungry (and tired) children, this didn't go over well with any of us. Once we were in the room and unpacked, it was a short walk to the on-site Denny's, which had okay service. I was surprised that the resort did not have free wireless in the villas, nor in the lobby. They basically encouraged guests to use Denny's connection or pay for internet service in the business center. The discounted tickets and planning representative was a nice surprise & I was able to plan most of our family activities right on site. Being in building 5 was an extremely long walk from the lobby, especially after walking the strip for about 90 minutes and exiting the shuttle at the front of the resort. Couple of great things about being in building 5 - children's activities, gym and concierge are all in the building. With one exit, you're near the main pool and gas grills where we fixed several yummy meals. With another exit, you're near the lazy river. My sons loved the man-made beach, the basketball court, the volleyball net and swimming with their new friends. I loved how quiet the resort was and that no smoking nor gambling was at the resort - you could basically have a family trip in Vegas without the slot machines. The shuttle service was a nice touch and kept us from having to rent a car. The bad part about the shuttle is the grocery store run is only 3 days per week and it's at 8:00 am (too early for vacationers)!

Just valet parked at whatever hotel we were stayin at. The lazy river was truly wonderful. The hotel charges $3 per day for tubes, but we never paid for any, as guests who were leaving offered their tubes to guests newly arriving and there were always several unclaimed tubes lying around. We had no problem finding chairs in the sun or shade at anytime during the day. Drinks at both the pool and the lazy river were expensive, but you were allowed to bring your own in a cooler. They did sell small ones in the gift shop for $5.00. We rented cars due to the sheer number of people we had with us, so I can't comment on the shuttle service, but we did see Tahiti Village shuttles on the strip when we went. The vans were large and nice looking. We received a mid-week cleaning, and had no problem having any trash picked up if left outside our door within a few minutes.

Fully equipped kitchen with granite counters and stainless steel appliances. Huge bathroom with double sinks and large whirlpool tub. Nice toiletries included. Bedroom was a good size with comfortable king bed. Living/dining with sliders to patio. Everything was clean except I thought the upholstered furniture while not worn could have used some freshening up. The unit was exceptionally quiet.

There were lots of loungers but needed to get up earlier than we did to find a place with a 'hut' for shade. We were not approached at all for timeshare presentations. Did have some messages on the 'phone to use the spa but nothing else. Parking was a bit of a chore as all the spaces in front of our unit were always taken. We used the parking garage which meant a little walk but not a big deal. Yes, the pool & lazy river are fenced off which requires your room key to enter but we thought this was a good security feature. As well, had to show room key for towels but they would let you have as many as you wanted. My only complaint was that the washrooms near the lazy river weren't open which meant walking to the pool area & remembering to take the key to get back in! Found the staff to be very pleasant. The building and grounds are very well maintained. Lots of people used the bbq area for meals. We enjoyed being a little away from the main strip which was so busy.

First the hotel----we were there on a timeshare exchange. (Please keep in mind that our home timeshare is a deluxe 2 bedroom/2 bathroom premiere unit and exchanging it for another resort is supposed to get us a comparable unit) Entered the lobby and it was very attractive! Couldn't wait to see our accomodations. We requested a non-smoking room as close to the pool as possible. We were given one on the first floor---sounded great, but when we got there and opened the door, we were shocked! It was like a cave---so dark. And not near the pool at all! There was only one window (missing the screen) that opened to the lobby parking lot and had tall shrubs planted in front of it, presumably for privacy. Unfortunately, the privacy came at the price of absolutely no natural light. We had to have maintenance bring us an extra lamp----which they placed on the floor without a lamp shade! Our \"kitchen\" was minimal---microwave and mini-fridge only. The upholstered furniture was old looking and not especially clean. The bathroom was clean, but the tub/shower combination was tiny! Where was the big jetted tub advertised on the website? Obviously in the other (larger) part of the lockout unit we were in along with the stove, dishwasher and washer dryer! So disappointing! We were expecting something far nicer than what we got! When we asked for an upgrade, we were told they were totally booked. Next day a young couple was at the front desk complaining that they didn't want to pay for a 2 bedroom unit when there were just the 2 of them. I don't know who's booking reservations, but they're obviously not doing a great job. Then we went down to the pool and spa to relax---This place is totally locked up....fences and gates everywhere that require your key card to enter. The pool is large and at first glance, beautiful. Unfortunately there is a sand beach entry for children and the sand is not well confined to that area. It goes everywhere and is really an annoyance. There was also about an inch of sand in the bottom of the spa. When I asked if they were going to clean it out, all I got was a dirty look. And forget about bar or food service! There is a portable bar by the pool and another by the \"lazy river\", but no servers. Drinks are $13 for the first and $9 for refills. Available food included chips and ice cream at the bar or a hot dog or nachos at a portable cart....which was out of hot dogs when I wanted one because they're only allowed to have 6 (!!!!) in the cart at a time. And did I mention there are no restaurants in the resort itself? There is Tahiti Joe's just across the driveway and Denny's in the same building and that's it. Tahiti Joe's was horrible! The food was awful, the service was abysmal and cocktails have to go on a separate check because the bar is actually owned by a different company. Concierge service was a joke....yes, they'll book local day trips for you and make reservations, but they also want to sign you up for a sales pitch and when we declined, the concierge became VERY rude and cut off the conversation, even though we were about to ask her to make reservations for us. This place has so much potential, but is a disaster as it is now...I couldn't even get change for a dollar to use the vending machine. And parking?? Horrible! Couldn't get a parking space late one night so parked in guest registration parking and got a nasty note on the windshield and a nasty phone call at 6 am....I guess I was supposed to park on the other side of the resort between Denny's and the fleabag motel next door and walk all the way to my room late at night alone??

My husband and I had taken a tour last year, and thought our children would really enjoy this resort now that the Lazy River had been finished. We had a list of complaints by the end of the week. First of all the main pool was very dirty. I don't know how often it is cleaned, but I did not appreciate floating clumps of hair while I was trying to relax in the pool. Secondly, there need to be more pools for the size of this resort. The pool and the lazy river are way too crowded. The Lazy River is supposed to be for floating around. It was so crowded at times, that it took forever to float around the river just once because there was actually \"crowd traffic\". Thirdly, I thought it was inappropriate for the resort to allow all that beer drinking in the lazy river. It got a little wild on the Fourth of July, with some semi drunk guys acting pretty foolishly while families with children were trying to enjoy themselves at the lazy river. Fourthly, not all the dryers were working in the laundry room, causing a backup. Who wants to stay up past midnight doing laundry during their vacation? Complaint #5: the concierge in building five was not helpful at all when I asked him about the local children's museum. He never made eye contact, and the only thing he could do was print out the directions for me. He was very young and inexperienced. Complaint #6: The gyms need to have age rules posted. On one of the days that I was working out, I saw parents dropping off their young children (maybe about 9-10 years of age), and leaving them there to entertain theirselves. I was there to exercise, not supervise other children who could get injured on one of the machines. Complaint #7:Security was too lax. There were lots of people going in and out of the buildings at night, and using the pool that I am positive were not members or resort guests. How could so many people not have a card key to enter the pool areas or the buildings? Complaint #8 (and final one as well) : The internet access was absolutely primitive. I had noticed several people sitting in one section of the lobby using their laptops. Since I did not want to pay to use the computer in the lobby, I was told by someone at the front desk that I was welcome to use my laptop in that section because that is where you could access the internet from the Denny's that is located accross the parking lot. In other words, the resort was not paying for internet access. Even though I knew it was an unethical procedure, I tried it anyway. The internet was extremely slow. It took me 20 minutes to \"get in\", and it was through Denny's home page. I went an entire week without retrieving my email.

Actually a little nicer than the new ones. (Yes, we did ask to see one of the older suites.) We plan on going back next year and possibly making a purchase.

Tahiti Village is done! The lazy river is in and was the highlight for our kids on this trip! It is nice to have the lazy river close in proximity to Tower 5, which is part of the finished Phase II development. The sandy beach entry in the main pool was still a favorite and my kids made many friends there while building sandcastles. The whole resort is clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. I especially enjoyed the washer and dryer in the new Phase II rooms. They seem much more efficient that the original rooms. It would be nice if the balcony could be extended over to the main master bedroom, but we enjoyed it anyway, just couldn't when the kids were sleeping. The hot tub was nice to enjoy at night and I appreciated the fact that they made that part accessible for adults 24-hours a day. Tahiti Village has also extended their shuttle service with 4 shuttles and now stops at Tropicana, Circus Circus, New York, New York, Treasure Island, Outlet Malls, Stratosphere, and The Orleans. Wiki Wiki is the convenience store located on the property. Prices are fairly good...considering its convenience. Only $3.95 for a 1/2 gallon of milk. Tahiti Village added a spa this year called Manaha. While we did not have any treatments, prices seemed competitive and the spa itself looked gorgeous. One suggestion I have is to either add more tables to the pool area or add more chairs to the barbeque area. It seems that when we were there, a lot of larger families like ours were utilizing this great feature, creating a chair shortage. Only 6 tables were available in the immediate barbeque area with only 4 chairs allotted to each table. No extras were stacked or available, which created tables with no chairs. We tried to eat in the pool area when the barbeque area was full, but there were very few tables in the pool area. One other drawback was we couldn't check out any barbequing tools from the front desk since they were all checked out. It's funny that we barbequed two days in a row and no one we saw there had utensils either. I wonder who had them! Our room overlooked the lazy river and part of the Vegas strip...ahhhh!

In 2008, Phase II was just about complete and opened later that year. Our room was actually located in the new phase, and it was nice to see that several things that were a little aggravating in the older phase had been addressed in the new phase. One of those things is the washer/dryer. In the old phase, it's a combined washer/dryer...one unit...you put the clothes in, they get washed and dryed in the same machine. The dryer worked horrendously...the clothes always stayed damp and wrinked terrible. In the new phase, it's a separate washer and dryer, and they work very well. Since we stayed so long, it was of great help. Also, the a/c was set up better. In the old phase, in the Bora Bora unit, in the master bedroom, the a/c blows right on your face as you sleep, and it blows hard. We always turned it off and kept the a/c on in the living room, and the entire unit stayed cool. In the new phase, the a/c grilles are located better and air circulates better. In the bathroom, the air exhaust works better, too. As far as the property goes, for the first time, we were not hassled with sales reps, or \"owner update\" phone calls. No one called and we were glad! The Lazy River is now open, and boy oh boy, it's the nicest one I've ever been in...better than Wet N Wild and better than Atlantis. There are 5 water features, designed to drench or splash you, but only if you choose. To fully enjoy the river, don't waste the time renting a float. They charge $3.00 a day for the float, but they are bulky, and keep you out of the water. I hate floats in the lazy rivers, and it was so nice to just swim around, every day, and I did. One thing, some of the water falls are really strong, especially the main one, so cover your ears...you don't want water rushing up your ears. Can't say enough about how lovely the \"river\" is. So nice, I never even swam in the main pool. Don't know why, but the main pool water was murky for the entire 2nd week...looked very uninviting. The river was much better. Evidently, Phase III and Phase IV are planned. Land has been cleared, and with the endless tour groups on the property (they are not allowed in the pool areas, though, fortunately), I overheard that 2 more restaurants will be added, in addition to the Denny's and Tahiti Joes, both of which are pretty good. I also saw the full site plan, and there are more pools and water features to be added along with the new phases. We actually requested a few things be in our room when we arrived, like extra hangars and such, and they have a website where you e-mail them and tell them this, but of course, none of that happened. And trying to request a room in a certain area of the property is also a big pain. I now understood what people were talking about when they said there is no elevator at the end of Phase II building, because we stayed in the very end unit at the end of any INCREDIBLY long corridor. We truly got good walking exercise! But the check in process with luggage and some groceries was a huge pain. Parking is tough on the property, but the parking garage was never even remotely full. However, when they add Phase III and Phase IV, parking is going to be ridiculous, so it seems. One note to Tahiti: get rid of that stupid curb in front of Phase II, behing Manor Suites, and put down parking stripes so people can park! As it is, they all jump up the curb and park anyway! Parking is rough on this property with the addition of the new phase, because the parking garage is on one end of the property, and the entrance to Phase II is incredibly far from the garage and other phases. Overall, we still love Tahiti and will return next year. If you plan to stay here, trust me, do NOT get a room on the first floor of Phase II. All the tours walk down the hallway, and it's a mess of people. On the weekends, the pool and pool areas get pretty crowded, too. Not crazy, but crowded enough. And because the gated system to enter the propery and pools requires a key and you open the door to enter, the door then slams shut, so don't get a room near a pool if you don't want to hear it.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at Tahiti Village!\u201d", "Author": "californiadeb", "ReviewID": "UR29669949", "Content": "We did an exchange through Interval International and were extremely pleased with our stay.

We came back at 4pm and had to stand in the same long a$$ line. What was pre-registering for?? They told us to go see the Welcome Center Concierge for our welcome packet. So one lady stopped us and told us to go speak with one gentleman. He was nice and started to give us some coupons and such...Then he said he didn't have everything and that we'd need to go see Darcy for the rest of it. Darcy was nice. She said that as owner's guests we could go take a tour of the facility and in exchange get some tickets to a show. We asked her what show and she offered ICE which she said was supposed to be really good. So we said sure, since we've been on many owner tours of resorts we've stayed at within Interval. She took a $40 deposit for our appointment and said that as soon as we were done with our tour the money would be given back, that it's just a way to make people want to show up. The following day we showed up for our appointment. It was a total cattle call. Our \"tour guide/salesman\" asked us where we were staying, which was weird, we had never been asked that before. We told him at Tahiti Village. He looked at us strange. He took us into a large room where they give presentations. We finally told him that we think we're in the wrong place, that we are supposed to be on an owner's tour, not in the hard sale area. He walked us back down and we were shuffled around from person to person. We finally just said we want our $40 back and walk away. Then they told us that our money would be given back in 3 days. Not cool, that's not what we were told. So one lady said would you like to still get the ICE tickets and we agreed. She said she was going to get a form and came back with Mike. He pretty much said he didn't know what kind of places we've been to before but that's how they operate here. Everyone goes through the presentation. He said in no way would we be getting the tickets and pretty much that we were [--] out of luck for getting our money back any sooner. We told him the kind of review we'd leave for him. Just because of how lousy the staff is there, I really, really wanted to hate this place! I wanted to come on here and completely bash it, but honestly, the facility is so nice it's hard to. The good: Its a new building so you can't hear other guests banging or jumping around as you normally would in other places, the kitchen is very nice, stainless steel appliances, granite counters, large living areas, large tvs in living and bed rooms, lots of lounging chairs at pool and river, the pool and river are nice. The bad: Our view was of a dirt lot overlooking a car rental facility. The only nice part of the view was sunrise in the morning (yes, we were up that early most days). The elevators are in the middle of the building so if you are at the end, it's quite a trek to get to the elevators. Parking was chaotic! Luckily they have the parking garage but if your room is not near it, it's quite a trek too! I really enjoyed that fact that it wasn't in the midst of the \"strip\". It's nice to come back to a quiet, calm place where the bells and dinging of slot machines is no where to be found! We didn't use the shuttle because we rented a car and are glad we did! Most days and nights the Douce (double decker bus) was packed. It was just easier to pick the Block we wanted to hang out around and park at one of the casinos for free and walk place to place. There is an outlet mall right across the street...we never went there. We never went to Joe's or Denny's (on sight). There are so many better places to eat than there, in my opinion. The Palms has a fabulous buffet Bistro Buffet that is $9.95 pp for lunch that is actually super delicious with a great dessert area!

We did not have a hard time looking for parking at the Tahiti Village because we mostly took the Tahiti shuttle bus, and when we did we go for a drive, we were lucky enough to always find an empty spot :). An outlet mall is walking distance from resort. We also liked how Tahiti Village is some distance away from all the lights and noise. Cons: No free internet (very expensive to use at Tahiti Village), and as some reported finding a parking spot can be an issue.

However, let me be one of the few to tell you - this resort is beyond beautiful and do not believe the negative reports. I arrived at 1pm (knowing check in was not until 4pm). I was greeted by great service from workers in the lobby. The woman who checked me in went out of her way to ensure I got the perfect room. She asked what building (new or older) and view (strip, standard, pool, or mountain). I chose Building 5 (NEW) pool view. To my surprise our room was ready!! The woman who checked us in was very personable and knowledgeable. After check in - we went to Tahiti Joes for lunch. I had rented a car but did not know where anything was at and was too hungry to look. The greeter at Tahiti Joes was very nice and took our order with ease. We got 2 burgers and fries meals. Here is a complaint: We waited an hour (no lie) for our food to come (we got take out). Furthermore, Tahiti Joes was empty so I could not understand the serious delay. The staff was nice (I won $20 at their slot machine) but that was it. The food was over priced and only average. For those who rent a car, there are many options (the outlet mall which is right across the street [food court], McDonalds and other fast food joints (all within walking distance (bus ride) and driving. Another complaint (though did not bother me) was the groups of visitors whom were doing tours who were being begged to sign their name on the dotted line to purchase a timeshare - the Tahiti Village team would take them to Tahiti Joes and buy them a drink to get them liquored up and sign their name. Avoid this at all costs if you are doing a tour. The room: I got a studio and let me tell you, IT WAS STUNNING!! This is my 4th timeshare room and this one ranks number 1. The studio is the size of a 1 bedroom (really) - it was huge. I had a view of the strip and pool and could see the sun rise every morning. It was great. The bed was super comfortable and the 2 flatscreen tvs were added bonuses. This room is nice for 2 people (a couple), it is cozy and immaculate filled with tropical illustrations. It does not feel like your in the middle of the desert. Be careful though, the standard rooms overlook a dirt field (I think they call that mountain view) - request a pool or strip view. Another complaint is about Building 5 (though this may be consistent in the other buildings as well). If you have a car, you have to park in the garage which is on property but it takes about 10 minutes to get from the garage to your room. Also, there is a LONG (no lie) hallway from outside to the elevators, it goes on forever. When checking in, be ready to carry your bags, groceries a long way. This is only a minor complaint but for those with mobility issues - it may be problematic. Rent a car or not? YES! For me, the convenience of having a car made my vacation even better. However, I can honestly say, the shuttle service (though I did not take it), was seen on property and seems worthwhile. Driving on the strip in April was GREAT!! I have heard the horror stories but it was not bad in anyway. Yes there is traffic, but if you live in any metropolitan city, you can handle the strip. However, if you are going to an event, you should leave 2 hours early (to drive the strip, park the car and get to your location). Speaking of parking, the parking garages at hotels along the strip are FREE - however, they are just as big as the hotels themselves. I found valet to be best (also free) just tip $1 or $2. The only things in walking distance is the outlet mall across the street and gas stations. It is in no way in walking distance to the strip. However, both the airport and rental car facility are next door. Back to Tahiti Village - the sand pool and wave pool are BEAUTIFUL. I did not get to experience it - the weather was cold during most of my stay but I did get to sit at the pool. The chairs are relaxing and areas well kept. Lifeguards were on duty daily and were nice as well. Get ready to be starred at and get photo ops from tours, they are taken to the top of building 5 for an ariel view of property. Housekeeping: Phenomenal, everything I ran out of was replaced within minutes. I did not get to experience any of the activities offered but many were offered. I tried to do the Red Rock Canyon tour through Tahiti Village but was told it was booked solid for 3 weeks. If you know you want to do any tours offered by the resort, book them as early as you can. The concierge were nice (not the greatest). Watch out: Walking around the property (you will get stopped) to take a tour/presentation. Decline nicely and be on your way. Also, on your 2nd day, you will get a call about a \"Welcome Package\", DO NOT pick it up. It is a trap for a tour/presentation. Also, for those reports about no maid service, this is a timeshare - that is expected. Also, be on the lookout on the strip from other timeshare presentation people, they will stop you in general conversation and try to get you to attend one, just decline and walk away. In the room - there is no channel line up. The weather channel is not very helpful (it is not local). No internet (very expensive); the channels are good (basic cable).

Also, the hotel is far enough off the Strip that kids won't be inundated with racy images as soon as they step foot out the front door.

We hadn't been to Vegas for over 13 years and had no idea what to expect. I have read some complaints about the location and I will say it is not in the heart of the action on the strip but we both agreed that for a family, it was perfect. Most of the hotels on the strip offer parking so rather than march my two young children through the smut peddlers in order to tour the strip on foot, we would simply drive from one attraction to the next. We had driven in our own vehicle to Vegas so we didn't have to worry about a rental or using their shuttles. The room was very nice. There was a sofa that made into a queen bed which sat in a small living room area. The kitchenette had a microwave, fridge and sink and the cupboards were stocked with dishes and silverware for four people. There was a large pantry/coat closet area for storage and a bar with a few bar stools for sitting. The bathroom had two entrances, one from the living room and one from the bedroom. The bathroom was nice and large and you didn't feel at all crowded if someone was bathing or shower and someone was using the sink. The bedroom had a King bed which was one of the better hotel beds I have slept on. Both the living room and bedroom had a flat screen TV. One of the remotes didn't work properly and we had a new one delivered quickly upon request. My husband did notice the airplane noise more than I did. It is in the landing path of McCarran airport but I didn't find it at all disruptive. The property and the pools are gorgeous! There are outside BBQ grills and sinks if you want to BBQ and dine outside. The pools are lovely even though it was quite chilly when we were there. We didn't eat at the onsite restaurant or try the free breakfast but if you go south of the hotel, further down the strip, there was a number of restaurants and good shopping. We did eat at the garden buffet at the SouthPointe Casino one night. It was a couple of miles further south on the boulevard. It was reasonably priced, clean, and worth the money for our family. We were asked twice if we would be interested in a 'tour' of the facility or if we had received the promotional 'gift' to which we simply answered no thanks. Easy as that. I didn't feel any extreme pressure to take any timeshare presentations. There were people touring the facility with hotel employees but it wasn't at all distracting or weird. As a family or just as a couple, we will definitely keep this place in mind.

The Bora Bora had a full kitchen and steam shower while the Moorea had a half-kitchen and a much smaller bathroom. Both types of suites will sleep four (both come with pull-out sofas), but I would opt for the Bora Bora because the larger space and extra amenities (including a deck) are worth it. If your traveling just as a pair and you don't plan to spend much time in your suite, the Moorea is just fine. Both suites come with two large screen LCD TVs and a DVD player.

Wife\u2019s parents are owners. After reading all the negative reviews we were very tentative about our trip and checked in expecting the worst. I am pleased to say our stay was pleasant in most aspects and we look forward to future visits. Service staff were polite and helpful. Rooms were clean, spacious, and well maintained. Large flat screen TV\u2019s in each room and the master bath had a great spa bathtub and steam shower. House keeping does not come in every day, but this amenity was not necessary as we have no problem making our own beds, and besides, they promptly attended to any need we had \u2013 new towels, kitchen supplies, coffee, etc\u2026 they even came immediately to the room when we called about a spill. Our room was on the 8th floor and faced west. It was a busy weekend for airline traffic yet we could not hear any plane noise at all despite being able to see them come in on approach. We were not bothered by any harassing sales calls or sales people. Although I admit they hung around in packs and their were constant tours going on. But again, we hardly noticed, and experienced none of the hassles others have complained about. Now some downers: Although Tahiti Joes is a decent enough restaurant, don\u2019t order any of the \u201cspicy\u201d foods unless you really like HOT. A wired idiosyncrasy is that you have to order cocktails from a separate server and pay a separate bar bill \u2013 that seems strange to us. We brought along the Wii for the kids, but the flat screens are mounted so flush to the walls you can\u2019t slip a hand in to access input terminals. In the end I went to Radio Shack and bought RCA adaptors and then used the jacks from the DVD player on the main TV. The real downer of the place was that the big tower has ZERO internet service. I talked to someone about it and they say their tech company had a problem during construction and they were not expecting Wi-Fi for a while. Denny\u2019s is the only free internet access available. If anyone in your party has trouble walking make sure you get a room close to the elevators, the big tower hallways are football fields long. Being a holiday weekend not much work was happening, but major construction is and will continue to be going on for some time.

We own a week in Rangely, ME, but since we have family in LV, we decided to trade out for this year, and spend the holidays at Tahiti Village. First, I never proactively received a confirmation of our reservation from either TV or Interval. I had to call both of them several times to make sure our reservation was safe. After our arrival with no glitches, I was looking forward to a nice week. We had the Royal Tahitian, which is two separate rooms with a common living room and kitchen. Beautiful suite. The living and sleeping areas were great. We had a bit of trouble with the jacuzzi tub, but maintenance came by and fixed it within a half hour. Pros: - Great rooms (stayed in Tower 2) - Wonderful pool and hot tub area - we swam for 5 out of 7 days during thanksgiving week. - Relatively good and timely service Cons: - PARKING is horrible!!! There is not enough parking for all the guests. This was mostly true on the weekend. During the week it was less crowded. - In-suite Washer/Dryer can handle about 3 things at a time. Even a small load takes 2 hours to dry. - CONSTANT flow of sales people and prospects, even on thanksgiving. - We missed the mid-week housekeeping. Getting our room back on schedule took 3 calls to the front office and housekeeping. Finally, 2 days later, they came to clean the room. - Pizza place flyers under the door almost every day. - Automated phone messages left on voicemail at about 7AM. This left a blinking light on the phone that would wake us up. Overall, I think the management at Tahiti Village does not care excessively about customer service or satisfaction.

As a curtesy, they booked us at TV (the 2nd time we'd stayed there). Our checkin was flawless - I had asked for a room overlooking the Strip in Bldg #1 and they easily accomodated us - 4th floor. We enjoy watching the lights and seeing the planes land at the airport - and even though it seems like we are only a stones throw from the airport - I never heard a plane landing while there - even when we had the balcony door open. The soundproofing in both the door and windows are great. Our guests staying in the lock off unit did, however, say they heard a baby crying in the room next to them one night - but not again. We COULD hear 'muffled' voices through the our bedroom wall - and the sound of anyone running their shower or whirlpool tub - but not enough to disturb our sleep. We rented a car for this trip and never did use the shuttle - although they just started a new schedule. Rather than the TV shuttle taking you to the Town Center Shops - Tropicana - Treasure Island - the new schedule has it taking you ONLY to the Tropicana (every 30 min), then you have to take a 2nd shuttle up the Strip to T.I. and Stratosphere or you can take another shuttle headed to NYNY, The Orleans and then to the Tahiti and Club Soleil properties. So if you use the shuttle - be prepared to make 'connections. Oh, and now you need a shuttle 'pass' that you get from the 'consierge'. While they tell you to come pick up your \"welcome package' that includes this pass - it is just a ploy to get you to agree to another 'owner update'. My husband just went down late in the evening and just asked for the passes (although we never used them). Our room was very clean - there were PLENTY of towels, TP and kleenex for us to use (we were there 4 nights - so we didn't have our room serviced), but anytime we asked for something (like extra coffe paks), we were accomodated with a smile! We didn't use the pool - although it is heated to 82 degrees, we didn't have time - but there were several people in there every day. They were fililng the lazy river, and I see from the live webcam that is is still filled, but doesn't seem to be open. Didn't partake in the 'free' continental breakfast available from 9 to 10 am over at Tahiti Joes - seems like that is where the sales people now bring all their 'prospects'. Check out was no problem - you leave a $100 deposit on your credit card when you check in - internet service is $9.99 daily (a little pricey) No wifi in the older buildings - but you can borrow a network cable while you're there if you have your own laptop.

Building 5 has a concerige desk in it (I'm assuming all the buliding do). Becareful these people are here to assist but to also get you to take a tour. You can tell this place is brand new, its beautiful. Got to the room, it was clean, had flat screens in both the living room and bedrooms, and a radio (that is hidden) in the living room. In the small unt there is no stove, but there was a microwave, toaster, sink, mini fridge, silverware and dishwashing liquid. We fit 3 girls (ages 26-35) in each room quite comfortably. They only clean once a week but will happily give you more towels, soap and remove any trash you've accumlated. We didn't care too much for a view, as we mainly slept most of the time we were in the room. The hotel doesn't have wifi (seriously) but Denny's does and i was able to pick up Denny's wifi from our room on the 4th floor of tower 5.

For all practical purposes, its location is \u201coff strip\u201d but the resort provides an excellent shuttle service on comfortable buses to 4 strip locations: Tropicana, Treasure Island, Stratosphere and the Premium Outlets. The shuttle runs fairly frequently and is pretty reliable. Room accomodations: We stayed in a 1-bedroom premium (Bora Bora) located in the newer building. The facility is quite nice with an optimal layout scheme. There is a concierge service on the entry floor (usually manned) and ice service with vending areas on each floor. The Bora Bora rooms are fully equipped and sleep a total of 4 in a king master and queen sofabed. They also have balconies with table and chairs. The thick glass balcony doors do a good job of keeping out construction noise, but note that there is also ongoing indoor construction which is quite loud at times. The bathroom impressed me most with its convenient floor plan, oversized whirlpool jacuzzi and seated shower. The toilet area is recessed providing some additional privacy. The shower also serves as a sauna with a very easily utilized steam function. The water pressure both there and throughout the entire condo is strong and the \u201cinstant on\u201d hot water system is commendable. There\u2019s no waiting for the tub to fill for a relaxing jacuzzi, and the on/off switch is built right into the side of the tub. Just press a button to turn on or off\u2014no timer switches. The double sinks are separated by a lower counter area for the guest to sit for makeup applications, etc. The only additional item I would receommend is a lighted magnification makeup mirror. Other than that this is the most functional bathroom facility I\u2019ve experienced so far in any hotel or timeshare resort. The kitchen is quite convenient and reasonably well-supplied. The usual utensils are there along with a few extras. The resort provides dishwashing liquid and 2 dishwasher tablets. The double sink also has a garbage disposal. The washer/dryer is small but perfect for this condo. Two little boxes of laundry detergent are provided. There is also a food delivery service for a fee if you wish to have your fridge stocked in advance of your arrival. I wouldn\u2019t bother with this if you arrive on a Sunday or Wednesday because at 8 am on Mondays and Thursdays a shuttle will take you to a well-supplied grocery store just down the road. It\u2019s very convenient and the driver will happily give you a hand with heavy groceries. You have about 50 minutes or so to shop and that\u2019s plenty of time as long as you go with a list. For many perhaps the nicest inclusion are the large flat screen TVs in both the living room and bedroom. Along with comes a music center with DVD and VCR. Onsite amenities: A single pool equipped with comfortable lounges and tiki umbrellas provides fun and relaxation on nice days. A \u201cLazy River\u201d is currently under construction and looks to be a lovely area when completed. There is also a nice convenience store with a variety of provisions one might need immediately, an ATM, an exercise room and 2 restaurants (Tahiti Joe\u2019s and Denny\u2019s). There\u2019s free Wifi at Denny\u2019s so go there if you just need to log on occasionally during your stay. The resort has only scattered service for which you must pay a fee. Printing is available in the tiny business center (2 PCs) but the minimum to log on is $5.00. The barbecue area, equipped with 5 large gas grills (cleaned daily), has lots of cooking space and shaded sitting areas. This amenity seemed to be highly popular with the guests. Problems: -There are many lifeguards for the single medium-sized pool but I didn\u2019t see them do anything but hand out towels the entire week we stayed. People were permitted to enter the pool with food, beverage, etc., but the worst infraction was that diapered babies were allowed in as well. I found that to be a huge turnoff. -While most shuttle bus drivers were well-mannered and demanded to see everyone\u2019s bus pass, at least one or two failed to make the grade. -A great deal of smoking goes on at this resort even though the advertised guidelines indicate that smoking is permitted in only a few designated areas. Even salespeople could be found smoking with their clients while walking around the resort. Our room appeared to be smoke-free but that may be attributed to its newness. The smoking issue is something I would watch for the future. Generally speaking, resorts which accommodate smokers as much as this one seems to end up much dirtier and more difficult to maintain in the long run; something to consider if you\u2019re buying a timeshare and are interested in lower maintenance fees. -WiFi should always be a free service in mid-level resorts such as Tahiti Village. The attached fee was a huge disappointment. -Be forewarned; there is a great deal of construction noise at this resort both inside and out. It also sits very close to McCarran Airport where flights take off in the direction of Tahiti Village approximately every 20 minutes or so. If this kind of noise breaks your relaxation cycle you would do better elsewhere. Otherwise, I recommend you go. The price is right and the fun is just up the road!", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jonesville, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cnice and new and under construction\u201d", "Author": "Mike V", "ReviewID": "UR20732426", "Content": "We traded our timeshare to stay at Tahiti Village.

We mostly just slept there and spent our waking hours in town. We did not use the facility (pool, bar, etc.) at all, but we saw lots of people having fun in and around the pool from our balcony view. The pillows were flimsy and the wifi was too expensive. I used Denny's for free, but I got loaded with unwanted e-blasts and pop ups from using this hot spot. The big flat screens in the rooms were nice, but I think they were not receiving a high def signal as the picture wasn't very good on any of the channels. There was no lighting above the mirror in the bathroom--just to the side--which caused shadows on one side of my face and made it hard to see well enough to properly shave and groom my whiskers. I loved the space, the kitchen, the laundry, the balcony, and the steam shower. I'm sure that time will fix things like the parking and the cable signal.

There are not enough loungers and all the unbrellas were taken by 9am so you had to be at the pool very early to get a good location. They offer a shuttle service to the strip since they are just south of the airport. The shuttle system is very poorly run. Even though they are supposed to be on a half hour schedule, it was not unusual to have to wait 90 minuted for a shuttle to show up. By the end of the night, the shuttles were so behind, it was ridiculous. We had a horrible experience on the shuttle one night as the driver dramatically overloaded the bus then hit the highway on the way back to the resort. He was not able to travel the speed limit and it was hazardous. When we reached the resort and complained to the night maager, her response was incredible. She told us we didn't have to take the shuttle and that we could have gotten off. If I were in charge of her, I would have fired her after that night, Instead of handling the situation, she actually escalated the emotions of the passengers.

After reading all the previous reports, I was really worried that we had made a big mistake booking this timeshare (through a friend). We (my boyfriend and I) were pleasantly surprised and would definitely return. This was my first trip to Vegas so I was very excited. We took a cab to the resort (which cost around $30.00 w/tip) would be great if they offered a shuttle service (the cab ride back to airport was around 25.00). Arrived around noon and our room was not ready. We asked for a pool view and they told us to come back at 3:00 and they would have one for us. We dropped off our luggage and went to explore the resort. The grounds are just beautiful and the pool is amazing. We quickly changed into our suits and pool bound we were. There were so many different parts of the pool even though it was all 1 large pool. There was a shallow part with sand which was great for small children, there are 2 other shallow parts (perfect for putting your lounge chair in), there was a volleyball net & basketball net in the pool\u2026just a great pool that offers something for everyone. There is a store on site (wiki wiki post) that sells extra floats. At the pool area, they will give you towels and if you get there early enough, they do have a few extra floats, noodles and inflatable balls. You can also order food from Tahiti Joe\u2019s and have it delivered, there are menus on the chairs (see photo) The resort also offers a free shuttle service to a few points along the strip (Tropicana, Treasure Island, Stratosphere and a few stops to the Premium Outlet Mall). The Deuce bus is also convenient. For 5.00, you can ride all day. There is a stop close to the resort whether coming or going. If you are coming back at night, it stops over near the outlet mall. When you are heading towards the strip, you can catch the bus by the outlet mall as well but it will take you to the bus depot first (strange but it\u2019s not bad). The Deuce will stop a lot so if you have to be somewhere in a certain time, I would not recommend it. The Deuce also goes straight down the strip and all the way to Fremont Street (which took over an hour from Tahiti Village). The shuttles also have coolers on them with small bottles of water \u2013 free of charge. The parking garage \u2013 I\u2019ve seen soooo many complaints from people here and I don\u2019t get it. From reading other posts, I thought the parking garage was across the street or something, it\u2019s right next to the complex. There are parking spaces closer to the buildings but if you aren\u2019t lucky enough to get one, the parking garage isn\u2019t that far. When you first arrive, you can drop your bags off and have a bellboy take them to your room so no need to lug them from the parking garage. Tiki Joe\u2019s & Denny\u2019s \u2013 both were great places to eat. We only ate at Denny\u2019s twice, got the wi-fi to work the first time but not the second time. Tiki Joe\u2019s has amazing nachos and they are HUGE. Hit the bar there for happy hour before our flight home \u2013 great beer specials. Welcome Package \u2013 this is where the timeshare comes into play. We knew from reading other posts that this is the \u201cwelcome to the timeshare\u201d package and we weren\u2019t interested. We were asked when we got there if we wanted it then and we said \u201cno, we\u2019d pick it up later after we checked in fully\u201d. No issues there. We got a few messages on the phone with daily activities and reminders that if we didn\u2019t pick up our \u201cwelcome package\u201d yet to do so but there was never any more pressure. The place does bring people in almost non-stop. It\u2019s amazing how many people come and listen, not sure exactly what they are getting in return. There is a concierge desk that will help get you discounted show tickets if you are interested. There are also a few really nice gas grills & mini frigs towards the south end of the resort. I\u2019m not sure if they are there for anyone to use or if you have to reserve them, but they are nice. The rooms were really nice. We were in a moorea room, 1 bedroom suite with no balcony. The room had a mini frig, microwave and toaster\u2026no oven. Housekeeping will come in the middle of the week to clean, but we never needed it (we just took towels & soap off the cart). Check in is at 4:00 and Check Out is at 10:00. We asked for alittle later check out and they said 10:30 or 11:00. We ended up checking out at 10:15 but it was nice to not feel as rushed.

But now at the end of my first week here I am glad i didn't beleive the hype of a few unhappy visitors. Our first night here we tried to upgrade to the Bora Bora, the larger condo, and they originally they said they could not accomidate us because they were overbooked. We asked to speak to the management, explained this was our honey moon and recieved not only the upgrade but also a REALLY nice gift basket. SHUTTLES - they have shuttles that run to the strip the top of everyhour. Suggestion: take the shuttle to the strip and spend the $15 on the cab to come back so you don't have to worry about pick up times. POOL - AWESOME, to the person who complained about the tempature of the water please remember it's Vegas...it's hot...the pool can't be kept too cold or people would not stay in that long. The water volleyball was awesome and the food was reasonably priced. They don't advocate outside food and drink but don't inforce that either as long as you aren't a drunk idiot. ROOMS- Bora Bora was great, nice plasma in the bedroom, wish it were in the living room. I've never seen a washer and dryer literally in one...not stacked...actually one mashine that will wash and dry your clothes. MAID service - yes, they only come once a week but if you leave your garbage outside they will pick it up. We personally appreciated not having someone in our room everyday interupting our plans but if you don't know how to clean up after yourself you can get the service for between 35-85 dollars depending on the room size. Convenience STORE - was very suprised they did not over charge just because they could. AIRPORT service - just get a taxi, even if they did try to offer the service at the 10am checkout every one has different flight times and you would be sitting in yet another line to get home...not worth it. Parking - we were in room 1612 and the parking was never an issue for the 4 days we had a car. Suggestion: get the rental for the week it's free to park at 95% of the casinos. Even if you don't need it the whole week it's usually A LOT cheaper to get the week rental and just return it early.

In fact the entire property was spotless. Staff was working endlessly keeping the resort immaculate. The staff was also very friendly and willing to assist with whatever need arose.

First off I was a bit worried after reading all of the reviews here. So to say the least I was a little skeptical that things would be ok. We arrived about 7pm on a Saturday evening which turned out to be an excellent time to arrive. The front desk had no line and we had our room keys within 3 minutes. We were put on the second floor of building 5 which has just opened. The room was as advertised and very nice. There was almost no evidence of anyone staying in the room previously. I think we were only the second occupants. One pan had a couple of scratches in it and everything else looked brand new. We had been through the murderous presentation about 3 years ago and knew it was not going to happen again so we were constantly on guard for the lead-ins to it. Every time we talked to a concierge we were asked if we wanted to do it to get free show tickets or a Grand Canyon tour but we were not pestered after saying no. In the casinos I found it effective to show the room key to the people trying to hook victims for the presentation and say \"Already staying there.\" They quickly moved to the next potential victim. The good... The staff was friendly, helpful and available when needed and unobtrusive when not. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is convenient but away from the strip. The steam shower was awesome. Housekeeping picked up towels and garbage left in the hall very quickly. The bad... Coffee. The weak stuff they pass off as coffee in the room is not fit to drink so plan on bringing your own or grabbing some locally before morning. The coffee maker used #2 Melitta type filters which we had to buy at the grocery store. The Pool. The pool is shallow and not shaded at all making it very warm. Too warm to be refreshing. The lazy river is still under construction and should be shaded from the afternoon sun by building 5. They also do not appear to be enforcing the rules of no glass in the pool area. We saw many people with beer bottles in and around the pool. Parking. As mentioned in other reviews the parking at this place sucks. Fortunately we were close to the south end of building 5 which is only a few steps from the new parking garage. If we were in any of the other buildings this would have really been an issue. Stairways. Being on the second floor and fairly fit we tend to use stairs instead of elevators. Unfortunately there is no access to the stairways from the first floor of the building. This forced us to walk almost 300 feet to the elevators and then back almost the entire length of the hall to our room. Not a huge deal but packing a weeks worth of groceries that far was no fun. Wi-Fi. Specifically the lack of it. Wi-Fi Internet service is not available in building 5. For a \"Nominal Fee\" of $11 a day you can get it on your TV in the room but I don't think I am alone in thinking $11 is not nominal. There were two workstations with excessive fees available in the \"business center\" (I would call it a closet) in the main lobby. There is no excuse for not having wi-fi in a brand new building. Free Wi-Fi is available in the Denny's restaurant next door to Tahiti Joe's. Fire Alarm. There is still construction going on in building 5 and Thursday morning about 8 am the fire alarm was set off forcing us to evacuate the building. We had to stand outside for about 10 minutes while they sorted it out. When we could get back in we had to wait around in the building lobby for a few minutes while they figured out how to unlock the elevators which were secured by the alarm. See the note about no first floor stairway access above. Housekeeping. Our room was toweled mid week and they did a fine job except they forgot to empty the garbage. This was not a big deal for us and I only mention it as some people would be put off by it. If you want housekeeping service more than just the one time during the week there is a $35 charge. Transportation. If you are going to stay here you really need a car if you want any flexibility. We had one so we did not use the shuttle but we saw people waiting for it almost all of the time. It appeared they only had 2 or 3 shuttles running. But they had about 20 shuttles available to ferry the presentation victims back and forth from their hotels on the strip. The Deuce strip bus can be caught across the street (Warm Springs) at the outlet mall. There was often a taxi waiting for a fare near the front entrance but I never saw more than one sitting there. There was a taxi queue across the street in front of the outlet mall. General stuff... For groceries there is a Food 4 Less store about 2 miles south on Las Vegas Blvd. Excellent prices and a good selection. We were pleased with our deli purchases there as well. There is also an Albertson's store about 3 miles east on Warm Springs at Eastern if you want a regular full service super market. For liquor Lee's Discount Liquor has about the best prices and selection I have seen around Vegas. They are located about 3 miles south on Las Vegas Blvd. For gas the Rebel station on the corner of Las Vegas and Warm Springs has about the best gas prices around and they also have E85 available. Parking on the strip is free in most of the casino parking garages. Just look for the self park signs. We used New York's garage for the south strip and Paris for the central strip. Downtown on Fremont use the Golden Nugget garage or the city garage just east of Fitzgeralds. Just make sure you get the ticket validated. Validation is only good for 3 hours so you need to go move the car if you are staying longer and don't want to pay. Do not use the Necropolis garage north of Fremont as Fitzgeralds will not validate it. In summary... I would never buy into this place nor would I subject myself to one of their sales presentations again. They will tell you it is only 2 hours but you will be lucky to get out of there with your wallet intact in less than 4 hours. The secondary market for Tahiti Village is alive and well. They will be happy to sell you a unit for 40-50k and make you think you got a good deal but you can find them in several places online for 10-25k. Three years ago in our presentation they started us at $37500 and as we were walking out the door they were trying for $7500 for the same deal. It is obvious they only have one objective in mind that being to get you to a presentation. They don't care if you already own since they want to \"upgrade\" you. I would definitely stay at Tahiti Village again. The rental rate is a bit excessive in my opinion at $200 plus a night but fortunately there are secondary rental opportunities available as well if you take a little time to look for them.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "central coast california", "Title": "\u201cTahiti Village Timeshare Trip Review\u201d", "Author": "juliadanielle", "ReviewID": "UR19836667", "Content": "I saw the ad on TV for Tahiti Village for a free 3 night stay in Las Vegas, and thought, \"no way, if it's too good to be true it probably is.\" I called anyways to see what it was all about. The operator told me that I could stay at Tahiti Village and they would give me a $100 dollar gas card to come out, the only catch was that I needed to go to thier two hour time share presentation, and put down a $98 dollar deposit. I was still sceptical but I decided to give it a try. Before I went I looked online for some reviews on how other people's experiences where with Tahiti village timeshare presentation was. I couldn't find much, (which is why I am writting this). When my boyfriend and I got to Vegas I reset our odemeter to zero so we could see if it really was only 3/4 of a mile from the Mandelay Bay Casino (which is what they told me on the phone), and it wasn't. Tahiti Village is actually about 3 1/2 miles from the MB. When we checked in we had a little trouble showing that we lived together (even though our id's show the same address, my city was miscorrectly spelled on my id, so they made us print out something from the internet showing that we actually did live together (an amazon.com reciept.). After we got that cleared up we went to our room. The room was amazing, very spacious, clean, and definatly nice. Our presentation was scheduled for the next morning at 10 am. We had had so much fun the previous night that we only got two hours of sleep. Anyways, we were introduced to our guide, and we sat down and talked for a while. He was trying to explain to us how he had bought one of their timeshares and actually sells the room for one week a year, and makes money. I didn't really believe that you could make that much money on one of their rooms being that you can stay in a room in the middle of the strip for the same amount of money. They also had a deal where if you bought one of thier timeshares you could get discounted trips to all over the world (six times a year for 7 days) for between $299-$700 (that actually did sound like a good deal.) We explained to our guide that we wanted to purchase a house first, and that it was not a good investment for us to buy one of their timeshares because we needed to save our money to put more down on a house that we could stay in 52 weeks out of the year. At the end of the presentation the closer came over and told us that the price of the larger suite (the one that we stayed in for free) for $48,000 dollars, or we could purchase the smaller room for $13,000 dollars. He tried to make thier 17.9% interest rate sound small, but we again told them no and explained how expensive a mortgage is in California, and they let us go. We went to the window to recieve our refund, and gas cards. We had no problem at all. The presentation really did only go 2 hours, but we were lucky because other (staying at other hotels had to wait for everyone to get out to ride the shuttle back) .When we checked out they asked why we were checking out at 10 instead of 11? I showed them the paper they sent me in the mail stating that check out was at 11am. They said okay and charged me nothing at all. All in all I would say that this is a very good deal. I read some reviews that people were upset that they had to sit through a two hour presentation, but they didn't appreciate the fact that if they had booked a trip to Las Vegas and paid, they would have ended up spending upwards of 1,000 dollars to stay in a room the size of thier room, and all the other \"gifts\" they give you to go out there. I would definatly take advantage of this again if I could. I only ended up spending $180 dollars total on this trip, including food, gas, gambling, going to the top of the stratusphere, ect.

It was my only positive experience dealing with the staff the whole time I am there. She couldn't believe that the lady at the front desk had said what she had. There IS a mail drop box at the front desk for guests!!!! Imagine that! This lady was very courteous and sincere. I then asked for a comment card. She tells me that they have them at the front desk. Once again, I get the third eye look, then am told that they are out of the comment cards.

My mom was worried being so close to the airport and the noise from the pool but once you were inside the room you couldn't hear anything. The lanai was wonderful. It's really big and looked over the pool. We had breakfast out there every morning. There was some hair on towels and food in the track of the sliding glass door. They really don't pay attention to detail, maybe because they have so many units to clean. Overall, we were happy. The parking is horrible. It's not bad if you can get one of the few places up front but if you have to park in the garage, it's very far away. I utilized valet parking when I couldn't find a close spot but valet takes forever! A minimum of 15 minutes to get your car. Ridiculous. There are plenty of hotels on the strip the same size or larger and they get your car to you in less than 5 minutes so I'm not sure what the problem is with valet parking at Tahiti Village. The continental breakfast they offer is a joke. Three juices, pound cake, muffins and coffee. That's it. Nothing nutritional. Denny's was good for breakfast. Tahiti Joes was awful. Not recommended. The entertainment was just as bad. For those of you want the Las Vegas Resort ammenities (casinos, entertainment, restaurants, etc) this is not the place for you. This is a timeshare, so yes, it's going to be more like an apartment complex. The pool is awesome and a great place to cool off.

This place has no casino (I new this going in), no active bar scene, and no real restaurants. Tahiti Joes is OK, but there is only a Dennys for breakfast. I don't know about you, but I don't go to Vegas to eat at Dennys. All this wouldn't be so bad if they had a decent transportation system. People fly into Vegas, and most don't rent cars. This place is miles from the strip and just about everything else. Their shuttles leave on the half our but only stop at 3 places. There is almost no taxi service to speak of. If you miss the shuttle or want to go anywhere other than the strip, you have two choices, wait a half hour (if your going to the strip), or call a taxi which taskes at least 20-30 minutes to get there. We almost got into a fight when our cab got there and 2 other parties ran out claiming it, saying, \"we called 30 minutes ago\" If your used to resort style transportation, cabs in a line waiting, forget it. I don't come to Vegas to get in line to wait that kind of time. This place feels more like an apartment complex, with proximity to the strip but you need a car to get around. I agree with the other review in that the staff is not knoledgeable or overly friendly. At least not like you'd find at a real resort. Again, more like an apartment complex staff.

Washer/Dryer in the room is a nice convenience. Plates, glasses, utensils all provided. Nice room layout. A very very basic complimentary continental breakfast is provided in Tahiti Joe, Muffins/Pound cake and Juice/Tea/Coffee. The room safe is very very small, cannot fit a laptop. Tahiti Joe hosts some activities like sundae and cookie building for 2 bux. Plenty of pool related activities. Shuttle for groceries twice a week early in the morning. Town Centre is nearby, \u00bd mile. Access to shops, restaurants, and brand new digital movie theater. Rent a car if you want flexibility otherwise you will be bound to the shuttles and bus system. Local roads and local highways are very very easy to navigate and figure out. No need to be intimidated by the Las Vegas Blvd Traffic. Be warned Red Lights at the intersections seem to take forever to turn green. Literally a two minute drive from the airport car rental place. Might be 10 mins from the Airport itself. Real issue is that as a timeshare place the staff isn\u2019t trained in proper hotel management etiquette. For example the front desk didn't know the difference between Tower 2 and Tower 3, basically they didn't know how to read their own map. Or issues with the Tahiti Village printed directions to attractions to Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, etc... The Hoover Dam directions are completely wrong. Thank goodness I had enough of my own common sense to figure it out before blindly following them and getting completely lost and wasting time. Another example of confusing situation is the whole shuttle system. Confusion on which bus is designated for owners/visitors and which bus is for the people they want to sell timeshares to. Lastly, I'm an owner, don\u2019t make me go thru an owner update, I just want information and details.

We did not arrive until the 4th night of our week as we didn't want to spend a full week in Vegas, however, we had to use a week before it expired. We are Marriott owners of Desert Ridge in Phoenix, however, their Vegas property was not available when we needed to go and Tahiti Village looked nice enough as I looked through the various availabilities online with Interval. However, we were left a bit dissapointed. If Tahiti Village wants to compete with the likes of Marriott, Hyatt, etc. they will need to make some changes. We felt as if they focused more on trucking in (and yes -- it was truly trucking -- I've never seen so many busses of people) would be \"buyers\" then those that were actually staying at the resort. Don't get me wrong, they were friendly enough, but the service we are used to just wasn't there and the accomodations, while supposedly new, were left in a bit of disrepair. The first night we were put into a smoking room without really realizing it, as it was after midnight by the time we arrived. We thought it smelled a bit off, but decided just to go to bed. We were woken by a very large cload of smoke and smell coming from the lock-off door (we were in the lock-off side)! We had booked a non-smoking room w/ a view -- we got the view, but not the non-smoking room. They didn't even ask at check in if this was okay. I suspect that most non-smokers would forgo the view for clean air -- we are certainly in this group! They were able to move us to a new room that morning at least. I had to bring my laptop with me for a bit of work and was irritated to learn that I would have to pay $9.99 for 24 hours -- serioulsy, how expensive is internet! Very rarely have we had to pay for internet in the last several years at hotels and never once at a timeshare. Seems like a pretty \"cheap\" way to make an extra buck -- not exactly an amenity if you have to pay for it! We noted in our 1st room that the baseboards were pretty beat up already and that most of the furnishings were also in pretty rough shape. Yes, that is pretty nick-picky, but for a new property, I'm afraid to see what it will look like in a couple years -- this has never been an issue w/ Marriott type propertys-- probably because the quality of their furnishings is nicer to begin with. The bathroom also had issues, specifically the shower / bathtub. The shower head leaked and the bathtub had a crack / hole in it that if left for any length of time would definitely invite water damage under the tub. I would think that if you were trying to sell timeshares, that you'd take better care of your facilities. We visitited Tahit Joe's for lunch and were also dissapointed there. We were left at the hostess stand for at least 15 minutes, and finally gave up and sat at the bar. The waitress there was nice enough, but too busy to much bother with us. We had to ask to finally get our lunch order taken, even though she had handed us menus (after we asked for those). When we finally received our order, at least it was tasty. However, they could certainly learn how to speed up their service and employ enough people to wait on the guests that are there. Again, nothing drastic, but its often the details that make great hotel lines, great. To end, no -- we would never stay there again due to the number of issues we faced: individually none were a big deal, but all together enough to deter us from staying there again. However, we can see where its mostly just a new property that needs to work out various kinks. If they want to compete with the larger properties and the more popular timeshares, they will need to pay closer attention to the details or risk being labeled as a low-end hotel / timeshare provider. A few nice points: Never once were we harrassed to attend a timeshare presentation (BIG PLUS to us) and also the location of the property. It is technically on the strip, however is still 3 miles to closest big name -- Mandalay Bay. This may be a negative to some, but it was nice to be away from the glitz/glam except when we wanted to be there.

I am a timeshare owner and traded one of my weeks to a two bedroom lock off I did this because this was what was available at the time. Day 1: We rented a car from the airport which is pretty simple from McCarren. All the rental cars are under one roof now so you take a white bus which has all the rental car names on it and are delivered to the car company. It's one big building and very easy to figure out. We rented from Budget since I am a fastbreak member there which means you fill out your information online so it saves you time at the car place. Just look for your name and find your car and drive away. That simple. If you are renting a car and going to TV when you leave the rental agency you take three rights and you are there. Simple. The last right you take is Las Vegas Blvd and TV is on your right hand side. My first impression was that it doesn't look as big as it said it was. It is on the strip, on one side is an empty lot which I guess they are expanding to and the other is a place called Manor hotel which looks kind of dumpy. Another reviewer had mentioned that if you call ahead and ask for a room overlooking the pool or the strip you won't end up looking at the motel. I did do this and was granted a room on the 6th floor (this is high as this particular building goes) and a view of the pool. Our room is 1612/1612A. Check in was simple we got here about 3:30 our room was ready. If you walk in the front door to your left is the timeshare people and concierge and to the right is the registration desk. They took a credit card number for incidentals but I have had this happen everywhere I stay so no biggie. We went to the concierge to pick up our welcome packet (this is where they get you to sign up) since I am an owner (not here but a timeshare owner in general) they did not press me to see their \"owners tour\" You do want to go to this desk though because this is where you get your maps and coupons and your goodie bag (razor, toothpaste, antacid, aspirin, sample shampoos etc.) if you don't like that stuff I guess you can skip it. They also give you the activites paper which has the goings on of the resort listed Saturday - Friday some of the things they offer are sightseeing tours (South Rim Grand Canyon for $100 pp, Lake Mead) Field trips to Red Rock Canyon which leaves every Mon, Weds & Fri at 12:30 for $2.00 pp and a Laughlin all day tour for $10.00 on Tuesdays. For kids they have cookie decorating, arts and crafts, candy treasure hunts, create a critter, make your own sundaes and they also do morning walks 3 days a week. Gas here is currently 3.69 a gallon which is about 30 cents cheaper then were I live in upstate NY. I wish I could bring that home! When we left the front office we had parked in the front of the building our room was located on the left side if you were facing the building so we had to drive around to get to the elevators. One thing that I did not like is the parking situation. We were only able to park in the undercover spots once or twice. There is limited parking I will take a picture of it so you can see but the cars line the fence, maybe 40 or so spots. They are covered because the heat is pretty bad here (88 yesterday and expecting triple digets by Monday) there was one spot to be had when we first checked in so we took it. It was a bit confusing at first on where to get into the building but I am not sure if it was me or the map. I just got off a 5 1/2 hour flight and was starving so it was probably me. Anyway we found the elevators - to get into the building during the day time hours the door just opens up (from the outside coming in) but we noticed last night while it was still light out that they do lock and you have to use your key to get in which is nice at least there is a little security keeping people from just walking in. The elevators are to your right and if you look to your left they are right there. There are two of them and they are the full size ones. It is a new building so they work and they are quick. We got to the 6th floor where there are signs posted as to which way to go as to your room number. Our keys worked on both of our unit doors with no problem. Ok now the room, since there are only two of us in this room we won't be using the lock off but I will describe that first. When you first walk in you are in the kitchenette /living room portion of the room. It is plenty big enough for 2 and possibly 4 if you like each other (ha) there is a 3 seat bar counter to eat on, pull out couch, chair, two end tables, closet and TV in this room along with your kitchen which has a half size fridge (no ice maker) full size sink, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and blender. It also has the plates, glasses and utensils. There is a small hallway which leads to the bathroom which has a regular bath/shower, sink and toilet. The bath and toilet are not private (there are no doors separating anthing it's all one room) At the end of the hall way is the bedroom which has two end tables, I think a king size bed and small tv. You can access the bathroom from the bedroom or the hallway (two doors). That is about it on the lock off. Both rooms are very clean I even looked for issues and did not find any. I am use to having the bigger room but would not be upset with a lock off here. The larger room is pretty much the same but well, larger. This kitchen has the full size fridge and stove with everything you need to cook. It is actually quite beautiful with the granite countertops and stainless steel appliances. It is large enough to do what ever you want in it. There are also three stools to eat at the breakfast bar which is where I sit now to type this. This is an open air room which means no walls separating the living room dining room, kitchen areas. There is a small table for four, a pull out couch, and end table, coffee table and entertainment center with a small tv. The washer/dryer are located in a closet off the kitchen. They are one unit (washer/dryer combined). They have computers for the tv and a dvd player. You can get the internet for 9.99 per day which you can use their keyboard/tv screen or bring your own laptop and plug into their plug which is located on the bottom of the entertainment center. They will provide a cord for you at the front desk for free if you do not have one and you need to bring it back to them or they will charge you. It worked fine for me. There is no free internet service at TV but I was told that the new building, that has yet to be built, will have it. There is a Denny's connected to the building which has free internet and that also works fine. There is a balcony off of the living room which has a small table with four chairs. Our room overlooks the pool and it is very pretty. The bedroom is off the DR portion which is also plenty large enough but could use another or a bigger dresser. The dresser where the large screen tv sits has 4 small drawers and one of them is used to house the DVD player. There is a king size bed and it is comfortable. There are two end tables each with a drawer and a full size closet with about 10 hangers. You can access the bathroom from the kitchen portion of the room or from the bedroom. There is a jacuzzi tub where the double sinks are and the toilet and the steam shower (note on the steam room/shower - I enjoyed it but it is very hot, becareful not to get burned by the steam nozzle, keep away from it when it is on because it will spit out hot drops of water now and then and they do hurt, the steam also creates a bit of a smell, I did not notice it the first time but I did on the 2nd and 3rd time, it didn't stop me from using it though) are in their own little room. Our first night on the town we went to eat at Terribles on Flamingo and Paradise. We had a buy one get one buffet coupon so we figured we would try it out. This casino is older the buffet was 9.99 so it only cost 5.00 pp the food was only ok but worth 5.00. I recommend using any coupons you get because it is worth it unless you have alot of money and like to just spend it. I am on the thrifty side. You do need a car to get anywhere around here since this timeshare is located way down at the end of the strip. You CAN NOT walk to any casinos from here (not the strip ones anyway) it is on a highway with no sidewalks for walking. Mandalay Bay is over a mile away. They do have a shuttle that runs to Town Square, Tropicana and Treasure Island. It runs from 9 am to 11:30 pm everyday except Fri/Sat when it runs till 2am. I will try to post a pic of the schedule. Day 2: Went to the pool which is very nice. The lazy river is not built yet but they do have it dug out (I overheard a salesmen say August). The main pool is pretty large and does have life guards on duty. You get your towels by the pool and there is hut for drinks ranging from 7-10 dollars. There is a hot tub which was pretty hot. The hot tub is open 24 hours, pool from 8-10pm. We had breakfast at Denny's the Grand Slam breakfast is 6.99 which gives you a choice of 4 items. It was not busy and the wifi works great there. For dinner we went to the Rio for the seafood buffet. The price is 40.00 pp but if you like seafood it is very good. They also have prime rib and an excellent selection of deserts. We went to Albertson's to get our market stuff. It's about 3 miles down Warm Springs Road it is a full service market. There are also a couple of CVS drugstores and the Las Vegas Outlet mall is on this street. Across the street and down toward the strip is a large outside shopping center called Towne Hall. It is brand new and has all of your designer places in it. Day 3: We went to eat at Carnigies Deli in the Mirage - the sandwiches were huge but $$. We were looking for a food court but the Mirage does not have one. We went to a show at Danny Gans theater (Jay Leno). We visited the weight room here at Tahiti, it is on the small size it has about 8 pieces of equipment and it does look newer. They also have a sauna. For lunch we went to Tahiti Joe's and we both had the steak andwiches. They were really good and our bill was $23.00. Well worth it. TV Has a little store attached where you can buy food (eggs, bacon etc) snacks, some clothing, pool stuff, jewerly etc. Things are a little pricey so if you can hit a market you might want to do that. There are ALOT of sales people here but we were never bothered. We were asked when we checked in and that was that. The bad reviews that this place has gotten is mostly from the sales pitch (free vacation that you are offered) If you take those out of Trip Advisors reviews this resort would probably move up to one of the best places to stay for a timeshare resort. Check out was pretty painless also. We asked the day before we left if we could get a late checkout and they told us no because Wednesdays were a busy check-in day. I was kind of mad but figured I would wait till the morning. In the morning we arranged it with the cleaning crew ourselves and got to check out about an hour later. They were fine with it and when we did get down to the front desk no one even questioned us. We stayed by the pool the rest of the day till our flight time. If this review sounds kind of funny I wrote it while it was happening in Las Vegas, then added to it after I arrived home so it might look kind of strange. I apoligize for that.

Also be prepared to not be able to forget Alan Thick since he greets you every time you turn on the TV. The pool and hot tub are great but the pool closes at 9 sharp. The closest thing to a casino is the video poker at the bar in Tahiti Joes. Tahiti Joes has great food too. The only problem we has was getting two cribs. For the 1st two days one of the babies had to sleep in an empty suitcase. housekeeping only comes once while your there (midpoint of stay) and between guest stays. During their cleaning they put away the pull out couch and blankets and pillows. This was kind of annoying since i was sleeping there and had to remake it. Potential buyers led by salesmen swarm the hotel grounds during the day. Take the red rock canyon bus tour leaving the hotel, its a great deal. Also rent a car if you want to visit the strip.

In 2007 we had went to their other facility off decator next to a Dennys...just up the street from the Orleans. At first we thought it was a hotel and was delighted in the setup and was interested in staying there this year (08). When we spoke to the counter help she told us about the concept and gave us a short tour. We called this year and went on the tour as she had suggested. Our tour guide this time was polite and professional; however when we were given the price after several inquires it was a bit beyond our current income. My current monthly payment is 1010.00 for 2000 SF. And their payment was roughly 750 per month. The guide kept pushing that we wouldnt have to spend more than 140-170 when we travelled compaired to the 400-600 we'd spend at a regular hotel; yet thats really deceptive because if this were the case we would have forked out almost a grand on a mortgage for a tahiti village certificate that essentally said we owned a time share only days before our trip....oh im sorry a \"vacation ownership\" or whatever title they are calling it this year. What boggles my mind is how i can own it if i dont really own anything but time at one of their resorts. We dont have an actual piece of property to call our own. For instance...should i get some time in the dog house i couldnt just go to my \"vacation ownership\" and have a place to stay. Id have to call and make arrangements and hope that i get a room with a view. So really what theyre selling is vacation time. And at the high interest rates we were quoted i can only imagine what the rate woulda been in the end if i had bad credit. When we inquired about play areas for our kids the tour guide said, \"there is a play ground across the street.\" He was proud to point out the meager gym (honestly only because the development wasnt finished) and the beach like pool with a kids sand area with only one little blonde kid digging a hole (where were the parents by the way....and i dont mean the 5 life guards on duty). Now for anyone else with a five and 8 year old child you know that a sand box has a shorter entertainment life than a sand clock hour glass. In all honesty the concept and a good portion of the perks are great and we'd be interested in this when my retirement comes in the next few years. But given the treatment we recieved when we told the tour guide, the finance manager, and the marketing rep that this was not financially feasable; i'd be more inclined to just buy a property near the beach in santa monica to sneak off to for some quiet time. We must say that the Tahiti Joe's lounge and the food there was really good, the bartenders were swell and there is now a tiki mug from Tahiti joe's standing in my collection. I must thank Tahiti village for the hour of free gambling and the $100 in shell cards for the nice ride home with my lovely bride!

We stayed at TV for 3 nights. We got the 1500 sqft 2 bedroom suite for $200 a night through the Entertainment Book travel site. The configuration is two separate suites with a connecting door in the middle. One of the rooms was slightly bigger with a balcony. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the pool, partial view of the Las Vegas Strip, and could see planes landing at the airport. The suite had two full bedrooms, one full kitchen, one partial kitchen, one spa tub, and one steam shower. The spa tub and steam shower were in the bigger room. We could have lived in the place for a month in the way it was setup. The adults had their own bedrooms and the children slept on the pull out beds in the living rooms. Two families could easily be comfortable in this unit. The suite was very clean and nicely maintained. Everything worked fine. The bigger suite bed room had a huge flat panel in it. The rest of the TV\u2019s were standard tube TV\u2019s. The d\u00e9cor was an \u201cisland\u201d type theme. It was quiet despite being so close to the airport and the jet landings and takeoffs were not an issue. The balcony was good sized and nice to sit on and check out the pool. The unit had a washer/dryer also. The resort was nicely maintained and showed little signs of wear. The pool area was incredible. They have a sandy beach area and wading pool type areas for the little ones. The kids had a great time at the pool. For a family with young children who want to spend a lot of time at the pool, this is the best feature about TV. The hot tub was very nice and big also. The hot tub is open 24 hrs. Sometimes the hot tub had too many kids especially at night. The pool does not have a lazy river or any water slides. TV is not within walking distance of any casinos. They do have free shuttles going to the strip all day and night so that helps. They do have a restaurant with video poker at the bar if you need to get your fix in without leaving the resort. Oddly enough they don\u2019t have shuttles going to the closest casinos \u2013 The Silverton and South Pointe which are south on LV Blvd. If you are interested in shopping there is an outlet mall across the street. There are also some chain restaurants fairly close by. The resort has a Denny\u2019s on site and a restaurant \u2013 Tahiti Joes. We ate at Tahiti Joes one night and the food was very good. The bar is nice with good drink specials and quite a lively \u201clocals\u201d scene into the morning hours. TV is a timeshare resort so there are quite a few people being taken on \u201ctours\u201d by the sales staff. We were not harassed to go on a tour by anyone from TV. When we got our \u201cWelcome Packet\u201d from the concierge they asked if we wanted free show tickets if we would take a tour. We declined and it was no problem. I believe the concierge desk has access to half price show tickets similar to locations around Las Vegas. There is construction going on at TV \u2013 they are building a new addition to the resort. It can be a little noisy, but nothing too disruptive. The new addition is massive \u2013 6 stories. The building in question looks to be finished with the major construction. They did have a giant crane operating when we were there \u2013 installing huge palm trees. If you want the \u201ctrue\u201d Las Vegas strip experience, then this is not the place as the location is away from the Strip. If you are looking for a casual, relaxed environment away from the chaos of the Strip, then TV would be a good choice. If you are a family looking for a nice, relaxing place to stay, with a great pool, then TV would also be a great pick. Just a few thoughts if you are planning to stay at TV. An outside upper floor room (4th floor or higher) on the north side of the resort will have a direct view of the Las Vegas strip \u2013 which at night is spectacular and the planes landing and taking off at the airport will be right in front of you. There is nothing in front of this part of the resort (because of the airport) and no street noise. It may be louder because of the airport, but the view of the Strip is spectacular. If that is not available then go with a room facing the pool area as the anything else will be overlooking the parking lot or Las Vegas Blvd. There is one minor negative about the location of TV. Next door to TV is the Manor Hotel. This hotel is low budget place with extended stay type rooms. There are some sketchy people around this hotel. Lot\u2019s of hanging around on the balconies, drinking beer, smoking, some screaming, etc. Basically the entire outside south part of the resort faces the Manor Hotel. I would avoid any room that faces toward this place. A few other minor issues in the suite were the lack of adequate drawer space for clothes and the beds could have of higher quality -- better mattresses, have matress pads, etc. No big deal but some people are picky about stuff like this. Overall, I would highly recommend TV if you have a family or just want to avoid the madness of the Strip.

The concierge desk was extremely helpful in getting us reservations to restaurants and shows on the strip. There is a shuttle that brings you to and from the strip and are very timely. This is a great place to stay and I highly recommend this to families and couples. I even upgraded my unit!. By the way, if anyone is interested in buying, please contact me because I am a multi-unit owner and I am considering selling a unit.

He did not realize we had to sit through a possible horrible sales experience. After reading some of the bad reviews is was begging him to try and cancel but he said let's give it a try. Well, I'm glad we stuck it out. I know some of you had a bad experience but for us it was fabulous. First of all let me say, that we followed all the rules. We are married and had 2 forms of identity with us. We lucked out all the way around. The hotel they put us at was the Las Vega Renaissance which is a Marriott property. If you look at it online, you will see that it is a fabulous hotel, clean, new, contemporary, friendly and quiet (non-gaming), which was perfect for us. It was off the stip and located by the Las Vegas Hilton/Convention Center, again, okay by us. We checked in with the Tahiti Village gal at the desk and all went smoothly. She gave us all the coupons and gifts that were promised. The next day, the very nice complimentary shuttle took us to the Village. Again, we must have gotten lucky by getting the sales rep that we did, but after we explained that we really didn't do much travelling and that we were basically only there for the free trip, he said \"well this probably isn't for you, but let me just continue my presentation and show you around because it's my job to do so\". And that's all he did. Again we must have gotten lucky because even when his boss came by and lowered the price of the timeshare and we told him we weren't in a financia position to purchase he said okay and left us alone. Too easy. I was relieved. We got out of there with no hassles and still had another day to enjoy ourselves. Our sales rep Sam, took us downstairs where they had our deposit credit waiting and we were on our way. Our bill at the Renaissance hotel was ZERO. There had been a $50 per day deposit put on there also but was credited upon our check out. From what we saw, T.V. was very nice and if we were in a position to travel more we may have even bought. There were giving 12 weeks of timeshares away at different places for a low cost per week for life and other prizes like free timeshares weeks in Europe etc. But that didn't include airfare or incidentals, so I'm sure few people would even take advantage of the freebies. The condos were very very nice. But a word of caution, I wouldn't sign anything without knowing ALL the details of exactly what you're buying. So for us it was great, for others I see it was not so great. Good luck, Hope this review helps. 3 nights at the nice hotel we stayed at probably cost $600, we stayed for free. 1 more tip if you do go, we had the shuttle drop us off at the Riveria so that we could redeem our Comedy Show coupon and then get our ticket for the show at the ticket booth.", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201c\"Worth it\"\u201d", "Author": "MandaF", "ReviewID": "UR10843666", "Content": "We found our rooms on expedia for, what I though was excellent, only $85 a night.

They are still going through construction, and even though our room was on the very end of tower 2, closest room to the construction, I was only bothered by the beeping of a truck in reverse on our last morning there. The check-out time is, in my opinion, ridiculously early at 10am, but if you call to the front desk you can request a late check-out.

We always rebt a car, and I have no problem tipping the valet $2 at any of the casino's we visit. The new shopping mall is supposed to open soon, and rumor has it that there is a casino going in across the street. I think the only negative thing I have to say is that the free continental breakfast at Tahiti Joe's is a waste of time, seeing as it is only muffins, coffe and juice. Hit the grocery store down the road instead and get some toaster waffles. Lastly, if the large casino's aren't really a draw for you, or you are looking for lower ($5) table minimum's, I recommend going to the Silverton or the Southpoint, both of which are just south of Tahiti Village.

We found that it was a certain way you had to put your key in the key pad. That was why we could not get in the building.

My husband told the staff and by that evening when we returned the water was quite comfortable. Speaking of the Staff, I was ready for the staff to be rude to us. Again, no such luck! I was impressed by the staff's knowlege to remember names. Everyday, they called my husband by his last name in speaking to him. The concierge desk, helped me obtain show tickets at a discount price.

We arrived on a Friday a few hours before the check-in time (which is 4:00pm), expecting to drop off our luggage and hang around until a room was ready. The girls at the Registration Desk were great- getting us right into a quiet room on the 6th floor with a view of the strip. We were bombarded immediately by the woman across the way telling us to get our welcome packet. The packet was actually quite helpful. We politely told them we were not interested in seeing their \"presentation,\" took our packet- and coupons, and headed to our room. (We were never bothered again by the salespeople or \"welcome\" desk people.) The Bora-Bora suite (1609) was perfect- large and clean. The kitchen was fully stocked, including a 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker (a few packets of coffee were provided although we brought our own), toaster, and a blender. Every pot, pan, dish and utensil we could have wanted was there. There were lots of glasses- wine glasses too. Housekeeping also provided some dishwashing soap, dishwasher tablets, and laundry soap. We enjoyed the steam shower- which was perfect after a dry day in the desert- and jacuzzi. Both worked perfectly and were very relaxing. The balcony was much larger than I expected. There was lots of room- it was great. We used the Strip shuttle a few times. It was always on time at each stop. There is a cooler full of cold bottled water that you are free to take. We tipped the driver on the return trip to the resort. There were two instances where we didn't have hot water for a shower in the morning (Thursday and Friday). I read about that in another post so I expected it. In addition to the hot water issue, I also read about noise from construction and the airport. We never heard either. There were planes landing and taking off directly over the resort but once we shut the door we never heard them. The only bothersome noise was from the people below us running the water (filling up the jacuzzi or taking a shower.) While annoying, it wasn't unbearable. I understand people had trouble with the washer/dryer but we had no need to use the dryer at all. Each morning we did our laundry and put it out on the balcony to dry. It was refreshing not having to do all of that laundry when we got home! The pool area was well-staffed. Although there are signs that say no outside food/drink allowed we saw plenty of people bringing drinks with no trouble at all. One group even had a cooler and a bottle of Malibu! The lifeguards were plentiful. We never had a problem getting chairs- there were plenty. The Tiki Bar at the pool had odd hours. I am not sure what time it opened, but it closed by 4:00pm each day and the drinks were very overpriced. If you must buy a drink, hit the gift shop and grab something there for half the price. My husband used the fitness room a few times and liked the Universal machine. The salesmen give tours all day long, and they always go by the fitness room so be prepared- especially if you like the treadmill- which is right by the door. We used the Sauna as well. That was very nice and relaxing. It is big- we had 4 people comfortably in it. Tahiti Joe's was good. We split a plate of nachos- which was big enough to fill both of us. Something strange was that the \"bar\" part and \"restaurant\" part are owned by 2 different companies- so a separate waittress has to come out and take your drink order. You have to pay for your drink separately from your food. Not a huge inconvenience, just a little weird. The gift shop was well stocked- items we saw included- wine, beer, bread, breakfast food, milk, ice cream, gifts, sunblock, pool toys, etc. On the day we checked out (check out is 10am), we weren't flying out until 9:00pm. The girls at the Registration Desk gave us a pool key good for the entire day. That was nice- we were able to spend the day on the strip and then relax there before our flight. We checked our baggage and picked it up before we left. The taxi taking us to the airport took a while to get to the resort. Call at least 1/2 hour before you need it.

The suite was so beautiful and spacious that my siblings and I moved from our hotel on the strip to their living room (every parent's worst nightmare lol.) The kitchen comes with 6 bowls, 6 plates, 6 spoons etc, so it's great for a small family/group. The garbage disposal and dishwasher are definately a plus, as is the washer/dry combo. The steam shower is big enough to have a small seat and the whirlpool is bigger than it appears in the photos. the bathroom had two entrances (bedroom and kitchen), so guests in the living room don't have to walk through the bedroom to access it. the bedroom is a nice size with a king (possibly queen) sized bed, full length mirrors and a 42 inch TV (always a plus lol). the couch in the living room is a sofa-bed that can fit two comfortably & there are extra pillows and blankets in the bedroom closet. there's also a dining table with 4 chairs and 3 stools at the bar. the patio is bigger than it looks in the picture and had a great view of the pool. (the suites on the outside of the hotel had either Strip or mountain views). the hotel is close to the airport , so occassionally, you'll hear planes passing by, but usually, the sound of the waterfalls next to the pool drowns that out. there's a convienence store called the wiki wiki which has the usual travel essentials (including water toys for the pool). we didn't go to tahiti joe's, but the on-site dennys was good and had an extremely nice waitress (rebecca, i believe). there is construction going on, but i think it stops pretty early because i've never seen it when i went to the pool in the mornings. tahiti village is a developing timeshare resort ($63,000 for a 2 bedroom unit? no thank you), so like other reviewers said, there are a lot of salesmen with potential buyers around, but most of them just smiled at the hotel guests, said good morning and held open the doors for us. we didn't rent a car, so parking wasn't a problem. the shuttles came every 30 minutes (on the hour and half hour). it took exactly half an hour from tahiti village to the last stop - about 12 minutes to the tropicana, another 13 to the second stop (i believe it was treasure island) and 5 more to the rivieria). the shuttles had a cooler full of complementary bottles of water - definately a nice touch when you're in the middle of the desert lol. the shuttles don't take the scenic route (straight up las vegas blvd), so they're able to skip the notorious strip traffic. tahiti village is on las vegas blvd, but it's about 2 miles south from the last major casino, mandalay bay, so it doesn't have the easy access to gambling the way strip hotels do. if gambling isn't your #1 priority though, then either using shuttles or renting a car is fine (strip casinos have free parking). the pool was FANTASTIC. whether it was noon or 9pm, the water always felt good. towels and water toys were provided (noodles, buckets, goggles, water volleyball). there was a cute little section with sand where children were usually playing. there was a volleyball net and several lifeguard stations (depending on the time of day, i saw one to three lifeguards). a previous poster mentioned not liking the gates to the pool. i didn't mind because 1) i carried my key whenever i left my room, so it wasn't an extra burden and 2), it made me feel more secure knowing that a stranger couldn't just walk into the pool area. there was a bbq pit behind the waterfalls with about 5 stations, but it was just TOO HOT for BBQing. the las vegas outlet center is right across the street and the stores had pretty good prices. this site has a listing of the stores: [--] the only other place that is close to TV is the Little Church of the West (the oldest chapel in Vegas). My parents renewed their vows there, so it was perfect for my family. the resort will hold your luggage for 24 hours after you check out (a bit early at 10am). this came in very handy since we had a midnight departure flight. my parents went to the time share presentation (2 hours), politely told them no thank you and received the usual timeshare gifts - casino credit ($100), 3 tickets to comedy shows, a japense show called mazuri (spelling?) and credit at a restaurant for lunch or dinner. there was a choice between those gifts or paying $20 for one of the cirque shows (zumanity at new york new york). TV has a red rock canyon tour for $2 and that was very nice. they also give hoover dam tours, but we found a cheaper price somewhere else, so i recommend looking around online first. all in all, we had a great time and would highly recommend tahiti village.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tahiti Village", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d628433-Reviews-Tahiti_Village-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$88 - $297*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7200 Las Vegas Blvd. S</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89119</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "628433", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ce/9b/d9/tahiti-village-full-kitchen.jpg"}}
