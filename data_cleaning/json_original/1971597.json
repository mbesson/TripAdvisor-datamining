Breakfast is different, so don't expect typical European buffet - some eggs and sausage, jam, basic cereal, but you're in Turkey so try olives, pickled vegetables, salty cheese, savory pastry and lots of yogurt. The hotel furnishings in the room are somewhat dated, and yes, the bathroom and balcony doors didn't shut properly and there could have been better lighting in the rooms, and if you don't shower before 8:30, the water may run out, but the view of the Bosphorous was spectacular, the balcony had a great street view and the sultan's lounge was an exotic touch and the tiles in the bathroom were colorful. It may not meet everyone's standards, but I liked it, and the location was absolutely fantastic. Eat lots of eggplant, many different ways, and visit the landmarks early to get the best photo shots with the least amount of people, because there are lots of queues. And drink freshly squeezed pomegranate at the fruit stalls, a great energy boost. And listen out for the muezzin during the day. I finally recommend introducing yourself to Istanbul initially with a hop on/off bus sightseeing tour starting at the Hippodrome to get your bearings of the city, a valuable introduction to the fantastic sights.

We arrived for a 5 days stay as its rating on booking.com was high and reviews were very favourable. The result: we ran away a day after, with a scandal. First, the address which they put on the web, for some reason, does not exist so we spent 30 min looking for it. Second, it is old. I have nothing against ancient houses with one requirement though - it should be clean. BUT this place is dirty, very-very dirty. The rooms are very small, dark, never renovated. Furniture set includes a bed or two with no carcasses, wardrobe with missing handles and a tiny TV with 3 channels. Each and every piece is falling apart there... There is no normal bathroom door, the substitute is a plastic folding curtain that does not close properly. Our friends got even a better deal: a toilet chair was located RIGHT IN THE shower cabin. Such rooms you normally get at 20 euro per night in a backpacker hostel, but not for 70 euro... We wanted to check out immediately, but the owner threatened that we would have to pay a penalty which included a one night stay (which was fine with us) PLUS some COMMISSION (?) which, as he said, he had to pay to booking.com for our reservation. After we contacted booking.com and filed a complaint, he went further threatening us that if we didn't pay FULL amount for 5 nights right away, he would call the police and would not let us go... At some point he went simply mad and started to behave like a cheap action movie character screaming things like \"this is my -- hotel\", \"I am the boss here\" and etc. That was bizarre... At the end, we paid him one night stay plus a penalty for another night in cash. Later on this day, however, he filed booking.com system a \"no-show\" for us so to be able to extract a \"no-show\" fee from the credit cards... So, we had to block them and complain again... I strongly discourage people from staying in this hotel. Though, you might be fascinated by old buildings and love it all there, but guests should not be treated in such a disgusting, disregarding manner... So, if you don't want to end up in a situation like ours, better go some place else... Our story had a happy end.

Our room had mould growing in the corners, a manually operated air conditioning unit which was too high for us to reach, a bathroom that was poorly lit, had no toiletries and was barely big enough for one person to move around in. There was only one plug point in the room, which was not enough to plug in the lamp, refrigerator and TV at the same time, so you had to choose which one you wanted to use. Overall, the hotel is shabby, ill-equipped and extremely badly managed. As others before me have said, the breakfast room can only hold about 10 people, so don't be surprised if you arrive there to find that you have to wait to eat breakfast. The selection of breakfast foods is extremely poor and we often had to ask for plates, cutlery, etc as there was often not enough clean crockery available. The only advantage to this hotel is that the location is very good, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia are all within 15 minutes walk of the hotel. However, there is an abundance of better (and cheaper!) hotels in the vicinity. All in all, our trip was definitely dampened by the terrible experience we had there. This hotel is by no means a 4* hotel, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a 2*.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201clocation great - room not so\u201d", "Author": "Traveller76England", "ReviewID": "UR28271713", "Content": "The location of this hotel is excellent and the staff are friendly.

The sink ridiculously low and hard to use without hitting your head on the shelf. My first morning there was no water.

I overheard a German guest mutter, 'this place is catastrophic' when we were trying to find a seat for breakfast. Also, the buffet had not been replenished and various items were dried up, I presume from having been put out for several days.

So before we started the trip, I told myself we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much of the rooms. The good services started even before we set off. Even though we booked this place via another website, we got an email from the hotel directly very soon asking about the airport pick-up. Knowing we travelled by train from Greece, they gave the info about direction from the train station. Other good services included offering us free (and this is extra) breakfast on our first day (since we arrived rather early), providing info with patience about sight-seeing, good services for serving breakfast etc. I also like the fact that you can use the internet on a hotel-provided laptop for free. As for the location, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close to the train station, just 2 min walk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worked for us perfectly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also close to everything else, the Topkali Palace, Ag.

Now, the room itself. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as I prepared to accept, but I could also understand why some previous guests said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not up to the level of a boutique hotel.

I spent a wonderful time sorrounded by a staff who was very pleaseble, attentinve and corteous. I recommend this place if you're travelling alone or with a group of friends. You'll have a blast and will find in some of their workers a good trip advisor or talker.

The food was fantastic and the staff so very friendly and helpful and courteous. Furthermore, there is a restaurant just around the corner called 'Urfalim' which I believe is linked to the GS. The food was the best we had our entire time in Istanbul and was very reasonably priced. Please don't be put off by the exterior as it was excellent. We'd like to thank Haleel, David and all the staff at the hotels who made our time in IStanbul so fantastic!
