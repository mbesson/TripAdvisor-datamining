They are the Bradford Inn, Bradford House, and Bradford on the Lake. My daughter and I stayed at the Bradford Inn for the 3rd time this year. My daughter says this place is her \"favorite place to stay\". When she says it's her favorite place to stay, she is not limiting this to Branson. It is simply her favorite place to stay. You will not find a lounge, game room, or swimming pool here. But what you will find is the most charming, quaint, out of the way place you will remember for a long time. If you want noise, lots of people and night life, then you want to be in the middle of Branson. But if you want something that is quiet, for the best night's sleep you have ever had, with a view of Branson from atop the ridge the hotel is built on, then don't pass this one up. The rooms are themed room that can be viewed on their web site. The hotel was built by Robert Westfall, and expertly decorated by his wife. From the time you drive through the white fence onto the property, you can't help but be charmed by the landscaping. And then you go to the other side of the hotel, and look down on Branson about a mile away. And if this wasn't enough, just wait until the night, when the lights of Branson fill the skyline. What a site. My particular room had a Safari theme. The room included a small refrigerator, an ironing board, and upon request, an iron. The refrigerator was nice for snacks, as the hotel is up the road a little ways from the nearest store or restaurant. In the morning, the owner, Robert Westfall, personally cooks up breakfast. You can tell, he really enjoys it too -- what a way to start the day. While he has a full commercial looking kitchen, he actually cooks up eggs on the counter in front of you on a griddle, while carrying on a conversation with his guest. He really is that personable. And the breakfast doesn't stop with eggs, he has cinnamon rolls, sausage, biscuits, sausage gravy, cereals, milk, orange juice, and, well, I'm sure I'm forgetting something...Oh, yeh, coffee (probably still forgetting something). He also serves lunch a few days a week, however, I was always out and about around lunch time. The other facilities owned by this family I understand are just as nice as the Bradford Inn.

Upon arrival, everything went well. This is a very charming place, and the location is great. The lady checking us in was very friendly, and the process was smooth and easy. When we got into our room, I was quite disappointed to see that although the picture on the website showed our room as having a four poster bed, it did not. Also, I did not realize that there was no separate shower, just the one in the jacuzzi tub. We were excited to see a nice gazebo with a wonderful view, overlooking Branson. However, that excitement was short-lived when we sat down to enjoy the view and quickly had several wasps flying around our faces. This place has what I would call an infestation of wasps. I understand that it's spring, and that there are going to be wasps around, but this was excessive. They are everywhere, all over the gazebo and flying right outside the door to our room. We took a walk around the property, and we could see wasps nests up in the eaves of the buildings, with numerous wasps flying all around them. Who wants to be stung by wasps while on vacation? The breakfast is your standard fare; eggs, Jimmy Dean sausage patties, biscuits and gravy, waffles, fruit, etc. The man preparing it wasn't overly friendly. The eating area was very, very crowded, so we ended up eating out on the deck, but that was nice. Our second morning there we went to Grand Country for breakfast, as we didn't want to contend with the crowd. The parking here is limited. I don't think we were ever able to park in front of our room. On the positive side, the bed was very, very comfortable. The housekeeping service was good. The jacuzzi tub was relaxing. The price was reasonable. However, given the wasp situation and the fact that our room was just your average, Super 8 style room, we probably will not return. I think we will stick with Aunt Sadie's when it comes to Branson B&B's.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Bed and Breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "javamamma", "ReviewID": "UR92177117", "Content": "We stayed at the Bradford Inn between Dec 27th-Jan. 1st.

The location is absolutely beautiful and it was a very pleasant and relaxing respite before heading back to work the following week. We divided our stay between the Carriage Room and the Secret Garden Room. The Carriage room was my favorite! I was a bit dissapointed that the jacuzzi tub and the fridge did not work in the Secret Garden, but it did not hamper our fun. I loved the fact that my daughter used the seperate sitting room as her own private retreat. She had her toys and games spread everywhere in her own space. These rooms were almost more like private apartments to me, although I believe the rooms all differ and do not all have sitting rooms. I travelled with my mother in law and 8 yr. old daughter. Greg made us breakfast everyday and it was delicious. He was super pleasant and fun to talk to. It was also fun to talk to people who were super friendly and from other parts of the country during breakfast time. Breakfast was generally the same menu every morning and we loved it! Eggs made to order, biscuits and gravy (my fav.), fruit compote, waffles, some mornings were coffee cakes, pastry items, cereals, juice and the coffee was GREAT. I am a very picky regular Starbucks customer so if I like the coffee- it's saying a lot. Overall, we loved our stay and hope to return to the Bradford Inn someday. I would also like to add the fact that the Bradford is just outside of town which I find to be a bonus, because you are away from all of the hustle bustle and traffic.

We stayed in the Gothic Room. It was nice with an electric fireplace, jacuzzi tub in the bay window, large bathroom, great king-sized bed, etc. The ONLY negative thing I have to say about the Bradford (and reason why it gets 4 stars and not 5) is that many things in the room seem very old and could be fixed very easily. There are quite a few marks and dings in the wall that need to be touched up, the a/c unit is an old one that cheaper hotel rooms use that must remain on constantly if you want it cool, the mini fridge needed defrosting and the temperature nob in it was broken off, and in the jacuzzi tub one of the knobs was missing. So, nothing that's going to make you not want to stay there, but there were quite a few small things that could easily be fixed up. The maid servis was great, every day the room was vacuumed, had new towels and the bed was done up very nicely. Also, the view from the Gothic room was amazing!

The Bradford Inn is a great option to the standard hotel stay in Branson.

The rooms above them are on the ground level (which is were you drive in off the highway) They also have rooms above the ground level rooms and a very few above them. The \"walk-out basement\" rooms are our least favorite. You drive around the inn, and down the hill and enter them from the rear. They resemble motel type rooms from the outside. Even though they are furnished deciently, they have an odd feel to them. I would highly recomend any of the rooms above them. When we brought are two kids, we booked the Eaves room - It is nice because there are basicly two small bedrooms that are connected with an open hallway with one small bathroom. As far as the furnishings- this is a FAMILY owned and operated INN. This is not a Westin or Hyatt. Everything has a homey feel to it, as though it is someone's own furnishings. Everything has always been very clean and functional. Take note when booking a room with a \"jacuzzi\". You can get one by itself, or you might get one that is part of the shower in your bathroom (not that appealing to us).

Don't get me wrong, it's not like they are mean and grumpy old folks- I guess I just expect them to be really nice and they never are. Check-in has always seemed like it was a bit of a bother for them. Breakfast as well, I just for some reason or another, expect to be greeted by these talkative, happy people and we never are. (Please don't stay there because of that.... It's just my quirky observation) The food has always been good- 7:30 to 9:30 is the time allowed. (7;30-10:00) would be nice for late risers. You will have to check-out an iron at the front desk, kind of annoying since there is already a board in the room. Also, for you exercisers - there is really no place to walk/run, unless you drive and park your car some where. The Inn is located on a busy road, with no shoulder to walk or run on.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan, USA", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful spot, homey and close to the strip\u201d", "Author": "Jetz", "ReviewID": "UR16545236", "Content": "Stayed here with my mom and we both were quite comfortable.

Mom's handicap accessible room featured roll in shower and hand rails. The rooms were clean, but in some cases could use a bit of touch up paint. Breakfast was served in a sunny, large dining area. Owners cooked eggs or waffles to order and also offered fresh fruit, cereal, coffee cakes, beverages and more. We loved the country setting of the inn and preferred this to staying closer to the strip or in a chain hotel. The theaters and restaurants were 5 minutes away and it was easy to get to the Yellow, Red and Green routes that keep you from sitting so long on the strip.

Our room was OK, but it was sparcely furnished. had no view of the mountains. We did not have a coffee maker in the room. There was no hairdryer, or shampoo for that matter. We had an ironing board but no iron. These things we have become accustomed to having for our convenience. So be sure you bring everything you may need prior to booking this place. I guess what I am saying is there was no attention to details here. The breakfast was OK, but far from great. It consisted of coffee cakes from the freezer section at the discount warehouse, and fruit from a can. They did make good waffles while you waited. Breakfast was served on paper plates and you ate with plastic forks. I have had better breakfast at Holiday Inn Express. The innkeepers were not the warm and welcoming people that we had seen mentioned in other reviews. In fact the lady at the front desk never smiled, never welcomed us, and never mentioned what the property had to offer. She was more concerned with going over the rules of the property and having us sign a statement that we knew the rules of the property. Not a real warm fuzzy moment. More like going off to summer camp with the camp counselor from Hell. I am not sure if she was the Innkeeper, she never identified nor introduced herself to us.

The Secret Garden room is on the end of the building - so there was nothing to clutter the view. What a beautiful Fall morning! Breakfast was great and everyone was SUPER friendly! We saw Cirque on Friday night - pretty good show - especially since it was FREE with some connections we have (we live just north of Branson). The best part of the Bradford is the PRICE! It was $89 for a Friday night when Big Cedar was asking either $149 or $269. YIKES! The room wasn't your standard hotel room - and we liked that. One cool thing they have is a journal in each room where past guests could write about their experience. It was interesting to see the entries from past guests - especially the one written the evening of September 11, 2001. Anyway - I HIGHLY recommend it!

After my husband and youngest son fell asleep in the king size bed, my oldest son folded out the sofa sleeper and began reading.

I returned to the king size bed and also found several small bugs in the pillows and on the bed there. I woke my husband and he went immediately to the innkeeper, who promptly gave us The Pheasant Room downstairs. The next day we did a little \"research\" and discovered the bugs in our room were bedbugs. While in the Pheasant Room, we misplaced the remote control. I looked under the bed and found two empty soda bottles, and the post cap to the bed. I also found three porn magazines and dirty underwear in a dresser drawer, not to mention the dirty wadded up grocery bag in the tv stand.

We had a home cooked breakfast every morning (7:30-9:30), and coffee is ready by 7:00. Best time to ride the \"strip\" to plot/plan everything by car is early morning - especially before 10:00. After that, there are two or three alternate routes that go above and below the city. Once you get to know these routes, navigating is a snap. The best shows we saw were Jimmy Osmond, Shoji Tabuchi, Country Tonite, Jim Stafford, and Legends. We saw other shows too, but these were the best. We felt the train ride was not worth it. Not much to see as everything is overgrown. You must visit the Candlestick Inn for lunch (dinner is expensive). Great view, great food, and great lunch prices. Downtown, Mr. B's for ice cream! We didn't visit Silver Dollar City or Celebration City as they're more geared for children with a lot of rides (roller coasters, etc.).
