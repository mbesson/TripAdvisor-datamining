{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't make the same mistake we did In late July we made the mistake at staying at this hotel. We had spent the last 7 days in Munich and Nuremburg and had been staying in wonderful hotels for around $200/night. For this comfort property, we paid nearly that amount and can honestly it was the nastiest hotel I've ever stayed in. Stains all over the carpet, old, musty, and out-dated furniture and the bathroom was disgusting.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR366178505", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "napolinicholas"}, {"Content": "Good value. Stayed here for three nights in June.Not too easy to find, we had to wander around for a while.Anyway, we booked because it was cheap and close to the airport. Staff were very friendly and the room was spacious with a large bathroom. cleanliness and standard was just average but I liked the fact there were supermarkets (with bakerys) and a few restaurants just a few minutes walking distance away. Breakfast buffet was great, a lot to choose from and fresh. I would book this hotel again and would reccommend it for those who are after value.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR704006682", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "winky_7"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for For a rate of 63 euros, breakfast included, reasonable value. It would seem that some reviewers may have been ripped off by a taxi as there is a flat rate from the hotel to the airport of 18 euros |(Airport to hotel was 22 euros, but airport taxis are always more)Rooms were fine - clean, well priced mini-bar, TV with CNN, and an excellent breakfast.My grumble was the hotel advertised a restaurant open Monday - Saturday, plus bar. Well, Saturday night, our arrival at 7.45pm, everything closed! We had to wander out to a nearby shopping precinct to find Mexican burgers.Nobody should expect too much from a 63 euro hotel. I doubt if many stay more than one night, and it serves the purpose.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR309128170", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SunderlandMackem"}, {"Content": "Filthy! I booked our family of 5 to stay here on the last night of a 2 week trip to Germany because it was at the airport and Frankfurt requires you to arrive 3 hours prior to your flight. I was glad to see that I could get 2 king beds since we have 3 children.This was the filthiest hotel I have ever seen and we ended up going to the Steigenberger (MUCH more expensive but MUCH nicer) because we could not allow our family to stay somewhere like that. The first thing we noticed was the stained carpeting and not only was it stained, it wasn't even vacuumed. There were NOT 2 king beds, they were double beds with king headboards! There was a dead bug on one of the pillows, there were cigarette burns on the furniture and the towels were thin and frayed at the edges. They were suitable for the carwash!!!When I called Comfort Hotels customer service about it they said the hotels are independently owned and operated. I'll never stay at any of their hotels again.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR396833487", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "crossranch"}, {"Content": "Not so comfortable... We stayed in this hotel before our flight home because it was near the airport. Thankfuly we only spent one night there. The hotel is located in a sort of light industrial area near the airport. It was a little hard to find since the major cross streets near the hotel are not accessible from the autobahn. Unlike the previous reviewer, we found no air conditioning at this hotel. It was really hot outside and the air did not circulate through the window and into the room, so we were hot and sweaty all night. Also, there were trucks and cars driving by our window at all hours of the night, keeping us from sleeping too. The bathroom had a tiny shower, and only offered economy sized squeeze bottles of hand soap in the shower. One plus was that it did have a hair dryer. The rooms are accessed by old fashioned keys, and the door was so thin that I probably could have punched a hole in it. Probably the worst part of the hotel is the restaurant. I don't know why we decided to eat there, but we did. Its an Indian restaurant. We tried to order several things from the menu but the chef, who also ran the front desk, didn't have the ingredients to cook them. We finally found something that he had the ingredients for, and as he was prepaing the food, we heard a lot of coughing and sneezing, which was unappetizing. We didn't want to be rude, so we stayed on for the meal, even though we wanted to leave. The food was edible, but very bland. I think the guy genuinely tried to cook something good, but it came out quite flavorless. In all, I would not recommend this hotel. Next time we will spend a little more to stay at the Sheraton that's connected to the Frankfurt airport.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR570670488", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great place Nice clean hotel, and what is more important, this one has this wonderful invention called air conditioning (not so many hotels in Europe are aware of this one). Fabulous restaurant just down the street. Great breakfast. No noise at all, despite being close to the airport. The only drawback is that they have no shuttle from the airport, and this will add 30 Euro to the 75-Euro price tag (this includes breakfast).
