They are helpful and caring in everthing they do and always have smiles on their faces. We left happy as never before and felt like friends to these lovely people. The location of the hotel is in my opinion perfect; it's situated close (walking distance) to some of the major sights (i.e. Fontana di Trevi and the Spanish steps) and yet in a quiet and cosy neigbourhood. Rome is a rather busy and noisy city at all hours, but thanks to the great location of the hotel we slept like royalties. The beds were firm and comfortable, which also contributed to good night sleep. You find public transportation really closeby and we can really recommend bus line 80 from Via Boncompagni, which takes you directly into the middle of the city centre (i.e. Via del Corso and Piazza Venezia) in a couple of minutes. We stayed att a superior double room and were more than satisfied. It was clean, spacious enough and had air conditioning. The bathroom was big and fresh with shower cabin. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was delicious with omelette, bacon, sausages, bread, cheese, yoghurt and lovely croissants with chocolate. Great coffe and warm milk as well! The reception has 24 hour service and there are security boxes for safe keeping in the rooms. When we visit Rome next time we will stay at this top of the line hotel again for sure!

They recommended the best routes to take, how to maximize our time and trips, they were just wonderful. We enjoyed Rome so much and largely due to them! They welcome you in and you can feel that they truly want you to enjoy your time in Rome and at their establishment. You can see the pride in their service. Hotel: Cozy, very clean and in a great location. Its a \"budget price\" but way above other budget hotels and B&Bs and I'd give a 3.5 star hotel ranking. We went every where from here. There is plenty within walking distance or a short bus ride. Even for the Vatican, Colosseum, Spanish Steps we never took more than 15 mins to get there. Great pizzerias, wine shops and delis all around on the same street. We ate at the La Bruschetta 3x, right below our room window and loved it. Room: Double Room Superior - Clean, large bathroom (in ours), robes, great lighting, large windows to leave open and take in the sights and sounds around us. Bed and pillows were comfy. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, sound comes in through the door but only is a slight problem if it is quiet in your room and not if you are talking or watching TV. I'm a light sleeper and slept soundly with my ear plugs. Breakfast: Excellent, fresh, plentiful and the variety was outstanding. It completely fueled us for our long days out.

This hotel was certainly the best place I could have chosen to put up for the 4 memorable days in Rome. The people especially Giuseppe were so helpful and friendly that I simply cannot find words to express my gratitude. The breakfast in the mornings was huge and varied so no complaints there. There was a wide assortment of baked goodies and simply put a gourmand's dream. Being a vegetarian, I did not want to eat the omelette with ham in it, so they made fresh omelette for me even though I did not ask for it. They had high speed internet included with the room tariff (which was not the case in our other hotels). The two brothers at the front desk were always ready to patiently explain the travel routes, the best places to eat and the easiest way to plan our day travels. In addition to being extremely patient with our multudes of questions they were also very forthcoming with helpful hints to getting around in Italy. Not only that, they also helped us figure out the cheapest fares to our later trips to Venice and Florence. As a family hotel they had a very personal approach to the hospitality unlike the more professional B&Bs. Being near the Borghese Garden, it was also literally minutes away from most of the sights in Rome. If you get a Roma Pass, you really do not need anything better. The best part of our trip was that they even agreed to keep our extra pices of luggage in storage so we could travel light and reclaim our bags on our last night of stay. The rooms were nice and airy and the beds were very comfortable.

It was our first trip to Rome and we were on a bit of a budget. This hotel was very good value, as we only paid just over \u00a3200 for the whole stay. The hotel is in an old fashioned apartment block, on the first floor. The location is set back from the main, very busy area of the city but it felt very safe and civilised. After lots of sightseeing and battling our way down the Corso, it was a welcome relief to be somewhere a bit quieter. We had a nice welcome from the guy on reception, who gave us a map and showed us the routes to walk to the main sights. I'm sure he would have given us lots more information and help had we needed it, but we already had most things planned. Our room was pretty tiny but they don't pretend otherwise on their website so we knew what to expect. It had all the storage and other facilities we could need, and everything was very clean. A great bonus was the large fridge and good value mini bar. We also had a TV with BBC world, which was a bonus. Breakfast was the only disappointment of our stay. I think the problem is that they put things like pastries and toast out first thing, but that's it,so if you come to breakfast later it's the same round of toast etc. This means we endured quite a lot of rock hard pastry and very chewy cold toast. Coffee and juice were nice, but they're trying to do too much. If they cut down on the large and random selection of cakes, and just did more fresh toast it would be an improvement. The other amusing thing is that breakfast is meant to be served from 07.30, but the day we visited the Vatican so needed to leave early, we were sent back to our room until 8am as breakfast 'wasn't quite ready'!

Booked one room which was ok - probably double with added bed, but it was comfortable and room also had a wardrobe with plenty of coathangers. Not a great deal of space for laying out clothes but would be fine for two people I think. Arrived in Rome late evening and took a taxi to the hotel. The driver had to look up the hotel location on his satnav and even then he had some difficulty finding the hotel as it is tucked away off the main road, Via Veneto. Price from the airport, Fumiumicino, is 40euros. The driver tried to charge me another 9 euros for 3 pieces of hand luggage but relented quickly when challenged. Take some tranquilisers before you get into the taxi, either that or keep your eyes shut until you get to the hotel because the driving is manic - also crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing means nothing as you will still be fair game for any motorised vehicle in the vicinity of the crossing. To be fair the hotel supplied details of how to get to the hotel and the information was worthwhile. On the way home, because we were leaving at lunchtime and because by then I was more familiar with the city, we took the Terravision Shuttle bus from the station Termini to the airport, costing 6 euros each. The hotel is small, which in my opinion is certainly not a negative, maybe 8-9 rooms. The staff are very friendly and keen to give advice on where to visit, how to get there, where to eat etc and this was very helpful when you first arrive. The entrance to the hotel is slightly unusual because It seems like a residential block with other people, not hotel guests, also living in the building and using the same entrance door. Later in the evening the outer door is locked and you need to buzz reception from outside in order to gain access. The room was fairly large and nicely decorated but the shower room/toilet was quite small and compact. Everything was very clean and the towels were changed daily. It is a family owned hotel and there is attention to detail and any problems, if they should occur, would I am sure, be dealt with promptly by the owners. There is also internet signal available and you need to ask at reception for the code. Breakfast was continental with a selection of meats, rolls, cheese, coffee, juice etc. It was perfectly adequate and a good start to the day.

Hotel Golden is a small, and extremely well kept family run hotel, located just one block off Via Veneto, and across the street form Borghese gardens. The area is busy, but clean and safe, and services such as groceries, cafes', wine shops, restaurants, ATM's, and bus lines are available within one to two blocks. Our room, #111, a \"Double Superior\" was located on the corner of the building, and had a view of one the few remaining sections of the wall that once surrounded Rome. We had much more space than I had imagined there would be. Our room was large and inviting, and featured a King size bed, two night stands, desk and chair, cable television, an upholstered chair, armoire, and a luggage stand. The bathroom was quite large, and included a large single sink, shower, commode, bidet, table, chair, and hair drier. Heat, which was turned on later in the evening, was more than adequate. It was provided via an over door unit in the bedroom, and a radiant wall unit in the bathroom that also served as a towel rack. Something that is important for those with accessability issues to know, is that this hotel could be somewhat challenging for those in wheel chairs, or having difficulty with steps. You must traverse several half steps between the street and the small iron/wood Otis elevator. The first floor hall is narrow, and some rooms have a step up into the bathroom. Use of the commode in some of the rooms is tight as well. Ours required stepping between the shower and bidet for access. Knowing all of this, I think you will find Hotel Golden to be a comfortable respite from your time spent discovering Rome. We were greeted by Giuseppe upon arrival early in the morning. Our room was not quite ready, but after checking with Mama Teresa we were invited to enjoy a liesurely breakfast while our room was prepared. Afterward Giuseppe went over details about transportation and sites in the city, and offered recommendations for ding and groceries. All of his recommendations were eventually put into play, and every one was spot on in regards to quality, value, and location. Hotel Golden is not for everyone, but if you enjoy the warmth of a home spun atmosphere, a cozy breakfast, friendly and honest people, and meticulous cleanliness you should enjoy the Lorio family, and their \"Hotel Golden\"!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keller, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFamily Run Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Caseymjobe", "ReviewID": "UR121035456", "Content": "We visited February 2009.

The breakfast is also peculiar; there is a great variety of choices, but everything is presented in miniature form: mini omelets, mini french toast, mini pancakes, mini bread, mini cereal bowls--perhaps because the breakfast area is so tiny. We soon learned to pile up our (small) plates as if we only had one pass through the buffet because once the breakfast room was full it was very hard to navigate and jockey for position between the tables and the food display.

Giuseppe and Marco speak excellent English and \"tolerated,\" with a smile, my rudimentary Italian. The location was perfect at the entrance to the Borghese Park and walking distance from the Spanish Steps. The family could not have been more helpful. They arranged for the car to pick us up at Fiumicino, as well as the same car service to take us to the port at Civitavecchia - which was much less than if we had \"caught\" the cruiseline \"bus\" who-knows-where! They also offered to arrange for the service to pick us up 13 days later at the port to take us to the airport. The car service was excellent, too. Reliable, on-time, and courteous transportation is certainly a fear for travelers in a foreign country. Our three experiences were very good and Hotel Golden was key to linking us with that company.

Finding a quiet haven in Rome is miraculous. From a previous visit we knew the Villa Borghese area could be relatively peaceful. Based largely on TripAdvisor reviews, we chose to stay in April at the Hotel Golden. This is not a place to see-and-be-seen, nor a high-style boutique hotel sporting the latest trendy decor. But this is the place to stay with the Roman family you never knew you had! The hotel occupies a residential building on a quiet street less than a block from Villa Borghese Park \u2013 a godsend for families with children because there is plenty of room to run around in the park. We arrived via the car service hired through the hotel \u2013 an easy, stress-free option. The small reception area and tiny breakfast room are on the 2nd floor \u2013 there is no lobby. We were upgraded to the family suite, and while two of the extra bedrooms remained locked (and unseen), the space we had available was enormous, particularly by European standards - a large, high-ceilinged bedroom (king bed + twin day bed), a dining room, bathroom and large vestibule. We were wallowing in space! It\u2019s difficult to overstate the care with which the family caters to their guests. We overslept the first morning, missing the open hours in the breakfast room. Without asking, Mama whipped up coffee and breakfast for us. On another day, when we planned to dine elsewhere for breakfast, they held the kitchen open until we appeared because they thought we\u2019d overslept again. Such attention is unheard of in a typical hotel! Being in the family suite on the 3rd floor required a family member to escort us to unlock the outer door, so someone was always on hand with a smile and concern that our day was a happy one. Kudos to the Loria family for a charming, well-run inn! We absolutely recommend the Hotel Golden to anyone looking to be treasured by family in Rome.

It wasn't the best breakfast in the world, but for a free meal, it was definitely appreciated. Free wi-fi is provided by the hotel, which was extremely helpful in planning our days in Rome. I highly recommend a pizza place just down the street on Via Marche. Take a right out of the hotel and it's a few blocks down on your left. I don't recall a name, but the pizza was delicious! I also recommend a nearby gelato shop down on Via Sardegna called Caffe Lotti. Their gelato is absolutely to die for and the lady running the shop was very friendly and welcoming. For transportation, the Spagna metro station is technically the closest, however I would recommend the Barberini station instead. It's a little further, but the hill is a bit more gradual up to the hotel than from Spagna, which starts downhill and then takes you back uphill. The Villa Borghese is just steps away from the hotel and a great place to just walk around and explore. You can rent bicycles, go to a movie, visit a museum all in this little area.

Initially we were worried when finding out that it would be about a 10-minute walk to the two closest Metro stations (Barberini and Spagna). Turned out that major sites such as Pantheon, Fountain of Trevi, Piazza Navona, and Spanish Steps were all within an easy walking distance from Hotel Golden. And the walks to the Metro stations, esp. to Barberini along Via Venetoi, were also very pleasant and not inconvenient at all. Even the Vatican was walkable, if you would not mind walking for half an hour. Second, the hotel was spotlessly clean and well cared for. We were, thanks to the kindness of the owners' family, upgraded to the superior room for the price of the regular double, and everything was immaculate. And the room was very large by the European standards. Last, but not the least, the owner's family was so wonderfully helpful. They showed us immediately upon check-in those places where the locals would eat and drink, so that we would not pay the extra \"tourist prices.\" The map marked with the \"right places\" that we received upon check-in was invaluable.

We were very disappointed. Although the bathroom was small and the room itself was poorly lit, we were okay with this as this is quite common in Europe. It was the indifference of the owner/staff that was the real disappointment. The front desk of the hotel is staffed by the 2 brothers (40ish) who are pleasant, but the older couple (likely their parents) are just rude. The father does not seem to care to say good morning to you - and will think nothing of walking in front of you while you are struggling with your luggage. The mother rarely grunted a hello to us...I think it was day 6 when she said good morning. Hotel: the hotel is made up of 15 of so rooms, but they are all located on the second floor of a 5 storey building that has mixed uses in it. To gain entrance into the hotel, you had to use an intercom buzzer at the front door. We felt like we were entering/leaving a prison. There is no sitting area or waiting room if you every wanted to step out of your room for a while. The breakfast room in very tiny, only 6 tables and we had to stand and wait for a table several days. Breakfast - truly not at all like the pictures on the webite. They only put out enough eggs for one person at a time....odd...and the \"mother\" stands in the kitchen doorway and watches the food you put on your plate...it made you feel very uncomfortable. One morning we entered the room for breakfast 1/2 hour before the breakfast time was over and there was not bread (not a bun, croissant, nothing). We asked the older woman (not the mother) for some bread and she just shrugged her shoulders and said under her breath in Italian \"that we should have come soorner if we wanted bread\"! Restfulness - not at all. We heard other guests complain that they could hear everything in the next rooms. We were unlucky to have the room across from the reception desk (again, the entire hotel is all on the 2nd floor of this building). We heard everyone coming in and out and talking to the hosts at the front desk. And again, unlucky us, our room was beside the \"parents/owner\" of the hotel who live there on site. They had no courtesy for us as guests to keep their voices down even after 11pm to allow their paying guests to get a restful sleep. Sometimes it seemed that they were all yelling at each other about the running of the hotel - I know, sounds comical, but not when you want to rest after a busy day of sight-seeing in Rome. Location: In the north end of the walled City. I suggest you take the transit out to your furtherest destination and then explore/make your way back on foot to enjoy all that Rome has to offer. If you are wanting a restful sleep and to be treated with courtesy, I think you would be better at another hotel.

The staff is very helpful, but not overly friendly -- but they are not cold by any means. I think they are just typical Romans. They answer your questions and get you what you need in a very courteous manner and then they leave you alone. The breakfast buffet was very good every morning. Free WIFI. The cable TV was a little screwed up in our room, but we didn't mind that as much because we brought a travel DVD player for the moments we just wanted to kick back.

Sightseeing was our main objective, therefore the majority of each day and evening we would be out and about in Rome. At the end of each exhausting day, what was important to us was a comfortable night\u2019s sleep in a clean room with a functional bathroom. We checked out the top 30 hotels in Rome listed on TripAdviser and shortlisted five. We chose the Hotel Golden for the following reasons: Price [breakfast included], location, free WiFi, complete no smoking policy and most importantly the overwhelming positive reviews. We weren\u2019t disappointed. [Tip] I emailed the Hotel and through them, booked the saloon car airport pick-up service. At \u20ac40 + \u20ac2 airport tax it was cheaper than booking directly. Marco and Giuseppe took care of the arrangements and kept me updated. [Tip] On arrival at the Hotel, the driver will require payment in cash. The Hotel is situated on the first floor and is accessed by stairs or a small antique style lift [we used both]. We were checked in by Maria and Giuseppe who proceeded to highlight on a map the tourist attractions, the best routes to take, the location of public transportation, a local pizzeria and restaurant etc., etc. This map and their local knowledge proved invaluable. Our room was a Classic Double which overlooked a pizzeria. The window was double glazed. The bed was firm but comfortable. There was Sky TV but the majority of programmes transmitted were not in English. Pay per view TV was an option but not tried. There was a mini bar/fridge, wardrobe with small chest of draws and room safe [too small to house a Laptop], a sofa bed, two bedside cabinets, telephone, dressing table and chair, wall mirror and a table lamp on an occasional table where some sweets/candy were placed every day. The flooring was tile. There was an adjustable air conditioning unit above the entrance door but being on the first floor we just opened the window for some fresh air. Our room had two spare electricity wall sockets, three if the table lamp was unplugged. The bathroom housed a \u201cTelephone Box\u201d type shower cubicle with adjustable shower head. The cubicle was small but OK. There was a toilet, bidet and hand basin with wall mirror, extendable shaving mirror and hairdryer. A disposable razor and shaving balm were provided as well as a shower cap and sachets of body wash/shampoo etc., which were replaced daily. Bath and hand towels were white and clean and replaced when necessary. There was also an extractor fan, chair and shelving. The flooring was tile. Lighting was adequate throughout. The rooms were clean, nicely decorated and serviced daily. Room service was available but not tried. Maria, Marco, Giuseppe, if you read this review, two slight criticisms: The shower water could have been a fraction warmer and after we had returned home and revisited your website we realised that the bathrobe and slippers you state that you normally provide, were absent. Overlooking a Pizzeria, we expected some noise but this didn\u2019t bother us too much. If you like complete quiet, I would suggest that you request a room located elsewhere. WiFi connectivity in the room was excellent. The inclusive breakfast was good. Tea, coffee, milk, juice, flavoured yoghurts, cold meats, various cheeses, boiled eggs, omelette strips with bacon, various rolls, butter, cakes, croissants, biscuits and more besides. All were constantly replenished. The breakfast room is quite small with the maximum amount of tables fitted in, so it maybe a little awkward if like me you\u2019re a tad overweight. The Hotel website states that there is also a coin operated laundry, private garage with a collection and delivery service and newspapers available. We never checked out the laundry facilities, had no car to garage and didn\u2019t request a newspaper. We asked Giuseppe to arrange for a saloon car to take us back to the airport. He made the booking, confirmed it and kept in contact with the driver. When the Mercedes arrived, Giuseppe came down to the front entrance, introduced us to the driver and stayed until we departed. The charge [payable to the driver in cash] was \u20ac40 as the \u20ac2 tax is not applied for journeys back to the airport. This boutique Hotel is family run and has a real family atmosphere about it. The hotel is situated in Via Marche close to the Villa Borghese park in what appears to be a safe area. The main tourist attractions are all within 0.5 to 3 kms approx, nevertheless there was still plenty of walking to be done. [Tip] To make best use of your time, take a taxi ride either to or from an attraction. There is a taxi rank within two minutes walk of the Hotel. Expect to pay \u20ac6 to \u20ac13 per journey approx. Be aware of dishonest LICENSED taxi drivers using METERED cabs. Two such drivers, parked on a rank in front of St. Peter\u2019s Square informed us that the fare back to the Hotel would be between \u20ac23 and \u20ac27. That would only be true if they took the scenic route around Rome to boost the fare!! For the more adventurous, there\u2019s always the bus or metro. [Tip] If attending the Pope\u2019s address in St. Peter\u2019s Square [Wednesday mornings, weather permitting], choose a different day when it\u2019s less crowded to visit the Basilica and Vatican museum. Giolitti ice-cream parlour [recommended by Giuseppe] and a short walk from the Pantheon, is a must do although ice-cream purchased from other establishments was also pretty good. So what\u2019s not to like about Rome? For us just one thing - the illegal street traders who accosted us non-stop. Would we return to Rome again: Yes! Would we return to the Hotel Golden again: Yes! Would we recommend the Hotel Golden to others: Yes!

Despite a considerable language barrier (mainly due to our very poor Italian) he pointed out a few sights and before we knew it we were at the Hotel Golden. Now I've started with the driver because ultimately this illustrates perfectly what's special about this hotel. The attention to service and detail is quite a revelation in this age of high volume hotels filled with low-paid staff. It is without doubt this element that sets Hotel Golden apart from any other mid-priced (and possibly even upper priced) establishment in Rome. The owners and staff go to great lengths to ensure pre-arrival service is great as well during your stay. If there are two or more of you then the car service is a really great travel option from the airports, which are quite a distance from the city and would require a train journey followed by a mixture of metro/bus/walk/taxi depending on what you want to do. A word on the location, it\u2019s good for both walking the city and access to bus and metro, if you want to be in the centre of nightlife then a little closer to Campo di Fioro or Piazza Navona might better suit. However, if you want to retire to a slightly more genteel area at bedtime then the hotel is perfect. An eye wateringly expensive cocktail at Harry\u2019s bar is a nice treat at the end of a long day and then you can fall into bed after a two minute walk. You can walk to the Coliseum in 30mins and the Vatican in 40mins. The hotel is very well located for getting to the Appian way which is about 7 stops from Barberini metro (Antica Appian or something like that) and then hop on the 660 bus straight off the metro. The bus turns around at the Appian Way and goes back to the Metro stop. So you can't really get lost. A trip out to the catacombs and Appian Way is a perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of Rome as well. A final recommendation on stuff to do in the area is to go to the Cappucin Crypt located a few mins walk down the Via Veneto towards Piazza Barberini. It\u2019s quite extraordinary and moving in a strange way. So onto the hotel itself, its a small and discreet place and I\u2019ve stayed in similar family run places in Florence and Venice. I'd highly recommend these sorts of small hotel as you get excellent value for money as well as great service. As with others of its kind, there is no flashy entrance or palatial reception. Although if you pay attention you'll notice the entrance to the building is quite grand in an understated way. Up a flight of stairs you find yourself in a small and tidy reception with the hotel rooms and breakfast area all on the same floor. We had room 103 which is a superior with cosy and tasteful decoration, enough space to swing a couple of cats if so wished, and a spotlessly clean bathroom. Our friends stayed in 104, which was perhaps not quite a nice as it has a more awkward shape, but more than adequate none the less. I suspect the standard rooms may be a little on the small side and would definitely recommend going for a superior if your budget allows. The double glazing in the rooms is first rate you can barely here any street noise. That said the sound proofing out to reception is poor and so there is disturbance from general conversations or guests arriving / leaving. I don't think there is anything that the hotel could do about this given its size, so I would merely say to light sleepers you should bring some ear-plugs otherwise you might be woken by people departing early with the dragging of cases down the corridor or check out chatter. Breakfast is in a little room off the main corridor and it can be quite busy or cramped, we had to wait a few minutes one morning for a table to become free. Not such a big deal, but of you are a family of four there are no tables that take more than 3 people, we found families had to take two tables which meant it could be a little busy at times. The food however, is lovely with so many delicious cakes and pastries supplemented by juice, meats, cheese, cereal, eggs you name it. The omelette in particular is delicious as are the cake - a veritable feast by! Finally a few words about the main reason to stay at this hotel above all else - the family who run it. A harder working, helpful and friendly set of people must surely be hard to find in Rome. They gave great advice and guidance about travel, restaurants, how to get from A to B etc that our short stay in the city was perfect. I didn't really appreciate this until our last evening when we were chatting to a fellow traveller in a bar off Piazza Navona who had just paid 115 euro for two main courses and a couple of drinks for two people. We had been sent to fabulous trattoria full of Iocals where people were waiting in the street for tables. We paid less than 100 euro for 4 people for delicious food and great wine and hadn't really appreciated until that point what great advice the hotel had shared with us and how helpful they had been in a very unflashy way. So the hotel is clean, in a good location and well priced, but above all else it is run by gracious and helpful people and that's the main reason to stay there above anywhere else.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWhat a delight...peaceful stay.\u201d", "Author": "FleaBag08", "ReviewID": "UR99692945", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Golden.

We stayed in the family suite on the second floor. It was very quiet and roomy, even the bathroom! An enjoyable breakfast is provided in the morning, with treats like chocolate croissants but also good healthy staples like eggs and yogurt. We have stayed in \"four star\" type hotels like Hilton before, and I felt far more comfortable and welcome at Hotel Golden. The location is very nice as well. Rome can be a little bit like running the gauntlet at times, noisy and crowded and a bit non stop when you are hitting the more touristy areas. Hotel Golden provides a spot of oasis, located just off Via Veneto right by the Borghese park--quiet and calm, yet still a close walk to attractions like the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps and the Barberini metro stop. If you are running late there are taxis that tend to queue just around the corner as well. There were great restaurants around the area, and we stopped in at Lotti almost every night for some gelato.

We knew we'd be arriving late and had said this when booking the hotel - there was no issue. We took a taxi from Spagna metro station after getting lost - we should have read the instructions received from the hotel instructing us to get off at Barberini, only two stops away from Rome Termini. It's a 10 minute walk from Barberini, all uphill but at a gentle enough incline through Via Veneto - a throwback to Il Dolce Vita and you can still see the 5* hotels on the road along with the US Embassy. Checkin was hassle free, Marco provided a map, showed us the area, recommended routes to walk and places to visit and showed us the nearest convenience store. The room was 103 which was right next to the check in desk, it was a superior Twin, an upgrade from the Classic that we booked. The internet was fast, the room was spotless, the bathroom was large and clean. The A/C is really a heater, so if you want to cool your room down you've got to open the windows - perfect thing to do in February, nice 10C air cools it down fast! The family that run the hotel are all very nice and friendly, especially Marco and Guiseppe who were only too happy to assist us with booking for Villa Borghese, ordering a taxi for the return to Termini etc. They both spoke flawless English, while we spoke very little Italian so they were a real help. The breakfast is the typical continental fare, but definitely adequete though we didn't avail of it much ourselves, preferring to eat on the go. Speaking about 'the go', 45 minutes walking or less will get to you the Colosseum or the Vatican. 10 minutes to the Metro, 7 minutes to the bus 63 that'll take you to Travestere, 15 minutes to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps or the Galleria Borghese. 20-25 to the Pantheon and that area. It's a prime hotel location. This is a hotel that cares for it's guests - I left my room after 12pm on some days having heard cleaning going on about 9/10am and still found it had been tidied upon my return. It was really unexpected and really made me feel like a valued guest, one they aimed to please. Top this all off with a lovely post-trip email making sure I'm doing well and asking me to write a review here on Tripadvisor if it wasn't too much trouble - something I'm clearly only too happy to do after all they did for me!

This means that it has a cold floor, so bring slippers. The noise from outside the hotel was barely noticeable, even though we were on the first floor. This is attributable to the modern windows which had sufficient soundproofing to dampen the noise from outside. There was absolutely no noise from our neighbours. The room and bathroom was made up everyday while we were away. Breakfast was always served in the morning in the dining room. I suggest giving it a miss if your into hot food, but I found it more than adequate for my needs. There was a selection of cold meats and rolls as well as the obligatory cereal.

I was so pleased to be met by friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and I admit, English-speaking staff. Giuseppe and his sister and brother, who run the hotel, could not have been more caring about whether or not I had a good time in their city. After paying E70 for the cab ride from Fiumicino Airport to the Hotel, Giuseppe informed me that the driver had ripped me off--there is a flat rate for E40 by which drivers are legally bound to abide. I was disgusted. For this reason, he and his siblings arrange for their guests to be picked up at the airport. Little did I realize that that was the reason why. On departure, I did use that service and was pleased to tip the driver well for not ripping me off!!! After my experience with the thief cab driver, I think Giuseppe understood I was naive (even for a New Yorker!) and tried to help me manage his frenetic, crazy, \"chancey\" city as best he could, with explicit instructions for walking to Villa Borghese, getting to the Metro, finding a special flea market on 19 Sett. He could not have been more kind. Sleeping: The bed, I have to say, must have been nearly brand new--the mattress was nice and \"hard\" (supportive). I had the best nights' sleep in my two weeks in Italy. It was so terrific that I even commented on it to Mr. Giuseppe. The windows in the small room were excellent, thick enough to block out the evening noise in conjunction with its A+ air conditioning. The bathroom was rather large, I thought, for a single, by Italian standards and even contained a bidet. Little extras like a disposable razor and callous-softening rock were included with the bath give-aways--a very nice surprise, and meaningful for people traveling from countries where you're not allowed to bring razors, scissors, tweezers, etc. on the plane. The little dish of individually wrapped candies was great, too--especially because the candies were delicious. They weren't just junk put there for show. You could tell that your hosts really wanted to make your stay as pleasant as possible. There did come with the room a free breakfast, but unfortunately I never rose early enough to partake of it -- it was vacation after all -- so I'm sorry, but I can't comment on that. But if it follows the kind of standards of service and generosity that the rest of the experience provided by the hotel does, I venture it must be terrific. Over all, although I really didn't like Rome itself -- too frenetic and crazy, not relaxing at all! -- if I ever go back, I would stay at Hotel Golden Rome again. Worth every penny, in a beautiful neighborhood, near buses and the Metro, just a 15 minute walk from the Villa Borghese Museo; two and a half blocks from the bank; two blocks from Harry's Bar and the gorgeous Via Veneto....it was charming and professional and lovely.

I selected Hotel Golden after reading countless reviews on Trip Advisor for various hotels in Rome. I was looking for a hotel that was in a safe location, clean and reasonably priced. Hotel Golden fit the bill. The hotel is located one block off of the Via Veneto (one of the most expensive and exclusive streets in Rome). I felt extremely safe walking to and from the hotel at all hours. We paid 70 Euros a night for two of the nights (i.e. approx $91 USD) & 90 euros for one night (i.e. approx $116 USD) for a small double room. Be aware- a small double room is extremely small. It had a double bed in it and maybe 2 feet walking space around 2 sides of the bed (2 sides were against the wall) and that was the entire room. The bathroom was also extremely small \u2013 you could barely move in the shower (I wouldn't recommend this size room for a very tall or larger person). I don't think the room size was out of the ordinary for Europe (although the hotel rooms we stayed in Venice & Positano were much larger) but you should be aware of it. The breakfast was good (the best one out of the 3 different hotels we stayed at in Italy). Breakfast was a simple assortment of breads, eggs, yogurt, cereal, coffee/tea/juice. The hotel is located on one floor of an office building (you have to get buzzed to enter the building) and then buzzed again to enter the actual hotel. There is an old elevator that worked just fine for getting our bags to the hotel (which was on the second floor). We arranged through the hotel for a taxi to pick us up from the airport for 40 Euros (cash, including tax, tip & luggage). The driver was waiting for us when we got out of customs with a sign with my name on it. Driver was courteous and the ride to the hotel was fine- took about 40 minutes. The car wasn't a black sedan (as the hotel's e-mail said) - just a regular taxi but it was fine. I believe 40 euros is the standard rate from the airport to downtown Rome (I saw this price advertised elsewhere) so I think you can get this rate if you don't go through the hotel but it was convenient to have the taxi waiting for us and know that it had been arranged through the hotel. The staff was ok- not overly friendly as other reviewers have said \u2013 they did not go out of their way to welcome us but were fine to interact with. They gave us a map of Rome and showed us suggested routes to walk. We walked to all the main sites from the hotel (Spanish Steps about 15 minutes, Colosseum, about 45 minutes, Piazza Navona about 45 minutes, Vatican about 1 hour 15 minutes). A cab ride from the Termini Train station was about 10-12 euros (including 2 bags). The hotel was clean and the air conditioning worked well. There was a computer with internet in the lobby that you could use for free (although 2 of the nights the internet didn't work and the woman at the desk told us she didn't know how to fix it and it's been broken for 3 years. This didn't make sense to us since the next night we stayed there it worked fine).

We used their transportation they arranged from airport to hotel and hotel to cruise port. We waited awhile for the guy at the airport, but that was of no fault of Golden Hotel - the driver was not standing in the area mentioned with our name. A quick call to Golden Hotel and the driver came to find us. The trip to the port was fine, he arrived on time. Guiseppe was so very helpful - as was Marco. We always felt safe in the hotel and area surrounding. The American Embassy is around the corner as is a police station. I would have felt safe walking anywhere around the hotel at any hour of the day or night alone. You have to be buzzed into the building, then buzzed into the actual floor the hotel is on. There is always someone at the front dest to welcome you. They kept the key so you didn't have to worry about losing it while touring around Rome. They recommended two restaurants that were wonderful - can't say enough about San Marco - pizza is excellent as is the four cheese gnocchi. All questions we had they had answers to or found out the answer. One of our friends birthday was the day we left and Guiseppe helped with part of our surprise. Marco helped us with all of our luggage (it was a ton)! We had three rooms and I don't think any of them were unusally small - I have stayed in a room in New York with three other people and our rooms this trip looked expansive compared to that. There was plenty of bathroom shelves to put our toiletries on. Our air conditioner worked well and it was very quiet at night. The breakfast room is small, but the food was great. There were many more options at this hotel than there were in our bed and breakfast in Venice - and the food was much better. The price was great and the hotel was very clean.

It was a longer but easy, pleasant and interesting walk to the big sights of the Centro Historica such as the Colosseum and forum. The nearest metro stop is only five minutes walk away at Barbarini and we used the metro to get to the Vatican Museum although that too would have been walkable. The streets near the hotel are much quieter than the main tourist areas but the nearby Via Veneto is a long leafy boulevard with plenty of restaurants. We chose this hotel largely because of its location close to the Villa Borghese and its park and a good write up by previous visitors on the tripadvisor website. We were not disappointed either in the hotel or the area. The staff in the hotel were very friendly, Marco and introducing himself and his brother Giuseppe by name and only too willing to give directions and to ask how we were getting on - also to help visitors connect to the free wi-fi as our ipod-toting son will testify. Our first floor triple room was spacious and although we were initially disappointed that its window looked on to an internal courtyard and so didn't have a view or much natural light it was clean and comfortable. Even though ours was the first room along from the lobby it was quiet and we were never disturbed. There was a good shower and there was never a shortage of hot water.Thankfully the room was air-conditioned as the temperatures hit 32 c (90 F) but the unit did tend to drip. The breakfast buffet was great with good coffee or tea, juice, cereals, breads, very good cakes, eggs and omelette, cheese, cold meats, croissant and delicious cakes. The breakfast room is a bit small but cosy and welcoming and we only had to wait to be seated for 5 minutes on one day out of four. We never felt like we were being rushed to finish breakfast and we always lingered to plan the day and have an extra coffee. Although the Villa Borghese park and hotel appear on the map to be seperated by a large main road, don't be put off as it has good crossing points for pedestrians and the park is a beautiful, cool shady oasis on hot Summer days, largely traffic-free and as safe - early mornings saw runners and walkers using it before the temperature rose and in the evenings many locals seemed to stroll through it. It was a good place to relax after visiting the city centre and our near-teenage son enjoyed it - there are a couple of cafes, bike hire and plenty of space to play or rest. I managed to run every morning but was glad of the drinking fountains dotted around the paths. We had arrived at Fiumcino airport early afternoon and took the train into the central Rome station at Termini. It seemed like a long walk with our cases in the heat from our platform to the central metro stop. When we left we asked Marco to arrange for a car to take us to the airport - it only cost 45 euro which was what the train and metro fares had cost us for the outward journey and was good value. As our flight home was in the evening, the hotel looked after our baggage so we could enjoy our final day unhindered. We were collected by a small air-conditioned mini-bus and driven through central Rome, getting a bonus tour of the centre and it only took about forty minutes to get to the airport terminal. Tips: buy a Roma Card (25 euro for an adult) for free entry to two museums and free travel on metro, trains and buses for three days. It spared us the very long queue at the Colosseum - you can get the card from the Tourist Information offices or kiosks. Children from EU countries get free entry in to some museums but may be asked to show proof (our son wasn't at the Colosseum but would have had to join the admittedly shorter queue for the Palatine Hill to get a free ticket, so we skipped that). We only had to queue for less than 30 minutes to get in to the Vatican museum and we think that it was because we went on the Wednesday morning when a lot of people chose to go to see the papal blessing first - the tour touts (offering guided tours of the museum for 45 euro) had told us that there was a two hour wait when we joined the queue but they must have been mistaken! If you're in Rome for a week then we'd recommend that you spare half a day to visit the ruins of the roman port at Ostia Attica about 30 minutes from Termini by metro and train. Lido Central is a short distance further on the same train line and although our guidebook was a bit disparaging about the town, the beach was good - albeit much of it is effectively private (10 euro per person per day but we got on half price as we only arrived mid-afternoon) and there are public areas but they were busier. We also had our most enjoyable evening meal there at the Golden Cafe (the name is just a coincidence) for about half the price of the meals in Rome. We have recommended this hotel to our friends and would use it again if we visited Rome again - which we hope to do because it was terrific.

This was my second stay at the hotel and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Both times, I stayed in the triple room, just off the main lobby area. The room is spacious by European standards, with plenty of space for me and my 2 friends. The shower is great -- warm water and lovely water pressure -- after a long, tiring day of sight seeing. Beds are comfy. Air conditioning works well and was quiet in our room. (I know other reviewers have had different experiences.) The family that runs the hotel is great, always ready and willing to offer tips and suggestions. They genuinely want their guests to have the best visit to Rome possible. It is a bit of a hike to even the closest sights... Spanish Steps are 10 minutes away, Trevi Fountain is a 10-15 minute walk -- downhill on your way there but very much uphill on your way back. Everything else was far enough away that we took the metro. The closest stations are again, 10 minutes or so from the hotel. The hotel sits just behind several 5-star hotels. Nice in theory, except that every restaurant in the area seemed to be over priced and not that great. We had to venture as far as the Pantheon area (30-45 minute walk) to find good, authentic and affordable Italian food. The silver lining is that the area is VERY safe and quiet though. I've walked back to the hotel after midnight and never felt uncomfortable. You also don't get any street noise like you might at a hotel in a busier part of Rome. I've been so pleased with both of my stays, I'd be hard pressed to stay anywhere else when back in Rome. They'd have to be booked solid for me to even think about looking anywhere else.

I was especially impressed with the great manner with one of the sons who was at the reception. Recommended for senior travellors & families. Negatives: Service and Room - Perhaps, I just did not have a luck. The room I stayed had a lock issue. I had to ask help to close/open the room each time I go out and come back. To be fair, the son (at the reception) admitted the lock problem and he did not mind at all to help opening/closing the room. However, the father and the another son gave me an attitude that they knew how to close/open the room, but not me. Isn't it hotel's responsibility to make a room where any customers can access easily? Another thing is that I had to receive a receipt because I paid in cash. My check-out time was 8 am and the father said that i had to wait 15 minutes more as he did not know how & his son will arrive in 15 minutes..

It was the best transfer we have ever had. The brothers could not have been more helpful with help with directions, bookings, general advice, in fact anything.

Saying that, it was kept immaculately clean and the double glazing was 100% perfect at removing any street noise. Aircon was much needed as it was hot in Rome! The breakfast room was small but we always got a table. After 5 days of the same breakfast though we got a little tired of it. Some variety would have been nice.

We chose this hotel based on great reviews on both Tripadvisor and Booking.com and would absolutely stay there again, as well as recommend it to friends going to Rome. The location is unbeatable - in an upscale, safe neighborhood minutes away from the Spanish steps and walking distance from most tourist attractions (we didn't use public transport at all and got everywhere on foot). The hotel itself was a very pleasant surprise - the room we got was the largest we've had during all of our numerous stays in Italy (three and four-star hotels both in Rome and in smaller coastal towns such as Lido di Jesolo and Rimini), very spacious and with a large bathroom. The room looked freshly renovated, was very comfy and clean. Great bed and mattress too, we always felt well-rested in the morning. Breakfast was very decent. The staff are pleasant, helpful and professional. We found the room to be better (more spacious, bigger bathroom) than the one we had at the four-star hotel last year, and the whole experience more warm and friendly, as the hotel is small and family-run and people seem to really care about what they're doing and take pride in their job. The only difference was the small reception area with no street entrance (the hotel is inside a residential building on the second floor) but we were looking for a comfortable stay, not a fancy reception hall. I think the hotel is excellent value for the money and if we come back to Rome next year we'd definitely stay here again.

On the down but comical side, the woman keeping the breakfast buffet stocked was less than friendly, and the room got a bit cramped if multiple sets of guests showed up at the same time. The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way of most Rome attractions, tucked in a quiet residential neighborhood. Its a short 5 minute walk to the subway and also to the Spanish Steps, and a block away from the beautiful Borghese Park.

They are very basic, with relatively comfortable beds, clean linens and sound-proof windows. Although you can hear guests in the hallway, you can\u2019t hear any street noise at all. The bathroom we had was a very good size, but the shower stall and sink are of the miniature variety found throughout Italy which larger size guests may find a bit inconvenient. Water pressure was OK, but hot water availability was variable. Our TV did not work, it has multiple broken images, but we didn\u2019t really want to bother them about it as we did not need it. If we had mentioned it, I am sure it would have been replaced or fixed. Internet: A huge bonus is the great free internet service! Super-fast and efficient, this was the best we saw throughout Italy. Breakfast: Breakfast provides more variety than most hotels in Italy, and the care taken in the beautiful ornate place settings, and the constant attention to the food display was almost touching. Staff: This is a family run hotel, and you\u2019ll likely get to meet every family member over the course of coming and going from the hotel at various hours. They take the running of the hotel seriously (a bit too seriously at times), but its nice to see their level of organization and dedication. They went out of their way for all the guests, repeatedly. Altogether, this is a very well run hotel, but not in my favorite location.

My daughter and I stayed there recently and had a great experience. The hotel shares a building with other establishments (a common occurrence for urban hotels in Italy) on a small, quiet street in a prime area of Rome, just off the Via Veneto and near the Villa Borghese. Because we were staying for just one night and on a dollar-based (rather than euro-based) budget, we booked the small double room. Yes, it was small, but so is a diamond, and like one, the room was sparkling and beautiful. There were elegant curtains and bedspreads, an extra pillow in the closet, a nice little refrigerator, television with international cable stations, and free internet which we could access on our laptops. The bathroom was very well appointed with a big shower (this is rare in a three-star hotel in Italy) and wonderful water pressure. Moreover, it and the room were in absolutely first-rate condition, not just immaculately clean, but well-designed, beautifully tiled and equipped with fine fixtures. The breakfast room was tucked into a small, bright space, where the tables were decorated with elegant tablecloths and lovely dishes. Breakfast to me is primarily coffee, and the Hotel Golden\u2019s was very good. There were also various kinds of bread, croissants, jams, cheeses, meats, fruit and cereal, all very nicely displayed. The Hotel Golden is a family-owned business, with family members running the front desk and the other services. They do so in the most professional manner, while at the same time treating you like guests in their home, rather than simply customers. For example, they remembered my name, anticipated several of our needs, and were more than happy to answer questions about Rome and places we might see during our brief visit. As a result of all this, as soon as we returned to our temporary home on the Adriatic, I booked another stay at the Holden Golden for later this spring, and we are eagerly looking forward to it!", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cRecommendable Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ArbutusCa", "ReviewID": "UR26710021", "Content": "We are very satisfied with this hotel: it is clean, conveniently located with helpful staff.

The metro station is quite near at Spanish Steps, so we generally take metro to the Forum, Vatican, and other churches as well as Ostia. The breakfast is ok-simple but sufficient. There are a few restaurants not far from the hotel, serving good dinners. But in Italy, they often add charges in the restaurant bills for items that we didn't order, for example breads and cover charges-a few Euros here and there. For Vatican tour, we direcly booked from Vatican; it was an excellent decision-no lineup with excellent tour guide and lower cost. Beware of Angel Tour: our trip to the Forum was ruined. After confirmation through emails, they just didn't show up. When we complained, they put a blame on us that we were probably not tourists, but we were their competitors to smear their reputation. Their mentalities are strange and extremely not professional. You may need to join a tour bus from Rome to Pompeii if you are going there. Because the local train from Naples to Pompeii ( you need to transfer in Naples station if you are going to Pompeii from Rome) is rather uncomfortable and scary; many vagabonds and mean looking fellows stared conspicuously at you or your girlfriend or your wife; on our return trip, one guy even provocatively kicked his shoe to my wife's foot and spoke something in Italian. But when we finally couldn't tolerate him anymore and spoke to him in English, he went away and continued ranting. Do watch out if you travel with teenage daughters; Italian men like to flirt aggressively; they may not be mean but can be quite annoying. Naple area seems quite forbidding.

We stayed 3 nights during our trip in Rome from 28-31 July - room 102. After this we moved on to Florence (Firenze) and after that to lake Garda. It is called many times \"a little Gem\", but is it? My intention is to give a fair and balanced review and not to write the obvious: its is clean, it is located very good (near villa Borghese) the rooms are small, the breakfast area is small, no outside noise, good value for money. After our trip from Rotterdam (Netherlands) to Rome in the night it felt really good to arrive at the hotel in the morning. A sir named Marco checked us is and gave us a good explanation of the city highlights. When we got our room something seemed to be wrong with the electricity. Me and my girl both heard a ticking noise when the lights were off. Although it was not very loud, one could easily hear it: it was really annoying. I called Marco and explained my inconvenience about the ticking noise. He replaced two light bulbs but didn't seem to care about the complaint: he could not hear it, but it was probably the transistor in the bulb. (I can tell you this was not this case because of my technical background). There was nothing he could do he said with a lacking attitude. I don't know if anyone ever listened to ticking noises while getting a good night sleep, but it drives you nuts. I understand that some things cannot be noticed by hotel staff or fixed during a stay, but the least thing they can do is to say \"We are truthfully sorry about the inconvenience or I will get someone to look at it. None of this was the case\". I fixed the problem by removing some light bulbs and removing the key card, so the electricity was off. Not very nice in case of a nightly toilet visit. Mr Guiseppe is in my opinion a much better hotelier as he is more attending and friendly. I'm not bashing his brother here, but in a family hotel one should make people welcome. When you say nothing when a hotel guest comes in or goes out, you aren't doing a good job. Second thing a new traveller should be aware of is the small and not so good breakfast: the food is pre fabricated and in some cases warmed up. You expect to have at least some piece of decent bread. The largest piece was about 5 inch; really small. Although the woman handling the breakfast is really kind, she should in my opinion have at least serve some fresh things. The fruit is also canned..not very good. My advise is to charge 5-10 euro extra for a room and include a fresh breakfast. Taking all things together I would say that for its price level it is still a good pick to explore Rome. But I can say its a warm and welcoming family hotel. Its average but has a lot of potential. A small tip for dinner is the small restaurant around the corner (right). So just walk out of the hotel on the right side and take a right turn, it is about 20 meters on the left side.

Everything was just as described by the many glowing reviews from pleased guests - which now include us. The Hotel Golden is simply a great find for those wondering where to stay in Rome. This small,15-room, family-run place is a comfortable, clean, modestly-priced, hotel located in a desirable neighborhood that represents a great travel value. The property is very small and therefore has no amenities beyond a tiny elevator (the hotel is on the floor immediately above ground level - 1st floor in Italy) and a small breakfast room, but the price, location, room features and friendly staff (brothers Giuseppe and Marco run the front desk) more than make up for this. The guest rooms are all very comfortable and clean, though some are cramped in size and occasional noise in the hallway is a detraction for a couple of the rooms near the front desk (ask for the more remote rooms). On the plus side: the included breakfasts have a wide selection of continental-style foods and the coffee is excellent; the rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable; the bathrooms are modern and well-equipped with toiletries and even plush bathrobes and slippers; the location is convenient in a quiet, fashionable neighborhood off the top of the Via Veneto near the Spanish Steps (several $$$$$ 5-star hotels in this same area), the #116 bus stop and the Barberini and Spagna metro stations. I would highly recommend this hotel to travelers who are going to be out of their rooms much of the time sight-seeing and not expecting a resort-style experience but just want a reasonably-priced, safe, quiet and clean place to sleep in a convenient location near the central heart of historic Rome. Eating nearby: Pomodorino, just a short block east of the hotel, is a large and vibrant neighborhood place for great cheap pizzas, roasted meats and desserts. San Marco, on the same block, is a hip, modern place very popular with the younger, fashionable crowd. It serves more upscale food choices but at prices that are still reasonable. I recommend both. We just had to try the famous Bellini cocktails and sandwiches at Harry's Bar, a short walk west to the Via Veneto, but be forewarned - you will pay dearly for it, even for lunch. Almost any place on the Via Veneto will drain your wallet except for the cheap pasta place just up from the Barberini metro. Skip it unless you really want to splurge on a fashionable al fresco dining experience on the Via Veneto. Getting to Spanish Steps: There is no direct way to walk due west on surface streets to the Spanish Steps so you must walk down either Via Veneto or Via Porta di Pinciana then back up Via Sistina to the Piazza di Spagna. The Hotel Golden is an uphill walk back, of course, which can be daunting at the end of a long day walking all over Rome. You can alternatively hop on bus #116 or, if at the Spanish Steps, try using the underground walkways and escalators between the Spagna metro stop and the top of the Via Veneto. Look for the escalators outside Harry's Bar, a short block from the hotel. Transportation: I highly recommend the Roma Pass if you will be spending two or three days in Rome. The 20 euro price is a good value as it includes all public transit for three days (metro, tram and bus lines) and provides two free admissions to your choice of 40 attractions like the Colosseum, the Palatine museums or Borghese Gallery, with discounts off any others beyond the first two. The Metro is very easy to use as there are only two lines that cross at Termini train station (Barbarini and Spagna are the two closest stops) and it is the quickest way to get to the Vatican, the Colosseum and destinations further out. Bus #116 terminus is just a block away from the hotel and the other end is a short walk from the Vatican. Recommended maps: The Roma Pass includes a good map (the same provided free by the hotel) however, the best maps in general I've found for Rome and other cities are those produced by MapEasy.com ($7-8 each) as they are very easy to read and use, highly informative and durable (water-resistant and tear-proof). In addition to clearly marked streets and landmarks, they are profusely detailed with location and information on all historic sites, hotels, restaurants and cafes, retail shops and department stores, banks, hospitals, entertainment and parks, transit (metro, bus, airports, ferries, car rentals and parking), etc. The maps concentrate on the city's center (there is no outlying regional info) and include enlarged scale views of several of the most important neighborhoods. Other travelers remarked on our MapEasy guide maps that we used in Rome, Venice, Florence and Barcelona.

Pros: The room was quiet -- a big deal to me -- and we were able to sleep through the night without interruptions. I had asked for a quiet room in advance, though I'm not sure other rooms wouldn't have been quiet as well. Great location -- located at the top of the Via Veneto, near the Villa Borghese. We had a short time in Rome, so we never made it to the Villa Borghese, but it was very convenient for us to walk right down Via Veneto and pick up the subway at Barberini Square. The hotel is about equidistant from this stop and the stop by the Spanish Steps. (Side note: There is a change place right near the entrance to the Barberini subway at the bottom of Via Veneto if you are walking down the right side of the street from the hotel. It does not charge a flat rate commission, so you do not feel pressured to change more money than necessary, and I found it to be one of the best rates in Rome and Florence during our trip). It's also a fairly short walk to the Trevi Fountain (about 10 - 15 minutes) and it's possible to walk to just about anywhere in Rome, but we walked to the Pantheon (about 15 minutes) and Trastevere (about 30 minutes) with no problems. Helpful Staff -- they gave us good directions and answered any questions. Cons: Conservation -- A/C set to a minimum temperature (would not be an issue if we weren't required to turn in the key card that controls the power each time we left the hotel). It took the room about an hour to cool off -- a bit of an inconvenience in July when Rome is unbearably hot and humid. This would not be an issue other times of the year. Additionally, I asked for an extra towel the day we got in and the person who gave me one seemed a bit less than forthcoming. I know we are used to more in America and I have no problem conserving, but it just felt the slightest bit overboard to me. Bed -- not terrible (I debated even including it here) but it was a bit hard. I did not wake up feeling stiff, so it may have felt harder to me than it really was. Overall, a decent experience and I would recommend this hotel to people looking for value in Rome -- the location is good and the staff are friendly; the room is quiet and clean.

It is also within walking distance of many of the sights, including the Galleria Borghese and a beautiful adjoining park only a 10-minute walk. Our room was on the front of the building overlooking a quiet street. It had all the amenities we wanted, including air-conditioning, plenty of room for two people, a large comfortable bed, cable T.V., a nice bathroom with shower and hair-dryer, and even fluffy robes and slippers. The room was always pristine when we returned from a long day of sight-seeing, and it was so pleasant to see Guiseppe at the front desk. He was very helpful in suggesting restaurants and bus routes, and even arranged for us to get into a sight we wanted to see. There is a breakfast buffet off the main hallway, which was plenty to get us started each day. We met several other U.S. travelers there and it was nice to chat with someone from home.

The location was convenient and easily accessible by foot to some of the key locations such as the Spanish Steps, the Borghese gardens, Via Veneto and others.

The driver and car they secured to get us to the airport was excellent and the 40 euro price seemed quite reasonable. On the down side, the breakfast was adequate but had the quality one might expect with canned fruit, pre-packaged deli meats, and mass-produced pastry. The lesser priced of the two rooms we had was extremely small with barely enough floor space to move around the bed. There is no common area in which to relax and sit with a book, glass of wine or cup of coffee, and due to size and available furniture the rooms are not conducive to anything but sleeping. Overall, a sure thing for cleanliness and convenience but I think perhaps we could have done better, especially now that we've seen the city and realize how accessible other locations would also have been.

Both rooms had king size beds (two twins pushed together) which were fine. There were no chairs in the room other than one small desk chair. That would be OK except the hotel has no lobby so there was not one place to sit and read or relax. If you were in your room you had to lie on the bed. The bath was adequate and everything was clean except for the floor. Our feet would be dirty after walking across the floor. House slippers are provided which helped on that problem. One room suffered from a lot of street noise. If we wanted to visit and plan with our traveling companions, we had to find a cafe.

The hotel\u2019s location, near the upscale Via Veneto, is a nice, calm oasis away from the touristy crush of Rome. We found the nearby buses (less than 5 minute walk) and Metro stop (less than 10 minute walk in an underground tunnel) useful to get to the major sites when we didn\u2019t feel like walking. We stayed in the King Superior and, based on other reviews, I asked if I could be placed in a quiet room away from the front desk. I am a light sleeper so this is important to me. While there was no noise from the street, I could occasionally hear conversations and the television near the front desk, but never after 11:00 P.M. or before 7:00 A.M. The room and bathroom was spacious, clean and comfortable. (When we travel, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time in our room except to relax a little and to sleep so we don\u2019t need a suite or additional sitting areas.) Marco and Giuseppe were very helpful prior to my arrival, answering questions, securing reservations, etc. They check their email often and respond quickly and courteously. Once we arrived, they were happy to give directions and assist us with transportation issues. Giuseppe informed us that there is a travel agent in the same building who, for no additional charge, was able to book our Eurostar train reservations to get to Florence and Venice. I highly recommend this service, to avoid confusion at the train station and to help better plan any train travel since you know in advance the date, time and seat reservations. Another gentleman also worked at the front desk and speaks little English. We speak very little Italian, so we learned quickly to get all of our questions answered by Marco or Giuseppe when we saw them at the front desk. This is not a complaint, but just a suggestion to other English speaking travelers. The size of the breakfast room was not a problem for us and we only had to wait 5 minutes on one day before we could be seated. We enjoyed the extra security feature of leaving our key at the front desk and getting \u201cbuzzed\u201d in upon our return. I give this hotel 5 stars for value because I did A LOT of searching for hotels before making this reservation and felt I could not find another hotel in the same class in a superior location for the same rate or better. To Americans, nothing is a good value in Italy right now, with the weak dollar, but this is not something to penalize the hotel for in terms of value rating. There was one issue that disappointed me. We arranged, with our reservation, for the car service at 40 Euros to pick us up at the airport. I emailed my flight information to them and asked if they would monitor my arrival online, since I may not be able to call them to report a delay, and they agreed to do this. Long story short, my flight did not arrive at 9:00 A.M. as planned and our arrival was changed to 6:45 P.M. I called the hotel from Amsterdam that morning to let them know of the change in plans. A woman, who does not speak English, answered the phone. I do not speak Italian so I was unable to communicate with her. So I paid 5 Euros for a 10 minute internet connection in the airport and emailed the hotel with the information, asking them to monitor my new arrival time. I then was off to take another flight to Paris to get to Rome. Like I said, long story. Our flight landed in Rome right around 7:00 P.M. and we found our driver about 5 minutes later. The service was wonderful and exactly what we needed after a long trip, with many complications, to get there. When we got to the hotel, we paid our driver the previously agreed upon (and verified by email) 40 Euros, but he insisted we owed him 55. We walked into the hotel together because he wanted the hotel staff to explain the cost to us. Giuseppe told us that the fee is 55 Euros because we landed after 7:00 P.M. He then said \u201cWhat time did you land again? Was it before or after 7:00 P.M.? If you had to get your bags and you did not reach the driver until after 7:00, then you have to pay 55.\u201d I informed him that no one told me of this and if they had, I would have just taken the train in. 40 Euros for the service is reasonable. 55 with the current exchange rate would have changed our minds. He stated that Marco emailed me with this information, but I told him I did not have access to email during that time since I was flying. He shrugged and said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but this is the arrangement we have with the driver\u201d and that was it. I am a business owner and understand that occasional mistakes or lack of communication may happen from time to time. I also know that a sincere and appropriate apology goes a long way to smooth over any problems. An extra bottle of Prosecco or something similar would have cost them little and would have been a nice gesture to show regret over the situation and appreciation for our business. But based on the response to the problem, we assume there was no regret. This was my only disappointment with our stay and I found it surprising, based on our other interactions with the hotel owners. This is also the main reason I am giving a 4 star rating. Would I consider staying here again? Yes. Would I ask about any issues that might change what I\u2019ve agreed to pay? Yes.

I I picked Hotel Golden after much searching as it rarely had any bad comments, never mind bad reviews on Tripadvisor. We booked online directly with the hotel and got a great deal. We also e-mailed the hotel directly to arrange a pick-up car from the airport. The hotel e-mailed me on 3 occasions in one day just to make sure the arrangements were pefect! That is what I call service. Our check-in was quick and efficient and we were provided with a free large map of the city upon which they marked a couple of restaurants they recommended we try. We were also advised to come to them with any questions we had. Room Our room was perfect and a good size, particularly the bathroom. We had a king size room so that maybe made a difference as I have seen other reviews saying the rooms are small. We had a dressing table, storage table for suitcases, a double couch, a king size bed, a bedside table and 3 cupboard drawer with built-in TV and safe in our room and were not short of room. The bathroom was really big with a full corner shower, huge square sink, toilet and bidet. We also had a table with a box of complimentary toiletries and a separate chair upon which were fresh towelling robes. There was also a hairdryer in the bathroom. We also used the mini bar which was incredibly cheap! A small bottle of Prosecco wine was only 5 euros and a bottle of water only 1 euro. Service A continental breakfast was served every day between 7.30am and 10am and there was a good variety of items. The dining room was small but we never had a problem getting a seat and it was never particularly busy. The family who ran the hotel were really friendly and were always happy to help. You have to buzz to get into the hotel after around 5pm as the hotel is only on one floor of a large building but even on Saturday night when we returned at around 2.45am there were no problems with getting in. This hotel is in a very fashionable area of Rome as the Via Veneto is just round the corner. This means that you are staying in one of, if not the best areas of Rome, but without having to pay the huge premiums to do so. We could not have picked a better hotel and I would advise anyone travelling to Rome to stay there. As for other tips about visiting Rome: 1. Get a good hop on-hop off tour bus and sit up top. Allows you great photos of the main sights and means that you can travel around all day getting on and off as required. We used this every day we were away and loved it. 2. Get a tour guide for the Vatican museum, Basilica etc or you will not fully appreciate everything you see. Our guide was an Australian called Michael and he made this trip the highlight of our stay 3.

It was totally quiet though small. Would not want to stay in this particular room for more than one or two nights due to it being a bit of a tight squeeze for 2 people. They have double paned windows so no worries about the street noise of Rome. They are right off the Via Veneto. It's a perfect location to stroll the streets of of the city from. We both travel alot for pleasure and business. A 2 star hotel in the height of the tourist season in Italy was a first for us. This is really one of those \"finds\" in the travel industry.

After making use of the taxi pick up from the airport - which was possibly the most hassle free transfer we've experienced on city break and worth every euro. Checked into the hotel located on the first floor of an apartment block, beautiful entrance hall and antique lift. The hotel itself is very welcoming, spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished. Our room was a good size, with a spotlessly clean bathroom and the most amazing view of a roman face peering in from the wall opposite. The shutters meant we had cool and dark sleep and the double glazing provided a brilliant soundproofing from the nearby main road. The bathroom layout was interesting with a bidet directly opposite the toilet which proved to be an obsticle on entering and exiting the shower. The hotel itself is situated within walking distance of everything in central Rome. It took us approximately one hour to walk to the Vatican and about 15 minutes to the Trevi Fountain. This really was the best way to see the city as you are greeted by the most amazing sights round every corner. We would recommend that you get up early and attempt to do the main sights first thing, as the crowds become vast the later in the day you leave it. We walked straight into the Colosseum and practically had it to ourselves. You also get to see a different side to the streets of Rome without all the tourists thronging. Breakfast was more than adequate with pastries, fruit, cold meats and bread to fill yourelf up on if still hungry after the previous nights dinner. It started at approx 7.30 and although previous reviews have commented that the small breakfast room was too small to hold all guests, we did not find this a problem at all - except if you choose to eat at the same time as everyone else. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel, all the recommendations made by Marco at the hotel were great, although we would recommend booking for Friday and Sat nights. A taxi into the Piazza Navona area doesn't cost more than 6/7 euros if you want a bit more variety. Whilst the via Veneto has some beautiful bars/ restaurants why are very expensive but good for just watching the world go by. In all we had high hopes for the Hotel Golden and were not disappointed.

The hotel is on the first floor of a lovely building and serviced by a small antique elevator (large enough for two with luggage). We found our room, and indeed, the whole hotel, to be immaculate and furnished with great attention to detail and quality. After booking on the hotel website, we were offered the opportunity to be picked up from Leonardo da Vinci airport in a chauffeured car for Euro 35. This suited us after the long haul flight from Australia and the driver obligingly drove us past many of the buildings and monuments on the way to the hotel-- a great introduction to the city! We arrived in Rome early in the morning and Marco offered to look after our bags until the room was ready. When we returned early to check in we were offered coffee and mineral water in the breakfast room while we waited. Marco's mother even brought us some grapes and a TV to watch; it was small touches such as this that made our stay so enjoyable. Our room was number 104; it was larger than we expected and beautifully furnished. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom large and modern and the airconditioning much appreciated in the summer heat. Free wireless internet was also a bonus. A continental buffet breakfast was served in the breakfast room and included bread and pastries, cured meats, boiled eggs, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and cheese. Upon check in, Marco gave us a map of the city and showed us the best walking routes to each of the major attractions. We enjoy walking and did not have to catch public transport at all during our stay; all of the attractions are 15-30 minutes walk away. He also suggested some nearby restaurants and was happy to make reservations on our behalf.

As normal I try to help and be constructive in comments - which are longer than most (sorry) The hotel has rooms on the 2nd floor of a building in one of the more upmarket areas of Rome. Floors above and below seem to be residential but no noise at all from either. We concur with the comments of other reviewers with regards Marco and Guiseppi who are keen to let you know how to get around and give plenty of advice. Our room was spotlessly clean, and bed confortable, and bathroom and shower great (although you get those annoying sachets of shower gel which you cant open without your teeth - bottle would have been good) Hotel is away from the main road but you probably need to keep windows shut at night to ensure you dont hear it or keep air conditioning on which was a bit noisy but worked very well - but really no problem at all. I would say however that our room was opposite the breakfast room which serves breakfast from 7.30 so if youre in one of these you will hear early morning activity - but then again you should be rousing for the day anyway. Overall we were well pleased with room - and it has a complementary safe in it - good idea. TV is in there - but you dont use it much (and CNN is really the only channel if you only understand English) As one who likes a good wholesome breakfast I found this disappointing with the smallest cereal bowls Ive ever seen. Ok if you like a light breakfast with rolls and cheese/jams etc. No toaster in sight which was a shame. Breakfast room is very small with 6 tables so early bird gets the worm as they say - but that said we went back to the room when there was a queue and then unprompted they called us when a table was free - nice touch. As for location - well its about 10 mins walk to Spanish Steps downhill and you need to work out a few shortcuts. Rest of main sights all within walking distance but probably half hour to Colosseum which is the furthest away - always take a couple of maps. Bus service is good but you need to know where to go - hotel will help where to get on (and just to say the jump on and off bus tour for Euro 13 each was great value) . We came across a quick route to the metro through supermarket under ground which would have been so much better if we had known. However, we needed the exercise. Be prepared for the walk up the hill back to the hotel - its good for you but tiring. Be like us and use the bars along the way - and on which point the bar round the corner (just across from the tobacconist) is great and friendly and nice cakes and savouries also. There are taxis of course but who needs them !! To finish let me say we really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. Its a 2 star I think but run as good as the bigger ones and the brothers take great pride in the hotel which shows. Small but as I say clean, comfortable and personal touch. I know the brothers check trip advisor every day to see whats said. They do an excellent job with one floor of a building. The price we paid was euro 480 for 3 nights which in Rome is good value. And of course Rome is a wonderful place to visit and we did feel quite safe in the hotel area. Oh one last thing - recommend you use the hotel organised taxi to/from airport - less risk and good value (35 euro each way). Airport was 40 mins away (and the journey will be an education on Italian driving).", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Golden\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5231656", "Content": "The Hotel Golden is an excellent hotel, perfectly appointed, clean, safe, centrally located next to lovely Via Veneto.

The hotel was easy to find and convenient to everything I like to see in Rome. The rate I got for the single room I was in was better than most other hotels available. The hotel staff is great - very friendly, and english speakers as well. (most of them). The rate I got included breakfast, which is a pretty standard Euro-breakfast. Decent coffee, espresso-drinks available, breads, croissants, yoghurts some fruit, teas. all in all, not bad. But the dining room can fit only 5 or six small tables... The place is very clean and modern. Located on the 2nd floor - it's very secure. You have to walk by the front desk to get to your room. The desk person has to buzz you in to the front door for you to just get you in the building. The room I was in was small, I could touch the two walls at the same time, with my arms outstretched. I'm less than 2 meters tall. Still, since I don't come to Rome to hang out in the hotel, it worked for me, because it was clean and the bed was comfortable.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cKeep it a Secret\u201d", "Author": "footballfan", "ReviewID": "UR4985055", "Content": "We visit the hotel for three days at the end of March, and to be honest I wasn't goint to write a review, as looking at all the good reviews the hotel has it will be difficult to book next time we go to Rome!

We spoke to the owner who said that the hotel is in the process of being upgraded to a 3 star for next year. This hotel is excellent value for money and I would say it would be hard to find a hotel in Rome in such a good location that would give you better value for money. We traveled to quite a few different areas of Rome and from what we saw this was the best place to be. Everywhere was in walking distance. Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain about 10 minutes, the Vatican about 30 minutes. This hotel is only 253rd in the popularity index, but don\u2019t be misled by that figure.

We arrived to a very gracious and discreet hotel where Marco, another member of the family, immediately made us feel welcome.

The breakfast consisted of a large assortment of foods and beverages and was great for starting our days in Rome. We found the area to be very convenient and easily accessible to the rest of the city, from what we saw it seemed to be the best area in which to stay. Marco recommended (and mapped out) several restaurants/bars that were wonderful experiences and made our vacation that much better, even going as far as making reservations for us at his favorite restaurant where we were treated like locals. I cannot say enough good things about this small hotel and accomodating family. We visited 3 other cities in Europe, paid more for larger chain hotels but this was by far the best. As someone who has travelled quite extensively, and usually enjoys the services and amenities of a larger hotel, the Hotel Golden surpassed all of our expectations and made me appreciate the delightfulness of a small, family run hotel, while still having all of the services one may need while on vacation.
