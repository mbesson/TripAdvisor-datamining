This was highly important for us as there was a goup of us travelling for business and needed flexibility with our numbers. When we got there we found it was 2 tiny bedrooms with no living area, no dining area, no kitchen and could only sleep 4 adults if they were prepared to share the double beds in each bedroom. When we complained to the owner/manager about a lack of living area he pointed to the 2 sqm space next to the bed, hardly a lounge area. The bathroom was tiny and you couldn't sit on the toilet without hitting your knees on the wall. The second bedroom didn't have a cupboard, only some hooks, and there was barely enough space to put a suitcase. The price wasn't cheap compared to real 2 bedroom apartments for rent. The front room was noisy as it is located next to a gay bar with a beer garden where people were drinking and making noise late into the evening. Would definitely never stay there again and it was only lucky that we were mining people who had stayed in some pretty average conditions in remote locations around the world that we agreed to stay. That and the fact that the mining conference we were attending had booked out virtually all of the other accommodation in Toronto.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cThe worst, O pior, die schlechteste, le pire, Det Verste, \u6700\u60aa\u306ele pire\u201d", "Author": "MarcosGalindo", "ReviewID": "UR125125831", "Content": "You can not consider this as a hotel...

I could also put up with the misrepresentation on the website (room did not have a pull out couch as promised) I could even put up with a lack of on site management staff (they are no where to be found, only a maid who was very friendly and nice). It was tough to deal with NO AC (they don't leave the remotes in the room and cut the circuit breaker so it doesn't work unless requested). What really started upsetting me was not having my phone calls to management returned to fix the AC. I was also really pissed off when I was accused of being too noisy because I was blow drying my hair. This was a blow dryer supplied by the hotel and I was doing this at 8pm on a Saturday night. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, not because of cleanliness (it was clean) or even the cramped space provided, it was the horrible service from management and constantly feeling alienated during my stay.

My first clue that it was something unusual was an e-mail the day before my arrival, asking what time I might be there. Turned out that they are basically not staffed, and since I showed up at a time they were not expecting an arrival, I had to buzz, then phone, before somebody came to let me in. However, I was then love-bombed with two separate staff members showing me to my room, pointing out how the TV and air conditioning worked, assuring me that I could phone for service 24/7 if I needed it, and making sure I felt welcome. The place is a Victorian house, at one time a doctor's office, converted a few years ago into a B-and-B before the management concluded that nobody wants to pay for an inn breakfast in a neighbourhood like the Village, just off Yonge Street a quarter-mile south of Bloor, which is thick with restaurants. I think they've done a good job with what was there. The room I was in had a double bed, but it would've been a tight squeeze for two people to stay there. Likewise I wouldn't have wanted to entertain, or even maybe spend much time relaxing in the room. For what I wanted -- somewhere to sleep after a day of meetings, before heading off to more meetings -- it was just fine, and probably the cheapest decent accommodation within walking distance of Yonge and Bloor. Other notes: Room was adequately dark at night, very quiet at all hours. Extremely clean, no bugs. Fridge in room, very cold. Lots of hot water, though it took a while to warm up. Air conditioning not powerful, but adequate. I never saw another guest all the time I was there, though I was told the place was nearly full. Tiny courtyard behind the building with patio chairs, where I read for an hour in the afternoon. Proprietor very keen to chat about his ambitions for the business.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "simcoe", "Title": "\u201cWe won't be back\u201d", "Author": "buffSimcoe", "ReviewID": "UR117670654", "Content": "Air conditioner did not work for most of the time we were there, management comments were \"it doesn't feel too bad to me\".

Access to the hotel could only be gained by buzzing the intercom (which nobody responded to). I had to phone the hotel from outside using my cell phone which after a long flight was annoying. I was shown to my Bronze single room on the basement level which was quite small (picture looked slightly bigger than the room) but expected for a boutique hotel and it was reasonably priced considering the location. The room was quite cool considering I visited during a heat wave. Be aware that a basement room will mean you get noise and small vibrations from Wellesley subway station but I got used to it quickly and it didn't bother me. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the air conditioning much, but it worked fine like everything else. The shower was big and powerful enough, and the room was fine as a base camp. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a presence from the hotel staff (the office was outside at the back of the house and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear if anyone was in). The inaccessibility of the staff when I needed something was disappointing (checking out took longer than it should as I had to phone the office to make sure someone was present to collect my key card).
