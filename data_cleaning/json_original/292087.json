The room/hotel was clean and safe which were our two biggest concerns, the third being we wanted and ensuite bathroom. This bathroom was clean and nice although small (again, seems very european, I wouldn't say that's a negative at all). The location was perfect, we walked everywhere and loved waking up to see the fountain the middle of Piazza Santa Maria. We loved the simple breakfast served in the rooftop garden, what welcome respite from the crazy lively chaos of Rome. Again, having never been to Europe, I was expecting more for the price (at least, in major cities in the states you would get more for the same price) but we were extremely pleased with the hotel. If we went back to Rome I would seriously consider staying there again - probably the only way I would not is if we decided to stay in another neighborhood to experience something different.

This practice might be fine for European visitors for whom there is no time difference, but for American travelers who are suffering from a 6 hour time difference, as I was, it was extremely unpleasant. If you try to say that you don't want to have breakfast as it's too early and you're jet-lagged (or you simply don't want it), they insist you must. On my final morning I finally succeeded in saying I wouldn't have breakfast but it required a real back and forth, and I speak fluent Italian. Waking up at 9 or 9:30 every morning when I was extremely jet-lagged made me too tired to do much in Rome, and I was completely exhausted for the rest of my trip around Italy. I'm very sorry to report all this as the hotel itself is lovely, I didn't find the noise from Trastevere to be any problem, I think it's reasonably priced for Rome accommodations, and I found the owner to be incredibly kind (the man in the mornings less so, as it seemed my every action, sleeping in past 10 am and not wanting to eat breakfast, was a problem for him). It's really a shame, because Rome is lacking in good quality small, affordable pensioni, and this would be a fine option for anyone on Italian time, but for American visitors arriving directly from the US, it is really unpleasant to be woken up every morning. I also think it's bad business practices to call someone's room before 10, even more so for jet-lagged clients.

Simona, Claudio, Vadim and Simona's mother were always very friendly and went out of the way to help us with restaurant recommendations,museum info, taxis, etc. We had a very early flight out of Rome and Simona even set her alarm for 5:30 am so she could come in early to help us get off okay. This made what could have been a very stressful departure from Rome into a joyful arrivaderchi! The continental breakfast on the terrace was always a great way to start the day.

While I thought traveling off season would provide better rates, I was surely mistaken so I was a bit defeated in the idea of paying upwards of $200 a night for a not so great hotel in Rome, particularly when I booked a top 4-star hotel in Nice, France. Needless to say, I read a review about this B&B from another poster and booked it right away. The rate I received was decent; it averaged just under $150 per night and I thought that was great considering the area. We wanted to be close to central Rome but still wanted a neighborhood type feel with many restaurants within walking distance. Villa della Fonte was the perfect fit, although it will not work for everybody. While this is not a B&B, it is not a hotel either, it's something in-between. So, the quarters are close, don't take large pieces of luggage becuase you'll have a hard time with the narrow staircase. And the rooms are a decent size but still small. Villa della Fonte is located right off Piazza Santa Maria. Be mindful, some cabs will drop you off just outside of Piazza Santa Maria, I guess cars are not allowed, although we did see a couple a few times. It was by pure luck that I choose the right street to walk down, so we had no problem finding the hotel. So, keep in mind, either get dropped right near the Piazza or walk to the Piazza. You'll see the Santa Maria church, diagnoally there is a cafe (can't remember the name), the hotel is right around the corner, there is a sushi restaurant right before you hit Villa della Fonte. You will have to ring the front desk to open the door, and you'll need to leave your key each time you leave the establishment. We never encountered a problem of the front desk clerk not being there. As mentioned before, the staircase is very narrow but the rooms are nice and clean. The bathroom was rather larger and we had zero problems with noise from the Piazza, but we did hear noise within the establishment. It was quiet for the most part except in the morning, you really can hear everything in the morning, so no sleeping in. The bed happened to be the best bed we slept in throughout our trip, even better than the hotel in Nice.

The location is terrific!! We walked everywhere from the Vatican to the Piazza Navona. No problem. The Trastevere is the best place to be at night, it is all resturaunts, bars, wine bars, and people watching. I would suggest this hotel to younger singles or couples, the walking might be too much for some, and it is a busy area at night. Also, this is not the most touristy area, so most people speak little English. We don't speak Italian, but we got by ok. One other thing, no cars can drive down the street of the hotel, so you have to get dropped off or picked up by taxi a few short blocks away. We found it helpful to have the phone number for the taxi driver to call the hotel directly to get directions.
