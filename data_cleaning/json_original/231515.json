Buffet breakfast and wifi was free, although the wifi required you to log back in frequently. The buffet was basic but tasty - toast, eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, filter coffee etc. The room service menu was definitely basic with no vegetarian options (apart from one green salad) and so the hotel staff provided us with a pizza/pasta menu that was delivered and charged to our hotel bill - average pizza but at least it was another option as we were in the room a lot at night due to having a small baby with us. Overall a pretty basic hotel, however I found the rooms clean, the staff helpful and if you get a good deal on your room, worth staying there.

Location was great, near diagonal and near my conf. The hotel is listed as 4 stars but IMO it barely deserved a 3 star rating. The rooms have hardwood floors which is nice, but the rest of the room is lacking. Bed was large - two twins pushed together to make a giant king bed. However the mattress was very hard. My room had a bedspread with a large brown stain - at least 12 inches across. I noticed that housekeeping replaced the spread in the middle of my stay but why was it there in the first place? The sheets however seemed quite clean. Room had thin walls I could hear everything in the next door room including someone talking to family in the US at 2am - every word. Hotel wifi is terrible it was completely out for about 12 hours from 9am until the evening. Breakfast was actually pretty good lots of choices but it is buffet. There is no meals to be had at lunch time. And dinner only has room service with a very limited menu and hours. Compared to 4 star hotels I have stayed at in London and Paris I would put this one definitively below those - it seems to rate about a 3 star at best. The lack of continual room service or dining room and the poor wifi are not 4 star and the gym in the basement is very limited - it would hardly qualify at a decent hotel in the US.
