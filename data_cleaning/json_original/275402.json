The service was great the staff were wonderful, friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed them. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfy. (2 single beds were great for my friend and I but would not have been acceptable for my husband and I) Access to the internet in the lobby was helpful for keeping in touch with family and also checking itineraries for the next part of our trip.the hotel was undergoing some external upgrades but the noise did not effect our stay. The location was not in the midst of everything but you could get to all the action in minutes on a short bus ride. (We purchased multi-day transportation passes for the city transportation services) All in All we had a great first 6 days! We were headed to Switzerland the next day by euro-rail. We decided to go have a quick dinner, come back and pack up for the next days trip. We got back from dinner and somebody had climbed the scaffolding on the back of the building and pushed in our window and took the whole safe out of room, the safe was not secured properly, but \"hidden\" in a closet. In it was our passports and my friends entire wallet. We went across the street (literally) to the police substation to get the police and it took 45 minutes because nobody actually mans that particular station. We finally got them, they said they would have to come back the next day and take prints etc.etc. We had to stay another night, and pay for it. The manager did give us free meals. We did eventually get replacement passports in Bern, Switzerland. The consulate in Amsterdam was horrible and unhelpful, it was like being robbed of something even more valuable than the passports ~ dignity and hope! They actually made us feel like the criminals! Upon our return to the US I tried to contact Bastion Hotels to discuss our incident at their hotel and could not get in touch with them in any way shape or form. For months I tried. They had all my info, and were aware of the incident and never contacted me either. This lack of concern and professionalism by the company itself will keep us from ever staying at another Bastion Hotel anywhere. Thankfully I took travel insurance for myself (my friend skipped it) and I was reimbursed by my policy for most of the inconvenience, including the replacement passport, extra hotel nights in Amsterdam and Bern, and extra meals and train travel. Thank you CSA and my friends Tom and Don for insisting I get travel insurance! Moral of this review: If the safe is not nailed down, don't trust it! And ask why it isn't! Buy trip insurance, it was less than $80 and worth every penny!! If traveling abroad leave $120 with a trusted family member or friend so the consulate can call them for you and request they wire the money directly to them. They will not allow you to make a call, nor will they accept anything but cash from you!!!(I had my Chase Master Card, they would not take it) Oh and you can not receive a Western Union transfer in another country with out a passport.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, peaceful area easy to get to and clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Longalion", "ReviewID": "UR119835758", "Content": "We visited for 3 days and 2 nights Amsterdam.

The surroundings at first doesn't look great but most places outside the centre are the sames and is quitesafe as it is opposite a ploice station. We arrived at the hotel about 10am not expecting to check in till 2pm but were given our room straight away. As check out is at 12pm they are happy to look after your bags if you have a later flight. The hotel is modern and clean throughout and the room was just right, they are all twins beds, TV, fridge, a kettle with coffee and tea and very clean. The maids came daily and were very friendly. The staff were very friendly and helpful and responded to all requests straight away. Breakfast was brilliant, very impressed for what we paid, scrambled eggs, bacon, boiled eggs, can fry your own eggs, cereal, all sorts of breads, yogurts and croissants, tea, coffee and juiceplus more. Beware...when we arrived at the main station in Amsterdam we were'nt sure what buses to get so we grabbed a taxi, were told it would be 15 euros. When we arrived at the hotel we were told they took us the long way round so beware and it shouldn't cost more than around 10 euros. It is best to get the hotel to book your taxi. If not the buses are very easy once you know where to get them from. The bus stops are right outside the main station and you need to get bus 32 and 33 and get off at Rode Kruisstraat and the hotel is a 1 minute walk from stop. The buses are not that cheap for single and returns and if you are planning to take trips into the centre and around the area it is much cheaper if you go to the GVB bus information centre which is literally opposite the station as you walk out. We got a 4 day bus pass for 18 euros for one person. Single and returns are about 4 euros each time per person so it is worth getting a pass for the time you are staying. All in all, the hotel was very pleasant and great location for getting to the centre with a 5 minute bus ride.

The surrounding area is not very pretty, but the bus stop was very near and the bus (32 or 33) takes us to the central railway station in 10 minutes, and are quite regular (every 15 minutes, say).

It was everything we needed - clean, reasonable sized room, even tea & coffee facilties in the room, friendly staff. Car parking was just outside but not secure although there's a police station just over the road but we never felt it was a risky area. We didn't have any meals in hotel, prefering to have late breakfast/ lunch/ dinner in town. Buses to/from town were very frequent (just 50m from hotel) and journey only 8-10mins max. Buy a Euros 7.30 strippenkaart for best deal when travelling on public transport - great value and two of you can use the one strippenkaart until all the tickets (15) are used up. From the main station to/from the 3 main canals, use the minibus shuttle for Euro 1 per hour - stop it anywhere en route and jump on and off as many times as you like during the one hour - but don't forget to keep your ticket! Think it's called Stop & Go (or something similar) Great food at the Pancake Bakery (Prinsengracht 191 - near Anne Frank museum). Great afternoon tea, cocktails and decor (Art Deco) at the Schiller Bar in Rembrandtplein 26 then take a look inside the foyer at the Art Deco Tuschinski Cinema in Regulierbreestraat just NW of Rembrandtplein - FANTASTIC! Go to cafe at the top of the clock tower at Metz & Co department store on junction of Keizersgracht & Leidestraat - great views & nice food but I think you will have to book for a window table in tourist season. Only one word of caution - watch out for muggers!
