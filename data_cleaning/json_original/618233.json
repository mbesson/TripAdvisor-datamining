Great People.. I was lucky to meet Sean Lourdes who runs the hotel from the States and if you can meet him he will make your stay even more amazing. Just an amazing person. I stayed there for 6 days and the staff are all professional. I found the gym located on the 3rd floor amazing.. There is an Olympic size pool 3 stories above the main floor. Personal Trainers available at no extra charge for us. Also I found the equipment in the gym to be top grade. 10/10 for a small private resort.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR221234834", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "purelygolden"}, {"Content": "Park Nilo Hotel- Large clean suites, excellent staff I stayed at the Park Nilo Hotel on business. The hotel is located one block off Reforma on Rio Nilo street, between the Marquis Reforma and the Sheraton, in a nice area of town. (on the same street as the Japanese Embassy). Rooms were HUGE suites with full kitchens, especially the suites on the 5th floor. Room and common areas were always very clean and the staff were outstanding. Hotel has five floors, with the gym on the second. Good security since you need a room key to access your floor. Free high speed WIFI internet svc worked well. Hotel has a very large gym with all the equipment that you could possibly want and large outdoor pool. It even has a small juice bar where you can get good food. Gym is comparable to Golds gym in the states, and is open 6 A.M.- 10 P. M. weekdays, and also open on weekends. Hotel is in an area with excellent restaurants and has a Japanese restaurant off the lobby, and steakhouse across the street.If you are looking for a large suite in a nice area of the D.F., I would definitely recommend this hotel.
