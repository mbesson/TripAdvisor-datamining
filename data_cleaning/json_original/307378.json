{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great and good location I didn't book this hotel, my company did and I was so pleased when we go there. My colleague had stayed there before so we knew what to expect. The hotel starts on the 25th floor of this tower in the Ginza area, so instantly, you're above it all. Japanese hotel rooms are smaller that we Americans are used to. This one wasn't so bad. No one has king beds though, which is kind of a let down. The bathroom was huge which was great. there was a desktop in the room that I had to call and have switched to English which included the internet (wifi was also free). The breakfast was good each morning, lots of choices and the drinks in the lobby were good too. A little small, but still good. Here is my big tip, get a luxe guide (google it) and a rent a phone with gps if you can. We used my iphone and it was such a help navigating around. Here are a few highlights from our trip...go to the meji temple and then walk down the harajuku (which is like rodeo drive, only better) and have lunch at Maisen (pork cutlets) walk some more and have dessert and tea at the Berry CafeWalk out of your hotel and explore ginza. Stop by Itoya, it looks like a card shop, but it has everything. Walk up to the top floor, there are beautiful papers and traditional Japanese art and gifts. Its amazing. Stop and get some of the mont blanc baumkuchen at nenriya (in the matsuyka department store). Just stand in the line, its totally worth it. and then go down the street to the and get some macaroons at Laudree (2nd floor Mitsukoshi department store). We took a tour to Nikko which I could have passed on. There is so much to do in Tokyo proper. One of the highlights of our trip was dinner at Kaikaya. you'll have to sleuth to find it but its totally worth it. Its kind of japanese with a touch of french. and great sake. Also, Andy's Shin Hiomoto, its great. Ask Andy what is good that day. If you need to , feel free to contact me directly.Have a great trip!", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR588149037", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "matthewloranger"}, {"Content": "Highly recommend for business trip This hotel was recommended to me by a Japanese friend who travels back to Tokyo regularly, so it seemed like a good choice - at it was!Finding the hotel was something of a challenge because having arrived on the Tokyo Metro I made the mistake of going to street level. Had I remained in the basement, there was a walkway which would have taken me straight there, which wasn't entirely clear from the map on the hotel website. But you live and learn. No big deal.Staff were all very nice, welcoming on arrival and helpful beforehand (I had some presentations delivered to the hotel prior to arrival and they were waiting for me in my room when I arrived). Room was excellent. I have been told that the single rooms are quite small, so I booked a double and it was a nice size. Bed very comfortable. Bathroom offered a wide array of toiletries including razor, toothbrush and so forth. Room was also equipped with a PC and broadband was free - these days I find it very annoying when business hotels try to charge for broadband access, it should be part of the package. I didn't try any of the restaurants because there is so much other choice nearby in Shiodome City and Ginza - both are just minutes away. But everything looked very nice.The spa offered very nice facilities including sauna, hot tub and massage. The back  neck massage I had there was very reasonably priced and probably the best massage I have ever had, anywhere in the world. Wow.In-room Shiatsu massage was also available almost round-the-clock and was also excellent and very welcome after 13 hours on a plane.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It might not be super-luxurious in the opulent sense but it was extremely comfortable, well located for travelling around Tokyo (with four Metro lines and the JR Yamanote line all within 5 minutes of the hotel entrance) and also walking distance to Tsukiji fish market, Hama Rikyu gardens and Ginza.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR614487432", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RusNewton"}, {"Content": "Quality Hotel This is a newer hotel in the newly developed Shiodome area. Incredible views, an attractive and vast lobby and bar area, and quality, attentive staff highlight this hotel. The Royal Park is ideal for the business travel, however, I noticed many couples and small families on both of my stays. With a staff that speaks decent amounts of English and with the Shiodome Metro Station just down the elevator, it's great for those wanting quality and location. I used the concierge on numerous occasions, and her patience and knowledge was refreshing. Breakfast buffet had a great selection and view out the windows. Be sure to enjoy the local TV station's hub across from the base of the building. It's kind of like the Tokyo version of the 'Today Show', and they often do segments in the courtyard with the public in the background throughout the morning. There is evidently a newly built, gorgeous live theater next door in the same complex above the Shiodome Metro Station. 'Wicked' was playing there on my previous visits. I also made the 20 minute walk to the fish market... a definite must if you don't mind getting up at the crack of dawn, but stay out of their way!Keep in mind that this section of Shiodome is like the neo-Tokyo image in that it is populated with wide sidewalks, elevated walkways, new shops and imposing business towers. You are not in the heart of the traditional culture of Tokyo, but you are in the midst of it's business culture, that's for sure.I do believe that you can find the quality of this hotel elsewhere and at a lower price. But you'll be hard pressed to find such an open lobby area, gorgeous view, and ease of travel.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR468788101", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Plan_Ahead_Fred"}, {"Content": "Perfect place to stay!

We stayed at the shiodome for 8 nights, the hotels services were FANTASTIC.. the internet in each room is what sold me, i loved being able to see the weather each day and plan our day trips inside the comfort of your own room. Even when we had a problem with the TV, they were quick to react and fixed our problem.The Shiodome is located in the heart of business Tokyo and walking distance to Ginza, so not too many tourists around here, just ppl travelling to Tokyo on business. The tour companies use it as a pick up hotel, so that has advantedges. However if you want the more Tokyo buzz i suggest staying over in Shibuya, Harajuku or Ropongi. Another positive is that JR Shimbashi station (for those with JR rail pass), on the main Tokyo loop line is a short walk from the hotel, for non rail pass uses, the Shiodome station is close by, so you can get around easily. Additionally the monorail to Tokyo Bay (Odaiba) is also walking distance.The negative side to this hotel was the guest services staff, we found that if you weren't dressed in a suit, then they will ignore you to a level of rudeness (ie. prented to make phone calls until you go away) We asked them to see if they could book a tour for us, after saying yes, they never did, and we did it ourselves with our broken Japanese. The hotel has washing machines and dryers for use, if you do not wish to use laundry services, very handy for those staying some time in Japan. For the price, I would recommend other hotels than the Shiodome. I only stayed here as I was able to obtain a corporate discount. BTW, we booked a semi double room, it was more than comfortable for 2 ppl and the bathroom size was decent. I would recommend, to save some Yen, go with the semi double.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR416866374", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Hashimotto"}, {"Content": "Never Lets Me Down While no longer 'new', I have been staying at the Royal Park Shiodome Tower for my annual visits to Tokyo since the hotel opened. It may not be the fanciest or the most glamorous, it's nevertheless a really reliable hotel that never lets me down. The location in Shiodome/Shimbashi is most convenient with easy access to a number of key subway lines, JR and otherwise. It's walking distance to Ginza, but for me, the highlight is its proximity to the Tsukiji Fish Market. If you're up by 5 am with jet lag, just walk over to the Fish Market, just at the right time when the tuna trade heats up. The whole Shio Site (as the locale is called) is a complex of office buildings (Dentsu, Shiseido and ANA have their HQs here), creating a very futuristic Blade Runner like environment that's spectacular especially at night. Every room at the hotel has a great window and the view is fantastic - big sky with hawks during the day, and sea of buildings and blinking lights at night. The complex is also packed with both retail stores and restaurants, making it very easy to either eat in your room with store-bought foods or eat out. And typical of Tokyo, even after dark, it's absolutely safe to wonder around the complex. The hotel is reasonably priced, and even though the rooms ARE on the smaller side, it more than makes up for the lack of space with everything else. It also has a small but very accessible gym (it's hard to run outside in this neighbourhood), and even a coin laundry room (convenient for a quick wash). When you book, make sure to secure reservation that includes free breakfast coupons. While I prefer to eat breakfast at Tsukiji (excellent bowl of tuna over rice plus miso soup can be had for less than $10), the hotel has a very nice Japanese restaurant that serves Japanese breakfast, as well as a bright western buffet-style breakfast place that has great views. The staff is mostly Japanese, but are most helpful.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR370403748", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "555NewYorker"}, {"Content": "japanese smooth Stayed at Royal Park Shiodome for 5 nights.
