The hotel is located in a building that is probably from the 1880's, so expect the room layout to be a bit unusual, and the floors and stairways to be a bit creaky. The ceilings must have been at least 12 feet high. We appreciated the thick carpeting, ipod dock, and comfortable bed. The neighborhood seems recently gentrified, and is great for pub crawling, cafes, and hole in the wall restaurants serving excellent food. The real clincher is the price, only $80.00 for a clean and comfortable room in the center of all the action.

They are super! Some suggestions: Parking: travellers with autos have a problem. No \"hotel\" parking, either get lucky parking on the street, or pay expensive rates at nearby lots. They should make a deal with one of the nearby lots! Local knowledge: Where is the nearest ATM machine? The all night shops (7-11)? It would be very handy for travelers staying more than one or two nights to print a map, and hand out copies to guests of useful information about the area. Not the historical stuff, there's already maps for that!

(62 dollars a night, about a mile to the inner harbour and a few blocks from mt vernon, a great neighborhood) We had read some of the bad reviews but we are very easy going people and just needed a place to sleep so it seemed perfect. We found a spot right in front of the hotel to park, that wasn't an issue. When we checked in, however, the two men behind the counter told us that while we could stay at the hotel on the first night, we would have to leave and go to another hotel on the 2nd night. These guys own another Roadway Inn 5 miles outside of the city and thats the one they were going to put us up at. They kept telling us that the rooms at the other hotel are much bigger, they all have king size beds and they wern't going to charge us more for staying in a bigger hotel...like they were doing us a favor. When I suggested that our second night should be comped or discounted the general manager got very combative and told me he could just go ahead and cancel my entire reservation if I don't think I have to pay. And then kept insisting that this was a really great deal they were giving us because the rooms were bigger. As I kept trying to tell him that we don't care about the size of the rooms, we want the location. He also said that if we needed a shuttle there would be one, but after a little more probing it turned out he meant he would be driving us in his Subaru. Without any other options we said fine, we would switch hotels in the morning and went about our trip. In the morning I went downstairs to speak to the people at the front desk about what we should do. How do we go about switching hotels? How do we get there? What is everyone else in the hotel doing? The two men (different from the day before) were dumb struck. They had no clue what I was talking about, said people were checking into the hotel for the night and made several remarks to each other that these kinds of shinanigans happen at this hotel often. They suggested I call the Comfort Inn Customer Service line. As they began filing my complaint the woman got real excited and said \"oh!! I need you to sign up for the comfort inn rewards program! It's free!! This hotel has so many formal complaints against it that I can actually give you 12,000 rewards points which will get you a free night at a different hotel in our chain\" Thats not even taking into acount the shotty rooms.

It's a 20 minute walk to the harbor. Okay during daylight, but the hookers and pimps were setting up shop on street corners by dinner time. Bus service and taxi service will get you back and forth quickly and cheaply. The hotel price is great compared to anything else remotely close to the harbor, but you need to have clear expectations of what you will be getting into. The hotel looks and feels quite old. There are tall steep wooden staircases covered by old carpeting leading to the guest rooms. There are no elevators. There are only about 6 rooms per floor. Ours was on the top floor. Including the front steps to the lobby, that was 66 steps to carry luggage up and down on check in/out. Do not attempt this hotel if you lack stair climbing stamina. Both public spaces and our room (118) had chipped and peeling paint on the walls and frames, along with plumbing pipes sticking out of roughly punched gaping holes in the walls. This applied to our shower head, the sink drain, and a wall pipe in the hallway. I also noted an open electrical junction box just sitting exposed in a wall punchout in the hallway. The shower stall had dirty stains on the plastic enclosure walls. Bath towels were cheap and thin handtowel size. The bed has a plastic barrier sheet underneath the bottom sheet, causing great rustling noises every time you or your partner change positions. Rooms have one double bed -- Rather small for two people in this day and age of queen and king beds everywhere. The complimentary breakfast is served in a small area with no seating. Put your cereal and day-old donuts on a tray and carry it to your room. We noted no interior noise disturbances, but from our top-floor room we heard loud street noises all night. People revving engines, sirens blaring (Mercy Hospital is nearby), and people calling to each other. The hotel is on a corner and in the middle of the block is a laundromat that seemed to serve as a gathering place for many destitute-looking people. I parked my car on the street with serious reservations about its safety, but had no problems whatsoever. Because of traffic delays, we got to the hotel around 5:30pm on Saturday. The clerk greeted us with \"I just called your home phone number. I didn't know if you were going to show up or not. Everyone else is checked in and I'm about to go off duty.\" That seemed like a strange deadline time for accepting checkins!

By the end of our stay, i was starting to have serious doubts as to the legitimacy of this \"hotel.\" Our stay at the Rodeway wasn't bad, but it was just full of annoyances -- it literally took 15 minutes for the water in the shower to heat up. There was no means to warm anything up: no microwave or coffeemaker in the room or on the premises at all, which is a bummer if you want a late night cup of coffee or to warm up a snack. The bed was tiiiiny. The free continental breakfast was appreciated, but it was bare bones to the max. The huge tub of waffle batter looked like it was made 6 months ago. No fruit, yogurt or anything that wasn't from a box or a mix. The location of the hotel is decent: exactly one mile from the Inner Harbor and near some bars and museums. I will give the Rodeway points for cleanliness and customer service. When i inquired about a microwave and was told that there was none, the man working the front desk kindly offered to heat up some water for me in a tiny hotpot he had. Though I was really craving a cup of coffee, his act of kindness at least got me a cup of tea. He then proceeded to heat up water for me every night -- unprompted -- for the remainder of our stay.

We could not have found another hotel anywhere in the city for that rate for even ONE night. Anyone who selects the Midtown does so for two reasons: price and location. Neither will disappoint. As I already mentioned, the rate is a steal and its location is better then the Water Front. There are a lot of cute restaurants in quick walking distance of varying prices. There is a nice coffee shop/bookstore across the street called Red Emma's that we really enjoyed. It is a one mile walk to the water front. The staff was pleasant. It is a safe neighborhood with beautiful surrounding architechture. There is also a laundromat across the street if you are planning an extended stay. Our room was huge for the price we paid -- full size bed, desk, two sitting chairs, two tv's, etc. The free wireless internet was really quick. The place was clean - things just were a bit worn. The free breakfast consisted of one type of pastry and coffee. The front desk manager also offered us orange juice. As for critiques: 1) The entire hotel exhibits poor worksmanship. The painting is poorly done and things are done sloppily. 2) The windows sometimes vibrated with traffic noise. 3) It took a long time for the shower to warm up (we were on the 2nd floor) However you get a lot of value for your money, so what do you expect when it is a 3rd of the price? Also, while the website advertises parking in a nearby garage, the desk manager had a hard time giving directions to it.

They have an Early Bird special of $7 if you are in before 9AM and out by 6PM. Overnight parking was $5.

On one day we came home late just to find the door to our room wide open. They said it was due to some painting job done during the day but didn't care to inform us in advance. Nothing was missing anyway but it didn't improved our impression of this place. And so every day some kind of problem came up. In generall I really would say that it is to much money for to little of a hotel.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brandon, MS", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay for price paid\u201d", "Author": "BrandonMS-TripTaker", "ReviewID": "UR23583359", "Content": "This was an excellent stay for the price paid.
