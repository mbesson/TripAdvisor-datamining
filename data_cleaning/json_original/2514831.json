Rooms were very clean and bright, tub/shower combo was nice and spacious. L\u2019Occitane toiletries were a nice touch. Separate toilet was \u2018euro-cramped.\u2019 Nice amenities included coffee and tea in the evening, mini refrigerator in the room and bottled water included. Small patio which is surprisingly quiet with two small tables and two chairs each for a relaxing snack on the ground floor. Everything looks like it was completely renovated recently and is a truly modern hotel. We even had a nice balcony which was perfect for an evening glass of wine. Beds were extra comfy. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful, especially Karim who was more than happy to offer suggestions for saving time and/or money. English is no problem at all and the hotel appears to cater to Americans, who comprised about 80% of the guests. Breakfast is \u20ac 12.00 pp, evening beer / wine is \u20ac 5.00 glass. Better suggestion for a more \u2018authentic\u2019 French breakfast is baguette and cheese w/ fruit, although the morning manager was a bit rude in kicking us out of the lobby area when we brought in our croissants and pain au chocolate. Said we were, \u201cbringing our own food to the restaurant\u201d. Hmmm\u2026I thought they were running a hotel catering to guests, not a restaurant. We just passed it off as being old-school \u2018rude French\u2019 who hasn\u2019t figured it out yet. The rest of the staff was great. Fairly close to the RER B subway line (7 minute walk) and the Luxembourg gardens. Same distance to the Pantheon, where we picked up our museum passes (very short ticket line.) Tips: Lots of affordable restaurants in the Latin Quarter, a favorite of many is Polidor about 10 minute walk away. Dinner for three, including starters and wine, was \u20ac 71.00 total. Bread / croissants: Go out the door, turn right and at the second street (a big street) turn left. First store on the left has fresh bread all day long. Along the way you will pass a little grocery selling fresh fruit. Cheese/etc. CremerieSte. Hyacinte. Same street as hotel, about two minutes walk (exit hotel, turn left, walk two minutes \u2013 198 Rue St. Jacques Sweets: Regis, right next to cheese shop, 200 Rue St. Jacques Wine:Nicolas, other side of cheese shop. Quick meal: Vietnam Luxembourg, one minute past the cheese shop. Skip the one you pass on the way \u2013 not good. Snack \u2013 right out the front door, Au Vieux Cedre, Lebonese wraps. Nice extras: Free wifi which worked pretty well (sometimes bogged down when lots of people were on it). Computer in the lobby for guests to use Printer for guests use came in really helpful when work sent me an important document to review. Electronic juke box where you can select the songs playing in the foyer / tea room area (hint, it\u2019s on the wall near where the stairs go up) Overall, would highly recommend if you can afford it. We paid \u20ac 272.00/night for two adults and one child (about US$ 350.00 / night at the time). Solid 4-star hotel.

Like other reviewers have said the RER is 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it is an exceptionally good service to and from the airport. At 9.10 Euros each it\u2019s a bargain rather than paying over 50 Euros for a taxi. The room itself is on the small side but it is Paris, we stayed in room 501 and it was on the top floor. The bathroom was beautiful and I found there was enough room to put toiletries in the bathroom and there was also a large fitted wardrobe located in the bedroom which was more than adequate for our belongings. I had previously read the TA reviews and people have stated that the mini bar is completely free. This does not seem to be the case anymore, the water is free (which is replenished daily) but the cans of soft drinks and orange juice are 3 Euros each. The hotel has feather pillows so anyone with allergies will need to request synthetic pillows, unfortunately they are extremely flat and we had a little trouble getting more than one each as apparently they had ran out. This was rectified the next day but neither my husband nor I slept very well throughout the entire holiday. The showers are fantastic and really powerful but this meant I could hear next doors shower very early in the morning and you could also hear them talking. The soundproofing on the doors/windows are very good as we did not hear any street noise but the soundproofing in the room leaves a lot to be desired. The breakfast looked absolutely terrible; considering we are in Paris I expected an array of croissants, cheese, meats, bread for a continental breakfast. There were a few bits of fruit, the smallest croissants I have ever seen which looked stale and some babybel cheese. At 12 Euro's each it was a bit of a joke. The bedroom had a small table and chair so each morning we went to the local bakery (there is one a couple of doors away and one a 5 minute walk away) and bought croissants, bread, smoked salmon (from the supermarket - located a few doors away) and cheeses from the food market located near the Eiffel Tower. As for the location, it is located close to Luxembourg gardens which are beautiful, Notre Dame is a 10 minute walk away and the Pantheon is a 5 minute walk away. We found that the nearest metro stop that takes you directly to the Eiffel tower is from Saint Michel which is near to Notre Dame (15 minute walk away). We also used this stop to get to the Champs Elysees but you have to change metro 3 times but at 1.70 euro a ticket it\u2019s a bargain. The Latin Quarter itself was fantastic, I much preferred this area to the Eiffel Tower as I felt safe walking around the Latin Quarter at night unlike the Eiffel Tower area. One of the best restaurants is Le Petit Chatelet which is located across the road from Notre Dame (Separate review). We did find that all the restaurants we went to did not have a menu in English but it was fun trying to decipher the menus. You will find that the Latin Quarter is much cheaper than the Eiffel Tower/Champs Elysees area but the quality is still superb. The home made baguette sandwiches were 3.70 Euros each where as at the Champs Elysees it was 7 Euros for a sandwich that had seen better days. All in all the hotel is very stylish, in a good location but I feel as the sleep quality was so poor if we return to Paris we would look at staying somewhere else in the Latin Quarter.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Virginia37", "ReviewID": "UR126608965", "Content": "The hotel is very good, mainly the staff.

Watching the movie \u201cMidnight in Paris\u201d recently on cable TV was the push I needed to post my review. The strength of this hotel lies in its location in the heart of the Latin Quarter plus its top-notch customer service. Location Hotel Le Petit Paris is situated in the fringes of the 5th Arrondissement @ Rue Saint Jacques. What I loved about its location was its proximity to the \u2018Jardin du Luxembourg\u2019 (Luxembourg Gardens \u2013 it\u2019s in the 6th Arrondissement) and of course the short walk (?2 minutes) to the Luxembourg RER station. We were literally surrounded by food \u2013 so many cafes, brasseries etc at traveler-friendly prices. Daytime, hubby and I love walking thru Jardin Luxembourg in the mornings after breakfast \u2013 seeing the perfectly maintained French gardens, kids with their sailboats or playing in the sandboxes and admiring the lovely La Fontaine de Medicis. At night, the adjacent streets are indeed \u2018made for walking\u2019 \u2013 there is nothing quite like strolling past the historical \u2018Pantheon\u2019 under the glow of the moonlight. External Fa\u00e7ade The white walled Hotel Le Petit Paris began as an 18th century coaching inn tucked inside the ancient city walls of Paris and has more or less preserved its external fa\u00e7ade thru the test of time. Room Interiorly Hotel Le Petit Paris is a boutique 5-storey hotel with 20 uniquely designed rooms. Hubby and I stayed in a \u201cSuperior Room\u201d - it\u2019s an 18m2 room with a queen-sized bed. Rather cramped admittedly but then that\u2019s the norm in Paris. The room was clean and had a modern design. Our room was done up in greenish and yellowish hues with a painting of the Eiffel Tower by the side of our bed. Wi-fi connection was speedy and the best feature of all was its \u2018romantic\u2019 bathroom. The bathroom was equipped with an adequately sized bathtub + shower overlooking \u2018starry lights\u2019 tile ceiling and we felt pampered with the L\u2019Occitane toiletries. Our gripe about the bathroom however would be its leakage problem but thankfully we had adequately thick towels to mop it up. Breakfast We didn\u2019t try their breakfast because as mentioned earlier, Hotel Le Petit Paris is surrounded by food. =) Service Two thumbs up for the hospitality shown by the hotel staff. They were courteous, professional and spoke fluent English. They really went out of their way with helpful recommendations of restaurants and tour bookings. A notable point to mention about the hotel is the complimentary tea/coffee and tidbits in the reception area and the free wi-fi + free printing service (comes in handy for printing out online airline ticket bookings). This is indeed a gem of a hotel which lives up to its Travellers' Choice Hotel Awards 2012 Top 25 hotels in France (#5) and I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alexandria,va", "Title": "\u201cLittle gem\u201d", "Author": "tmg1958", "ReviewID": "UR125128622", "Content": "This little gem of a hotel is near the Sorbonne in the Latin quarter.

We chose a \"classic\" room and we struggled to fit suitcases for both me and my husband in the room. If you are travelling with two or more people, choose one of the choices other than the \"classic\" room because it really is only big enough for one person. That said, if you can get past the room size, it's a great place to stay. The location is perfect. Close to all the sites and two blocks from shops and a wide selection of restaurants. The rooms and the hotel overall have some really fun, modern decor. The rooms are very clean. The bed are exceptionally comfortable and the bathrooms have awesome \"rain showers\". The breakfast is an extra 12 euros but is very good. Wonderful French coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice (best I've had outside Florida) and a good selection of fruit, breads and yogurt. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They all speak very good English and are exceptionally helpful and friendly with restaurant recommendations and tour bookings. We also had no issues leaving our large luggage for a two day side trip to Normandy.

I can see why so many reviewers have scored this hotel so highly. However I can also share some of the views of Ctephen - and for me 5/5 should be saved for only the very best - unfortunately for me Petit Paris, although very good, fell just a little short of outstanding. Firstly I should say this was our first stay in Paris so have nothing to compare to, but I agree that the rooms are small compared to what we have been used to in other destinations. We stayed in a superior room and just managed to get by, but I could imagine travellers with a suitcase each might quickly find room hard to come by. So tip one would be to travel with only one large suitcase if possible, to save on space. I would struggle to imagine how small the standard room would have been. On the plus side the decor of the room was lovely. It was spotless, modern and tasteful. Basically the images on the hotel website were exactly as the room itself so if you like what you see then you should not be disappointed. (our room was the red decor) The real highlight was the bathroom - great design (you could shower in the dark if you wished as small lights within the tiling and on the shower head provided subtle lighting effect). L'occitane products were also a great touch. Unfortuntely the shower glass guard was not properly sealed so water dripped off the side of the bath and soaked the floor. Not disaterous but inconvenient having to put towels on the floor when showering which were then too wet to use. The other small gripe was the bed. At first sight it looked huge and was very comfortable. But it soon became clear rather than a king size it was two twins pushed together. And that meant as the night went on myself and my partner found ourselves sliding into the middle, which wasn't the most comfortable. The pillows were also way too soft for our taste. Other highlights were the reception area, very wecoming, tastefully designed, and also free internet usage came in handy. Real classy / boutique style. Complimentary tea and coffee also a lovely touch. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, couldn't do enough for you. Spoke great english and gave good recommendations. Location wise its a two minute walk to the nearest RER (train station) and about 10 - 15 minute walk to the Seine / Notre Dame. We walked to the Louvre in about 30 mins.

All in all a great place to stay, though there were a few issues. The Good: 1) Great location in terms of getting to the hotel from the airport. You can catch the RER to Luxembourg from the airport and then walk to the hotel. Note there is an escalator going up to the street, but not one down, which can be tricky for returning to the airport with your luggage. I caught a taxi back and that was easily arranged by the hotel. 2) Great location in terms of sights. I saw a lot of things I probably wouldn't have seen but for staying at the Hotel Le Petit Paris. Luxembourg Gardens is just around the corner. You can catch the RER at Luxembourg or walk to a lot of different places - I walked to and from the Musee d'Orsay one morning. 3) The room itself was small, but that wasn't a problem for one person, although it might be worth going up to the next level of room for 2 people. The bathroom with shower and sink was quite reasonably sized, there was a separate toilet, and then the double bed which had two slim wardrobes next to it - one with the fridge, which featured complimentary beverages. Note though that only the water, not the soft drinks, are restocked during your stay. There is free wi-fi during your visit as well. 4) The lobby areas really exemplify the funkiness of the hotel. Great but functional places to sit and relax. I spent an afternoon working on my laptop in the lobby area - which also functions as the breakfast room - and that was no problem with the staff. You can also sit and read, or hang out and enjoy the Honour bar. Bad: 1) When I checked in, but notified that my room wasn't ready yet - I was there at 1 and the room would be ready at 3. But when I came back at 3 and was told that there was a problem with my room - it had not been prepared for an arrival, and so it would be another hour before it was ready. This struck me as unusual as there are not many rooms in the hotel, so wouldn't expect this to happen. 2) On my second day, I left my room early - about 8am - to go to Versailles, where I got caught in a torrential rainstorm and decided to come back to the hotel early, as being soaked for two hours left me feeling quite sick. I got back to my room at 1pm but it hadn't been serviced. I got into bed and received a phone call at 3 asking if they could service my room. I explained that I felt very unwell and couldn't leave my room right now, but if I could have some towels brought in that would be good. The maid came to my room and seemed very upset and flustered that the room couldn't be cleaned, rushing around and trying to do a full clean in 3 minutes. I felt that the fact I was unwell should have been more important than the room being cleaned, particularly even given it was my decision not to have the room cleaned. However, on the next two days the room was cleaned quite early in the day, which was very useful. Overall, it was a good hotel and I would recommend it, it has a great location, though I'm not sure if it would be my first choice on a return visit to Paris.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cModern but Cosy Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "LS641", "ReviewID": "UR120793216", "Content": "Fantastic hotel, extremely helpfull staff who are more than happy to assist with local resturants, taxis, maps etc. On arrival we were upgraded to a Deluxe room, originally booked a Superior so this was a lovely surprise.

We saw the reviews for Hotel le Petit Paris, and we were delighted we could get reservations. We were there for four nights... The reviews were pretty spot on... The location is what really brings it home; all the energy of the Latin Quarter, just steps from Jardin Luxembourg, walkable to just about everything... We really enjoyed walking to and from dinner every night - sometimes a pretty good distance, but in Paris nothing could be more beautiful. We never once felt even the slightest concern about walking around late at night in Paris. It is indeed small... standing in one spot on our floor's landing area I could touch all four guestroom doors and the elevator without moving my feet, and the front desk is truly a just a desk sitting in a small area just inside the front door, but it's not the size of the desk, it's who's sitting behind it that makes all the difference. The staff (the one person at the desk serves as both check-in and concierge) was exceptional, from setting up reservations (we made them well before we arrived for dinners - all handled via e-mails to the staff), to marking up maps for our walks and Metro adventures, to reccomending cafe's and patisseries. I cannot say enough about how gracious and helpful the desk team was. The rooms too, were typically small, but very inviting. We had a Double Deluxe room with french windows that opened overlooking the rooftops. We sat with the widows open wide in the afternoon at our little table with a half bottle of wine (available during the afternoons in the lobby for a quite reasonable price) and watched the sun go down. The shower was great, the bed was extremely plush, noise not a factor at all. As in most hotels in Paris, you have to be moderately crazy if you take the hotel breakfast (usually 12-18 Euros per person), when you can get up and walk a block to patisseries, boulangeries, or street crepe makers for an amazing and inexpensive breakfast... One of us would go out hunting and gathering, one would go to the lobby for coffee, and a few minutes later we'd be back in front of those open windows in our room eating things that would make a foodie weep. This is a very new conversion, so it's still nice and shiny at this point - hopefully it will stay that way. Do not freak out (as I did) if you go to the address on Google street view. The shot was taken before it was purchased for conversion, but not knowing that info, it sent me into a vortex of panic. It's really there and it's fine and pretty and funky-cool in it's design.

Pleasant", "Title": "\u201cTrendy, Modern Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Joel G", "ReviewID": "UR119239712", "Content": "We chose this hotel based on an exhaustive search of the internet and Trip Advisor. We had never been to Paris before, but have many friends and family who had. They all had their own suggestions for the best area of the city to stay in. We chose Le Petit Paris partly because we thought it would be well located for our visit and what we wanted to accomplish during our visit. The hotel staff is extremely professional. The website is top notch and the responsiveness to our emails before the trip was better than almost all US Hotels I've stayed at. We stayed in Paris for 8 nights and had planned to split our time between two different hotels in two separate parts of the city. One on the Left Bank and one on the Right Bank. We decided at the end to just stay in this hotel for the entire visit since we thought it would make our trip so much easier, knowing that we had our little Paris \"room\" to come back to in the late afternoon or evening. In terms of location, I would say that it would have been easier to have been a bit closer to Saint Germain or in the direction of the Seine/Notre Dame/St. Michel. It would have saved 10 minutes of walking to the St Germain restaurants and shops each day. Since we were staying for 8 nights we knew that we would have plenty of time to visit all of the main sites. The hotel is close to the Luxemburg RER (subway) station and so you can access all of Paris so easily by the Metro or Bus. We took the RER B train straight from the Airport to the Hotel and saved around 40 Euro. It was an easy transfer to the train to the Versailles and Fontainebleu castles (the later a highly recommended day trip) The hotel room is very beautifully decorated with a lot of attention to detail. The bathroom had a fantastic shower and lighting. Reminded me a bit of staying at an Aloft hotel in the US. The beds were very comfortable. Our only issue was that the blankets/quilts were quite heavy and it got hot at night. Each room has an air conditioner, but the hotel limited the thermostat to how cool you can make the room (This was a bit bothersome as it could get quite warm with the heavy blankets). Just a small note - the beds have a pretty mini bedspread. The maid staff though did not make up the beds with it every day and just folded them in the corner. (this is a small item, but for an expensive hotel that prides itself on the small details it's something that they should make note of). They also limited the volume of the television which was somewhat inconvenient depending on the channel and program you were watching. It was nice to have the stocked (free) mini refrigerator and the safe in the room. The maids restocked the fridge everyday, although we did have to remind the staff twice to restock. (again a small annoyance that seemed out of place for an upscale boutique hotel). The hotel concierge staff was awesome. Very fluent in English and willing and able to help with all of our requests. Overall, the hotel is very well run and was a great part of our vacation in Paris but is probably 20% overpriced based on the location and size of the rooms.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi", "Title": "\u201clocation not quite ideal\u201d", "Author": "Sam7506", "ReviewID": "UR119182545", "Content": "a nice and boutique style hotel, with friendly, helpful, multilingual staff.

The bed was perfect, and a one-piece mattress. The closets were broom closets. The TV stood on the floor for lack of a place to put it.

You can swing by Place Monage on the way back and walk around the little \"farmer\"s market. some amazing cheeses. From the hotel you can walk up to a restaurant on Estrapade street called L'Estrapade (excuse my French and lack of details since I am currently in Nice having only left yesterday and typing on la ipad.) who's French cuisine is amazing, great fois gras and pigeon, as well you get a home feel when you eat there. The owner has a Bernaise background and likes to tell you about it, Cooper the dog is always hanging around you trying to coax customers to feed him (don't feed the dog) and portions are big. You can also walk up Saint Michel ( or Saint Jaques but more to see on Michel) and when you reach Saint Germain St hang a right and head to another market (there is a guy who sells amazing foise gras) or head straight to the Sein and head towards Nortre Dame, or you can head to the Rue of Severin and paruse through the streets of many eats (i gave it that name, however I never ate there only with the eyes).

Someone has clearly put a lot of thought into the design and for quite a decent price you get a very comfortable stay and plenty of thoughtful touches which make you immediately like the place.

Positives: effective (silent) aircon, free wifi, satellite TV, comfortable good sized bed, free minibar soft drinks, very clean, quiet, power shower, good towels and bathroom goods, very nice design and generously fitted out. Negatives: wifi only works for one device. Public areas are also nice but..... Upon arrival I had asked business contacts to meet me in the lobby for a short meeting. There are drinks and snacks in the lobby with little forms next to them as an honesty bar, which is quite a nice idea. I didn't see any of this as I went straight to meet my contacts as I was late. At the conclusion of my meeting they said that the hotel had a wonderful policy of free drinks in the lobby. How unusual I thought. One of them went around the corner and emerged with three glasses of champagne which we toasted with and off they went. I was then accosted by the receptionist who reminded me that this was an honesty bar (i.e. basically accusing me of being dishonest) and that I owed \u20ac36 for the three glasses!! I agreed to pay \u20ac12 for my own glass which I figured would pay their costs for all three glasses, but I was put out by the way that the receptionist accused me and just would not let it go even though it was clear that this was a misunderstanding and that \u20ac36 for regular champagne was extortionate. Anyway it didn't hugely affect my stay but being accused of dishonesty is never pleasant and I think that the idea of an honesty bar, though delightful, is just going to lead to misunderstandings. I didn't try breakfast, which was available for a \u20ac12 supplement.

It's a beautiful hotel in a great part of Paris. It is quite small and the staff are great and really helpful but there are some quirks... The rooms are small The mini-bar is not cold and only has soft drinks (it seems that they don't want you to use it as it was unplugged and the information leaflet in the room states that it is not a fridge, but it is!) There are no tea making facilities in the room but there is free coffee and tea in the lounge area In the lounge area which is tiny, by reception there are floor to ceiling shelves which you would think would be full of books and magazines to read but the shelves are stocked with only coloured boxes artfully arranged... but empty! The hotel is really clean which is nice but it gets a bit much when the hoover is on for most of the day The maid entered our room (even when we were not in) even although we had put the do not disturb sign on the door. Cleanliness seems to be almost an obsession in the hotel but there are no waste bins anywhere In our double room there was only one chair at our small table so if we wanted to sit down to have a brought in drink one of us had to sit on the bed No meals are served except for continental breakfast at a charge of 12 Euros extra per person. There is a room service menu though. But we didn't use it. It would have been too cramped in the small room for a meal to be enjoyed. The lounge area only seats 12 people max which isn't good in a 20 room hotel Our bed linen and towels were changed every day, even the towels we had not used. Not very eco-friendly. And so even though we were happy to sleep in our bed using last nights linen it was not an option. ---------------------------- In short the hotel is almost like an up-market hostel. It's a great place but has many small niggles which let it down. I wouldn't stay there again but if you can put up with the relentless cleaning regime and style-over-comfort policy it's worth a visit.

LOCATION It is wonderfully easy to access from CDG airport via the RER B. As mentioned by others it is in a lovely area & really easy to walk to just about anywhere which is what we did. We left from the Gare de Lyon & it was about a 10 min cab ride on a sat morning STAFF The staff are delightfully helpful & stored our bags as we arrived very early & took them to our room before our return from sightseeing. Their recommendations for local restaurants were superb & they were happy to make the reservations for us. When friends who were meeting us to go for dinner arrived they offered them complimentary nespresso coffee whilst they waited for us. They all seemed to speak good english & could not have been more helpful. ACCOMODATION As mentioned by other reviewers, the rooms are very small but stylish. We had a classique room on the 2nd floor overlooking the courtyard. If you had 2 large suitcases you would be a bit pushed for space but we were travelling light so was not a problem. We loved having a proper double bed (as opposed to 2 singles pushed together with 2 single doonas which seems common in much of Europe) & it was probably the most comfortable bed of our trip with lovely fluffy doona, great pillows & beautiful linen. The bathroom was perfect - loved the twinkly lights & big shower with good water pressure. Complimentary soft drinks & water in the room was also a nice touch EATING & DRINKING We had the breakfast both mornings & loved it. Freshly squeezed juice, beautiful fresh fruit salad, cereals, yoghurt, really fresh & delicious bread & pastries with jams, ham & cheese. My only comment is that I don't get why they don't offer the nespresso coffee for breakfast - they put that out after breakfast for complimentary use for the rest of the day & give you a flask of plunged/brewed coffee with breakfast. Contrary to other reviewers we thought the breakfast was actually quite good value for 12euros but maybe that is because of the rate of exchange with the Aussie dollar. Given that just a coffee & croissant in some cafes in Paris can cost around 6euros, the full spread for 12 seems pretty OK. The dining & lounge area is very chic & quite funky & we loved the honesty bar which was beautifully set out of an evening for you to help yourself & sit in the courtyard or in the lounge area. Gin & tonic probably a little pricey at 10 euros but as soon as we poured ourselves a drink the staff appeared with a complimentary bowl of snacks. I assume you could bring your own drinks & sit in the same area which would be smart if you were saying for longer All in all we loved this place & have already recommended it to friends we travelled with later in our trip who are returning via Paris.

Some small glitches - a broken light fitting, and shower curtain did not really work so showering caused a large puddle to develop on bathroom floor. Staff were fantastic and welcoming at all times. Tea and coffee facilities downstairs were welcome; honesty bar a nice touch too. Breakfast was reasonable value for 12 euro - the spread was deceptively extensive and it was possible to fill up on pastries, cereal, toast , fruit and so on. Location is absolutely fabulous and atmospheric. I would not exactly describe this as a bargain - we paid 250 euro a night which is certainly not cheap.

The hotel has at all hours a coffee and tea service free of charge and a honesty bar available in the stylish lobby. Our room was a double superior room in the 4th floor. Size was perfect, the bathroom very well appointed and everything very clean. There is a mini bar filled with juices and water that is free of charge, a very nice gesture! TV channels offer programming from across Europe. The bed was very comfortable. On our second stay (1 night) we were given a smaller double classic room smaller, but very well sized. It was an interior room but it was quieter than the other one and the view to the street is really not that good!

Just the beginning of a wonderful weekend of service. Our rooms were beautiful. One room on the first floor was decorated in beautiful shades of pinks. The other room on the 4th floor with a terrace was perfect in shades of green. The terrace was a small area with 2 chairs with many leafy plants. The view was up and down Rue Saint Jacques. What a great spot to drink our bottle of champagne sent from friends at home. The rooms weren't huge but we had plenty of space. Yes, the shower walls are not designed that well so you often times have mini floods on the bathroom floors but the showers were wonderful with excellent water pressure. The honor bar was a great idea. We used it almost every night before and after we went out to dinner. On our last night after returning from a late dinner, we sat in the lobby with other guests from Australia till 3:30 am. The gentleman at the front desk never acted like he was put out to be cleaning up our glasses at that hour. And the prices for drinks at the honor bar are beyond reasonable. Overall, I can not say enough about this wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Paris. You will not feel like tourists when you step out the front door. You will feel like this is your Paris neighborhood as you walk off to buy something at the boulangerie or patisserie a few doors down.

The nice-touches: great decor, comfy rooms, nice bathroom, complimentary coffee, tea, water and biscuits, great wifi that worked consistently, a public computer from which guests can print e-tickets, and a full spread of alcoholic beverages available at night under the honor system. Also, we made last minute plans to vacate our reservation early in order to detour to Monaco, and the hotel accommodated our change and gave us the 3 for 2 special even though our early departure cut off our 6th and free night. The drawbacks: The front desk staff was very helpful, but not overly friendly (with the exception of Abdul who was awesome!). The rooms are really small (but I assume this is typical Parisian style). They did not have any guidebooks or tourist tools of any sort. This, combined with the fact that those at the front desk often said they didn't know where certain things were, was somewhat frustrating.

On our first night there, we discovered that our room did not have a safe installed yet. The next day we had one! We consulted with the ladies at the front to get their advice on places to go, suggestions for the best way to get to certain places, etc. While I am sure they are often bombarded with these types of questions all day, they never showed any sign of irritation. Each person we dealt with seemed more than happy to help us. That is a very reassuring feeling being a foreigner in another country. As far as location goes, we felt this hotel was in a great spot. We were close to a metro station, and were close enough for pleasant walks to Notre Dame, the Louvre, and the lively streets within the Latin Quarter.

We weren't keen on our pink room, and although it was a superior it was tiny even compared to other boutique hotels we've stayed in in Europe. The staff were polite but not very knowledgeable - they told us the wrong place to get the tour bus so we walked for miles in the rain to find the right stop, we would expect them to know these things and have leaflets about them. On Saturday morning (busiest day) the breakfast waitress could speak no English, and although we are French speakers many of the other guests were not so this caused problems. Also, on the final night the electricity went off at midnight and didn't come back on until 7am.

Our stay in Le Petit was for 6 nights and we each had a suitcase and a smaller roller bag. My caution is that the rooms are small. We had the deluxe double room and the room was very nice with a comfortable bed and bathroom but virtually no closet or storage available. We stacked the suitcases in one corner and took out what we thought we would need for the week in Paris but of course it was a daily ritual digging the suitcases out and finding things we needed. The suitcases and roller bags made getting around the small room even more difficult. The hotel was finished within the last year in an older building but the interior and all of the furnishings are brand new and comfortable. The staff was excellent and spoke English. They were very knowledgeable and their directions were right on. The wireless internet service in the room was excellent and they had a laptop in the lobby for those that do not want to carry one. There was a small Italian restaurant 3 doors from the hotel going towards Notre Dame that we found to be excellent. There are small grocery stores, wine stores, bakeries, cheese and other such stores all within 2 blocks. You are within 1 block of the bus service and 3 blocks to the subway. We walked to Notre Dame and several other close locations and used the bus and subway for the other Paris attractions. Cab service to and from the hotel to the train stations were made without problems. Please do not strike this hotel due to the size of the rooms. It is everything that all of the reviews cover but you should expect the room to be a lot smaller than you are used to in other world locations. If we return to Paris for a short trip with much less luggage this will be my choice for a hotel. My last comment is that when we left Paris we took the Train to London. This is a two hour trip and you are only under the channel for 20 minutes. We both agree that travel through Europe by Train is the only way to go and from now on we will home base out of London or Rome and use the Train for all of our Europe travel.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cLoved le Petit\u201d", "Author": "vetin02", "ReviewID": "UR66365263", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel le Petit Paris in May for 8 nights in one of their standard rooms. The vacation was wonderful and we really enjoyed staying at the hotel. We arrived in the morning so were unable to check in right away but stashed our bags at the hotel and did a little exploring in the meantime. The hotel is very near the Pantheon in the Latin Quarter of Paris. We felt the location ended up being a good place for us to stay - there is a park, the Luxembourg Gardens, a couple blocks from the hotel that is a favorite of Parisians to go and sit, relax, picnic, etc. The metro stop is pretty convenient and other than hoofing it, was the sole mode of transportation that we used. Bike rentals are throughout the city and the bus system is also supposedly very good (you can use metro tickets for the buses too), but we didn't end up using either. The hotel is one metro stop and easily within walking distance to Notre Dame. The hotel itself was very clean with excellent staff. The room we had was small with a WC on one side of the room and the shower/sink near the entrance to the room. Our room faced in toward the central courtyard (a small area with a couple of outdoor tables) and was next to the elevator on the 1st floor (one up from the lobby). I've noticed people posted regarding noise issues and we did not experience that problem. If anything, we had to be careful not to oversleep as we did one Sunday morning until 10:30am. I do tend to bring earplugs whenever I travel, but my wife does not and is a light sleeper and had no issues whatsoever with noise. And this was supposedly one of the busiest times as all hotels in Paris were booked and we had many people tell us that it is the most people they've ever seen in Paris - so the lack of noise was not due to a lack of people. The shower did leak onto the bathroom floor along the sides, but didn't affect our trip at all. Just be careful not to leave clothes on the floor when showering or they might get wet. Other than that, I cannot think of anything negative. They have an espresso machine downstairs that we would use free in the evenings. They also put out an honor bar (liquor and wine) at night - we didn't use it but it looked like they had a number of selections. We also didn't eat breakfast there although it appeared as if a number of people did. There are a few restaurants that serve breakfast in the morning by the Pantheon and numerous bakeries to grab a pastry on the way to wherever you are headed. The staff was very nice - we mostly dealt with two nice young women at the front desk who offered good restaurant recommendations and directions. The room itself was maintained very well by the cleaning staff. The bottom line is that we enjoyed the hotel, would return, felt we paid less than comparable hotels, and would recommend this hotel to friend or family. We booked directly on the hotel's website and I would recommend that as they had better deals on their website itself than the travel sites.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "burk13", "ReviewID": "UR65926631", "Content": "boutique hotel with great and helpful staff and modern/cool vibe.

We were not disappointed. We booked the green room that is pictured on the site and in some of the pictures in tripadvisor, which is one of the few with a private balcony, and we loved it. The decor was as we expected, bright, modern and charming, and everything was spotlessly clean. We didn't end up using the balcony much at all, but enjoyed having it there to check the weather conditions, and for peering out at Paris once in a while. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing, with a large rainshower overhead as well as a handheld nozzle. Roomwise, we had a couple of minor quibbles. The toilet was in a separate little closet that is in the entry hall, not in the bathroom, which proved to be a bit inconvenient having to walk across the bedroom to wash your hands, but not a big deal, and there were obviously advantages to having the toilet separate. The only other issue was that the room was quite small, which we expect in Paris, so there was not a lot of room to lay-out and open the suitcases. However, the charm of the room made it feel very homey and comfortable. The staff was amazing. Everyone was friendly, helpful, smiling and charming. They helped us get tickets to see Moulin Rouge after we had called the theatre ourselves already and been told it was sold out...and we were seated right next to the stage, which we couldn't tell was because of the hotel or not, but it was unexpected and nice. We were on our honeymoon and our friends had arranged for surprise gift baskets, flowers and bottles of champagne to be sent to our room twice over the course of our stay, and I was told that the hotel staff had been very helpful in making these arrangements, and the gifts were very well arranged in the room when we arrived. The common areas to the hotel are also very beautifully decorated in a very colorful, crisp and modern way. Its the only lobby area that we have ever spent time in. We actually hired a Parisian photographer for a Paris photoshoot, and when we showed her pics of our hotel she was so taken with the decor she insisted on doing part of our shoot in the hotel. There was a breakfast eating area which was also very inviting as well as a private outdoor courtyard. Breakfast was for a fee, and we paid for it once and it was a simple and fine. There was an honesty bar that had tea and coffee in the afternoon and I believe booze in the evening but we were always out.

They have a decent hairdryer, but I think you may have to ask for an iron/ironing board. The L'Occitane products in the bathroom are a nice touch. Housekeeping is great too. The capsule coffee in the downstairs is on from 12pm and it's great after a long walk to just come knock one back in the teeny courtyard and relax for a moment. The location is great too... I recommend Cafe Soufflot on Rue de Soufflot for a beer/wine after a long day's walk, sitting outside... the sunshine beaming down.. fabulous....

We booked the double deluxe room. It was initially quite expensive, but we got one night free as part of a Spring deal, which made it more manageable. The hotel is well-located for sights, attractions and also for eateries, so the price isn't really surprising. The room and en-suite bathroom were very stylish, and I really liked the lime and purple decor (though I appreciate it may not be to everyone's taste). The room was very small, but we didn't need to spend much time in there so it didn't bother us. The bed was of normal size, but I found being boxed in by the wardrobes either side a little claustrophobic. The bathroom was nice, though short on storage space. The little lights set into the grouting in the bathroom were very pretty, and I loved the L'Occitane toiletries. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The lounge/lobby area was quite comfortable, and the complimentary tea and coffee were a nice touch (especially the Nespresso machine). One note about the honesty bar - I'm not sure how \"honest\" the pricing is, at \u20ac10 for a whiskey!! We didn't stay for breakfast so I can't comment, though I did see it laid out - it looked tasty, though was very expensive - my advice would be to pick up something nice at a boulangerie and save yourself some money. A couple of issues: we were woken every morning by noisy construction work going on in what I assume was the building next door. I appreciate that the hotel itself may well have no control over this, but it would have been professional to forewarn us of the noise when we arrived (we couldn't be bothered requesting to move rooms once we'd settled in). Also, the shower leaked badly. There was water absolutely everywhere within moments of the shower being on. I heard another customer mention this at the desk one morning, and I mentioned it in passing upon checking out - the lady at the desk admitted that all shower doors needed to be resealed.

How often in your travelling experiences do you stay in places whose rooms are so new that you are one of the first guests? Coffee is left out the whole day, it is the capsule variety you can slip into the machine so you can choose the strength. I am not a fan of the strong Parisian coffee you buy in restaurants! Breakfast costs 10 euro per person and is worth it, there is not a massive spread but it is sufficent and will be far cheaper than going out to eat. There are many Americans in the hotel thanks to the favourable tripadvisor ratings and I heard many say how much they will miss this hotel. There is a complimentary computer terminal in the lounge area and I believe free wifi, I love it when hotels provide these things free.

In my view, this hotel deserves the excellent reviews it has been getting. I\u2019ve given it a 4 rating because I think that a 5 may raise false expectations.

It\u2019s hard to add anything that hasn\u2019t been said already but \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s easy to get to Le Petit Paris by RER (Blue Line B) direct from CDG. Somebody else had posted directions to the Hotel from Luxembourg RER station \u2013 that was helpful to us so I\u2019ll repeat them for others: come out of the station by the exit to Rue Gay Lussac, as you come up the last escalator cross the road at the zebra crossing directly in front of you. Turn right at the corner where McDonalds is then walk up towards The Pantheon. Turn right again into Rue St Jacques (Crepes a Go-Go is on the corner on the opposite side of the road). Le Petit Paris is on your right a couple of hundred yards down the road. The welcome we received was friendly and very efficient \u2013 full marks there. Our room 402 was lovely. Like most Paris hotels it wasn\u2019t massive but it was plenty big enough for us and there was way more cupboard space than I had expected. The standard of furnishings was very high and the bed was very comfortable indeed. There is quite a lot of traffic on Rue St Jacques but you couldn\u2019t hear a thing as the double glazing is so effective. The shower was lovely (yes ours leaked a bit too but it wasn\u2019t a big deal). Everything was spotlessly clean. We didn\u2019t have breakfast in the hotel as we preferred to go out each day but the free coffee and tea in the little lounge area was welcome and the \u201chonesty\u201d bar works well. I can\u2019t remember all of the prices but it was 5 Euros for a glass of wine. We loved the location of the hotel \u2013 so close to The Pantheon and the Sorbonne, St Germain etc. We spent a very pleasant couple of hours in the Jardin de Luxembourg. It really is my favourite area of Paris. There is a plethora of cafes, restaurants etc within easy walking distance. Our favourite, recommended by the hotel, was Restaurant Perraudin \u2013 out of the hotel and turn left and it\u2019s towards the corner of Rue St Jacques. The 3 course menu was just under 30 Euros, with 5 or 6 choices for each course. The food was fabulous. There didn\u2019t seem to be any need to book \u2013 it\u2019s open for lunch and dinner.

That being said, our overall 'very good' rating just misses out on 'excellent' due to a couple of relatively minor points, most of which can easily be rectified as the hotel grows older (it is only recently opened). Namely, Valentines weekend in Paris was extremely cold (negative degrees) and unfortunately one evening our air con just wouldnt stop blowing cold air into our room- we called reception who, while very polite, couldnt help rectify the problem. Fortunately the duvets in the room are both extremely comfortable and very warm, so we managed! The minor detail points referenced above include having an electrical socket near the shower (!), missing towel racks, no place to put amentities while showering, and a broken light (wires hanging out). These can be forgiven as the hotel is finding its feet, but still need to be rectified - a standout hotel is one that pays attention to all the little details.

As mentioned in many reviews it is a lovely boutique hotel in a wonderful location and with an outstanding staff. Our room, albeit being one of the largest one, was fairly small but well appointed and very comfortable for a leisure stay.

The hotel seems to be a town house which has been converted. The owner explained that it used to be a hostel type of hotel and needed a huge amount of work to get it to the state it's in now. The design approach seems extremely contemporary with lovely touches throughout. I'll post some photos, but there's a modern take on the chandelier in reception, a bookcase with jauntily arranged vibrantly coloured boxes, an unusual raised wallpaper and a Space 1999 type sit in bubble seat. Words don't do it justice. We took the suite which is up on the 1st floor. The room was fairly spacious - although some of my friends' rooms were not. The suite has an en suite bathroom and a riased wardrobe area. All colours are warm and welcoming. The TV had more channels than I've seen in a long time although there was no DVD or stereo. (which you'd expect at this price point). The bathroom was nicely done with a TV above the bath. Only compliant here is that it's a bit small - taller people will struggle in this bath. The shower is great though. Another nice touch is that the air con (if you use it) is quiet, whisper quiet.

We had such a wonderful time. As other have said unless you know what you're looking for it is very easy to walk past the hotel on Rue St Jacques as there is only a subtle sign next to the entrance. However, it was very simple to get to the hotel from the airport (it was about a 30-40 min journey (check which train you get as some are \"quick trains\" which only stop at 3 or 4 stations others seem to stop at every station)) . The train station (Luxembourg) is only a 5 min walk from the hotel. Each room at the hotel is styled in a different way. We stayed in room 503 which was a 70's style room. As with all hotel rooms they're not big but that didn't matter to me. The decor was lovely and we had an amazing view across the rooftops of Paris including a view of the Eiffel tower in the distance. The whole room was finished to a good standard. There was also small mini bar hidden in the cupboard (i think it was either 3 or 4 euros for a can of coke). There is a lounge area next to the reception on the ground floor where you can help yourself to complimentary tea or coffee all day. The lounge as with the rest of the hotel was very stylish and very relaxing. Between 6 pm and 12pm there is an honesty bar that operates which seems to work very well. There was a good choice of drinks. The free wifi throughout the hotel was also a bonus. There was a laptop in the lounge that guests could use. One thing that i couldn't rate highly enough about the hotel was the staff. They were the best reception staff i have ever had to deal with. Alexandra deserves a special mention. She was so, so helpful! Alexandra recommended and booked some fabulous restaurants for us throughout our time in Paris. She also helped my husband to suprise me with some beautiful flowers. Her English was perfect and she was more than willing to help us improve our very dodgy French. The only hint of a negative thing that i could say about the hotel was that a couple of the rooms appear to back on to the lift shaft and you can hear the noise when you're in the rooms but it didn't bother me at all. There are only approx 20 rooms at the hotel and as such the lift didn't seem to be used too often. As to the rest of Paris we loved it all. The Pantheon and Notre Dame were only 5-10 mins walk away. There were lots of lovely cafe's in Saint Germain. We also loved having a walk around the Latin Quarter. The only place that dissapointed was the famous cafe Angelina's. Having queued up outside for 10 mins with high hopes of the best hot chocolate in Paris what i was actually met with was a horrible drink and a very rude waitress.

My wife likes to get to a hotel on the first night by taxi so i caved in and got the taxi. When we checked into the hotel the taxi driver entered reception looking for us and i was in shocked when he handed us 10 euro as in error we over paid him.

You then write down on a menu provided what you got and when you have finished drinking for the evening you leave the menu into reception who charge this to your room. Theres a mini bar in your room which contains minerals at a cost of \u20ac3.Breakfast ranges from 10 to 15 euro per person per day. We didn't use this as we are not breakfast people. Theres also a laptop provided in the lobby with unlimited internet access. Overall i have to say this was a our first time to travel to Paris and i did this for my wifes 30th birthday. We also travelled to eurodisney and was easy to reach via the railway. The hotel is welcoming, warm, friendly and nothing is any problem. We will be back time and time again.

Contempary chic design with nice entrance lobby area.

These issues are a bit of a surprise to me as there has been major investment in the building and very chic/classy decor, but it is early days and staff informed me that works to fix the shower/s were being carried out just after Christmas. Definitely good for two people, not sure about three in a room, apparently they have a bigger triple room? Gave me discount on checking out, thank you, staff were very apologetic and aware of the issues and I have no doubt they will address same asap.

The amenities in this type of hotel tend to be limited, but that's fine by us - we are there to see Paris, not sit in the hotel all day. In this hotel there isn't actually even room service (although they had a bottle of Champage waiting on ice in my room on arrival, as requested) - there is an 'Honesty Bar' where you take what you want and fill in a form that they collect and bill you for when you're paying at the end of your stay. This is our new favourite hotel in Paris. It's small and modern, brand new and near to lots of nice restaurants, bars, shops, metro, etc. The hotel is obviously very new, but the staff were literally more helpful than in any other hotel i've stayed in europe - nothing was too much trouble. While the bedroom was small, it was very well equipped, and the decor (every bedroom is different) was really nice. We stayed in the 'medievil' style room on the top floor and it was really fantastic.

There's no restaurant and breakfast is served in the reception area which doubles as a lounge area. If you haven't travelled to Paris before, hotel rooms do tend to be small and this is no exception - but they make up for it with the quality of decor and fixtures/fittings - perfect if you want to stay somewhere different. Our room was on the 5th floor and the glazing was strong enough to block out most noise. We had a problem with the hot water pressure on both mornings - I don't think there system is capable of providing everyone with hot water at the same time. In the end, we just needed to be patient. The staff were apologetic and promised to raise it with the manager. So in summary, good location in the latin quarter, beautiful design, polite and friendly staff and definately a thumbs up for a boutique hotel - but be prepared, the rooms are small. One final point to note, due to the size of hotel, all rooms in the main building seem to be close to the lift so you will hear it running but given that there can't be more than 3 rooms per floor and 5 floors, it doesn't intrude on your sleep.

Coming out of the metro station (direct from CDG airport by the way, very handy!) and seeing the glorious Panth\u00e9on lit up at night took my breath away. Standing at the crossroad on Rue St Jacques you can admire the Panth\u00e9on on one side, and look across to the Eiffel Tower on the other - Paris encapsulated =D Had a little trouble finding the hotel at first - we'd actually walked straight past it! The outside front is very small and understated, easy to miss. But it makes it all the more special when you get inside and discover such a chic interior. We stayed in room 301, so not such a glamorous view from the window but a really great room nonetheless - it's a red 'Medieval style' room, although the link to anything actually Medieval is tenuous - but hey, it's a holiday, not a history trip! =) The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom stunning (although small). The shower was a delight =) The windows are all triple glazed, so it was very quiet - but also very hot at night. After tinkering with the air con we did manage to maintain a comfortable temperature without needing to open the window and let in traffic noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful; even before our arrival I had no problems telephoning to discuss various things, and they were always extremely polite. The room was kept clean, and any other requests such as extra little things for the bathroom/Wifi code/recommended restaurants were met quickly and efficiently. The WiFi works great by the way - good for entertainment if you're not a fan of French television or dubbed programmes ;) The area surrounding the hotel is extremely good. In fact I think the Cinqui\u00e8me (5th) arrondissement is my favourite in all of Paris. It's easy walking/metro distance from the main areas of town and the touristy sights, but just far enough away to make eating out at a reasonable price possible. There are plenty of bars and restaurants on offer too, and thanks to the Sorbonne's proximity the nightlife atmosphere is fun and lively but not rowdy. It's also a very beautiful area - one road away from the Luxembourg gardens and a short walk from the Seine. I would love to go back! But this class of hotel is usually out of my price range.

Our room number was 503 and was styled as the 'seventies', though having lived through the seventies I am happy to report that the decor of the room was much more stylish than I remember the seventies ever being, though it did have a brown and gold colour scheme, so that definitely did remind me of the seventies. The room was not excessively large but there was plenty of room to store 2 cases and still be able to walk around. Where there is a deficiency is in the storage, only two rather narrow wardrobe and shelves at either side of the bed and in one of those the bottom 2 shelves were taken up by the mini-bar (which only contained soft drinks) leaving only the 5 hangers and a top shelf. The presence of the mini-bar also made this storage area rather warm, so not a place to keep your chocolate supply! We had a queen sized bed which was very comfortable. There was also a table and two chairs in the room and a standard lamp. There was also a Television in the room but only French channels were available. The bathroom was also very stylish with LED lighting in the wall of the shower and the shower itself being an overhead rainwater type with a separate hand held 'wand' also fitted. The bathroom did have a couple of little annoyances, the first that there was nowhere to hang your hand towel, so it ended up being folded on the shelf above the sink alongside our toiletries, there was also no shelf in the shower cubicle so you had to place your shower gel and shampoo on the ground, there was plenty of room for a shelf in the cubicle so this seemed a very strange omission. We could not fault the cleanliness of the room, towels were changed daily and both the bedroom and the bathroom were spotless. It was also a plus point that the hotel supplied toiletries were l'occitane, so good quality. We actually had a distant view of the eiffel tower from our room, at the back of the hotel, which was an unexpected bonus. We did wonder if those rooms on the front of the hotel may suffer from noise as rue at jacque is quite a busy road, though the windows are double glazed. We found the staff very friendly and helpful, however we were not told that in order for the lighting to operate you had to fit your room card into a slot, fortunately for us we arrived in daylight, those arriving in darkness may well have had more of a problem. The landing lights are fitted with PIR sensors but they did not operate quickly so if you switched off your room lights there was a moment where you were plunged into darkness. The hotel itself is not named on the outside, the only clue is a large vertical hotel sign hanging from the building, had we arrived on foot and not by taxi then I can imagine we may have struggled to find it (for those who do arrive on foot, it is across from a 'kebab' shop and just slightly diagonally across from a kitchenware shop). The public areas are stylish and quirky, difficult to describe but you can see for yourself on the hotels website. There is also, apparently free wi-fi in the hotel, certainly there was free internet available near to reception. There was also a coffee machine available free of use in the small seating area and the hotel ran an honesty bar. We did not have breakfast in the hotel (\u20ac10 for buffet continental plus \u20ac4 for omelette or plate of ham and cheese which you had to order in advance) but from what we saw of it the selection was cereals then various boulangerie products with a selection of jams. We actually had a 'breton' breakfast at the nearby cafe 'Crepes Agogo' on the corner of rue st jacques and rue sufflout, sugar crepe, coffee and fruit juice for \u20ac8.70. There are many places to eat nearby and the Luxembourg RER station is about 5 minutes away, the walk to the nearest Metro station (Cluny-La Sorbonne) is about 10 minutes and the walk to the river at Notre Dame about 15 minutes, allow more time for walking back up the not inconsiderable slope of Rue St Jacque. So, all in all we were more than happy with the hotel but are not sure it is worth the price, especially the normal undiscounted rates.

We stayed at Le Petit the last week of October for five nights and at the time we booked the hotel two weeks before our trip, Le Petit was ranked on TripAdvisor in the high teens, but by the time we returned it had already risen to #2 (at time of this review). The owners have clearly invested a lot of money in upgrading and decorating the hotel. Each floor has its own style - we stayed on the 3rd floor which we were told was all decorated in a red scheme (apparently each floor has its own design scheme). The bathrooms were definitely the best...with small LED lights embedded across both the ceiling and the tiles on the side, a flat screen TV in the shower wall, and a great waterfall style shower that fell like rain from the ceiling around a light. It was neat to turn off the main lights and only shower with the LED & shower lights watching TV. While the room itself was on the small side (like most hotels in Europe), it was very clean and modern with nice decor. The windows opened so we could enjoy the cool fresh air...not much of a view from our room but it was nice and quiet. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful...particularly Alexandra who spoke very good English. There was an honor bar each night with a great selection of wines, spirits, beer, and other beverages. We elected not to have breakfast at the hotel since there were so many other choices nearby, but it did look very inviting. The location was great with so many restaurants, cafes, brassieres (bars), bakeries, grocery stores, shops, etc. within a couple of blocks of the hotel. The Pantheon was also a couple of blocks up the street and the RER Luxembourg train/metro stop was only 3 mins walk. When the weather was nice (which happened to be four of the five days), we would stop at a bakery and walk into Luxembourg Gardens (3 mins away) to have our breakfast in the morning sun. In the evenings, it was very convenient to have the local bars very close to the hotel...there were many choices within a short radius. The WOS bar a block away was really nice with a great selection of drinks and beer from around the world, a very happening local bar called Le Pantheon literally around the corner, and a bunch of brassieres on Rue Soufflot (next to the Pantheon). A short ten minute walk and we found ourselves on Boulevard Saint-Germain where there are tons of restaurants, cafes, shops, nightlife, and action...very busy with so many dinner choices it will make your head spin. Being right next to Luxembourg RER, it was extremely convenient coming from Charles De Gaule airport with a direct train (RER B) straight from the airport to Luxembourg station and then a short 3 minute walk to the hotel. However, it was hard to see the hotel (we walked straight past it with our luggage) as there is only a generic blue \"Hotel\" sign high above, and while it doesn't look like much from the street, once inside it is definitely a nice boutique hotel. There are also a couple of small grocery/convenience stores next door where we bought water, wine, food, and soft drinks for the room which we put in the small minibar. There is a hair dryer in the room but no iron, so we had to use the hotel pressing service (no service on Sunday). We were completely happy and wouldn't change our selection of hotel if we had the chance. Le Petit would certainly be our first choice in Paris...we just hope that the fact it is ranked so high won't hurt our chances of finding availability or increase the price in the future.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa barbara", "Title": "\u201cElegent and very wimsical\u201d", "Author": "lyndenSantaBarbara", "ReviewID": "UR48194197", "Content": "I found this hotel very accidentily and we were very surprised how wonderful and beautiful it was.
