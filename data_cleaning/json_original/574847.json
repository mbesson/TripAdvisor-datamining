We had intended to take the subway, which is only a block away, but Madrid is so intimate and walkable that we never rode it, instead walking everywhere, including the Prado and the neighborhoods to the south and southeast.

The bedroom had four beds - a full and three singles. My bed was underneath the roof line so I had to be careful and not hit my head - I did not succeed. The room also had two desks, windows without curtains or screens, and plenty of outlets. Like a previous reviewer wrote - the bathroom did not afford complete privacy. Fine for a family but maybe not good for friends. But it was beautiful. We (or should I say my traveling companions) had the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant. I am not a breakfast person and when I do have it I want a good selection. This buffet did not meet my needs for the price. Would I stay here for a week? No, but it was good for my short stay and for the price.

We booked a family room as we had 2 adults and 2 teens. The family room we were given when we checked in was on the 4th floor and had a sloped ceiling. It felt like we were sleeping in a cave and if you didn't bend down when you walked around you would hit your head. It made us feel very claustrophobic. They really shouldn't be selling that as a room. We went to the front desk and complained. They told us we could switch rooms but not until the 2nd night. When we went to the front desk the next morning to switch rooms the front desk clerk told us we had to pack every thing and he didn't know when another room would be available. He told us we had to bring our luggage downstairs and he would lock it up with other guests luggage in little area in the lobby. It didn't feel very safe having our luggage with other guests luggage as anyone could pick up ours when they picked up theirs. When we made a deal of it another family room magically became available. The family room we received was better with a normal ceiling. 1. The bunk bed in the family room- My teen daughter who slept in the top bunk had to climb the ladder to get there. It didn't seem very secure. As she climbed the ladder it swung around and didn't stay put which could cause an injury. I had to hold it so she didn't fall. 2. The bathroom- As previous reviewers have said the bathrooms have a frosted door which doesn't give you a feeling of privacy. There is no bath tub which there should be for a 4 star. The shower head is very nice but there is a opening in the shower area with no door which makes it impossible to take a shower without getting the whole bathroom wet. 3. Breakfast- breakfast was good with fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, pastries, etc. There was a lot of pork. We don't eat pork so we just didn't eat that part. The hotel is in a great location if you want to be in a place to walk around. If you don't have a lot of time we recommend the tour bus. We took that and it was very worth it. You see more than if you try to do it on your own. You can get off at various stops and get back on whenever you feel like it. If you compare this hotel to a 4 star hotel in the US there are definitely not the same standards. But, we would stay here again for the convenience of the location and a family room which it doesn't seem is easy to find in Madrid unless you stay at a Petit Palace.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFantastic central location\u201d", "Author": "ohdesi74", "ReviewID": "UR133337461", "Content": "This hotel is located right in the center of the city and is walking distance to a lot of fun stuff in La Latina, Sol, Gran Via, Paseo del Prado etc. The metro is about 4 mins away and so getting to and from the airport is easy.

After booking through Expedia, I telephoned the hotel directly over a month in advance to explain our reasons for booking a family room rather than a triple and was assured by the head receptionist (Marta) that we will be allocated a larger of the family room and that she has made a note against our booking regarding this. When we arrived to check in, despite there being 3 of us at the reception desk, we found that we were given the keys to a twin room. After traipsing all our luggage up, and after a long day's travel, I must say this was highly irritating. I then had to have a long and detailed conversation at the duty receptionist to rectify this - who was highly rude and uttered not a single word of apology for their mistake. This particular receptionist continued his rude behaviour throughout our stay there. The room we were finally given was no bigger than the standard twin with bunk beds squeezed in. They seem to call themselves a high tech hotel, but the wifi was sketchy at best and the only thing high tech was the laptop provided and the shower (which was totally impractical if you wanted to avoid flooding the bathroom). I must stay they should focus on getting the basics right - such: as locks on the bathroom, proper bathroom door rather than a frosted on to avoid disturbing others in the middle of the night, providing enough hand soap, supplying irons, bath matts, sufficient pillows as standard rather than having to ask for this, also things like \"do-not-disturb\" tags, slighly softer mattresses, better storage for clothes, mirror in the room rather than just the one in the bathroom, repairing the water damage in the bathroom ceiling (see picture!) etc. I good go on.

I absolutely HATE booking into a hotel claiming to be a four star when really it is a three star, it is a very unpleasant surprise on arrival. I am starting my review by telling you that this is a THREE star hotel, not a FOUR star hotel as advertised. Do NOT expect a four star pampering or a romantic environment for a honeymoon in Madrid, etc. etc. Beds: Look nice, but equipped with three star mattress and pillows - unpleasant after three or four days. Room Design: Ok, but a let down from the photos online Shower: Impressive fixture with multi spray system (full body shower) but aside from this, spartan at best with no tub. Service: Pleasant and helpful at desk, but no room service, no in-suite amenities such as coffee maker, tea, etc. Room bar is stocked with a few basic items. Food: Breakfast is a basic english and continental combination. Definitely not four star, but would be acceptable if I did not have to pay an additional 30 Euros or so for the opportunity of eating it instead of spending the 10 or so Euros that it would have cost me to buy some wonderful pastries and espresso on the streets of Madrid, right outside the hotel. Location: Very good location in Madrid. This is a great hotel if you do not plan on spending much time at the hotel. Actually I will add that I saw an advertisement for free bike rentals at the hotel, which I did not try but I thought could be a nice touch. Worth inquiring about. Condition: Rooms in fair condition, hole showing in wall. Room smelled mildly of sewage (not kidding). Sound of running/dripping water when upstairs suite flushed toilet and showered made me confident the smell might really be sewage (what else smells like sewage?). Hallways are nice but main common areas (lobby, etc.) are in need of paint, updates and furnishing. White designer couch in entrance is filthy, paint is very dirty, etc. etc. I know this review sounds bad, but I am telling it how it is. Location is excellent and the hotel would be decent if it had been rated three stars and if the price was 30+ Euro cheaper including breakfast. I left feeling a little ripped off, lied to, and my back hurts more from the bed than from the plane ride to Madrid.

As we wandered around town I observed at least two others. I am not sure what makes them \"high tech\"? There is a laptop in each room which is included in the room price. There is also free wifi available. The old Dell was somewhat useful to check-in online or look at the train schedule though I am always reluctant to venture into my personal email or any bank account as I know key-stroke recorders and sniffers exist. (I don't want to hand anyone my login or password on a silver platter). There was nothing brilliant about this hotel. The room size was average (square) with a queen bed and a quarter of the space being taken up by a frosted glass cube which was the bathroom/shower. The wallpaper was dingy/worn as was the carpet. The light fixture were dated and the room as a whole appeared \"worn\". It's not dumpy, just worn and dated. The flat panel TV was hanging the wall swivel mount by one last bolt so I notified housekeeping - Nothing was ever done to correct. There is a breakfast spread available in the basement, however, we opted to wander out for all our meals. This location was great. One block from Puerta del Sol where you can catch the Metro to anywhere. Two train connections had use to the bullfights or soccer stadium (Real Madrid). It was also very easy to navigate to/from the airport via metro. The Plaza Mayor is a stone\u2019s throw East. Many dining options but in our case, we ate little places off the beaten path with the locals and only drank and people watched in the Mayor. On the other side of Mayor was the market with fresh juices, breads, sushi, tapas... anything you could imagine. A little pricey but worth a visit after 11am. The Royal Palace is within 10 minutes walking as are many other attractions. I don't know if this was the \"best location\" to stay in Madrid but it did not disappoint us.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "VT", "Title": "\u201cSpacious with bathroom issues\u201d", "Author": "lump62", "ReviewID": "UR118632721", "Content": "This was our first night in Spain and first of two nights in Madrid.

A couple of good tapas bars close to the hotel were La Descubierta and La Panera, definately worth a visit! The best way to get from the airport to Madrids main square is by metro, here are some helpful directions: After collecting your baggage, it's a bit of a walk to the exit. Keep walking towards the exit and eventually you'll see diamond shaped signs with \"metro\" on them; follow these signs (the entrance is inside the airport). - Each subway line is signified by a colour and a number. To differentiate between both directions each line takes, each one is signified by the final stop on that line in that direction. There is only one subway line to take from the airport, pink line (No. 8), and it only goes in one direction, so it's impossible to go wrong. There is an intercom system on the trains to announce consecutive stops. Stay on this line until the last stop, Nuevos Ministerios. Disembark and take the dark blue line (No. 10, direction Puerta del Sur) 3 stops to Tribunal. Disembark and take the light blue line (No. 1, direction Valdecarros) 2 stops to Sol.

We were happy with all of the results. We were looking for hotels very close to, but not in the middle, of all of the \u201caction\u201d (to avoid noise but have easy access), close to a metro station (for daily use to other parts of the city), hotels that were close to public transportation from the airport (to avoid expensive cab fares), good facilities for a family traveling with a teen ager and one of her friends, and English speaking staff (while people in our group could speak a little of the local language, having English speaking staff added comfort for us). Internet access was important. We wanted a hotel rated at least a 4 or 5 by other reviewers and in the top 1/3 of all rated hotels, generally having positive comments by Trip Advisor reviewers. The Petit Palace Posada Del Peine (there were a couple of the Petit Palace hotels within the same area) met all of these criteria. It's centrally located, close to a lot of dining options for breakfast and other meals (the hotel has its own restaurant if you prefer- we like to explore and found a wide variety of food types and prices within an easy 5 miute walk), was within a couple of blocks of the metro station at Puerta del Sol (be aware that when taking the metro from the airport, there are a number of transfers and many require that you carry your luggage up or down stairs- but it is survivable and less expensive than a shuttle or cab). The front desk staff, spoke english and were very helpful in providing recommendations, setting up a tours, etc. We were able to walk nearly everywhere from the hotel. The Plaza Mayor is about 100 yards from the hotel and the Puerta del Sol is just a few blocks away. Both are centers of day and night life in the area. The Mercado San Miguel, a smaller, modern open market place, also is a few blocks away and was a great place to grab breakfast or a late night drink or snack. It really buzzes at night as a place to be, drink and meet people. Despite the hotel being very close to Plaza Mayor, the area is very quiet at night. There is no problem walking in the area. We needed a room for my wife and I, our teenage daughter and her friend. It was great that the Petite Palace offered family sized arrangements. Most had a bunk bed in addition to the paired single/double bed. Our room had the paired single bed/double bed and then two additional single beds for the girls. The room was located right at the roof line which created a sloping ceiling in the room and some tight head room if you were not paying attention. We though that this was fun rather than a detraction. The free internet and lap top computer in the room, in additional to another set of open computers on the lowest level, were a huge plus. The room had an easy to operate safety box for valuables. Air conditioning was very good for the hotter days that we had there.

There was no free wifi in the room even tho that was listed as an amenity. This was a huge disappointment for me as one big reason I booked this hotel was for the free wifi.

Bed is comfortable. Computer is in the room (Laptop Dell), but the \"working area\" is very small and not well light. WLAN is working, but very badly. You often lose connection. Breakfast room: is in the basement - breakfast is not very large, but good quality. The variety of foods offered will, in my opinion, satisfy 99 % of all people. Business: Although it is called High Tech - it is not really high tech - there is no business centre, but at the reception I could print out something, using a USB stick. Location is good, but keep in mind, that you have to carry your bags about 100 m from the street / taxi, to the hotel. Overall I enjoyed the stay, although for business I would chose another hotel.

On foot, you are only 10minutes from the Palacio Real and probably 20 minutes from the Prado. Because the city is so buzzing you feel safe wandering around these main streets, as there are loads of places to get a drink or eat if you need them. If you are after general supplier - the El Corte Ingles Dept store has a brilliant supermarket in the basement. As a solo traveller I wasn't expecting a massive room, but still got a double/twin. It dominated the room, but there was more than enough room for just me. The bathroom was well appointed and the laptop was the main reason I booked there. You will need to bring your own kettle or you can use the tea/coffee machine down in reception but that inly becomes available after midday - not much good if you like a cuppa first thing! There's also a mini bar, but didn't bother to look into it. If you are staying on the Plaza Mayor, do not expect a silent room. However it was quite nice listening to the buzz of Madrid night life as I drifted off to sleep! My main gripe was the sound proofing between the walls, but think a lot of that was just my luck that my neigh had a small child who liked kicking the wall at inopportune times! Didn't hear anything from the corridor. I didn't have breakfast, but seemed reasonable at 10E. You could of course get something from a cafe instead, probably for cheaper.

It is average at best so if you don't want to pay high prices for not much, scroll to the bottom of this review for a possible reasonable option. And as nice and hard-working as the young adults working the front desk are, this hotel is so understaffed. This chain needs to step it up at this hotel to be charging so much. Booked a room despite some reservation about noise despite the pedestrianized streets the hotel's on. The double-paned windows did such a good job, we actually opened the windows when we came in during the day (but didn't need a siesta) so it wouldn't be completely silent. A plus. The room was on a quiet side street rather the main entry side which may have been a bit noisy according to previous reviews. Our room had large stains on the carpet which made us wonder if it was clean. The bed was just fine. Liked the room lighting fixtures which worked well with the modern theme of the room, bathroom and hotel. But paintings of these twisty, branchy trees on the room wall and hotel walls didn't work - they gave the hotel the feel of an amateur artist w/ a penchant for organic, wisty, knotty branches. Better to have left the walls blank if they were trying to save money on decor. The hallways are lit w/ cobalt blue lights on very dark-stained hardwood floor. Very whimsically futuristic- different from any other hotel hallway. Now we're back on track.... The bathroom we had wasn't as bad as the one pictured in the candid photo where it was less than a foot from the bed. Ours was \"down the hall\" like a regular hotel room. It had the modern square sink out of which water splashed everywhere and didn't drain well at all. No soapdish (and this is a \"4-star\"? - whoever rated this place better think again). The hi-tech shower was like a car-wash for humans (but not that difficult to operate) - but it's only good if you're 6-foot or taller as the \"back\" massagers will hit your neck/head if you're shorter. Again, whoever designed this bathroom had no concept of function as your bathroom will get very flooded; which should only acceptable hostals and pensions/if at all. It doesn't help that this flooded area is also exactly where the toilet is situated, so if you don't want to do you business w/ out your feet in a pool of water, better use all the towels to sop it up. And the toliet is so very darn close to a wall, every time you sit down, unless you're a very small child, your face will g-r-a-z-e the wall. This interior designer needs a refresher course BIG TIME. Also, they claim to provide juice, coffee, tea, etc in the lobby for guests (is that why we paid 4-star prices?). As the machine was broken the replenished beverages went down into the drainage area rather than into the cups - all we got that weekend was cold water when we could have really used some caffeine now and then during the day. The price we paid for the first night was outrageous (don't know if it was because it was the weekend or that this happened to be their National Holiday weekend) but at about 130Euros/night the second night, while still high, was a little more justifiable. Across from our balcony, I saw adults staying at Hostal Sol Cruz. While I'm not a hostal person anymore (thanks to the dirty ones in Barcelona and Paris w/ loud, obnoxious high school and college kids that scared me back into my moderately-priced shell), I would have stayed there as I didn't hear any raucous people hanging out their balcony and the price of the hostal was only 1/3 of the price of what we paid.

They offered us the same type of room at a different location (Torre de Alcala). We were so wiped out from the travel and luggage walk, we just asked to give us two double rooms instead. Steps from the Plaza Mayor - can be loud and a little \"honky tonk\". This is great if you're there for a girls/guys weekend, but I would have preferred something less commercial, honky tonk with the kids. Also, really inconvenient if you have to pull a lot of luggage, it's in a pedestrian zone and a cab can't pull up. Have to lug your bags about a block.

On complaining I was immediately moved to a non-smoking room - which was even bigger - there were 3 single beds, and a small balcony overlooking a narrow street. The bathroom had a hi-tech power shower and a 'marble' trough type sink. The bathroom walls were sandblasted glass - I'd not stay in this chain except when travelling alone; they all have the same bathroom 'concept' which doesn't offer the total privacy that we Brits require! Although the hotel staff understood English, they didn't appear to speak it - but that didn't present any problems to me.

The position of this hotel is ideal for exploring the centre of Madrid, most things being within walking distance or a short Metro ride from Sol (the nearest station). We took the Metro from the airport to Sol and then walked the last bit to get to the hotel, probably the quickest way to get there (and definitely the cheapest).

Our room for four was spacious, clean and quite well appointed with an exercise bike, trouser press, internet access complete with computer and air conditioning (although this could only be made to heat, not cool, perhaps because they think that no-one will get too hot in February). The kids had bunk beds and we had a king size bed, the mattresses were firm but OK. Some people have complained of small rooms but this one was absolutely fine. There was some street noise at night but in the middle of a spanish city you have to expect this, we had the same in Seville. The bathroom was trying to hard to be funky and modern. The sink looked great but was impractical, the shower was good but could have been bigger. Plenty of towels were provided, including four large bath towels. The broadband access was very useful, I took my own PC although one is provided in the room. The wireless link wanted a sign-in but I unplugged the ethernet cable from the hotel's PC and stuck it in my machine and was able to see the internet within seconds. Very useful for looking up restaurants and checking for opening times for galleries etc. We did not eat in the hotel and did not eat breakfast there either, there are so many places around the hotel to get breakfast of all types that it is a shame to stick to the hotel breakfast (which is also not cheap either compared to the many places around and about). Overall, excellent value for money. There are good shopping opportunities around Puerta del Sol and the streets north of there, great art galleries including the Reine Sofia and the Thyssen and good tapas bars and restaurants around the Plaza de Santa Ana. We found a couple of great bars which served terrific tapas, don't judge by external experiences, just look through the windows and see how full they are and if people are eating.
