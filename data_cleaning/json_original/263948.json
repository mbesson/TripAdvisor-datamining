First, do not make any reservations through their own website, it's much more expensive (about 120 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac /night !!). When you book this hotel, do so, if you are traveling for instance with friends, intend to party, avoid taxi costs at night when back from clubs or bars and be a lot outside and not spend time in the room. The staff is very friendly, if I dare say, maybe too friendly and flexible... I had booked a Twin room for one night under my name in order to stay with a girlfriend. I arrived at around 3 pm. At the desk, the kind receptionist said to me, that my friend is already in my room with a man and that I could just go up there.... Yes, I knew my friend had arrived one night before and had booked a room for the previous night. And I understand the idea to let us stay in the same room the 2 consecutive nights, so that my friend wouldn't have to move her stuff around. But still I found the situation very bizarre and unprofessional. Why was that previous guest still in the room at 3 - 4 pm when he's check out was at 11 or 12 am? I asked the receptionist to go herself inform that guest of my arrival as I didn't know the man at all. I felt uncomfortable and too old or psycho-rigid for that kind of situation and attitude. I had to wait for the man to leave. My bed was made later in the evening. The rooms are really tiny, so is the window and the bathroom (you can hear everything from the bathroom). The room was already in use when I arrived so I can't say about the cleanliness, but it seemed better than I expected. There was no breakfast service. On the plus side, there was an empty fridge in the room, where you could store your own drinks and food, and there's a supermarket just in the corner of the street. The room is really basic but okay for a budget hotel. There's no elevator and the stairs are kind of uneven and exiguous. Might be difficult if traveling with a very large suitcase... Not suitable for seniors. Seems like more a hotel intended for young partying people. So, if you're not in a happy, festive, flexible, careless mood stay away from this hotel. The location is fantastic. The receptionist was very kind, there really was something warm and friendly about the staff . Yet, it was bizarre when I left I just had to leave the key through a door, there wasn't anyone at all at the reception. So I would say, it's a good choice if you pay no more than 60 - 65 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night double, twin or single room. It's not worth more than that. The 120 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac asked on their own website is really absolutely over priced. One can get much much better places for that kind of money. But, yes, I could stay again in this hotel if it's the cheapest choice and if I intend just to have fun during summer or spring with friends...

The Riksjmuseum, Anne Frank's house, Dam square, red light district, centre of town etc are all within 10 mins walking (15 if you are a slower walker). Our room itself was quite small, but the bed was very comfy, a warm duvet and the radiator was always on and temperature could be adjusted. The bathroom was small (with a shower and toilet) but clean. We had fresh towels each day which was good. My main complaint was when I had a shower one morning and I heard the people in the room next door using their bathroom and so the water would just trickle out. Although this was at about 10am which is when breakfast finishes, so I'd advise shower a bit earlier and you'll be fine (as I did the other 2 mornings at around 9am). Breakfast was served 8.30-10am and although it was modest it was nice and set us up for the day. It included bread/toast, butter, jam, ham, salami, cheese and on some days boiled eggs also.

The beds were comfortable and everything was clean and in working order. All the furniture/fixtures/fittings were reasonably modern, although not totally brand new. We stayed in one of the front rooms, which had a pleasant view onto the canal. The location is brilliant - far enough away from the horrible tourist trap bars and coffee shops, but there's still decent nightlife to be had in the area, and there were some good bars, restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It's a really nice walk along the canal to the central area, or there are trams available at the corner of the block the Waterfront is on.

Staying at the Hotel Waterfront was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have much to say about the hotel, so I'll try to be concise... here are some major bad points followed by a stroy that everyone should read. (A) NOISY. The hotel is located directly next to a discotechque. The noise of the disco is bad, but the patrons leaving the place at 4AM, screaming down the echoing canal is beyond tolerable. Street noise is also very bad as the old windows. (B) NEEDS REPAIR. This place is by no means a filthy place, but my room was a bit run-down. Cigarette burns in the drapes and carpeting. The shower went from freezing to scalding and back in a matter of seconds. The photos of their rooms on their website are not a fair representation of what your room will actually look like. They're touched up and dressed up. (C) RUDE & UNTRUSTWORTHY MANAGER/OWNER. We decided to check out and find other accomodations based on our first night's stay. We agreed to pay the one night penalty just to be done with this awful place. Unfortunately, my troubles with this hotel and it's owner did not end for several months after my check-out. When you check in, they make an imprint of your credit card and urge you to pay in cash at check-out, however they make you sign a credit card slip that states your full amount. When we checked out after the first night, we agreed to pay for two nights. When we returned home we found our credit card had been charged for the full eight nights. We called the owner and he said he would credit our account. A month later, nothing had been credited to my account so I filed a complaint with MasterCard. In response, I was harrassed with phone calls from the owner in the middle of the night, made to my home, screaming profanities at me for disputing the charge to my card and posting a negative review of his hotel on an Amsterdam travel website.

We then made several complaints, and were eventually told to just 'turn up and we will look after you.' We then showed up on New Years eve (after a very long walk in the rain) and were told that we did not have any rooms at all.

We knew this wasn't true as we had already been told over the phone that our names were in the diary, but for only 1 room. This was worrying, as he has obviously had to make excuses to many people that day if he can't remember which excuse is which. He eventually booked us onto what he described as a 'cruise boat' and I wish I had taken a picture of it, as it looked like a rickety old pirate ship. We did not even feel safe stepping on board, and the security was non-existent. You could just walk right onto the boat and inside without seeing anyone.

We stayed at the Waterfront Hotel Amsterdam for 3 nights midweek (Wednesday 17th to Saturday 20th March 04) in a double room (Room No 2) which was en-suite complete with tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer, fridge, central heated with cable TV, and I would like to especially mention the extremely comfortable bed with a thick duvet and comfy pillows. There was no view at all from our room but we went to Amsterdam to see Amsterdam and not sit in the hotel, we did notice through the once open door of room 3 that if you were lucky enough to get this room or any other rooms at the front you would be overlooking the Singel canal, that's why they call it the Waterfront Hotel I suppose. The hotel itself was very well equipped and you would not get better facilities or be made more welcome in a higher star hotel. The smallish breakfast room doubled as a lounge area again with free tea and coffee at any time of the day, this is where the manager also had a desk reception. The continental breakfast was first class with the usual ham & cheese, assorted bread, boiled eggs, fruit, bran cereal, toaster, etc. and you could help yourself to your hearts content. The breakfast and the comfy bed was worth the money on its own, not to mention the free post cards and card rack with all the places worth visiting situated in the Hotel entrance. The Waterfront was ideally situated for the areas that we wanted to go too, Leidsesplain and Renbrandtplein was only 5 minutes walk, also the flower market was literally down the street. If you want to go to Dam Square the Red Light District or the railway station then this is about a 10 to 15 minutes walk, the easy way was by tram which stops just around the corner from the Hotel were a number 1, 2 or 5 tram will take you to these places for 1.60 euros (single), cheaper if you buy a ticket in advance from the many outlets. Unfortunately during our stay, the outside of the hotel was being renovated and scaffolding covered the front of the building, but this shows that the owner is continually improving things and keeping the Hotel Waterfront to a high standard, these improvements did not effect us in any way and will be finished shortly. We were made very welcome by the Manager of the hotel who gave us a good deal for the 3 nights, and all in all our stay was extremely good and well worth me taking the time to write this as a thank you to the Manager for a his efforts in making our holiday break enjoyable. If you are visiting Amsterdam, be aware that the smaller hotels are not as easy to find in the good locations as you may imagine, so a visit to the Hotel Waterfront is highly recommend. Word of warning in and around Amsterdam, be aware of the many vagrants, drug dealers etc. that hang around mainly the Red Light district and the main drag in from the railway station (Damrak) if they approach you or bump into you just walk away as they may accuse you of banging into them and making them drop their drugs, which you will be asked to pay for in a polite way, well, polite for a drug dealer anyway.
