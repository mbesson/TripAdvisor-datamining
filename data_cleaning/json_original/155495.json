The service is usually very consistent and I have rarely had a bad experience. On my last visit about two weeks ago, I noted with regret that they appear to have changed suppliers of their shampoo, conditioner, body wash for their bathrooms. I had actually noted this over the last three or four months, but wasn't until I read a few of the recent comments below that I found out it was a permanent change. (I innocently assumed they were having supplier issues and the Miller Harris products would re-appear at some point.) I have to say, it's definately not an improvement. The labeling on the bottles looks dollar store cheap (a pseudo stensel, black on tan, plain label), the shampoo is average at best and the conditioner is greasy to say the least. Also, I find myself using as little as possible to avoid the pungent smell. It's really a shame to hear that the Miller Harris products are gone unless I have time and initiative to chase them down by pre-arranging then, should they even have any left. (I shouldn't be told I can \"buy\" them at the Fairmont Store - they should already be in my room) I don't normally make it a habit of paying attention to shampoo and conditioner in hotels (hey, it's just something you use in the shower), but it's really hard not to notice this downgrade. I'm not sure if this is a money saving initiative gone wrong, or just a case of facilities procurement dropping the ball. It actually smells bad enough (not to mention it seriously drys out your skin...and for a guy to notice this, you know it has to be bad) that I would consider another hotel (any hotel) that didn't use these products. I'm floored management hasn't had more complaints (yes, it's that bad). Long story short, if you choose to stay at the RY, bring your own shampoo, conditioner, body wash and soap.

Rooms were pricey as we knew they would be. Lots of construction around hotel made it hard to find parking (no fault of the hotel). We stopped to ask a staff member of the hotel whether underground parking was cheaper than valet, he instructed us to park underground telling us it was much cheaper. Turns out, valet is $32, underground parking cost us about $5 more for the night, it would have been more convenient for us to do valet as we had several bags and coolers to carry. The hotel is nice, outdated but nice. Things could have been cleaner. We noticed that the carpets were quite stained throughout, and most things could have used a quick polish. Rooms were small but nice none-the-less. A maid barged into our room at 730-8am the next day. We weren't impressed.

Located right downtown Toronto across the street from Union Station and within easy walking distance of just about everything, this elegant hotel is THE place to stay in Toronto. You get a sense of what you're in for when you walk into the main lobby, and look down at the tens of thousands of tiny mosaic floor tiles, creating intricate patterns for as far as you can see. Someone clearly meant for this place to make a statement, and it definitely does - in every way. Take a walk along the mezzanine and check out the large historic photos of the hotel and you really understand just how special it is to stay here. Check-in was super easy. Our room was on the Gold floor (12th floor), so although our suite was not the largest in the hotel, we were nonetheless thrilled at its upscale appointments, including an HD television big enough to double as a tanning bed, and a massive, crazy-comfortable king bed. The bath linens were super-soft, and as always, the room was spotlessly clean. The turn-down service, complete with water bottles waiting on the nightstand, was a really nice touch. I often stay at Fairmonts in the course of my business travel, but this was over the top. Dinner, at the hotel's Epic restaurant, was not inexpensive, but reflected by the incredible service and quality of food. The wine list was fantastic too. The Royal York is, as mentioned, an easy walk to just about everything downtown .... and you can access the Toronto subway directly through the lower lobby. In spite of some serious construction work along Front Street, our room was quiet and we didn't hear a sound. I slept like a rock, despite the work going on outside. Any traveler visiting Toronto needs to put the Royal York on their agenda, and stay here at least once.

With the auto-show going on just down the street and with tickets to the Rock game across the street, we thought why not spend the Family Day weekend at the Royal York as a vacation away from home, yet close to home. We booked a room as part of a winter promo and was able to upgrade into a large corner suite with (ornamental) fireplace, dining area, 2 bathrooms and seperate bedrooms. The decor was looking a little worn, but still charming. However, things are being updated as we had a 44\" LCD TV in the bedroom and what looked to be a 60\" unit in the parlour. The biggest annoyance with this property is the cost of parking at $42/day. We managed to get a spot in the underground municipal lot next door at 40 York Street and paid $27 for the whole weekend! Keep this in mind if you're ever driving in to stay at the Royal York. We had a mixup on the final day of our stay, which could not have been resolved in a better way by the hotel. We were using up some Fairmont Spa/Dining certificates before they expired at the end of Feb, which were provided as part of the annual benefits of the FPC loyalty program. As it turned out, the certificates can only be used at the \"Willow Stream\" branded spas, which the Royal York's spa was not. After the spa accepted the certificates and provided the massage treatments, they said they made a mistake and could not accept the certificates because they were not a Willow Stream spa--something that should have been mentioned before accepting the certificates and providing the treatments! After explaining the mixup to the front desk, they simply removed the spa treatments from the bill and said to use the certificates for lunch in the restaurant before leaving. What a great way to handle a situation like this, to show loyal Fairmont customers that their business is valued. It's one of the reasons I love to stay at Fairmont properties. If you like iconic properties with some history and charm, and don't mind things looking a little worn in places, the Royal York is a lovely place to stay. Also be sure to join the Fairmont Presidents Club--if you stay with them a lot, they really take good care of you!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cConstruction in Feb 2012\u201d", "Author": "Deb C", "ReviewID": "UR124781169", "Content": "This is a great hotel in the downtown area, it's old and is showing its wear.

This Fairmont location lives up to the Fairmont expectations. Yes, the hotel is old but it is beautiful and has some of the best staff we have ever experienced. Our plane landed at 8 am on a Friday February 10th, so we got to the hotel well before the 3 pm check in time, which was no problem. The lady working at the check in desk (Nadya, I believe her name was) was friendly, fast and found us a room right away, also giving us an upgrade to the 14th floor where our room had an amazing view facing the lake, air canada centre, union station, Billy Bishop airport (got to watch lots of planes land and take off) as well as the CN tower. Our room was a decent size with a king bed. The bathroom was a little small but most hotel bathrooms are. The room was a little dated in it`s decor, but it was charming. Best of all the room was quiet. We were very close to the elevators and didn't hear them at all, we also did not hear any construction noise from the street below or traffic. This was probably because our room was on the 14th floor. The cleaning staff who were in the hallway by our room would always greet us ith smiles and make sure we didn`t need anything. The hotel is in the perfect location, a 2 minute walk to Union Station and the Air Canada Centre, and about 10 minutes to the CN tower (the Skywalk is closed at one point and we were required to take a detour because of the aquarium construction) and you can get almost anywhere from the underground PATH. The doormen were very friendly and helpful as well, always insisting we let them carry our bags up the stairs when we first arrived, or carry them down as we were leaving. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we will definitely be staying here next time we come to Toronto, as well we will both be recommending this hotel to everyone we know looking for a place to stay in Toronto. This is by far the best hotel experience we have had in the city. My only complaint is that the pool was FREEZING and the hot tub was out of service for the entire 4 days we were there. Also, we called down 2 days before check out to request a 1:30 checkout time as our flight didn't leave until 3:30, and the girl said she would put in the request, and on the day of checkout we called them to confirm and the man said there was no record of us requesting a later check out but allowed us to do so anway.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, ON", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "MD00016", "ReviewID": "UR124572143", "Content": "The Fairmont is a great, old, beautiful hotel.

I am a frequent guest at the Royal York (both for business and leisure) and I cannot recommend this place more highly. From the moment you arrive at the front desk to the time that you check out you are aware of the grandeur of this grand old house. Some comment negatively on the worn nature of some of the furniture. That is part of the attraction for me. This place is brimming over with character and history. Do yourself a favour and take some time exploring the second floor of the lobby and see pictures of the history of this hotel. Check out the sign in book on display in the lobby. In the warmer months ask the staff about the possibility of visiting the bee hives and roof top garden. Have a bite to eat in one of the many restaurants or bars in the hotel. The Epic has a great restaurant and a fine side lounge. My favourite bar is the Library Bar. The serving staff are exceptional particularly Rene who deserves special mention as he goes out of his way to ensure that you feel at home. On the lower of arcade level is a fine pub called Pipers and a little deli open for the morning and afternoon (my recommendation for a quick breakfast in the morning). At night you are close to everything or anything you'd like to do. If you are lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite you may want to opt to stay in. If so, try going to Longo's (a full service grocery store near the Air Canada Centre that is accessible through the PATH south bound through the nearby Union Station). Longo's has a great and affordable cold and hot salad/buffet bar. There is a well stocked LCBO in the PATH right near the Royal York as well. Occasionally you will find that your room is not ready on check in. Invariably the staff will try to get you an alternate room. If they can't they will offer to check your bags while you wait. We once had a rather long wait for the room and the apologetic staff gave us a voucher to use at the library bar where my wife and I enjoyed a fine riesling 'on the house'. The work out facility on site is adequate especially if all you want is a cardio work out. There is a full set of dumbells but not much space. The Airporter serving Pearson International Airport stops just outside the Royal York (on the west side) and tickets for it can be purchased at the concierge desk in the lobby.

The reputation of this hotel certainly precedes it and we were not disappointed; in fact, we were exceedingly impressed. We had read some of the dissenting reviews on Tripadvisor and after our stay at this formidable hotel, we can only conclude that those people are insufferably ignorant or else just plain unintelligent. We spent two days in Toronto before Christmas as our gift to one another. We attended a show, had dinner on top of the world at the CN Tower, and took in an exhibition along with the other signts of the city at Christmas time. The Fairmont Royal York was impressive in its timeless architecture, its evident maintenance, its warm and dedicated staff, its unequivocal elegance and its flawless attention to detail. The Lobby cannot be properly captured in a photograph, it was truly captivating in all of its luxury. We arrived by train at 8:30 in the morning with the intention of leaving our bags with the Bell Desk at the Fairmont, only to find at the check-in desk that there was a room waiting for us. We were greeted by a lovely young lady-- whose name I will not mention for privacy's sake but whose initials are H.R.-- who provided exceptionally efficient, effective and personable service while checking us in. The attention to detail was immediately evident as the lady at the front desk knew we were there as our gift to one another, and that we sought a room away from the ice machines and elevators if possible. This was information I had mentioned upon booking the room weeks earlier, but it had all been duly recorded with our profile. We were delighted to be able to take our bags to our room so early in the day. We were almost out of the foyer on our way to the East Wing when this same helpful lady from the front desk swiftly walked after us and informed us that she had given us a room that was rather closer to the elevators, and she asked us would we return with her to find another room. Within minutes we were on our way to the Eighth Floor in the main building to our new room and deposited our luggage. The room was beautiful. We overlooked Front Street, Union Station, the various waterfront towers and Lake Ontario itself. We could even see the Toronto Island airport! We had a lovely sitting area by the large window, a king bed, marble bathroom, a desk with chair, a bureau for the television, and a table for the coffee machine with tea, coffee and all the necessities. The historic tradition of the hotel was evident with the beautiful moulding around the walls at the ceiling and the floor and the glass doorknob on the bathroom door. The decor was sumptuous and elegant; rich drapes with beautiful patterns over white sheers on the window, coordinating linens and upholstery on the bed and the solid-wood furniture, all finished in a rich medium-dark wood. There was plenty of space for luggage beside the bed; the coat closet with ironing facilities was perfect for our overcoats. We were so pleased to find that bathrobes were waiting in the bathroom, which was outfitted with many soaps, shampoo, creams, conditioner and other accessories. The room in its entirety was perfectly appointed in furniture, decor, and amenities. We felt right at home when we returned later in the day as we prepared for supper and the show. That night, we strolled the Mezzanine level overlooking the grand lobby with its nostalgic photos of the Royal York in earlier days. We spent a wonderful time at the Library Bar-- the bar mix is fantastic-- which is another highlight of this great old hotel. Another triumph in decor, the Library Bar was the perfect place to unwind after the show and have a few drinks, just to soak up the cool and relaxed atmosphere. We took a look inside the Imperial Room adjacent, and it is nothing short of magnificent. This room wouldn't be out of place in a palace. It is splendid and nothing short of pure glamour. Returning to the room, the bed was exceptionally comfortable; it gave a soft feel and firm support all at once. The white linens were impeccably fresh, crisp, clean and comforting. Excellent sleep quality. The next morning we decided to try the pool. Donning our bathrobes, we were very pleased to find that the pool and fitness facilities are located on their own floor. In so many hotels one must walk through the lobby or past the front desk or the restaurant to get to the pool, and it is awkward to meet fully-dressed strangers in one's bathing suit. We were greeted by a very friendly lady at the pool who signed us in and gave us the same type of thick, soft towels we had in our room. The pool and whirlpool were an extension of the hotel: impeccably clean and well-appointed. Every detail considered. The plants and deck-chairs, the tiling, the glass roof overhead... it was perfect. We were very impressed by the large water dispenser near the door: it was full of ice-cold water whose surface was covered with thin-sliced rounds of oranges, lemons and grapefruits! It was absolutely the most thoughful and effective amenity to place near the pool and whirlpool. At check-out we were met with the same friendly service, and we spent the last little while before our train arrived waiting in the grand lobby, enjoying the beautiful Christmas decorations and watching the passerby. In case you couldn't tell, we were immensely pleased and absolutely delighted with our stay. So many hotels miss the mark, but the Fairmont Royal York has clearly stood the test of time owing to its elegance, unsurpassed service, and dedication to the ultimate experience for its guests. We sincerely hope it will always be thus.

The next day I was given a new room while I was out, but my luggage disappeared and it took a few hours and some persistence to locate it. The supervisor on the front desk told me he had delegated the task to the bell captain. After a few hours, I still did not have my luggage, and when I checked with bell captain, he said he was too busy to look for it.

The marble in both bathrooms gave them a lot of character.

There is a shopping concourse in the lower level of the hotel, which includes an LCBO outlet with a good wine selection, ATM's, etc. I had 2 dinners at the Epic restaurant which were both excellent. The last night we ate in the Epic lounge. The food was excellent but our female server seemed to be in a rush to get us out of the way when we first sat down to order. Once we were into dinner, that improved dramatically as additional servers came into play. Just a note, there are dozens of restaurants within easy walking distance of this hotel and the concierge had some excellent recommendations.

It is never easy for a hotel to predict guest flow, but there were enough other staff floating around that they could have deployed a few to ease the backlog.

The faucets, tiles, trim, etc. in the rooms is easily 30 years old.

We waited - and waited and waited. Finally, upon checking, we discovered that some other people had been given rooms, although they had arrived after we arrived. We had a short conversation with the front desk staff and were given assurances that our rooms would be ready soon. We were also given gift certificates - which just about covered the bar bill for one drink each, given the prices in the bar. A couple more checks at the front desk and we finally got into our rooms at 7:30 pm! Not happy campers by that time. To top it off, one room had not been properly cleaned and the other had a very noisy air conditioner. We returned to the front desk and finally got into upgraded rooms at about 8:15 pm.

When we arrived at 8.30pm we were told that our rooms were not ready yet due to the previous guests late check out. We were told that we should be able to check in within an hour. Due to the fact we couldn't check in straight away one of our rooms was upgraded and we were also given vouchers worth $80. This was a nice gesture but after an 8 hour flight from the UK the last thing you want is to wait a further hour to get into your room. In the end it took more than an hour and we finally got to our room just before 10pm. Even though we had problems checking in the lady on the check in desk was very polite. After this things did improve, our room and bedding were very clean and comfortable especially the pillows. The bathroom was also clean, we were given plenty of toiletries and the towels were of very good quality. Then on the second day of our stay another minor problem occurred, our key card would not work so we had to go back down to reception. The lady on reception asked us if we had kept our key cards near our mobile phone or credit cards. We hadn't so we knew that we had not caused the room key to fail. It did only take a minute or two for reception to sort it out so it wasn't the end of the world. However we had just had a long day out and we just wanted to relax in our room. The room was facing an area outside that had some construction but the noise was minimal and wasn't too much of a nuisance. The tea & coffee making facilities were also good apart from one day when we were just left coffee but no teabags. The gym and indoor swimming pool area was kept very clean and was a nice place to relax with a good choice of amenities in the changing rooms.

We stayed in a Fairmont Gold Jr. Suite - room 16-153 which was right beside the Queen's Royal Suite, which was kind of neat. The Gold level is definitley worth every penny. I won't lie, we paid quite a bit to stay, but with a young family with 3 boys aged 5 months, 2yrs and 5yrs the perks of staying at a downtown property close to all ammenedies was necessary. The best thing about the Gold level is the lounge. You have access to snacks and drinks nearly around the clock, all included in your room rate. This also included breakfast, which was also amazing. The staff provide VIP treatment all the way, with preferred check-in on the 12th floor. They were very informative and caring. They took lots of time to talk to our kids and involve them. One of the nicest perks was even though our check out time was 12pm, we stayed in Toronto until around 5pm to visit the CN Tower etc. They held on to all of our belongings and invited us back to the lounge before we left. Most hotels moreless kick you out at check-out. Regarding our room - I have read some reviews where people indicated they were falling appart. Whether it was because we were on the Gold Floor, our room was in fantastic shape. It was approx. 500 sq ft, had its own enterance lobby, followed by the living room that must have been 25 x 25 with a nice fireplace, couch and TV, it then opened up (open concept) to our bedroom area (20 x 20 perhaps), with the bathroom off of our bedroom. The furniture was in good shape, everything about the room was high-end. Sure the wallpaper in the bathroom was a bit old, but its the Royal York. It's supposed to feel a bit rustic. The pool area was fantastic, especially for younger kids. The main pool is great, around 4ft deep, but they have a small splash pad style area for the little ones which was a hit with our crew. All in all it was an amazing experience and a top notch hotel.

On this occasion we booked a room through a travel website in my name but indicated that there were four guests. On the day of arrival we telephoned the Royal York from home to confirm the reservation and to let the Fairmont representative know that my spouse's inlaws would be checking in before us as our flight was getting in to Toronto in the early evening. The representative (Rachel) told my spouse that it was not possible for his parents to check in earlier as their name was not on the reservation. I then got on the phone and confirmed that the room had been booked under my name and I was confirming that it was okay for the hotel staff to let my inlaws check in earlier (we had already paid for the room in full). I was told that this was not possible for security reasons. I asked the representative what were the security issues for the hotel but she couldn't come up with a clear answer and gave me some outlandish example of some man who was stalking me gaining entrance to my room. I advised her that I was waiving the hotel of any liability and I was giving her permission to let my inlaws in the room. I told her I could fax her this information in writing. She would not accommodate our request and instead made us call the service provider who then had to put us on hold while he called the Royal York to give her the names of our inlaws so they could check in earlier than us! This felt like such an unnecessary inconvenience. When we arrived at the Royal York the hotel was beautiful and the front desk staff at that time (not Rachel) were very professional and pleasant. The room was well appointed, clean but small (we knew it was going to be small). We had free WiFi and the beds were really comfortable.

Prior to booking this trip my spouse and I were excited to stay here with our 9 month old son. The Royal York was one hotels we had not been to yet in the city. The thought was to stay at this hotel every 2 weeks during the winter weekends (we live outside the city). We thought the location was perfect for being able to walk with our stroller in the winter time using the Path underground. After this experience we will NEVER stay here or recommend it to our friends ( with strollers or to those with limited mobility and need to use elevator.The entrance by the valet parking)! Valet Parking- 4 staff members watched us ( continued their conversation) pull up park our car empty out our SUV with our stroller and try to navigate the stairs with stroller. They were to busy talking to help. I do not expect to be waited on hand and foot but a simple hello or come and park our car would be nice. My spouse had to go up to them to tell them we wanted valet parking and where the elevator was. Elevator from outside- not clearly marked. On way out had to kick it to close (staff member told us \"yes well it was built in 1929\", he knew about it). Another time did not work at all and had to carry stroller down stairs. Not bad for a pregnant women. Room- on our way to our room the table outside of elevator had a layer of dust and grimy fingerprints all over it. We watched a cleaning staff member walk by garbage in the hall and on the table. The room over all was typical but wall paper in bathroom peeling in various spots. The furniture was clearly very worn, not shabby chic either. Food- we ordered room service. Limited menu. Cruise boat quality. The apple pie for $14 go to the supermarket below you will get something more for your money. I don't expect gourmet but quality since it is the Royal York. Very disappointed. I don't mind spending money on great food not the issue. Food poor. Go to the Keg for your steak.The staff member who brought in our food was the friendliest of the weekend. Our exit from the hotel was the same as we entered the elevator needed a kick to close the door.Valet staff watched us load our belongings into our SUV. We travel extensively throughout the USA.

We've had two previous experiences within the last two years where we've had to request room changes (they had on-going renovations, and I think some rooms were renos and some were not). The rooms are VERY small (but many older hotels are comparable). One severe criticism I have is that one of the perks is the beautiful Library Bar....However, it is sooooo extremely expensive it's absolutely infuriating. They charged $15 (without tip) for an ounce of gin!!!! I was outraged. On Sunday morning, in the restaurant, oatmeal was $10/bowl and coffee (plain brewed) was $5. I understand that hotel restaurants are expensive, but I couldn't help but feel that they need to charge extra because they know their rooms are not up to par anymore. I sort of feel sorry for the hotel, but they are really taking advantage. They are also enduring some terrible on-street renovations that make access to the hotel a bit compromised. While it's not their fault, good luck getting someone to direct you, or take your bags, if you pull up at the York Street door. I recommended to several people that they post signage or have bell hops at the various doors, but I didn't get the impression that my suggestion was taken seriously.

We had been allocated a corner room which in normal circumstances would have been nice but now just meant we had TWO windows we couldn't see out of.

We had booked the room last December so would have expected the courtesy of an email to advise the situation with the building work so we could make an informed choice. The room itself was spacious enough but had a very badly stained carpet, scratched bedside cabinet and altogether a slightly sad, dingy feel to the furnishings.

The common areas were beautiful and classic but the rooms were completely outdated. Having my flight to Toronto delayed, I arrived at the hotel at 1:00 am. Since I was staying for 6 nights, I had a large suitcase with me. There was no one at the front to help with the luggage and to make it worse, there are no ramps! I had to carry the suitcase up the steps. When I checked in, I was told it was a room with 2 double beds. I requested a change to a queen or king bed and was told there were none available. Hard to believe but I accepted it and thought I'd ask the next day. When I got to my room, I immediately smelled stale cigarette odor. There was a large stain on the carpet in the middle of the room and found that the closet was no more than a foot in depth. Trying to hang 3 suits and 7 business shirts was a challenge to say the least. Next morning, I approached the front desk and while the attendant was extremely helpful, she offered another room that turned out to be identical to the first. Later in the day, she found a room with a queen bed and \"normal\" sized closet but was told it would be $20 extra as it had a view. I argued that this was unacceptable, that they should provide the same price as a courtesy. She would not budge and I was told there was no manager around and this was the only room available. When I went to the new room, it also stank of cigarettes although not as bad, the wallpaper was peeling in a couple of areas and the \"view\" was of the construction going on in front of the hotel. Leaving me with not much choice and considering I would be out for most of the days I was in town, I accepted this room. The front desk told me a bell clerk would be up in 15 minutes to help me move my belongings. After one hour and no one showing up, I called the bell desk and was told they were extremely busy but would put my order at the top so someone would be up in the next 10 minutes. After waiting almost another hour, I went downstairs to get the new room key and moved myself. When I checked out I disputed the additional charge and after 20 minutes of back and forth, they finally agreed to waive the extra $20 a night. In speaking with my colleagues, they all shared similar experiences and all requested a change in rooms. The only exception was one individual who requested a smoking room and was given a suite. The one positive of this hotel is the location. It was ideal to the convention centre, stadium and financial district.

This was my first stay at a Fairmont. At my company's suggestion, I enrolled in their \"President's Club\". The lobby, the meeting rooms and the common areas are just beautiful. You can feel the history as you walk through the hotel. Their catering service is quite good. Upon arrival, I had lunch in the restaurant near the lobby and it was good, but expensive. My room was a very good size and there was a nice flat screen television in the room. The location is great - you can walk to the CN Tower and the sports stadium. There are many restaurants within walking distance. However ... this is a hotel that advertises itself to be a luxury five-star establishment. This hotel did not offer an in-room safe, there was not a bathrobe in my room, there was no turn-down service, and there was no make-up mirror in the bathroom. Most 5-star hotels offer all the above and many of the 4-star places I've stayed at offered those amenities and more. Now it gets ugly. When I arrived, there was dark hair in the bathtub and sink (I am blonde, so I am certain it was not my hair) and it was never cleaned the entire three days I stayed at the Royal York. When I arrived there were water splashes on the bathroom mirror and the closet mirror that were never cleaned. The room was not vacuumed while I was there. The bedskirt was frayed along the entire bottom edge. There was some kind of brown stain on the carpet near the night side table. The hallway on the second floor leading to my room always had trash - it did not look like it was vacuumed regularly at all.The toilet tissue holder in my bathroom was broken and many times the toilet tissue fell on the floor. My \"view\" out the window overlooked a rooftop that was littered with lots of trash. Water pressure was fine, however at 8:30 on Saturday morning, there was little hot water and I ended up taking a lukewarm shower. At checkout, there were several errors on my bill, which were quickly corrected once I talked to the front desk, but that was annoying. If The Royal York is any indication of what Fairmont hotels are like, I doubt I would ever stay at another Fairmont. It just is not a luxury hotel.

Originally I booked at the Residence Inn for $250 per night but canceled when the rates for the meeting were only $175 per night at the Royal York. My wife had stayed there with her parents 50 years ago, when she was a young child, and had fond memories of the hotel. So at a savings of $75 a night for 5 nights, saving $375 was a good deal. For the first 3 nights, everything was great, and the hotel was on its way to a 5 star rating. The only negative was that the carpeting in the room was compressed down, although it was not worn. Sunday evening we came back from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the air conditioning was not working. Called the front desk, and they sent a mechanic to the room. He determined that the blower blew out, and could not be repaired till Monday morning. I was given two choices, stay in that room or change rooms. I opted to change rooms. Big mistake. I had to repack and then lug all my luggage myself. The new room was at the far reaches of the building and smaller. It had a queen sized bed. The original room had a king sized bed. It did not have a safe in the room, although the original room did. I had to place everything in the safe deposit boxes at the reception desk. Bottom line was that for our inconvenience the hotel did not offer anything at all, and instead downgraded the accommodations we had. This knocked the overall rating down to 3 stars. On the positive side, the hotel is gorgeous and well maintained. It is part of an underground walkway system called the PATH. One can walk from the hotel to the subway and the commuter trains, to the Hockey Hall of Fame, to various commercial buildings in the Financial District (each with restaurants and shops), to the Hudson Bay Company department store, and to the Eaton Center shopping mall, all underground and without concern for the weather.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLove this place\u201d", "Author": "Bebej1976", "ReviewID": "UR116948961", "Content": "The fairmont is one of my favorite north American hotels.

It is considered pricey appox. $35 a plate and up depending on what you order. What a great experience this was, you have to ask for a table that the chef cooks at, make sure you ask for Toto he was fabulous. We notice the other chefs were not as interactive, he gave our daughter a chefs hat for being 16, she loved it. The food was great, if you order the ice tea...its real tea not the stuff you buy. With our meal we got soup, the onion soup is homemade with chunks of mushrooms, there is also misu soup (tou Foo), salad with home dressing and white rice, more food than you could probably eat, then the actual meal, so much food They brought my daughter another cheesecake for dessert and sang to her. We love cheesecake. An over all excellent experience for us. Would we go again, you bet and we would go to the restaurant as well. It is casual dress.

We had a hard time trying to regulate the air conditioner as it was 15 degrees when we came in and the carpets were stained and felt damp. At 440am I was woken up by the rattling of the blowing air conditioner and tried turning it off, but the stagnet air was too much to handle, so I cranked it on again. By 5am I went to find some juice or any kind of beverage in the hotel. After walking all the way to the vending machine, hidden in a closet, there was an out of service sign on it. So I went down to front desk. They advised that nothing was open, I could go to Tim Hortons in the area or call in-room dinning ($4 automatically added to your order). I turned to go back to my room and then went back to ask for change to possibly find another vending machine, the staff member told me to wait there and he'd see what he'd do. He came back with juice and sent me on my way - I was SO appreciative, it's staff like these who think outside the box to keep a customer. BIG thanks to you! I used the gym which I really enjoyed, the pool and hot tub looked nice, but I found it too busy to jump in. The attendant at the front desk was VERY friendly and kind. ANOTHER great staff member. We had also realized on our way back to the hotel after our night out that we forgot toothpaste, we hit the front desk and within 10 minutes we had a tube in our room! I was really disappointed and frustrated that I didn't get a good nights sleep from the rattling air conditioner and what we think was rattling pipes in the washroom. The staff that we came across were great and I recommend the Fairmont Poutine, which I did order and truly enjoyed. As I have never stayed there before, I don't know if there are better types of rooms than what we had (3-102). I wish my experience with our room could have been as great as the staff that we had dealt with. I thought about complaining about the noisy AC, but it was 5am, my husband was sleeping and all I needed was a repairman coming in!", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGrand Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "bucsuz", "ReviewID": "UR116037630", "Content": "Recent stay at the Royal York was greatly enjoyed.

We stayed at the Royal York for two nights in October 2010 & I thought I'd done a review then. I'm using the notes from my travel journal to write my review. I'm from Toronto and always wanted to stay at the Royal York, but could never really justifiy it, but now that I live in the UK, I just had to stay there. We arrived on a Via Rail train from Ottawa, so getting to the hotel was very easy - right across the street. The airport express coach service from Pearson also stops at the Royal York, and of course it's not far from Toronto island airport. All of the hotel staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and professional. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 4th floor. it was nicely decorated and although somewhat small, it was perfectly comfortable. We did have a slight issue with housekeeping where on both mornings we had not been left with a coffee pot or cups, but that was quickly rectified with a phone call. Tip1: make sure you join the fairmont presidents club before you stay- it doesn't cost anything and with it the in room internet access is complimentary, otherwise it is about $15 per 24 hours. We joined after we made our reservation and on check in gave the lady our number and it was all sorted. Tip2: Even if you decide not to stay at the hotel, you must have a look around. The lobby is lovely and there are plenty of seats so you can relax & look around. Up on the mezzanine level there are many photos, prints etc displayed and it's well worth a look. We also managed to have a quick peak in the ballroom and a few other rooms; they weren't set up for any functions, but still nice to look at. There are also shops, restaurants in the lower ground floor which are worth a look, and of course from there you can access the PATH which is a great way to get around the downtown during poor weather or do a bit of underground shopping. We didn't use any of the facilities, so I can't comment on that, other to say that they looked lovely! On the morning we checked out, we had several hours before we needed to be at the airport and were able to leave our bags in a secure room, so that was really helpful.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThe Queen stays here!\u201d", "Author": "KnowAboutTravel", "ReviewID": "UR115969735", "Content": "If you've never been to the Royal York, it's worth a visit.

The hotel lobby is very opulent and creates a great first impression. Bellboys and check in staff were friendly and efficient. Our room was on the 3rd floor and was clean and comfortable.

The spot dried, but reappeared with a vengence on our last night. We also heard dripping water through the walls throughout our stay. We now think that the air conditioning was leaking under the carpet. We went for breakfast at Epic on our last day with mixed results. We arrived at the restaurant right around 10 a.m., and waiting for about 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge us. When she did she informed us the restaurant closed at 10 for breakfast, and only the lounge was available for breakfast with limited menu. She indicated the lounge was full and said our best bet was to go to the Library Bar where they also served breakfast. 10 seems early to end breakfast and that caught us off guard, however off the the Library Bar we went. When we got to the Library bar we were told it was closed and did not open until 10:30. Back to Epic and were greeted by a different hostess. We then noticed there were many empty tables in the lounge - they just needed to be cleared. The hostess agreed to clear a table for us and we were seated. Not sure why the first hostess did not offer to do the same. Our waitress seemed harried. As soon as she arrived at our table she was turning around to leave. There seemed to be more hostesses than waitresses. We felt that our presence was an inconvenience to the staff.

Instead I felt a great deal of frustration in our brief stay. We were reliant on using the elevator to street level from the lobby; it worked only for 1 day of our stay. This elevator was quite necessary for us as I was traveling with my spouse and 2 toddlers in a large double stroller. We were left having to carry this stroller up and down the stairs at every entrance to the hotel. Fortunately, other hotel guests were nearby to volunteer their assistance on many occasions. The elevators in the east side of the hotel were also frequently nonfunctional and eventually we ignored them completely. Every time we stepped into an elevator we were constantly feeling uneasy as to whether we would get stuck in between floors! (This was exacerbated by the fact that we encountered several other elevators/escalators were nonfunctional throughout the city.) I felt a bit claustrophobic in our room as it seemed like the furniture (2 double beds, lounge chair, et al) was oversized for the size of the room we were in. However, the beds themselves were fabulous as they were extremely comfortable and we all had restful nights of sleep. I was also disappointed that wireless internet was available only for an extra fee. I am used to staying at \"lesser\" hotels where this service is complimentary. Oh well. In the pool area, my toddlers enjoyed the wading pool and its fountains. The attendant on duty even brought out plastic water toys for them to play with. The heated pool was nice, but a tad over-chlorinated as my eyes started to burn after swimming laps for about 10 minutes. Also, don't look for a drinking fountain in any of the public areas; there aren't any.

First impressions are a warm and welcoming lobby which is stunning and grand to view and a highlight of the hotel.

Room was exceptionally clean and easily large enough to accomodate the king-size bed, desk, chairs and all of our cases. Large bathroom with very nice amenities. The hotel is located immediately next to the Union Station providing transports links to all parts of Toronto. It's actually connected via underground walkways with much of the downtown area meaning you never have to head outside if the weather is unpleasant. Also connected via skywalk to the CN Tower and the Air Canada centre. There are a choice of places to eat and drink within the hotel, from a relaxed Irish style pub, to the more upmarket library bar and EPIC dining. Swimming pool, whirlpool and gym are also extremely clean and were not busy - plenty of robes and towels etc provided. Worth a visit is the mezanine level which has photos on the wall detailing the history of the hotel and famous people who have stayed over the years (including HRH on occasion!) Only slight issue is that the lobby isn't actually at ground level, and you need to climb up or down a few stairs (~10) to approach from any direction (I couldn't find a ramp anywhere). There were staff on every door willing to help if you need assistance with luggage. Final point (as others have mentioned too) - join their membership programme for free prior to arriving.

So I was shocked to find how run down the Fairmont RY has become. Within minutes of arriving, I called the Front Desk and asked if we could be moved into another room.

Our room was spacious, with two separate baths, two closets, sitting area with pull-out couch, and two tall windows. However, the carpet was dirty, the granite counter in one of the bathroom was chipped, there was a dead moth at the corner of the window, lamp on the desk did not work, noisy a/c , sound of water behind the wall, couch was stained and worn out, broken radio alarm clock (has sound but couldn't move up the hours to set time), faucet splashed water all over my clothes, hairs on the tub, and the room was very dusty, with the radio alarm clock especially nasty. Manager of guest services reacted quickly. Our room was dusted when we came back from dinner, and an Air Ionizer/Purifier was put in our room (I have asthma). We truly appreciated the effort Management made to make our stay more comfortable. To be fair to the Housekeeping team, we were there on a particularly busy weekend (June 10 -12). However, the dirt on the Radio Alarm Clock seems to have been there for a long long time. The lobby was constantly filled with people but check-in was fast and staff friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast and dinners we had inside the hotel - Epic and Benihanna. It's unlikely that we would return in the future due to the following reasons: paper-thin door that makes it impossible for us not to hear noises from the hallway; beds that are too soft; the numerous stairs that I have to climb or go down to reach street level no matter what entrance we used; and the analogue TV signal in full screen format displayed in a widescreen flat panel TV (all faces are stretched and screen mode cannot be adjusted). We did not enjoy the bed, the shower, and the TV. What else would one do inside a hotel room? Room amenities were average and nothing to be excited about.

I do have to say that the lobby is very grand and oozes history, the marble staircases and ornate wood ceiling add to the charm of the Royal York.

For us, the only excellent thing is its location. The Toronto Airport Express Bus service drops you right off at the front door, and as we had a train to catch a few days later to Ottawa, being right accross the road from the main railway station. Excellent! Upon check-in, even though we had their written confirmation for a Deluxe Smoking King Bedded Room, they did not have one available. They only had Twin Bedded Deluxe Smoking rooms available, which we accepted. The two beds in the room were Double Beds, so that wasn't so bad. When we arrived into the room, no ashtrays! We phoned the Front desk requesting an ash tray, which turned up about two hours later. The room was huge. Reading previous reviews, it sounds like the \"Fairmont Rooms\" are quite small, so opt for a \"Deluxe. Apparently they are twice the size. The Flat screen TV needed to be bigger, bacause the room was so big! So, despite the Twin Beds, a very comfortable room, with very comfortable bed. The bathroom was quite small, but well appointed, and in a good state of repair. Also very clean. Housekeeping staff were friendly, and did a very good job. The room was always kept spotless. The only meal we ate in the hotel was Room Service on our first night, having just completed an eighteen hour flight from Australia. The service was quick, about 20 minutes, the food was hot, of good quality, and with ample servings. So top marks for Room Service delivery. So all in all we had an enjoyable and comfortable stay.

After 10 minutes of checking if there were other rooms, I finally got a non-smoking room - right next to the elevator that literally would have made it impossible to sleep. So I bit the bullet expecting a decent smoking room. Alas, I was disappointed. I have pics attached, blurry as I am tired, but you judge for yourself: 1. It REALLY smells of smoke - expected I guess, but I wanted a non-smoking room to begin with 2. I felt like I had checked into a hotel in the Eastern block 10 years ago. Drab, outdated decor with the quality past it's prime. Sagging bed skirts, cigarette burns on the floor, strands of cleaning cloth on the door handle, stains on the chairs.

I didnt particularly enjoy the view it was looking out over the break inbetween one side to the other and actually had a beer bottle on the ground also construction onlooking. While the room was small that was not the problem i found some of the small touches could have been better it was cocked properly around the sink etc. My manin problem was that it was dirty, while lying in the tube i could see the floors needed a good washing, the coffee pot was broken and i actually burned myself. As for the staff the check in gentleman was nice enough and polite but the rest of the staff not so much when we asked for a map at the consierge we were given one but that was it, no can we help you find something, this is where we are on the map or any nicieties at all. When i asked our housekeeper for something on our last day they asked when we were checking out ( I had asked for a later check out). I did however love the old feel for the hotel and we went on the second floor and looked at the pictures I had so many questions and did finally ask someone which was an effort as no one seemed interested in conversation with guest. I mentioned it would be a wonderful addition to the hotel if they had someone do tours of the hotel with history of it, former performers, show rooms and even the scary stuff that all hotels have, a missed opportunity for the hotel. IN any case I might stay again but we were on a prepaid price and I wasnt given my points for the hotel , I hadnt realized this until just before i left for our trip so I might not come back there. Another good thing is that it is close to everythign and you can walk everywhere which is a plus. OH and one last thing it was noisy, we heard people coming and going at every time of day including 3 in the morning and I even heard some one cough in the next room and the staff was loud when conversing in the hall.

What you can expect is decor of old grace and elegance or outdated, musty screaming for an extreme makeover. Please do not rate your Fairmont experience by this unRoyal experience. I recently spent 4 nights at the York, selected for it's location and proximity to our offices and the Air Canada Centre. My commute was plesantly connected via the underground network which did not expose me to the winter elements. It was the internal elements of my room that shocked me. I paid extra to have a view and was upgraded to a king bed room. I could not change my mind in this room and the view consisted of the train tracks/barns with an inch of lake view between the highrises. The bathroom was extremely small which given the age of the hotel I was willing to overlook. However when I looked for an electrical outlet to charge my electronics, was shocked to see a sea of wires to an outlet with the cover plate laying on the floor.....not in one location but two. You've all seen the \"fire waiting to happen\" photos of overloaded circuits. I also could not help but notice the very dated electronics in the room.....circa 1980. I know that because I had the same alarm clock in my first apartment. I can accept planned obsolence, not what I expected for the reputation of the Fairmont brand. I contacted the front desk for the first time to question the increased fee for the view and report the concern for the missing face plates and fire hazard. I sensed I was not the first to complain as the upgraded fee was promptly removed from my bill. A short time later I discoverd the television did not work, and selecting the TV channels was an onerous task to navigate, in light of the remote that had to be pressed repeatedly to make one selection (imagine pressing the same button 5 - 8 times before working). I was surprised to learn the WIFI was not completmentary; surprised I could not plug in my laptop and use it on bed because the one spare outlet would not reach; surprised I could not get my air card to work in the room. This prompted a second call to the front desk requested tech assistance and an extension chord. The tech arrived and was unable to resovle the problem and ultimately I was provided free WIFI for my stay. The extension cord received was exactly that...the old school (in keeping with the 80's theme) brown cord vs a power bar. Again, you've all seen those photos of overloaded circuits. I was also advised the TV cable provider was down in the downtown core.....and later learned colleagues in neighboring hotels all had access thorugh the same cable provider. I also reported a chair in the room that had a dangerous gap in the wood joint connecting the seat to the arm....another accident waiting to happen. I was not amused that none of the reported issues were resolved in my 4 day stay. I was also not amused in hearing my neighbours in the next room, flushings left, right up and down from me. I was provided a cheese tray and a complimentary one night stay at the York. I challenged this as I had no plans to return to Toronto and the York would definitely not be my home away from home.

Its strongest asset is its location: it interconnects underground to the subway system, to suburban trains, and through a labyrinth of poorly marked tunnels to major office buildings and shops in the financial district. In the middle of winter this is a distinct advantage. By night, the location loses some of the appeal. Independent restaurants are further away, and the streets are emptied and, although safe they are lifeless. I wouldn't opt to stay here as a tourist to the city. The good business location doesn't translate easily to a good destination for tourists. The hotel is vast, and although the public rooms are grand, in an Edwardian sense, the room I stayed in during my 6-day stay was an illustration in some of the hotel's weaknesses. It is true that not all rooms have been recently redecorated. Other reviewers have pointed out that the furniture sometimes is chipped - but the beds are very comfortable and on a business visit some things matter less and the rooms are more than adequate - if a bit small on closet space. Nevertheless - in January - my corner room was surprisingly draughty, and there is no bathroom ventilation and mirrors are fogged easily. Otherwise, why are we still paying for wi-fi hook-up in 2011? At nearly $20 including tax, this is excessive and unnecessary. The gym is small, slightly awkward, but decent. Massages are just short of $100/60 minutes. The business centre was cheerful and helpful with getting a package to DHL just before closing. I can't say that I felt welcome at the concierge's desk. Continental breakfast (in room) is $22.

We got wonderful service from the concierge desk with both tickets and restaurant recommendations. The bell desk was great with luggage storage and transport organisation. From hot we went to tepid with both the rooms and weekend services. The hotel was clearly on half speed and half staff for the weekend. Facilities had either weekend hours or were closed. The main restaurant was closed for breakfast with the option being the mall level Royal Kitchen. If you are looking for a light breakgfast, say a piece of toast and a poached egg, you are out of luck. But you do have a choice, you can have the buffet or you can have the buffet. The hot buffet was warm at best. 'We don't get the turnover on a weekend' said the helpful waiter 'So the food has been there for a while.' The hotel is a classic with typically smaller rooms. Ours had clearly seen a lot of traffic and was a bit on the tired side. The bathroom was very small. Despite being small people, the toilet, wedged between counter and bath tub was a bit of a challenge. Two aspects of the visit were stone cold. They didn't mention it on the website, didn't tell us when we booked in and didn't tell us at reception. Instead they pushed over the counter an oh-and-by-the-way piece of paper. The pool is closed for renovations. Who, one wonders, is going to wobble off to another hotel in a Toronto winter for a swim? The boys were very disappointed. And then there was no hot water in my daughter's room, a fact only discovered after the younger boy was put to bed and fast asleep. A handyman came and gave them the oh-and-by-the-way it's the weekend and we can't do anything until Monday routine. The following morning they moved my daughter to another room. Wouldn't you think, no pool, no hot water, they might just have thought to give them a better room, maybe a bit of an upgrade on a quiet weekend for all the inconvenience?

Access - we could get to Union Station, Starbucks, the TTC (subway) and shopping without going outside!!! A big bonus when slushy and cold outside. There are a lot of hotels that I could have chosen for this trip, but I chose the Royal York because of its comfort, high level of service, and location that seem to be consistent with all Fairmont Hotels.

We checked in and my husband showered so we could go to dinner. He got out of the shower and told me the water was above his ankles. We called to have it fixed so I could shower and it took over an hour. Needless to say I was unable to shower and had to go to dinner without one, because it took them over an hour to show up at which point my husband told them to come back when we went out. The following morning we assumed the tub was fixed but of course it wasn't. I ended up showering in ankle high water which I'm sure was full of other peoples sludge. I pulled the sludge out of the tub myself and called the front desk again. It took over an hour again and only after a second call. One again we are waiting and our little getaway is wasting away while we wait. The manager of housekeepiing and a room attendant came to the room and the room attendant was arguing that the hairy sludge wasn't there the day before. She agreed to clean it and athe front desk manager brought another key so we could get ready in another room. She then showed me another room that wasn't acceptable. I told her that we wanted to get going and that we would pickup keys to our new room when we returned. The next room that we got was so small, I was so disappointed. I called the front desk again and they had no other room for us, so we where left to stay in this room. They offered us dinner or champaigne which we declined. They offered us a free night stay on our next visit, which I declined. I just wanted a nice room to finish our already ruined getaway. I will admit I did accept a comp night for the night before cause our evening was ruined.But I really just wanted a nice stay. They offered for me to speak to the rooms manager which I also declined because they had no other room to put us in so I had nothing to say to him. About 45 minutes later we heard a knock on the door and the rooms manager(Scott) was there. He said he understood I was very upset at the whole situation and offered for us to see another room. I was very doubtful but we went anyways. The room he showed us was spectacular. It must have been a suite. Living area and 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms...lots of views from every window. Finally someone understood it was about making it right. Although it was the last of our 2 night stay, it did brighten up the evening. While we where at the theatre they had strawberries sent to the room and it was a nice surprise when we got back. Scott was the only one who got it right. I still have more sad memories instead of happy memories for my 25th wedding anniversay getaway.

The Royal York is by no means a bad hotel, but it just did not meet our expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expectations set by our previous stays at other Fairmont properties (the Royal York was the fifth Fairmont property that we have stayed in over the past year). As expected, the hotel is traditionally decorated and well located within Toronto but it is unexpectedly tired looking and in desperate need of renovation/update (which was shocking given the room rate charged for our stay!). We learned two very valuable lessons during our stay at the Royal York; always check TripAdvisor reviews prior to booking a hotel (we made our Royal York booking on the road at the last minute so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perform our typical research) and Fairmont properties do not seem to possess the consistency that we have come to expect. To be honest, our stay at the Royal York has caused us to question our loyalty to the entire Fairmont brand. The Hotel: When choosing a hotel on vacation travel, we tend to select 4 & 5 star luxury hotels that are historic, posses traditionally decorated common areas (late 19th or early 20th century), and are located within the center of the city and/or center of the city's historic district. The Royal York fell into this category quite well. In addition to being located within the heart of Toronto, the hotel was close to shopping, restaurants, Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Union Station, Air Canada Center, the CN Tower, and more. The hotel appeared to be equipped with typical 5 star amenities (valet, restaurants, lounges, pool, fitness center, business center, etc) but we did not use any of these services/facilities other than the valet during our stay. Overall, though, we feel that the hotel needs a good renovation/update to be considered a luxury hotel. The Room: This part of the review is bit long so we put the important information first! For our stay, we reserved a Fairmont King Non-Smoking room directly through Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (we are President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club members and the Fairmont website has our number on file - plus the room rate listed on the Fairmont website was the same as both Expedia.com & Hotels.com). The room and bathroom were traditionally decorated and there was crown molding throughout the room. The size of the room met our expectations plus the room had a comfortable bed (appeared to be king size), desk, LCD TV, mini-bar, safe, and iron/ironing board. The room was carpeted and the windows in the room were a nice size (we had a corner room with two windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one window on each of two walls). The bathroom had a tile floor (marble as far as we can recall), granite counter tops, and included complementary Miller Harris products (shampoo, conditioner, cream, shower cap, etc). Normally this would be a perfect room for us but in this case the rooms (like the common areas of the hotel) are fairly well worn and not really that clean. For example, the dirt build up on the overhead furnace air intake vent was nasty and both the toilet and the tub in our room looked like they were in serious need of replacement (there was even a slight hole in our bath tub!). Obtaining this room, however, was a bit frustrating! Upon arrival we were assigned a room on the third floor but we eventually ended up staying in the room described above on the sixth floor (we had to change rooms several times). Our initial room assignment (3-103) was in really rough shape. The room desperately needed renovation plus it smelled like smoke. Upon informing the front desk that we would prefer a different room they assigned us a room on the fifth floor (room 5-133). This room was in much better shape than the previous room but the television didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work (we had sound but no picture) and we could clearly hear the couple in the room next to ours (they either had very loud voices or they were in a really good argument). Upon informing the front desk of the situation, we were then assigned a room on the sixth floor (room 6-174). The heating system in this room was very loud (started up with a loud squeaking noise that eventually dissipated) and the television remote didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to work all the time (either bad batteries or broken keys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure which), but after more than an hour running around changing rooms we just decided to keep this room and get on with our one night stay in Toronto! The Staff: Due to our short stay, we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interact with the staff other than during the check-in/check-out/room re-assignment processes. The valet and the front desk staff seemed friendly and helpful. The concierge seemed less than excited to interact with us (we asked her where we might find a coffee shop and her response was general disinterest). The room attendants (house-keepers) that we passed in the hallway were very pleasant and always said hello/good-bye. Some Insights: The front desk staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem a bit surprised that we had issues with any of our rooms. Each time we had an issue with a room we were handed a key to a different room (as if it is a very common practice to have issues with the rooms in this hotel). Instead of resolving issues, the hotel staff appears to just provide guests with keys to alternative rooms - so you may want to check in as early as possible to allow yourself time to work your way through as many rooms as possible before other guests snap up the acceptable ones! The hotel itself sits on top of underground shops so supplies are fairly easy to find. The hotel is directly across the street from the train station so arriving by rail appeared to be very easy. If you are looking for some casual and fun places to go for dinner and/or a drink you can try the Distillery District on Mill Street (http://www.thedistillerydistrict.com/). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 20 minute walk from the hotel but you get to see a part of the city that you might not otherwise see. Another casual restaurant/bar that looked interesting (and close to the hotel) was the Irish Embassy Pub & Grill (http://www.pjobrien.com/). Arriving: We drove to Toronto from Niagara Falls (the trip is about 90 miles and took us about 2 hours). Even though we arrived during weekday rush hour, finding the hotel was straightforward (we travelled on the Gardiner Expressway and the hotel is two blocks North of the expressway). For ease, we parked our car with the hotel valet (cheaper options are available close to the hotel but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to mess around finding alternative parking). The cost for the hotel valet was slightly more than $40.00 CAN per night (which included taxes). Departing: When we left Toronto we were heading to Ottawa (a 280 mile, 5 hour drive). The valet made sure that our car was outside the hotel on time (we called 20 minutes before we actually needed the car to ensure that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait in the lobby). Leaving the city (via the Gardiner Expressway) is very straightforward.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDated in some ways, but a real classic\u201d", "Author": "Blurgeshmurg", "ReviewID": "UR88584552", "Content": "Great service, and a perfect location - Toronto was basically built around this hotel!

Upon arriving we went to check in and were told our room was not yet cleaned. They offered us a $95 voucher to use in the hotel restaurants, and that it would be another hour to an hour and a half before the room would be ready. I was shocked-this 5 star hotel can't even get the rooms cleaned on time? We took a quick walk to the theatre to familiarize ourselves with the route, and then returned to wait in the lobby. As we sat there, we saw at least a dozen people check in and head off to their rooms. After an hour we inquired about our room but were told it was still unavailable. We asked them to take the voucher back and use it towards the cost of the room. They weren't very happy with that, and began to show some attitude in their demeanor. We sat for another 30 minutes, and by this time it was 7pm. When we inquired again we were told that no, our room was still not ready. At this point we asked to speak to a manager to clear this matter up. The employee went into a room for about a minute, then returned and handed us the key card to our room. Just like that. No questions asked, no apology, no explanation. I should have known that this experience was going downhill from that point. We got to our room, and I was disappointed to see it was slightly outdated, had a postage size bathroom (with somebody's hair all over the floor) and rushed to get ready. I guess I had expected something oppulent and decadent from the style of the lobby, and the name Fairmont. The room was okay-nothing to write home about. I've stayed at Comfort Inns with better service and cleaner rooms. I filled out the 'survey' that was in the room, and attached a note describing the issues we had with the hotel. And when i got home, I took the time to email the hotel and tell them how disappointed I was witht the room and the very poor service. I got a one-line reply saying they had 'fallen short' of their reputation and the information had been passed on. At first i thought-hey-this is an industry that thrives on reviews and referrals. They make making their guests happy the number one priority. As a business owner myself, I know when to issue an apology and make up for any shortcomings. The Fairmont Royal York obviously has different values, and basically brushed me off.

We paid for a Deluxe non smoking room but it was a bit small and located on a floor with other rooms that did allow smoking so on the first night we were able to smell the smoke in our room. But the most disappointing part of our stay was the dinner we were served on our first night there. We were tired, it was late and we thought we would order a pizza from the in house dining service and two soft drinks. The menu made it sound quite tasty and that it was made in house. So you can imagine how mortified we were when it was delivered by a member of staff in a Pizza Hut box with one bottle of Sprite. Do you know how much that cost us, with the expected tips? $75! For one pizza and a 1 litre bottle of soft drink that they obviously had delivered by Pizza Hut. We could have done that ourselves for a fraction of the cost but that's not what we thought we would be getting. It was lukewarm and they could at least have taken it out of the box and pretend they made it. We'd rather be deceived than blatantly mocked. Lesson learnt for us: not to eat in house there again. A huge let down from what is supposed to be a respectable, high class hotel. All of the food was expensive though. We were on a bed and breakfast package that limited us (after asking whether there was any limit on what we could select) to a total of $70 from the breakfast menu. This may seem a lot but the costs of the breakfasts quickly surpassed that amount. One other thing we noticed was that there wasn't a mini bar. There was a place for it, so we assumed that it was out for repair. We wanted a place to store water for the few days we were there so we called and asked if we could have a refrigerator. They obliged saying they could bring one up immediately. We later found out that this is considered to be an optional extra and so were charged $25 for its use without being told there was any charge at all. The other let down was not just limited to the Royal York but to all Fairmont hotels: wi fi internet access. It should be available and it should be free to all guests in this day and age. Not available to you in the hotel lobby only and for something like $15 for every 24 hours. That is daylight robbery. This is 2010. If the little motel down the road can offer it, so can you.

The hotel is in a wonderful location and while we expected the rooms would not be modern (in fact we liked the decor...very old world French style) we did NOT expect to have to clean the room ourselves! Indications of service were poor from the start. We pulled up at valet parking on arrival and were asked if we wanted help with our bags....now at a 5* of this repute you don't expect to be asked. We had 3 cases and a couple of other bags and had no problem pulling them behind us - and that's exactly what we did as we got the impression the guy wasn't too bothered in taking them. Check in was efficient but not almost rude. The girl at the desk asked for the name of the 2nd person staying in the room....I hesitated a moment as it was a strange ask given I had already handed over the paperwork relating to the reservation. Before I had chance to recover she indicated to my husband standing behind me and asked \"is HE staying in the room also\"? We got to our room (3rd Floor, Deluxe Double) and was immediately met with a very strange odour coming from the bathroom. We thought it might be some unpleasant disinfectant but on investigation discovered the toilet had been used and not flushed! I can only assume the rest of the room wasn't properly cleaned. After hours of travelling and it being late I did not call the front desk so got out my antibacterial wipes and cleaned the bathroom myself. I then discovered a 'Welcome card' in an envelope in the living area. Nice I thought.....until I realised it wasn't for us! I thought there might be a mix up in names but on further looking found documentation items/check out details belonging to the previous occupant as well as a used water bottle top. There were 2 bathrobes hanging on back of bathroom door - but it was obvious one had been worn by the previous occupant and just re-hung. Next morning I presented these and my complaint regarding the bathroom and bathrobe to the front desk. I might as well have been giving them a weather forecast for the amount of interest they showed! The guy asked if we wanted to move rooms....but then quickly added that as we were already in a deluxe room he would have to check for availability. I said I would move to a higher floor (more light as the lower floor rooms are quite dark) if there was one available but would be happy if the room was just cleaned properly and the other items put right. There was NO apology forthcoming! As the week went on there were other things that bothered me. (If I was in a 2* motel they may not have bothered me so much but this is an expensive 5* so I expect 5* service). Used coffee cups not taken or washed (although replacement cups were left). Ice bucket left with water for 2 days....I eventually emptied it myself. Coffee maker not cleaned. Ran out of the little cream/milk sachets on Tuesday - still hadn't been replaced by Friday when we were leaving. On a positive note the bed and feather duvet/pillows were extremely comfortable and provided for a great night's sleep. I also indulged in a massage which was great. We DID enjoy our stay in downtown Toronto very much but never felt we had lived through an exclusive 5* experience and this hotel is definitely not worth the rate paid. We've stayed in other Fairmonts which were just excellent - the most recent being in Monte Carlo - from which you just walk away saying WOW! Unfortunately this Fairmont had no such effect on us....it is trading on its name.... but for how long we wonder? We will be staying in one of the many other great hotels in Toronto next time and sadly won't be recommending the Fairmont.

My claustrophobia immediately kicked in. Because the hotel was fully booked they couldn't move me the first night. The next night they downgraded me (albeit without a refund) to a standard room on a higher floor so I could at least see out a window and check the weather. On the plus side, the location can't be beat, especially if you're traveling by train. It's right across from Union Station.

Ever since I had issues here, it just kept getting worse and worse. I am actually very shocked after staying here for 3 weeks and having to change 3 rooms. Obviously, they never wanted me to come back and I won't. And yesterday was Sept 11th and I had friends I had lost on my mind. I didn't need more stress from a \"service\" I was paying for. I had this fantasy that since I was staying on the executive floor, I would get a decent room and be in one place for the full 3 weeks. I over packed since my assumption was that I would unpack once and pack once. I usually go to 3-4 countries in 3 weeks. I needed a home base as I was starting a new job and needed to focus on work. I had just been a caregiver for the last few weeks before this trip so I was at capacity. And on my first day in Toronto, I had to go to a funereal. This hotel is old.. It is not built with easy access. There is a flight of stairs at the entrance where the limo driver dropped me off. I waited for someone to help me with my bags, which I usually easily wheel all the way to my room. I went to the special lounge where someone very cheerful greeted me and informed me that I was booked for two nights. I had to let him know that it was actually 3 weeks and that I want to be in one place for the whole stay. I should have known then. I won''t bother you with all the details - here are some highlights: I had to move 3 times because of them telling me yes, we have wireless. No, we don't have wireless. And after telling them how important it was for me to have wireless (I am recovering from an injury) they put me in a room with no wireless access. I told them I was allergic to feathers. I woke up at 3 am with an allergy attack from feathers. On an executive floor, there was screaming and yelling from 2-6 am one night. No sleep for me. The next day I was told that they had to ask the guests across the hall from me to leave the hotel. And it doesn't matter because it is an old hotel and you can hear EVERYTHING through the walls. One of the guys who worked there decided to share with me some stories about this. I hate drama and this was just drama all the time. I felt uncomfortable going to the lounge for breakfast and drinks because the people who worked there made me feel uncomfortable as I was the problem guest. I chose not to go to the lounge as a result. The scariest part was when I woke up on a Monday morning and found a hand written note from another guest under my door claiming they saw someone steal something from my room and could I knock on their door before noon. What??? I felt so awful that another guest was contacting me directly. It wasn;t about stealing anything but the fact that another guest was trying to contact me directly was so creepy. I have been travelling all over the world and this was the creepiest thing that has ever happened. They ended up calling security and I had to waste my time giving a report. Later, I was told it was a prank. At a 5 star hotel? What kind of security is there for a single woman? They did upgrade me to a suite. They did provide me with fruit and sparkling water. But they did not provide a good experience. A home away from home. They did not offer to comp me for the night where the guest they kicked out kept me up all night. Their staff went on strike and it probably explains why they did not put the roll of toilet paper on and just left it on the floor for me to change, even when they were not on strike. And how, I was gone from my room for 7 hours and no one came to clean it, when there was no strike. I guess my expectations are way too high and I am just a difficult guest, as I was told? I know, I should have switched hotels. But I was tired and stressed. It is my fault for wanting to give them another chance. But after checking out and being told I was the difficult guest, I am done. I am sad. I am in shock at how bad the experience was and how no one really cared. The irony is that those who know me know that I am low maintenance. I just wanted a good experience.

That is why I chose to take the train. If your business or leasure trip keeps you largely downtown or even on the subway line, you don't need a car. Finally, I made the short (3-4 block) walk to the Eaton Centre for a little shopping. You are in the middle of the whole city here, so shopping is not hard to come by.

I prefer more modern hotels, but this one is OK IF you get an inexpensive rate and are thrilled by history.

He told me that was the closest one and walked away. Gee, didn't I ask for one BESIDES that? You see, the Union Station McDonalds's doesn't have ANY SEATING!! To be fair, there were some service highlights. The front desk person was very professional at check-in (though she wrote the wrong room number on my portfolio envelope!)

I went to my doctor immediately and she informed to me that they were some kind of bug bite. After I returned home, I called Royal York to complain to the Management. The next day, the Assistant Manager of House Keeping - Stephan left me a voice mail msg saying that they will have a company come to the hotel to examine the room, and he will inform me of the results. I gave Stephan 1 week before my attempt to call him. I left him voice mail msgs and he would not return my calls. Then I spoke to the hotel manager on duty and she transferred me to Stephan.

I stayed there for two nights on business. The rooms are fine and typical of business hotels. The hotel had full amenities, although the only thing I used was the business centre, which provided free access to the internet and a printer. I got an excellent rate of $145 ($164, including a variety of taxes). They provided free internet access. At least I think it was free. The card on the hotel room desk indicated it was $13 per day, but nothing showed up on my bill when I checked out. The location is fine. It is relatively close to most downtown points of interest, although depending on where you want to be, there may be closer properties that are sufficiently comparable. Check-in was very quick. I had no wait and the desk clerk was very friendly. She offered me a choice between two rooms, explaining the pros and cons of each. I chose the room on the higher floor, which she warned me was right next to the elevator. However, I never heard any elevator noise during my stay. I appreciate this comment is in direct contrast to one of the recent postings for this property. In addition, after checking in, I went out to grab a quick bite to eat. On my return, I found a chilled bottle of white wine waiting for me. I called down because I hadn't ordered it and was worried about getting charged for it. However, they told me not to worry about it and it did not appear on my bill. My only complaint was about the temperature control in the room. When I arrived, (at about 6:00 pm) the room was a chilly 17 or 18 degrees Celsius (63-65 Fahrenheit). I set the thermostat to 75F and went out for about two hours. When I returned, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much warmer than 65 or 66F. I then set the thermostat to full blast. By 11:00 it was still under 70F. It pretty much took until the middle of the night, as far as I could tell, to warm the room up to regular room temperature. I suppose I could also complain that my upper floor view consisted almost solely of nearby office towers, but that really isn't the hotel's fault. Overall, it was a positve stay.

Paying a premium price to stay here because of the reputation of the hotel we were soon rudely disillusioned.

As at the Sheraton earlier in the week our travel agent had noted our reason for travel and the reception clerk said a drink (bottle of Champagne) would be sent up to our room -It wasn't. When I asked why not when we went out two hours later I was told it would be there on our return. When it wasn't I was told it was on the way and it arrived 6 hours later! There was no provision to check personal email although the TV in the room allegedly had that facility and we were charged $5.50 for 3 minutes use of the business facility. Although willing the concierge was not very helpful, and charged us $125 each for $70 dollar tickets to the Blue Jays game. Despite assurances she also failed to secure boarding cards from Air Canada, leaving us to get seats apart for our return journey. Finally, and perhaps the final straw, we had booked for afternoon tea in the Library Bar before leaving for the airport. Offered a list of teas we chose Darjeeling - but were served a standard breakfast tea. When we pointed out the error the tea was replaced, but when we asked for the pot to be refreshed it was filled with an inferior tea once again. After some altercation the senior server explained they had no knowledge of specialist teas and bought the leaves in the pot marked Darjeeling to show me. It was quite obvious that there were two teas mixed together. A little Darjeeling with a far larger amount of what looked like a poor broken Assam leaf. To give her her due she did delete the cost of the tea from the bill, but what was meant as a final luxury was of course totally ruined. In general the hotel, despite its air of opulence failed in the small but important matter of staff training and guest relationships.

Myself, hubby and 10 year old. Over the years, I have stayed at the Royal York about 5 or 6 times. I really like this place, the location is the best- close to Convention centre, Blue Jays, Air canada centre, union station, restaurants, CN tower, Eaton Centre, shops. I have stayed for business and leisure, by myself , with my husband, and with husband and child. Here's the good and the bad Good Location (see above) Transportation- is a stop on airport express bus..about $20 per person from Pearson, some discount for a roundtrip.I take this when alone, as a cab is abour $45 one way, a town car $55. With 2 or more people, I take the comfort of a town car limo from airport. Pool-it has one, a pretyy good one in my opinion. Adult swim only afrom 9 to 10 pm, pool has good locker room with attendent to give locker, towels etc. Health club not real big, but OK. Service- some of the best in a non 4 Seasons Hotel. I phoned for xtra pillows for sofa bed, and was asked would you like a duvet, too? They made up the sofa bed with duvet and triple sheets.Bell man always available to help, concierge helpful Linens and bed- very high quality, very comfy. Nice robes. Coffee - in room coffee maker made decent coffee, real creamers in mini bar (10% and 2%) not just coffee mate powder like in most places. Real china cups and silver spoon for the coffee service. Toiletries- good quality. Bath gel as well as the usuals. Bath tub is old, hotel was bilt in 1929, so is deep enough for a real bath. Not so good There most certainly is variation in the rooms. My first time here, (over 10 yrs ago) I had a room the size of a closet, next to house keepings room. Small, noisy, closet was itsy bitsy. (this was in the days before Hotel websites, when you phoned, asked for a room and got what you got because you didn't know any better). One time, I had a nice large king room, once a way too small king room while travelling with my husband-- I expressed my displeasure and was upgraded to a huge suite with 2 baths. Once we stayed on gold floor,in a king room, a tad small but good view and top notch service, loved the lounge- excellent, highly recommed. This time, room was perfect. I had booked a deluxe, wanting the extra room to fit a cot for my 10 yr old. I had the room pictured, which had a king bed, sofa bed, dining table for 4, and a closet big enough to live in. This appeared to be more than was offerred in the deluxe room, I guess I got a really nice deluxe room! Prices- are not low. Breakfast is very pricy Epic Buffet $28 but really good omelettes, pastry left lot to be desired. You can walk around corner to Tim Hortons, theres a second cup right there, too. Room service very $$$ too. Epic sfternoon tea is $29 per person but a lovely experience. So, you can splurge on the pricey food, or leave the hotel and get something much cheaper close by. Conv. store, Tims, etc out of main entrance, go right then right onto the next street. Hot dogs from wagons across street good, too. Air con- is pretty good. We had it cranked and kept the room cool enough, the bed area on other side of divider was that cool, but we asked for a fan, and all was good. We like it really cool at night, and found the temp good. It was just June, not a heatwave so maybe the a/c doesn't work as well in dead of summer. Bathrooms- are indeed small. Hotel is old, not much you can do. Not much counter space, but tub is nice and deep, If you want a nice soaking tub and separate shower, stay at the SOHo Met. No fan in bathroom. Noise- there was some party one night around corner from my room. I don't know what was going on in there, I saw about 20 young people all dressed up leaving....loud music. I called desk around 10, was told they enfore quiet after 11. I didn't hear a peep after 10:45. Maybe the people were having a party before going out.

The rooms are expensive, and I found the decor pretty lacklustre (peeling paint, old fixtures, scuffed up beat up furniture) for such an expensive hotel. I know hotels can have bad days and problems at times. I did mention this to the staff after I left and they were somewhat sympathetic.

The issue we had was that the room we were first given had no working tap water, was missing the knob to turn the shower on/off, and the shower was also leaking water. Other than that the room was beautifully upgraded! We were quite disappointed when we were switched to another room that was a down-grade in comparison. We did receive money off of our room for this (as there were no other rooms available), which did make up for it, but once you see the up-graded room it just puts you off! (There is also a pool and a few restaurants that are said to be good but more on the expensive side, we did not use either) However our second room was still nice and very clean, and the service we received while fixing the room change was excellent.

The service was outstanding, starting with the booking agent who took my reservation over the phone. It continued when I arrived with efficient and professional service at the check-in counter. It continued again when, after discovering that I had initially been booked into a room that was literally right next to the elevators, I was quickly switched to another room on a higher floor that was satisfactorily far from the elevators with just one call to \"Royal Service\". (When I explained over the phone that a colleague was already waiting for me in the lobby to head out for dinner, the hotel agreed to switch my bags to my new room for me while I was out, with me stopping by the front desk once back from dinner to pick up my new key.) It included the cheery clerk at the lobby coffee shop who helpfully suggested that I might be interested in joining the Nike Lounge womens-only running group that evening, upon noticing that I was clearly returning to the hotel after an early morning run along the waterfront. And it even extended to the friendly and polite concierge who stored my luggage in the morning and gave me directions to my meeting. The Fairmont's decor can only be described as traditional, in the grand railway hotel style at its origin. Perhaps that's the issue? Maybe people were expecting sleek, modern, minimalist design? That's not what you come to the Fairmont for - rather, watch for the exquisite mural of the Canadian Rockies over the main entrance, the incredible vaulted decorative ceiling in the lobby, the carved brass doors and dark wood in the elevator and the expansive colourful carpets and crystal chandeliers in public spaces. It's old-style luxury all the way - that's what Fairmont does and they do it very, very well. Add to this convenience - the Porter Airlines shuttle dropped me right at the hotel's York Street entrance and there was easy access to the city's Path and subway systems - and all for $145 / night! Truly, every part of this experience lived up to my expectations.

Essentially this is two older rooms with a connecting door, partially rennovated (bathrooms and some fittings) but still tired in places, one room has a sofa-bed so I guess they are ideally allocated to families - each room has a standard bathroom.

We had two Deluxe rooms and a regular Fairmont Room. The Deluxe rooms were very spacious with a separate sleeping area, large sitting area, TV's in both rooms, 2 bathrooms, and work desk. The furniture was good quality but some of it was showing its age. The wallpaper looked as though it was very old and needed replacing. The bathtubs in each bathroom looked like the originals... could stand to be replaced. Having said all of that, although everything looked a bit dated in the Deluxe rooms, the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Check-in was fast and friendly. We had asked that two of the rooms be close together as one of the rooms was for my elderly parents. We wanted one of the other parties in an adjoining room or across the hall in case my parents needed assistance. When we checked in we were advised that they had indeed looked after the request, two of the rooms had consecutive room numbers Front desk staff said the rooms were across the hall from each other. However, when we went to the floor, the rooms were actually down the hall around 2 corners apart, even though they were one number apart!!! Staff thought they had fulfilled our request, but obviously got it wrong. The Fairmont room was the most up to date room as far as decor, everything in it looked as though it was not too old. The room was very nice. We got real bargains on these rooms - $180 for the Deluxe Rooms on a high floor with views, and $127 for the Fairmont room. If I had paid regular price in high season for the Deluxe Rooms, I would have felt a little cheated. However, I thought we did very well for the price. When we went to have breakfast or brunch on Sunday morning around 10:00 a.m., we were told that the restaurant was closed. There was nowhere in the hotel to have a meal. All that was open was the Epic lounge, where the prices are just silly. So we ended up having to take a taxi elsewhere for brunch. Two of us went to the Epic lounge for coffee at about 4:00 p.m. After waiting about 10 minutes for service, we ordered one latte (that came in a small coffee cup/saucer) and one regular coffee. After about another 10 minutes, someone else came by and asked if we'd ordered, and we said we'd ordered 2 coffees some time ago, and hadn't seen the server since. The coffees arrived shortly thereafter. We then got a bill for $12.00 for our two coffees, with no refills! The afternoon before my parents went to the Epic Lounge and ordered one small plate with sliced meats and cheeses and 2 coffees and were billed over $40.00. This was all that was open for eating while we were there. We did enjoy our stay at the Royal York. The lobby is fabulous, the location is excellent for transportation, walking and seeing sights, hockey, basketball and baseball venues. Views from upper flooors are great. The hotel is really beautiful. It's worth staying there if you get a good price - but beware if you go in high season, you'll probably feel like you paid too much.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wasaga Beach", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "My_lover_boy", "ReviewID": "UR53143650", "Content": "We stayed in the RYH due to location (we had a business commitment 5 minutes away).

The service was so far below even the most basic of expectations. We asked the concierge for walking directions to one of the attractions we were looking to visit. the response can only be described as rude. We were spoken to as if we had just been violently ill on her desk. The look on her face was as if speaking to us was beneath her stature in life. On top of that the directions she provided were incorrect and left us two blocks North of our destination. I was so put off by the experience that upon my return to the hotel, I requested to speak with the manager. The Duty Manager presented himself and listened to my concerns and responded not with an apology but with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why she was like that she is a very good employee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The public areas are nice, if crowded and the rooms (I stayed on the Club Floor) small. At some point the hotel is clearly going to need some investment to bring it's standards up, but the present problem is the standard of service. The service in the hotel is poor, and if any problems are encountered the staff have a habit of pushing you from one desk to another. To get even simple problems fixed there seems a need to escalate the problem to a manager. Requests get forgotten (can you make up the room early?) and apologies aren't forthcoming. Even on the Club floor the service was less than impressive. It seemed that if you were a regular guest (and perhaps a captain of industry) there was significant grovelling and gesticualtion. For the unwashed others any requests were met with sparing response. The valet parking, given the $40 a day, was poor. The constant reminder of needing at least 30 minutes to have a car ready, and the waiting on the street until a valet was available really didn't suggest value or service. At times the valet area is a complete mess with lines of waiting cars. My guess on this hotel is given the huge number of rooms to fill each evening (this is a big and sprawling hotel) they are let at low rates to tourist parties. As a result the hotel has a large number of guests, but the resulting lower revenues only pay for a less than necessary number of staff. Staff always seemed harried, and wanting to move onto the next guest, rather than deal with the current issue. Service then suffers, badly. When I was there a large part of the lobby was let out to a film shoot, which the hotel seemed quite proud of ('please ignore the sniper on the roof'). It might have been revenue for the hotel but it did close off some of the entrances to the hotel and (more meaningfully for me) meant that the nicest bar (the Library) was unvavailable for one day and one night).

And since it was prepaid, we had no choice. I also signed up for the President's club online, which was free, although they required a credit card to put on file which they said was for future reservations. I'm sure they can't charge me anything without my authorization. Upon arrival, I went to the President's club check-in desk, where there was no line, and was promptly assisted. I was told that I had reserved a smoking room, to which I replied that I had reserved non-smoking, but she then informed me that we had gotten a complimentary upgrade from the regular hotel room we booked to a 1 bedroom suite. So I decided to accept this and determine if I felt that the room smelled of smoke once I got there. They told us that the room had two separate entrances in which either key would work. We found the room and I noticed that the hallway smelled heavily of smoke and was very concerned that the room was going to be the same. Upon entering, we were absolutely awe struck with the beauty and size of the room! The decor was victorian style, with two separate living room areas, a dining room table, kitchenette (no appliances, except a fridge), two full bathrooms, two coat closets, king size bed and a walk-in closet! There was a door between the one living room area/bedroom area and the second living room area, that could be shut if you wished. There were bath robes in both bathrooms, so a total of 4 bath robes! The toiletries were wonderful. The bed was soooo comfortable and had a wonderful down comforter. We slept GREAT! A few minutes after we got into our room, the front desk called to see how we liked our room and, of course, we told them it was absolutely incredible!

On the positive side, the air/heat worked well, the elevators were reasonably prompt for a 1,000 plus room hotel, and there are reports that the food is adequate, if severely overpriced. And it's linked, not only with Toronto's union station, but with the vast underground network of shops and interconnected office towers. Assuming that's what you're after. For the large hotel experience along the waterfront, try the Intercontinental or Harbour Castle.

After hearing so much about it and its glorious history, we thought we would be in for a special treat. We were sadly mistaken.

Filthy tile and grouting. This luxury hotel is also the first I have stayed in over 5 years now that still sports a tiny 28 inch (at most) tube television.... even the cheap hotels I have stayed in have updated in that regard. Wires sticking out all over like a rats nest under the desk (no wireless internet) Our neighbors smoked and loudly partied until 3:30am when I could no longer bare it and called service, no apologies made whatsoever, though someone did come and tell them to quiet down.... they continued smoking and hence made our room smell like an ashtray. Its hard to rationalize spending hundreds of dollarsper night in a hotel you can't even get to sleep in. The flagship restaurant Epic was closed while we were there, huge disappointment as we were planning on having dinner and tea there. No alternatives were given. We were told the Library Bar had an extended menu with items similar to Epic.... the waitress had no idea what we were talking about and the menu was full of sandwiches save a steak. We ended up eating dinner in their restaurant Pipers and all of us getting ill. By the way do not order the duck confit poutine... the \"duck\" is actually chicken. Valet was ridiculous... for $40 a night for parking you shouldn't be expected to wait 10 minutes and end up hunting down your own valet and bellhop. Thankfully it wasn't cold... I would have been very angry to stand in the cold waiting for someone to take our car and luggage.... unless you want to lug your stuff up stairs to get to check in... you have no option but to use the bellhop service... trust me..

The bathroom was outdated with peeling wallpaper and thick caulking applied everywhere, but it and the room were reasonably clean, the room had a separate living area, and there was a walk-in closet which was a nice feature.

Even the concierge was shocked when we told him. He suggested the Library - but it was a very dark place with \"fancy\" appetizers, not the nachos etc. we were looking for. Avoid the York's kitchen and deli - went there for a quick breakfast the next morning - place was a mess. Poor ladies behind the cash (only 2 of them) were taking care of cooking all the food, manning the cash, getting the coffee, and keeping supplies (utensils etc.) replenished.

A covered walkway connects the train station to the hotel but stairs are involved. It was easier for us (as my husband is not allowed to lift for health reasons) to go outside instead and cross several lanes of traffic to reach the hotel. Once there though, we met with stairs. There was no doorman and we didn't see a sign indicating an elevator or another entrance for handicapped people. Luckily, a friendly passerby helped us with our luggage. Once in the lobby we found no one at the check-in counter. A man at another counter rousted out someone from a back room. Pros: The room was a pleasant surprise. It was roomy, comfortable, nicely decorated and it had two windows. Everything was in working order. Most importantly (to us), it was very clean and quiet. Cons: The negatives were minor. The desk clerk, when we enquired, should have known there were other bottles of water available for less than the $8 ones on the desk in our room. And if complimentary bottled water should have come with the turn-down service, why were we not given the option of that service since they knew we were arriving late?

After I sent two emails I was told that the extra charge was for a bottled of water and a can of Pringles. We never touched any Pringles! Happily, they said they will refund the $10.60.

Other hotels in the city were offering conference-goers 50% off food vouchers and free breakfasts, but the Fairmont offered nothing. Guess they figure they are so old, they don't need to. I had a plain room with no view at the back of the hotel overlooking an alley and office building next door. Room was small, but adequate for one person. Bed was comfortable, but the thin walls made sleeping a challenge with noisy neighbors. Bathroom was tiny and the addition of a granite countertop made sitting on the toilet a real challenge. I am a large man and was literally wedged in and couldn't move. Some hand grips in the shower would have been nice. Toiletries were nice, as others have commented, but be prepared to make the sliver of soap last 7 days as it was never replaced. The snack basket was overpriced...$4 for a small bag of M&M's! Surcharges for EVERY phone call $1.61 per local call and $23 for a 7 minute call back to the States. Free in-room coffee, but I had to request creamer from the housekeeper and she had the kitchen send some up. The free newspaper was absent one day.

Fairmont was offering a tremendous rate for the night as part of its \"Be an Original\" campaign ($109 Canadian), which made the Royal York less expensive than many inferior properties in the vicinity. Since we were arriving by train, we loved the idea of the hotel's attachment to Union Station via an underground walkway- what a great way to arrive! I love the big-city vibe this hotel gives off: lots of people milling about, ballrooms hosting elegant functions, lounges filled with business people enjoying an after-work cocktail, lots of little shops to browse among down below in the concourse. The staff is well trained, very professional and pleasant. I enjoyed cocktails in the library lounge listening to an excellent guitarist play a variety of tunes. We were assigned rooms on the 6th floor. The three doubles were in the West Wing of the building, and my king was in the East Wing. My king room had obviously been more recently redecorated than the doubles-- more modern furnishings, more neutral decor, flat screen television. The three doubles still have decor from the late '80's (rose carpet, lots of chintz fabric and floral wallpaper) but all of the elements were well-maintained. The rooms are not large but offered more than enough space for a night. The bathrooms are especially compact but nicely outfitted in marble with good quality toiletries and bathrobes. All of us commented on having had one of the quietest, most comfortable night's sleeps ever. The beds are plush, the pillows are voluminous, and the rooms are well sound-proofed. I especially liked that the windows open-- something not often found in a high rise hotel. The next morning I used the well-outfitted gym and had a look at the lovely, modern pool area (it's not an historic pool like at the Fairmont Chateau Laurier in Ottawa). The pool area offers lemon-infused water and a variety of newspapers for guests to take- a nice touch. The only element lacking in the hotel is the restaurant in which breakfast is served on the weekends: the York Kitchen. The buffet offered is just not up to the standards of the buffets I have enjoyed at other Fairmont properties-- not as much selection, messy presentation, hurried/harried staff, and a very noisy \"Golden Griddle\" atmosphere. It's too bad that Epic is open for breakfast only on weekdays, as I imagine it would offer more of the dining experience we were looking for. I'm looking forward to returning here again-- especially if the promotional rates are still in effect.

Thankfully check in was speedy as I am a member of their Presidents club and so it has a dedicated check-in desk and we weren't forced to join the rather big queue! Room was decent enough for our needs - we were only staying there 5 nights not 5 weeks! Room was clean, beds were comfy, nice big flat screen TV and comfortable chairs to sit in. Our room also faced onto York Street so we had a lovely view of the CN Tower. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but again you aren't spending all day in there so was fine enough for your actual needs. My only grumble about the rooms was the lack of insulation! We seemed to have the \"neighbours from hell\" either side of us. One side came home from the New Year's Eve celebrations and kept us awake by their noise until easy 3am then just as we though we'd finally get some sleep, the room on the other side came back and woke us up at 4.30am! Not impressed as you can gather and hotel security did eventually pay them a visit to keep the noise down. Concierge were extremely helpful with the requests they made for restaurants - finding us a great Chinese restaurant for New Years Day and then an Italian one before we saw Dirty Dancing. They also sorted us out with a sightseeing tour of Toronto that fitted our needs too. The Lobby is fantastic and so beautiful - remember your camera to take photo's! And as a plus too, the hotel is connected into the PATH system so even though the weather was very cold outside you could still get around Toronto without having to go out into the cold. Thankfully breakfast was included in our package otherwise it would have been rather expensive eating in each day - almost $70 for 2 continental breakfasts by the time they added on a 15% service charge and the taxes... and they've got the cheek to ask if you wish to add a gratuity too!!! The only negative things I'd say about the hotel was that most of the hotel bars/restaurants were closed while we were there and the ones that were open (EPIC and the Japanese one) did seem to be rather expensive. The library bar made a rare opening on New Years Eve but the service was horrendous - 40 mins to receive a drinks orders then a further wait of 30 mins for the food to arrive and when it did the food was cold!

Perhaps a bit too large to be much of a luxury hotel. We spent three nights here. Overall it was fine, especially considering what we paid. But we had come to expect quite a bit from Fairmonts, and sadly this experience wasn't what we're used to from the brand. Check-in was fine. The front desk person was courteous and professional. No wait at the President's Club line. We had what is called a \"deluxe\" room, which is basically two regular rooms combined into one. It is about 500 sq ft. And has 2 bathrooms. Very nice for our family of four. Furnishing was traditional, but fine. Electronic safe in room. TV was old fashion tube, but worked well enough. Coffeemaker in the room. But no creamers anywhere. Desk was very small, barely large enough for my laptop. Internet was slow sometimes, but generally fine. Our room was on 5th floor, but no street noise problems. So why did I give it a \"3\" rating and not higher? Well, first, except for front desk personnel, other staffers we encountered acted as though we didn't exist, and their reply to our \"hello\" was more a grudging groan than anything pleasant. The second day our room wasn't made by the time we returned at about 3 pm. We had left the room at 7:30 am. Sure, sometimes they get behind, but 3 pm seemed kind of late. One of the kids wanted a nap, so we just hung up the Do Not Disturb sign and forego the housekeeping. Turndown came the first day, and all they did was leave a couple bottles of water and turned on the radio. Didn't even remove the dirty towels or replace the glasses. Not much of a turndown, if you ask me. So we do the DND for turndown for the next two nights as well. What's the point? One evening about 9, we decided to go to one of the lounges for a quick sandwich. Went in and was told to sit anywhere. Found a table, but 15 minutes later never even got a \"hello\" from anyone. Waiters passed us by on many occasions, and never once did anyone stop to give us a menu or anything. We walked out, and went to the nearby Sheraton for our sandwich instead. The bill that was slipped under the door had a mistake (overcharged us by $69). Small thing, but took time to go and get it adjusted. At checkout, called to get the car out, and was on hold for almost 10 minutes. No one offered to help with luggage at check out either. Valet gave us the key, and that was it. Would I go back?

The handbasin plug didn't hold water and the room safe was already locked shut - these problems weren't fixed during our stay despite reporting them. The coffee machine didn't work properly and the cold water pressure was low. We had no face clothes at first, unless you counted the soggy one at the bottom of the bath. We would really have appreciated a refrigerator and microwave for our young son's food, but these were optional extras charged at a quite ridiculous rate - these are often free (even standard in every room) in much cheaper hotels.

Cons (during my stay): - Couldn't check in when we arrived. There was some computer problem, so they gave a drink coupon and was told to wait. - Room overall: The room was smaller than I expected and did not feel clean. We were placed on the 8th floor, next to the elevator as well as next to a service area. Everyday, we had the displeasure of walking by service carts stored in the hallway next to our room. At first we thought there were howling winds, but after the 10th time in less than an hour, we realized that the elevators were very loud, making it hard to sleep at night. Also, because the room was next to a service area, at any time, the staff were banging carts into the wall. You can easily hear anyone outside your door and down the hall. Supposedly because of our special rate and the convention, they refused to move us to another room. That's bad customer service. - Closet door wouldn't open/close properly. It was off its tracks. It already had a crack in it, and when I tried to open it, the crack grew. - One of the pictures on the wall had a chunk of its frame broken. - One of the three lamps in the room had a dead bulb. Another one was just ridiculously cheap and ugly looking. - Bathroom: The worst! The drain was slow, and when I removed the stopper to see if that would help, I found the hugest wad of hair collected beneath the stopper. Really disgusting. - Wallpaper was visibly damaged in several areas. There was some obvious water damage to this room (bubbled up wallpaper, exposed drywall). This was really unexpected and unsightly. - Internet costs $13.95/day. Apparently it's not available in all rooms, and they don't have wireless. We figured out after the first day that you can join their \"President's Club\" for free, and get free internet for your entire stay. I think this only applies the first time you join. - Pool: under repair. - Elevators: slow. - I also met another guest that had to go back down to the lobby because they were sent to a room that had not been cleaned. Eww, gross. In summary, whether you're spending your money or someone else's, there are many much better accommodations in Toronto. I'd call this place shabby chic, but it's really just shabby.

I got a great package deal through CANAM worldwide travel agency that included train fare from Sarnia to Toronto, three nights at the Fairmont, a very large hot, buffet breakfast at a restaurent called York's Kitchen in the basement of the Fairmont; plus, all taxes for about $560 US. A very, very good deal considering the cost of accommodations in downtown Toronto and taxes. The best part about this hotel is its location. I spent a lot of time at the convention center so this hotel is really great, only about two blocks from the convention center and just across the street from the Toronto train station. It is right on the subway line too if you want to go to other parts of the city. As for the room, it is on the small side, but normal for a hotel of this age. The room was perfectly tidy, but it looks like it is on a gradual renovation plan. The bathroom has had various parts of it replaced and is looking like it is heading in the right direction, but it has a piece-meal look to it. The granite counter is new, but the tile is on the older side (and although clean) doesn't really match. The wall paper looks like it belongs to someone's grandmother...again, doesn't quite match the granite look, but appears as if it will be the next thing to be replaced. The bed is good and firm and there were 4 fluffy feather pillows. All nice. There was a small couch and desk in the room. Internet service was $14.65 for 24 hours (including all taxes). There is wireless service in the lobby too if you don't want to sit in your room. The lobby is nice, but unlike other reviewers I don't think it is out of this world...it looks kind of sparse, piece-meal, and under-decorated to me given the grandeur of this building. The service is quite good, given the size of this place it is surprising. The buffet breakfast at York's Kitchen (included in my package) was a very nice treat... and the staff at York's Kitchen were all very friendly and helpful. Despite being a buffet breakfast, they will make custom omelets for you at an omelette station. The pool and jacuzzi are currently out of service (maintenance) so if you want to use that you have to go to the Intercontinental Hotel. The downside? It's a large hotel and it does not do somethings that other hotels do...they do not provide forgotten toiletries gratis (you are told to go downstairs to the store, where a disposable razor packet will cost you $6+). What else? Surprisingly, there is no way into this hotel that does not include stairs. So if you are carrying or rolling a lot of luggage, you MUST carry your luggage up at least 12 steps to get into the lobby. I was very surprised that there was absolutely NO WAY to roll yourself into the lobby (despite several entrances). Very surprising in this day and age. I asked them how people with wheelchairs cope and apparently there is one elevator for these clients...but to be honest you would have to ask where it is--it isn't obvious. So if you use a walker or wheelchair make sure you know which entrance has the elevator before you try to enter the building. Could be frustrating. Overall, I thought was a very good deal as I normally spend about $159-$179 at One King West without taxes at the same time of year. The train fare alone was $110 round trip, so that puts the room at about $120-125 per night before taxes and accounting for the price of an equivalent breakfast.

If you are a light sleeper the noise will wake you up. Additionally, while the lobby was nice, I found the room decore outdated and dark. The first room I had was on the 5th floor and was not cleaned properly. I complained and was upgraded to an \"executive room\" that was the quality of what I expected their basic room to be. And the upgraded room wasn't that clean either.

The cutomer service was amazing from the beginning. While checking in, the staff made my boyfriend and I feel so welcomed. Our room was great. We had a corner room (I suggest this!) with a king bed and great view of the lake. I have to admit the room was a bit small, but I have been told this is because of the age of the hotel, since large rooms were not the usual in the twenties (I am pretty sure it was built in 1926 or 27). Food was great. We had dinner at the main dining room, epic and found the atmospher was great. Except we were not thrilled with the price. While the dishes were great tasting, we didn't feel the price was really right for what was served. I don't think i would eat dinner there again, probably just go to dinner outside the hotel. We also had room service for breakfast. We had a package for bed and breakfast, but we slept in unintentionally and the restaurant was no longer serving breakfast. We were really upset, but the hotel made an exception and just sent us breakfast from in room service. I was so impressed they were willing to do this for us.

The hotel is situated directly across Union Station in the heart of downtown Toronto. Upon entering the hotel, you will be amazed by the regal lobby furnishings and decor of the hotel. The woodwork, floral arrangements and gleaming floor mosaics are truly what make the hotel so glamorous. With regards to the rooms, due to the age of the building, they are on the small side compared to the newer luxury hotels available to travelers in Toronto. Many of the rooms have been refurbished giving them a more contemporary edge. The rooms boast large flat screen televisions, extremely comfortable bedding and luxury soaps in the washrooms. The marble appointed washrooms are also on the small side and consist of a bathtub- shower combination and sink. The beds are extremely comfortable but slightly smaller than the usual double bed dimensions. The hotel also offers its patrons the convenience of having several dining options within the hotel itself. On the ground floor there is EPIC Restaurant which serves both light dining options as well as four course gourmet meals. Although on the pricey side, the food is divine. There is also a Beni Hana restaurant on the floor below as well Pipers Resto-bar and two restaurants where you can get breakfast in the morning. The York Caf\u00c3\u00a9 serves breakfast for those on the go while York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grill offers hot and cold buffet breakfast options to its diners. The hotel also has great training facilities and a beautiful pool area. The extra touches such as the lemon-water and headsets for the integrated TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the exercise equipment provided to the clients add a special touch. There are also various underground passages below the hotel which connect directly to various other buildings. This is especially convenient to those business travellers who have clients in the surrounding financial district. Although I enjoyed my stay at the hotel, I would strongly recommend staying at this hotel if you can get a discounted room rate.

I have stayed at many nice resorts and will try to make comparison as I see fit. First off, I was originally going to stay at the Delta Chelsea. However, I am now glad I ended up paying more for the Fairmont. 1. Location. This was literally across the street from Union Station and the Toronto Convention Center. CN tower was a short walk as well. The hotel is also connected to PATH. This is Toronto's underground shopping system. 2. Service. Everyone was nice and friendly. Every time I called, I would get...\"hello Dr.___, What can I do for you\" Daily maid service was ok. Other hotels I stayed at (i.e. Ritz) would tidy up the room as well. The maid only put things to the side. Overall, this is a very classy hotel and you get the service you paid for. 3. Presidential Club. * This is the biggest tip that I could give you about this hotel. Join the club prior to your visit. It is free to join and takes about 2 min to sign up. You get so many more benefits. It includes: free local calls, free daily high-speed interent, free newspaper, and best of all Fairmont Fit. This is when Adidas lets you borrow new work-out clothes and shoes during your stay. If you sign up while you are there, the benefits don't start till your next stay. 4. Room. I stayed in a Fairmont Queen (approx 250sf) on the 3rd floor. The room was a tad small, but comfortable. It is more of an elegant style. Things are a tad old (including T.v.). The bed was comfortable (not the best that I've stayed in) and the pillows were really soft. The shower head was great. I loved the water pressure. The closet was really small and had a safe right in the middle. I was at the very end of the hall so it was extremely quiet. 5. Price. I paid about $300 (including taxes). I didn't care about the price, because my work was paying for it. However, if I had to pay for it myself, I would consider it a tad high. I have never stayed at a Fairmont, but my thoughts is that it rivals the Ritz. For that price, I would think they would upgrade the amenities in their room. Hope this review helps. Once again, if you book, make sure to join the Presidents club.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alliston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some TLC...\u201d", "Author": "sillygirl99", "ReviewID": "UR7390107", "Content": "I absolutely love buildings with history and character and have always admired the Royal York.

Since we were there to party, we switched to a smoking room and it was obvious that the room just wasnt in as good shape. We were on the first floor, and the carpet and whole hall way just felt really dingy.

After my first few stays, I joined the President's Club - so I have the perspective of service both with and without this extra priviledge (which is free). I am quite young to be a business woman and find that I am sometimes not treated with as much respect as those that are a bit older... NOT here. Service is always top notch. I am always respectfully greeted with my name and a smile and all staff go out of their way to make my stay easy and enjoyable. Some examples: One evening I returned to the hotel while still eating an ice cream and the doorman on duty insisted on opening both doors for me (even though I'm not one to ask for such things and could have easily handled it myself). The conceirge desk is very knowledgeable and always has the answers to my questions (be it local attractions, driving directions, etc.) and is quick to provide maps, etc - always very accurate. I've forgotten to request parking passes (the self parking garage is a public one, but hotel guests receive a discounted rate with a parking validation slip), and even the employee working in the parking garage was understanding and friendly. I've had my luggage stored for me, and the process was quite pleasant. Right down to Hassan, the employee that always serves my breakfast in York Deli (Avenues level)... somehow I always get him... and service is always prompt and courteous and the food is always great, and it's nice to see a 'familiar face'. When walking the halls and encountering any housekeeping staff I am always greeted with a smile and a 'hello' or 'good morning'. I've called the switchboard to request information or be transferred to another room, and I am always greeted by name and dealt with in a very friendly manner. I'm not the neatest person and often throw things around while in a hurry in the morning - one evening I returned to see that the housekeeping staff had not only made my bed, they also neatly folded my PJs (I had probably left them in a ball on the bed)! I could go on! Simply said... GREAT SERVICE. Other things I love: Express checkout... especially television check out. With a few button pushes on my remote, I can review my bill (which has always been accurate) and checkout. By the time I gather my luggage and make it down to the lobby, my receipt is already waiting for me in their 'mailboxes'. SO HANDY and no waiting. The rooms themselves are great - the beds and pillows are very comfortable, the provided teas and coffees are great, and I love the bath robes. I also always make use of the irons and ironing boards, which have always been great. Yes, the rooms aren't all spacious, but the views are often spectacular and I never feel too 'tight'. My favourite room was a corner room I had on the 10th floor - amazing views - I'll attach some photos. Some of the furniture does show some wear - but it's always still functional and generally still very pleasing (a few scratches or nicks doesn't bother me!). Desks often have basic business supplies in them, which I find a nice touch (stapler, post its, etc). Now for the benefits of the Presidents Club: Firstly, it's free and easy.. I signed up online and was enrolled instantly. I haven't yet had enough stays to 'bump up' to gold or platinum level, but already the perks are great... especially the free highspeed internet access (just introduced as a perk, previously you only received a 25% discount). Also great is the dedicated check in desk, which speeds up the check in process. I hear that the rewards I'll receive once I've stayed enough times are wonderful... so I can't wait and will plan to use my rewards at another Fairmont hotel as a 'getaway'. Summarized, this is a hotel with charm - which shines through the most in its world class service. It also shows in architecture, furniture and room sizes.. so if you're looking for a generic large hotel room, this might not be for you.. but, I, for one, enjoy it a lot!

We had intended to stay in a standard king room but, when we arrived, there were no king beds available (except in suites) so we upgraded to a Signature Suite which, although more expensive, made the experience much more home-like because of the additional space. I have to say that, this little suite, while not opulent, rivals one other hotel-room I've stayed in as my favourite hotel accommodation ever. It's unusual, I find, to sleep well in a hotel one's first night, but I slept as well (or better) than in my own bed at home. Part of this was due to the usual luxury amenities like the pillow-top mattress, the down pillows and the plush Turkish bathrobes, but part of it was the nostalgic decor: cut crystal (or glass) dooknobs and light-fixtures, antique (or reproduction) furniture and damask wallpaper. Even the novel colour choice (blue and brown) reminded me more of staying in my late grandmother's house, rather than at a standard luxury hotel. I think I slept like a baby partly because I felt I wasn't a guest in a hotel, but rather a very welcome guest in someone's home. I found the staff very accommodating, helpful and cheerful in a refreshingly low-key and respectful way. I also really enjoyed their health club.

If you are planning to self-park, even if you're familiar with downtown Toronto as we are, make sure you know EXACTLY how to get to the parking garage which entitles you to the special rate (it's on the north side of Wellington but it is not at all well-signed) and make sure you don't do what we did: swipe our credit card rather than take the special ticket which entitles you to the special rate.

We have found what we ordered to be better than at the Beaver Club in the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth (Montr\u00c3\u00a9al), but not as good as at Wilfred's in the Fairmont Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Laurier (Ottawa), or at Edith Cavell in the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge. We visit Toronto frequently, and do not always stay at the Royal York, depending on the room rates at certain times. However, it is unquestionably one of the finest hotels in the city, and appeals especially to those who appreciate traditional elegance combined with modern amenities, and a convenient location.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel\u201d", "Author": "caz1979", "ReviewID": "UR3197888", "Content": "Myself and my mum stayed here in May 04. We transfered here for a 4 night stay after 2 nights in Niagara Falls. First impressions from the outside were 'what have we done'. The front of the hotel was almost hidden away amongst the office buildings with nothing much in sight. Once inside though it was a different story. I have never seen such grandure in my life. Check-in was very swift and the staff were extremely friendly. We asked for a smoking room so we weren't expecting the best room in the hotel. Not much of a view as we were in the west wing facing the rooms on the other side of the wing but the rooms were fantastic. The decor was very traditional but extremely cosy. Not the biggest rooms in the world but it felt like a home from home and I got just about the best nights sleep I've ever had. I didn't once hear any doors slamming and rarely encountered anyone in the corridors bar housekeeping. The hotel is situated above the Path system which was great for getting about and the CN Tower and harbour were within easy walking distance. With a picture of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on the wall of the lobby it made us think - if it's good enough for royalty, it's good enough for us!

It really is a legend in its own lifetime. Impressive building and spectacular lobby - a truly grand hotel. Service was efficient and was not slow in coming forward. The room on the seventh floor was large and luxurious, the bed massive. A magnificent view of the harbourfront. You would want to stay in a room like this wherever you visited. Location was excellent and a major plus. We stepped off the train and effectively into the hotel lobby... our easiest transfer of the entire holiday. (a word to for Via Rail... what efficient and quality service... we would certainly travel about Canada by train again) Transfer to the airport from the York is also good with the Airport shuttle picking up outside and a 30-40 minute ride to the airport. Staying with location, we have stayed at the Toronto Colony previously and found the York to be better placed for all the main attractions. There are many good restaurants nearby and Joe Badali (Italian) was excellent. Now the balance... yes the Royal York comes at a price. Yes, we also ate out as prices were hefty by comparison elsewhere and that included coffee/breakfast. Yes, some of the finishing around electric sockets in the bathroom suggests that the legend is ageing and needs freshening up. Yes, next time in Toronto we would first look for a more competitive price elsewhere but we would stay there again and we can say that we have stayed at the grandest hotel in Toronto.", "Date": "October 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhy waste your money?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2581007", "Content": "Yes the Royal York is very costly to stay, so I expected a good night sleep, warm room and all the goodies of a first class hotel.

The rooms were dated even for the old fashion look they were going for was tired. The doors are wood and at all hours of the night can hear them slam shut. The buffet breakfast is very over priced as well and is not far off from hospital food.

The room we were ushered to was dirty with dreadful decor, had a very uninspiring veiw of the rear of the hotel and, ok I have to admit if I put my cheek on the window and craned my neck I could see a third of the tower sticking out above the back of the hotel. I wasn't really happy. I complained at the front desk and was given a different room by a very indifferent receptionist, but found the new room not particularly nice. After 3 room changes I just accepted the best one and lived with it (I was on honeymoon after all and had other things to do!).
