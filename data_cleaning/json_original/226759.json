The hotel itself is a charming little oasis and the beach is a short 10 min. walk. The staff couldnt be any friendlier and were very helpful with any questions we had. The negatives; Our room was a little \"rustic\" with only a wall separating the bathroom so if youre uncomfotable with that, you might want to get a different room. As I said the rooms dont have any frills if thats important look elsewhere. The \"free breakfast was nothing more than bland pastries, toast, coffee and juices but you could order off the menu. We did not eat at the hotels restaraunt \"mayan bistro\" because had all a list of places we wanted to try before hand but the smells coming from the bistro were wonderful and I heard nothing but good things about the chef.

All the other trip advisor reviews on this place were accurate though. They have tried to think of everything here. They have a small table and two chairs for smokers outside each room in the hallway but non smokers have to walk by all of them to get to the exit. You get to meet all your neighbors though. The rooms look spacious because there are only half walls and no doors to the bathroom. Fine if you are an old married couple and used to your partners farts. Others mind find it uncomfortable. The key to the sliding glass entrance door and the room safe are tiny 4 sided affairs that are difficult to use sober and impossible when drunk. So stay sober here. Which is hard if you are on the all inclusive plan as dinner service is very slow but the included wine is excellent and free flowing. Food is excellent. Very good gym next door. Laundry service nearby. Internet is free but only one terminal in a hallway. Two pools but both are small and chilly. Check in staff speak english and are very knowlegable.

The room was clean and tidy, and was adequate in size although nothing special. The bathroom area was separated by a three-quarter height wall ratehr than being a separate room with door. I wouldn't call it a bargain but it was good value for money given the location.

The mattresses in the rooms are really bad, the shower leaks (no fan), the room door is in fact a patio door. We asked twice to have it changed.

The hotel is tiny/cozy. Our group stayed over 5 nights. It's clean and makes for a nice ambience for a group since you will pretty much be the entire hotel. We rented a car and they had parking, so that was great because we could get around (just don't rent budget). It's about a block from the main pedestrian street 5th ave. and for the most part is not too noisy. Although, if you get a room facing the hotel Reina Roja when they have events, you may not get too much sleep (you'll know which one I'm talking about). The other thing is one of the honeymoon suites, suite 1400 or 400 is on the ground level next to the unloading dock of the kitchen. Let's just say deliveries are early in the morning. The breakfast are some stale toasts, some sweet breads, coffee and juice from a box. For some extra $ you can order eggs etc. My impression is the chef is prouder than the quality of the food. So don't get too happy when you hear the free breakfast, the coffee is the best part. Lot of european crowd so smoking on premises. One thing that struck us badly was the fact that one night we were sitting near the pool and they began spraying for bug control right on top of us. This is extremely bad practice and management should warn the guests about this and make sure no one is inhaling the pesticides. There were never any notices about this and this would definitely be something that guests should hear about it before and after so they are not in the midst of it. I'm sure management can deal with this fairly quickly which is why we didn't lower our review. We heard the beach club Kool had a good breakfast but that is additional. We went in February and the pool is very cool and has limited sun. Free internet.

The attitude of the staff is what makes any hotel from the most modest to the most grand. Aventura Mexicana is not a grand hotel, but it is clean, comfortable and - given the location between 5th & 10th Avenue - pretty quiet. The staff, on the other hand, would grace any hotel. Nothing was too much trouble. Travelling with three children, could we possibly have adjoining rooms? Well, of course we could! Could they find us a small space to park the hire car? No problem! The rooms were perfectly serviceable and a very nice touch was the little basket of \"organic\" soaps and shampoos. I loath air conditioning and it was nice to be able to turn this off and rely on the ceiling fan instead. There was a fridge in the room which allowed us to have a little minibar all of our own at a low cost and the rooms we were in (2202 & 2203) were close enough to the reception to have wifi on tap. If I could improve one thing it would be to change out the sheets from poly cotton to cotton, but this is really a very minor point. The courtyard and little swimming pool is charming and gave us a nice spot to cool the children down after hot session on the beach.

It's a nice small hotel with a terrific location for enjoying the beach, Cozmel and the thriving commerical/resturant/shopping area. The rooms are clean and servicable, with bottled water included. There was plenty of hot water and the A/C worked very well. Our room had a window towards the street (we were on the 3rd floor), that was double-paned so no street noise came through. Our room had an open floor plan with a bath alcove. I would inquire about the layout of the larger rooms if planning on bringing children. The common areas are kept tidy and are attractive to sit or sun yourself. They had a pool for children and adults. I would not go for an all-inclusive package here because there are so many excellent resturants in the commercial area. The included breakfast -coffee, juice, bread/roll- was quite basic. The coffee was stellar, does anything much else matter? We needed a bigger breakfast so we could have a late lunch after snorkling so we also ordered eggs/fruit off the menu. They were moderately priced with portions to suit an American (another day we split a breakfast burrito) and quite good. We had dinner one night at the Cafe, seafood paella, which was what we expected. The menu has a good variety of items typical of the area, but as I said, many other resturants are really excellent so the small cafe has a lot of competition. For breakfast or a snack it's tops.

The pools are small but perfect for cooling off or laying by them and I rarely saw anyone in them. The beach was no more than a 5 minute walk and the water in the ocean was so warm! We used the Kool beach club because it was free and had no problems. The waiters walk around often asking if you want drinks but not overly annoying. The most annoying were the locals asking if you want a massage, but a firm no is all it takes and they move on. The hotel arranged an excursion to Coba and that was amazing and well done. We also had them arrange for a taxi when we left and it was there waiting for us 10 minutes early. Everyone was friendly and helpful.

Traditional Mexican colors, furniture and d\u00e9cor \u2026 lush gardens and pretty pools throughout \u2013 with a courtyard type feeling. We had an upstairs room at the end of the \u201cadult pool.\u201d It was pretty basic but very clean and perfectly comfortable for us. I did notice right away that that there isn\u2019t a door on the bathroom area so if this is a concern for you remember to ask for a room with a bathroom door (it was never a problem for us \u2013 but I want to point it out for others who might find this uncomfortable). The grounds were very clean and well kept as were the pool areas and all of the terrace areas. Again, just very charming and what I envision for a \u201cboutique Mexican hotel.\u201d The entire staff was very nice and accommodating. Rob is the onsite manager and he and his fianc\u00e9, Ann, were so good to us! We enjoyed visiting with them and they were able to answer questions about the area. They also turned us on to some local places to check out (Canibal Beach Club being our personal favorite). The front desk and restaurant/bar staff were wonderful as well. We chose the all inclusive plan and I\u2019m sooooo glad we did! The Mayan Bistro restaurant is very cute/quaint and the food was ALL AMAZING! The breakfasts, lunches, and dinners that we ate were all very good. My favorite turned out to be the last thing I tried which was the shrimp and steak skewers. Yum! The location was just perfect for us. Far enough away from the hustle and bustle ... yet close enough to walk to anything and everything we wanted to see. We never took a cab the entire trip (except to the airport which they were happy to arrange for us). It was about a one minute walk to the main downtown/5th street area, about a five minute walk to Kool Beach Club (which is very nice and one of the two complimentary beach clubs included with the hotel), and about a 15 minute walk to the ferry to Cozumel. Important to note: we also felt VERY safe at this hotel and in Playa in general. There was a very good mix of people staying there. I\u2019m sure they accommodate kids just fine although we left ours at home and we saw very few kids at the hotel. We met a lot of very nice people from all over the world. There were couples, groups of couples, single girls there for a birthday party \u2026 like I said a good mix so all should feel comfortable at this hotel. I could honestly go on and on ... we LOVED it so much we didn\u2019t want to leave and we will be booking again in March! I will be counting the days! Thank you Hotel Aventura Mexicana!

Its a typical small hotel you'd find in the heart of Playa and while quaint, it is not worth the $125 night we paid; certainly not by Canadian/American standards. I agree that the grounds were immaculate and the cleaning staff did a great job of the rooms every day. The front desk staff was helpful when req'd. The pools are tiny and better suited for children. We had a deluxe king room. The bed with its apparent \"new\" pillow tops were still quite firm and uncomfortable. The bathroom was not a private room but separated by a pony wall. Get used to flushing 2-3 times; the toilets never cleared on 1st flush. Hot water was sometimes only warm water. The free continental breakfasts were paltry but there if you want it. Try Celine's french bakery on 5th; amazing for Playa! The access to Kool Beach Club & free chairs meant you were relegated to the inferior lounge chairs at the back of the club. The comfortable loungers used up front cost 70 pesos/day but it is a nice club with a decent restaurant, friendly staff and acceptable washrooms (use the restaurant's washroom - much cleaner). The beach is not 50 meters away- its more like 3 blocks away. Be careful of the ironing board/irons offered; poor quality. Our iron leaked and was leaving sticky residue on our clothes. Generally a quiet hotel unless the hotel across the street has its roof top disco going late into the night but even with that it wasn't so bad. No comment on it's bistro; did not eat there. There wasn't much storage space in the room. Luggage had to remain on the floor. There was a small built in closet with a few hangers. The built in counter was mostly used up by the flat screen TV. Seeing as most visitors speak english, a better attempt at english programming would be welcomed. I don't go to Playa to watch TV but its nice to have while laying in bed or when we stayed indoors whilst it rained all day. The small fridge was handy but the coffee machine was scary looking; we didn't use it. There are great cafes all over the strip.

The location couldn't be better. There is a nice gym across the street and you get a discount if you are staying at the hotel. Beach club is two blocks and it is free for hotel guests. Food on all-inclusive plan is really great. A chef prepares the dishes individually and he really knows what he is doing. It is a bargain for 400 pesos per day (about $30 USD). You can't feed yourself and have drinks, even wine and liquor, in the town for that amount of money. No way! so do get the meal plan unless you are a serious foodie who wants to sample around town, which is understandable. The staff are so cordial and welcoming. I cannot speak highly enough of them, really a pleasure. Only one thing strikes me as a negative right now, and it is temporary, is that they are building a gym across the street and there is a jackhammer running from 9-5. This is not the hotel's fault (I didn't deduct points for it here) but I found it disturbing as I do like to sleep past 9 when I stay out late and this is impossible as the construction is literally outside the back of my room. Sleep is impossible even with earplugs. I hate to have to say that here and maybe it will stop tomorrow. I mentioned it to hotel staff just to ask how long it would be going on. They said thank you for understanding and that the construction company actually planned to start at 6 AM until the hotel objected. Are they crazy?? there are 10 hotels on the block!!

It's right up Calle 24 between Calle 10 and Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue) but at the northern end, so I took a taxi to the bus station when I had all my bags. There's a small parking lot for people who have rented cars and I saw the front desk staff actually tell people to move when they had no business being parked there. Jose at the front desk took care of me from the start, explaining all the rules and answering all my questions. The hotel itself is beautiful with two pools, one for adults and one for anyone. They have a open-air restaurant with the best food - Mexican, Italian, seafood, breakfast - and bar. The bar service varied a bit - some waiters did not seem interested in serving you, others were very attentive, but the drinks were always strong, and the price of both drinks and food was very reasonable for the excellent quality. If I ever return to Playa, I will be sure to eat here again. Continental breakfast was pretty good too, with different juices each day (mango, apple, pineapple) and whole wheat toast along with pastries. The room itself was sparklingly clean. The maid made different towel art every day which was a nice surprise upon returning to the hotel. I had a room that faced an exterior street, so there was a bit of street noise and it was actually a bit dark, but this was the only detraction. The bathroom was impeccable and my room happened to have some serious water pressure - you had no doubt all the sand and salt were washed away. They have organic lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and aftersun gel you can use. The a/c was so powerful that I ended up turning it off most nights or it would be too cold. There is also a ceiling fan you can use, and the flatscreen tv had something like a hundred channels, most in Spanish but some in English or French. The bed was somehow both firm and soft - I have slept on some VERY hard beds when in Asia and so to me this bed was quite comfortable, although Americans who may be used to softer mattresses may want to know that mattresses in Mexico are firmer than back home.

My room was too far away to receive it, but in the end having it in the lobby meant that I was able to ask the front desk staff questions as I did research about what to do in Playa. When you check in they give you a towel card which you can turn in to receive a free beach towel for the day, and you get back when you return the towel in the afternoon. They have passes for free beach chairs at Kool beach club - which is hipper, more crowded and busy, and has a staff that spends a lot of time (too much time) making sure you have everything you need; and also a beach pass for Indigo which is a little farther down the beach - it is much nicer with beach beds, more beautiful hotels, more upscale feel, and some very good food and drinks. The young men and women who worked at the front desk were very polite and helpful, one of them going to far as to take me to Tulum and Akumal beach on his day off so that I did not have to use public transportation, and also to the beach club Fusion where they have live music (salsa and belly dancing when we were there) while you have drinks right on the sand as the waves crash in. This was a very nice complement to my vacation and made it much more enjoyable. For sure I would return to this hotel if I come back to Playa and stay here. Truly a relaxing and beautiful place to come back to in the evening.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect small hotel in great location!\u201d", "Author": "candyGeorgia", "ReviewID": "UR121504336", "Content": "We just got back from an amazing 4 night stay in Playa for our 1st wedding anniversary. We had been in touch with the hotel through email asking lots of questions and they always replied quickly with lots of information. We were very pleased upon arrival, the room was much better than we expected, clean and nicely presented with beautiful towel art and flower petals on the bed! The hotel is in a perfect location just off 5th avenue, 2 blocks to the beach (5 min walk) and easy to walk to all the action on 5th avenue. They give you tickets to use the sun loungers at Kool beach club which was nice, and they also offer massages right on the beach reasonably priced (I think it was $40 for a 30 min massage) The only downside to that beach club was the loud techno music, but you soon got used to it, and there were times it got a bit quieter, it was never a problem but if you want to hear nothing but waves then you may want to find a quieter spot. The breakfast at the hotel was good, 2 different juices everyday, coffee, tea, pastries and toast. Then you can pay extra for cooked food, we tried the 'Divorced Eggs' they were really good. Also, the hotel has happy hour 4-7pm (2 for 1 drinks) They make THE BEST pina coladas! Staff were great, especially Luis. They booked a trip for us to Tulum and Xel-Ha (highly recommend both places) The hotel was quiet, never heard any noise in the night or anything, no bugs! Nice outdoor decor, has a cool jungle feel, pools are nice, landscaping makes you feel relaxed. Cannot fault anything and would definitely stay here again in the future, and it wa great for the price. I have stayed in places that cost more per night but were nowhere near as nice. A great find! Oh, just an afterthought, if you are a couple and havent been together long, dont get the king room! There is no bathroom door, just a little alcove with a curved wall, so unless you are confortable hearing each other 'take care of business' then get a different room haha! (I think the other rooms were regular hotel style - the king room has kind of a nice open villa feel to it!)

Organic bath products and a very large shower in this room. The location is great. Starbucks is down a few blocks, a cambio and pharmacy are just around the corner.

Chef Marco makes wonderful food, try the Mayan Bistro out...they have great Mar y Monte pasta. . I personally think the breakfast (coffee, fresh fruit juice, toast and Mexican pastries) is enough but my husband would always order the breakfast burrito...he loved it and I will agree that thing is really good.

Everyone treated my daughter special and we felt like family. This trip we had a late flight so we checked out, kept our luggage in the office, borrowed 3 towels and went to the beach.

I chose the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. My son and I stayed here 7 nights and then spent 3 nights at an all-inclusive for a wedding. The hotel is on a quiet street (24) just west of 5th Ave (restaurant entrance off 22). It's the section of 5th Ave that I find less tacky then the most southern end. The lobby is open and it leads to the family pool, yoga, pavilion, and a fountain. We stayed on this side. You pass through an open hallway to the adults only side and the restaurant. It's very lush and pretty. I could never get the wifi in the restaurant nor lobby to work on my ipad nor iphone, but my brother could on his laptop. (I got wireless at the other hotel and at many restaurants to pick up on my devices so I'm not sure what the deal there was). But they have a pc to use downstairs, so that worked out ok. For the most part, we liked the hotel. We used the passes to club kool, but it sounds like from other reviewers we had a choice of another club but I was never told of it. Club Kool has pounding techno and the free passes are for the 2nd class loungers if it matters to you. We didn't care as the passes were free. I just would have preferred a club without pounding music or at least a warning that it has techno blaring over the waves. They give you cards for breakfast and towels. You must turn in the cards at check out or you will be charged an assortment of fees. We decided to use them minimally. The rooms were quite spacious and they have a basket of toiletries in the bathroom and we always had a towel animal on our bad. The toiletries are organic and honey-based. I liked the aloe, but the shampoo and conditioner didn't really work (conditioner was very runny) so bring your own. We had a fridge which was great. We didn't really have a proper balcony, but could at least open the doors and step out. We found it amusing that they bother to have a family/ adults only side of the hotel when you can smoke all around the family pool and off these balconies. Multiple times I had to pull my son from the pool because guests would decide to sit by the pool and smoke or smoke on their balconies. How is the family side family-friendly? Luckily we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. I had great instances of customer service at the hotel: such as when the guest services manager helped us get a van and driver when our rental car delivery failed to happen to poor the next morning when the front desk kid (late teens/ early 20s) spent time on his cell phone and put off calling my aunt's hotel to warn her not to wait outside for us because the van secured was running over an hour late. When I asked for help again, he was quite sarcastic and told me he was making sure our price was right and seeing who we needed to pay. That had had been worked out the night before and he was not doing any of those things by playing on his phone. On my first night there I asked how to get to Rio Secreto and could I take a collectivo as I had heard you could. I was told it was too hard and I should just take a taxi. So I tried again the next morning before we left and I was told by another person it was too hard for me, there was not a stop, and then told they would call me a taxi. I declined and they looked at me like I was nuts. I told them I would hail one off the street after we walked around. In the end, I felt lied to. There was indeed a collectivo stop. I was pretty mad about this-I had indeed hailed a taxi and when we arrived I saw the stop. I found out from Rio and Secreto where the collectivos leave from in PDC. The hotel didn't even volunteer that information. So I did the collectivos the hard way: I took one coming back. I got across the street off the highway where there is no stop and flagged one down. But getting there in a collectivo would have been easy and the difference of 15 pesos a person or 130 pesos for a taxi. I started to think the hotel gets a kickback. They were just as unhelpful about Xcaret and after the first day I didn't trust their advice. I think they stared at me, decided the American was helpless or wouldn't like the local options, and didn't offer up any help. What I did like about this hotel is that it was not full of Americans--there was a mix of Americans, Mexicans, and Europeans. The guests I found to be friendly. The breakfast at first I liked the first morning. They offer pan dulces, toast, coffee, juices, and a selection of hot tea. However upon observation, we watched them just add water to the coffee from the day before and the breads became stale over the week (they were buying too much and keeping it until it was gone instead of getting fresh bread). The breakfast wasn't why I was there so I just got over it. My parents who had a neighboring room ordered breakfast there off the menu and they had a less than satisfying experience too. We purposely were staying at a moderate hotel and eating restaurants off 5th Ave and where locals eat. I've spent a lot of time time in Mexico including studying at a Mexican University on the west coast of Mexico. And I read wonderful reviews of the hotel here, but I didn't get it. The hotel is very nice, but the people at the front desk really seemed irritated and flat out lied to me about how to get to Rio Secreto. Since they sell tours, I think they possibly were mad we didn't book through them? The final issue was when my brother checked out for us. I was out SCUBA diving. They added to our room a charge for my parents (who had their own room separate from myself, my brother, and my son) in another room for transport between the airport and the hotel, except that my parents' transportation was already included in the cost of their room. My brother was the only addition for transportation. When I booked both rooms in February, I included the transportation costs to the room for my parents in theirs and my son and I in ours. I paid 50% deposits for both rooms. And the other 50% were charged on arrival. So the transportation for my parents should never have been charged to our room as it was already included in the original booking for their room. My brother didn't know this and he offered up his credit card and unfortunately he paid. I think this is a good hotel option as it has a good location and it is safe, however it really needs to look at their service/ attitude approach. And probably food safety.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cPersonable Employees\u201d", "Author": "awetravel", "ReviewID": "UR119310200", "Content": "This is my husband and my third trip to Aventura Mexicana in Playa del Carmen.

We fell in love with the Boutique style Hotels durring our last couple of trips, staying at La Tortuga and Cabanas Tulum 2 times, this time we decided to shop around. I happened upon this hotel and their VIP all inclusive plan and decided why not, I figured if we ate breakfast and a few dinners and had drinks after a day at the beach it would be worth it. Boy was it, we enjoyed the Mayan Bistro so much we ended up eating all but 3 meals there. Chef Marco has my vote for best chef in Playa. The Room: We booked a Honeymoon suite, it was large, well appointed, clean and the bed was comfortable. There were no problems with water pressure or temperature. There was only a minor issue with the A/C which was quickly rectified. The Grounds: The grounds are beautifully landscaped and well maintained Reservations: Andy was extremely helpfull and pleasant to work with, if you are not comfortable making online reservations email Andy. Guest Services: Everyone there was extremely helpfull. Maintenance: We only needed maintenance 1 time due to our A/C not staying on, they were there in a flash and recharged the unit in less then 1/2 hour, the room didn't even have a chance to get warm. The Wait Staff: Some nights Chef Marco was the one man show, tending bar, waiting tables and cooking. For breakfast Giavanni and Dora were awsom. Aldo the evening bar tender was also great. The Mayan Bistro staff is what made our trip so special. To sum it up, this hotel is a great budget deal with a great staff that makes it seem so much more personnal. It's the best of both worlds, The feel of a small boutique hotel with a great staff coupled with the money savings of an AI, and no buffets.

The hotel offers the European option which best suited me because as a non-drinker I could not justify the very high all inclusive fees on some properties that easily run into hundreds of dollars per day. The property itself is \u00a0well maintained, the room I was in was thoroughly cleaned. The grounds are well kept and the property has two small swimming pools that looked very clean. I liked the fact that there is a separate adults only pool and a children's pool and these are open 24 hours per day.My only gripe is with the rooms, \u00a0in that the room is like a \"prison cell\", the toilet is just behind a half-wall with that has no door. It was probably good I was on my own, I would have been very concerned \"hearing or smelling some one doing their \u00a0very \u00a0\" private business\" from less than a few yards from the main living area. I do not understand why the bathroom does not have a full wall and a door. Secondly the \u00a0hotel somehow appeared to be on auto-run..maybe the manager was on vacation when I was there. \u00a0For example, the Internet was down the whole time I was there and nobody seemed to be actually accountable and doing something. \u00a0I also requested to be booked one of the tours that the hotel promotes, the front desk guy could not get through to the company that \u00a0provides the tours but he did not even bother to inform me that he had been unsuccessful and I forced myself to wake up early in anticipation of this trip and ooh that is when he finally told me that he did not manage to make the reservation plus a few lame excuses... Good job! The option I chose included \"breakfast\". Well this breakfast is almost fake, a few pieces of toast, a croissant and a cookie. So lower your expectations about the breakfast or just opt for the no -breakfast option and \u00a0go to any of the good restaurants on 5 Ave. I requested a late check out since my flight was at 10pm in the evening and they managed to accommodate me to 1pm, which was kind of cool.\u00a0 The hotel is conveniently located close to the popular 5 Avenue. When it gets cooler in the evening this avenue is popular for it's restaurants, clubs or people watching. \u00a0 I checked out Coco Bongo and it was very popular with other tourists. \u00a0My only regret is the whole of Playa del Carmen looked just like any other US town, I did not feel like I was in Mexico at all, everything is American. Next time I will try to actually go to a Mexican town or just head down to Miami.

This is referred to as a boutique hotel but only when you compare it to the all inclusive monstrosities along the beach. It is a decent size property and is very peaceful with nice mature gardens. Making reservations was easy and the guy helping me, Andy was very informative. There were people at the hotel from all over the world. There are two smaller pools in the family side of the property and a sort of hot tub. On the adult size the pool was slightly larger than a home pool or one at a smaller hotel in the states. It was nice having adults only section. This hotel is one block from the beach and they give you free passes to two beach clubs one of which we really enjoyed-Cool Club. Adventura is right off 5th avenue but you hear no noise from that street or from 10th which our window overlooked. We were on the top floor having been upgraded since we stayed there so long-15 days. The room we had was large, stylish and the \"open\" bathroom did not bother us. The furnishings were nice. Mattress was firm but I slept well on it with no real complaints. The room had a microwave we used nightly for popcorn or heating up leftovers, plates and eating utensils, coffee maker, a mini frig where we kept all our refrescos and fruit, a large flat screen TV, and one of our big pluses unlimited drinking water from a large dispenser. The airconditioning worked well and we had WiFi in our room. Only issue with the room was that a couple of times the hot water was not very strong but if you waited five minutes it was perfect. I think it was just a high use time. The front office people and all the workers on the grounds were polite, nice, and helpful. I had read past posts about the breakfast being on the lean side in regards to what is offered. Most days I planted myself in the restaurant for about half and hour, watched the morning news or videos and had as much juice as I wanted, three or four cups of coffee and usually 3-4 pan dulces and sometimes toast. Couple of times had the regular breakfast you pay for which is very reasonable and good serving size. We met some people who were doing an all inclusive for I think $21/day each.

I'll start with the bad. The first thing we noticed when we got here was the bathroom is more like a cubicle. There's no door separating the bathroom from the main bed area. So I had to leave our room every time she had to poo. We eventually got use to it. The hotel is not a professional business, more like a very well maintained mom and pop hotel. They have a desk where sometimes a trip manager is present where they offer various types of activities and trips. All Hotels over charge for these and if you go to a street vendor you'll find a better deal. The water pressure for the shower constantly varies. I believe it's because of other people using the water at the same time and the more people using it, the weaker the pressure becomes. Then the less people using it, the stronger it becomes. The worst part of our stay was that we got charged for a bottle of water we never used. I tried to consult the person at the desk but he apparently wasn't high enough to make any decisions in regards to such matters. Our plain was leaving in 2 hours and the only way for me to check out was to pay. Then when we gave 50 pesos to pay for the 27 pesos it cost. They didn't have change for us. I was very upset and this is the reason I call it a mom and pop hotel. Any respectable hotel would have a register and not some kid with only pocket change for transactions. The time was 7:00 in the morning which is a very popular time for people to check out so I felt a person with some decision making power should of been there to handle our situation. Now the good Location, for the price the location is pretty top notch. Two blocks from the beach and right off of 5'th ave, which is a popular area for restaurants and stores. Very cool air conditioner...It kept our room very refreshing. Until the house keeping lady turns it up or off. If turned off it will take around two hours to cool off the room again. Well maintained...it was clean and didn't have the dirty quality cheap hotels give off where you're afraid to touch the sheets.

The pools were an nice change from the Kool beach club, which free passes for lounge chairs were given at the reception. Also at the reception was a Skype phone which they allowed us free 3 minute phone calls to the USA. There were also a library of books you could read and return.

Antonio, Luis and another kind gentleman that I am so sorry I can't remember his name, took time to get to know us and make us feel at home and comfortable. They went out of their way to help us in any way they could and were always friendly and accessible. Even though we had a balcony room facing the side street (24th), it was very quiet all day and night and close to the action on 5th. Just around the corner, is an amazing Italian restaurant. The hotel offered tours but didn't push anything on us. We took one trip to the Isle of Contoy and it was very beautiful and a nice day trip. The last thing, but very important to me was the wonderful shower and the fact that we always had a warm/hot shower. Some places we have stayed in Playa barely had warm water, but the Adventura Mexicana had wonderful warm water and good shower pressure every day.

I am not sure how old the place is but it feels very new. It is totally respectably clean, neat and modern. Our room had 2 queen beds, a small refrigerator, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, TV, nice towels, phone, clock radio and large bathroom with nice shower. There is internet access in the lobby but since we were on the first floor, we also got it in our room. The staff were FANTASTIC. The front desk helped me with my spanish. The breakfast staff in the restaurant were also very nice. Always acting like they were happy to serve you. The hotel has many nice statues, 2 pools. They can also arrange trips for you. We were surprised to get daily vouchers for use of the \"Kool Club\" beach area. This was nice but you cannot bring any other beverages (including water). You have to purchase everything from them. That being said, we had several drinks and ate lunch there several times and it only cost around $20.00 usd. The Kool Club has a very nice pool. Eventhough the Aventura Mexicana is not right on the beach, it is totally within walking distance and the area is very quiet. It is only 1/2 block from 5th avenue. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. If I wanted to find anything that wasn't good, I would say that the white tile floor in our room had some large gray stains. Looked like the tile needed to be cleaned with muriatic acid. It was not surface dirt, rather something deeper. If you stay here, you will be happy. I have stayed at many hotels in PDC and this is one of the best for a moderate price. You can find cheaper but you get what you pay for and of course, you can get many places more expensive but my question is \"why\"? Every person who stays in PDC gets to walk the same streets, hang on the same beaches. Don't pay a high price for nothing.

The Aventura provides towels and passes to the Kool beach club, a short 5 minute walk to the beach. The restaurant, the Mayan Bistro, has excellent food and daily food and drink specials.

I'm a picky sleeper and I slept pretty good in the bed. I like super soft mattresses, so I'm different than most. No matter where I sleep, I prefer a softer mattress. The mattresses at Aventura aren't the cheap, thin, hard ones that you see at the Super 8. Our room had a refrigerator only. I've seen some posts that said their bathrooms didn't have doors. Well, our bathroom did have a door. We also had a big closet and lots of drawers. The staff were very pleasant and attentive. You will know them very well by the time you leave.

We would like to have stayed around the hotel longer each day, but unfortunately, we set ourselves up for long sightseeing days. We would love to go back and spend more time at the hotel, since it was a very relaxing atmosphere. The location was absolutely perfect... one block off of 5th Ave. (where we had dinner each night and the food is awesome). Its about four blocks to the beach... just a nice walk.

We couldn't ask for anything better! The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. The pools are perfect for lounging/relaxing and visiting with other guests. We loved meeting new people and comparing vacation notes. The rooms are quaint and perfect for a nice getaway. We would sit outside every night on our patio and check emails and sip cocktails. The restaurant is amazing! I've never had such great breakfasts. The chef will cook whatever you want -- and believe me, I'm a picky eater. I had great massages (booked the day of) for $35 per hour.

We did have the \"no privacy\" bathrooms that we had heard about ahead of time. Not THAT big of an issue. If you need a little more privacy there is a bathroom in the walkway between the two pools that always seemed available. They have a computer you can use for free. I think they also have free wireless, at least I saw a lot of people using their laptops. The hotel has a variety of room styles. I think the rooms by the computer may have more of a sound issue as I was told my noise woke up one of the people in a nearby room. If I had one recommendation it would be to paint the area around the pool white. We would usually come back to the hotel around 2 or 3 and hang out by the pool and the brown area around the pool got pretty darned hot. That's it.

We stayed here for 5 nights, and were generally pleased with it. The hotel is short (5-10 min) walk from the beach, and you get free towels to use at the beach/pool. It's right off of 5th ave, but is pretty quiet. A few notes: -We had a room on the 3rd floor, with very high ceilings, a fridge, AC, and fan. Rooms on 2nd and 3rd floor overlook the pool. First floor rooms are right on the walkways and would probably be louder. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no door or partition to the bathroom. This wasn't a huge issue for us, but it was definitely weird; not sure why they don't hang a curtain or something. -The hotel gives vouchers for free plastic beach chairs at Club Kool, a short walk from the hotel. It has waiter service, so you can order food/drinks to your chair. It was pleasant in the mornings, but obnoxious techno music started around noon and got louder throughout the afternoon. We sat as far as possible from the speakers, which helped a bit. If you want a quiet, relaxing beach afternoon, you won't find it at Club Kool. -Helpful, friendly front desk staff for the most part. When we had an issue with no water in our room (this happened twice during our stay), the staff were extremely responsive and fixed the problem right away. One exception: the Sunday before we left, we asked the front desk person to confirm our airport shuttle arrangements because we would be out all day. He was unfriendly and acted as though this was a great inconvenience to him. When we got back that evening we found out that he never called the shuttle company or told any of his co-workers to follow up. That said, the night clerk was extremely helpful; he searched around until he found our travel info stuck in a desk drawer, and called the shuttle company on our behalf. -Breakfast staff at Mayan Bistro were friendly and attentive, though a little inconsistent (we requested milk for our coffee at least 3 times one day and eventually gave up). Free continental breakfast isn't much food; we ordered extra food off the menu every day. -Happy hour drinks were 2 for 1, and you can sip them lounging by the pool.

The a/c works well, the staff does a great job maintaining the grounds and the front desk is helpful. We used the mini-fridge for some snacks, sandwich stuff and cooling down drinks. The big difference in our stay this time was the noise level. We had room 110, a first floor room, and there was a speaker right outside our sliding glass door. The bartender cranked the music, and I had to go out and tell him to turn it down at 2 a.m- twice. Our first visit here just one year ago, we were up on the second floor (I think 203?) and it was much quieter, I didn't even hear music or people in the bar. Also the maids' closet is right next to 110 so you can hear them in the early morning starting their day, rolling out their carts, etc. Make sure you don't get rooms on the 1st floor is my only guidance. The beach is close by- a five minute walk- and while you get a free plastic chair at club Kool by staying at Aventura Mexicana, beware that the techno music gets louder and louder through the day. My husband and I ended up walking down the beach a short distance and renting chairs at Hotel Las Palapas for 200 pesos/person. You could put the 200 pesos towards food and drink- and the service was way better there than Kool. We easily used up the 200 pesos each on food (lunch) and beers so it was worth it- especially the quiet, friendly beach that suited us better. We sound like old farts- but we're in our mid 30's and just wanted to relax on the absolutely gorgeous beaches, not go clubbing on the beach.

Four bits of advice, should you choose to stay here: 1. Do not use the hotel transport! They quoted my husband and I one price and danced around the details of additional changes. In the end they tried to charge us $180 round trip! The bus is $2/per person each was. I almost need to laugh at this, because it\u2019s simply asinine! 2. Take much of what\u2019s advertised on the website with a grain of salt. The pools are tiny, the AC leaks, the free wi-fi only works in the restaurant and some other areas - NOT all the rooms and the shower hardly provides any water. In addition you must read the fine print that says, \u201cDiscounts to beach club and fitness center.\u201d Nothing is free here! The continental breakfast is a few pieces of white bread, coffee and ONE glass of juice (don\u2019t ask for a second). 3. Should anything happen to anything in your room \u2013 prepare to pay 10 times what it is worth. One of the cheap lamps in our room was not very sturdy and when my husband bumped it, it fell to the hard floor and broke. We are understanding people and yes, it was his accident so we were OK to pay, however we were charged $89 for the extremely cheap, low quality lamp, which I\u2019m pretty sure actually cost the hotel $10-$15. When we tried to reason with them on the cost of the lamp, they wouldn\u2019t even listen -- we were left feeling robbed! 4. Do not book any trips through the hotel. Thankfully my husband and I shopped around a little before booking a day trip to Chichen Itza. Our day trip, which was purchased by a travel company on 5th Ave., cost $45. The hotel offered the EXACT same trip for $69. Once again \u2013 trying to work their guests for every penny they can.

If you are travelling with young children the place might not be suitable as there is no Kids Club or things that you would except from a resort. The Hotel also has an Italian restaurant with great food for the price. The restaurant is an open area close to the pool which makes it really nice for breakfast and dinner... We also appreciate the advice of the Tour Guide that got us a car at a really nice price, ask him about scuba diving in Puerto Morelos, it was amazing!

From the moment we arrived until check out the staff were nothing but friendly, helpful and seemed to genuinely care that we were having a good stay. Whenever we needed to organise anything, whether it be a taxi, make calls to dive shops or planning accommodation in our next phase of the holiday, we simply asked at reception and they done all the work for us. The breakfast in the morning is simple but perfectly adequate to get you going and consisted of croissants and pastries, freshly squeezed juice and brewed coffee and toast. It was always served with a smile. This was served in the poolside restaurant so you have the choice of dining al fresco or indoors. In the evening the bar has a happy \"hour\" with 2 for 1 cocktails and beers. On two occasion's we decided to stay in the hotel and as a gesture of thanks the staff continued to serve us 2 for 1 for the ENTIRE evening. The grounds of the hotel are lovely with several different small pools varying in size and shape. There is a Jacuzzi and sun loungers around all the pool areas. Fresh beach towels are provided daily. The rooms are beautiful and spotlessly clean. There is daily maid service and linen change is optional. Great attention to detail is spent arranging the towels into swans and flowers to give the extra touch. Air con worked well and there is also overhead fans. I would most definitely stay in this hotel again, i thought it was excellent value for money. It is close enough to stroll to the restaurants and bars but far enough away so that you get a peaceful night sleep without the thud of the nightclub's on your doorstep.

We reserved a Deluxe King room using Expedia and when we arrived I was appalled. The room we were given was on the adult side of the hotel. The only door was a sliding glass door, which opened onto a tiny room with a king-sized bed, two soiled armchairs, fluorescent lighting overhead, and a bathroom with no door. I was prepared for the bathroom with no door (having read reviews here first), though I have to say the lack of privacy was worse than I expected. Not very romantic! But the smallness of the room, the terrible lighting and the dirty armchairs were surprising. We were told that we were in the largest room and that the best that they could do for us was one on the third floor of the property, which was smaller but at least had a better layout and more windows. We were also near a deck with some lounge chairs that were decent, though there are no private balconies on this side of the hotel. The pool on the adult side is decent, but there were kids in it all week (that 'adult' vs. 'family' division in the hotel didn't seem to apply for the week we were there). The food at the Mayan Bistro, for dinner anyway, is mediocre and very overpriced. We paid the same amount for a dinner there as we did for dinner down the block at Yaxche, which was a million times better--one of the best meals we had in Playa. The continental breakfast consisted of stale pastries, toast, coffee and juice. It was a bad breakfast, but you could order decent omelets for only $39 pesos. There was one computer available for checking your email next to the lobby, but it was almost always in use by someone else and it was in a dark, dank buggy corner where you were sure to be eaten alive. The rooms themselves were spotlessly clean but in the hotel area there was a weird smell of sewage that I found very unpleasant. The staff were fine but not overly friendly. The clientele for the week we were there were a mix of mostly European young people and families. The hotel has a good location, only half a block off of 5th Avenue, on the tail end of the International part of Quinta. It's also only a short walk to the Mamitas and Kool beach clubs. As I say, the rooms were really clean and we didn't see a single bug in the room all week. We got a filtered water dispenser and refrigerator for our second room, which was nice. But I didn't find the comparatively lower price of the room worth it. It's definitely a budget hotel, like an Econo Lodge in the US. However the pictures online seemed deceptive--the rooms, at least on the adult side, are small and depressing. People might have had better luck with the 'family' side, I do not know.

Since we wanted to prepare a few of our own meals, it also comes equipped with a small fridge, a microwave, coffee maker, water cooler and dishes and utensils for two. It also has a kingsize pillowtop bed, cable tv, safe and plenty of storage/closet space. The washroom has a spacious shower and we never ran out of hot water. The pressure does fluctuate a bit, but was never a real issue. The property has to sides to it. The family side is just beyond the reception area and has its own pool and lounge area. You pass through here to get to the adult side. Which also has its own pool (a little larger than the family side) and also a good sized lounge area. This is also where you will find the free continental breakfast area which is served by the Mayan Bistro. It includes, toast, coffee, juice and a variety of pastries. It is a great place to start your day in the shade of one of the many palms. If you would prefer a full breakfast, that is also available for a very reasonable price. We also enjoyed the club sandwiches and cheeseburgers for lunch. The burgers were especially delicious, great flavour and the meat seemed to actually melt in your mouth...if that's possible. The best meals that we had at the Bistro though were the dinners. Marco the Italian chef, definately knows his stuff. The presentation was very professional and we never had a bad meal. We especially enjoyed the chilles relleno (stuffed Poblano chiles) The prices were some of the lowest we paid while dining in the area and the ambience in the evening is very lush and relaxing.

He even agreed to distribute the toys that we brought down for some of the under priveledged kids in the area. We didn't get the chance to do it ourselves this time. Thanks for everything Luis!

Management mentioned they read these reviews for suggestions...perhaps consider replacing these chairs in the future, as they can detract from the overall asthetic of the room. The grounds of the hotel, as well as the pools, are well maintained. The floral plantings give a beautiful tropical feel to the property; colorful and cheerful. The on-site restaurant, Mayan Bistro offers continental breakfast daily (included in the cost of the room), serving coffee, orange juice, toast with various spreads and assorted pastries. Menu options are available for as little as $4 USD. The waitstaff were very helpful and pleasant! The restaurant is also open for lunch and dinner, and offers 2 for 1 drinks from 4 - 7 p.m., daily. Ask the bartender, Luis, to make one of his original beverage creations for you - you will not be disappointed. Several beach clubs are within walking distance of the hotel. We discovered Wicky's, on 10th, to be a good option for us 40-somethings. A wonderful, relaxed atmosphere. Beach loungers are free of charge, provided each guest satisfies a $100 peso charge for food and beverage (easy enough to do). Staff comes throughout the day, offering slices of fresh fruit and cold towels (free of charge). If we return to PdC, we would certainly consider staying at this property again. Thanks to Luis, the concierge, Luis, the bartender, and Maria and Alejandra at the Mayan Bistro for a terrific stay.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland", "Title": "\u201cThird Times still a CHARM!\u201d", "Author": "playasuzi", "ReviewID": "UR64279164", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed her for the 3rd time in a year.

She is so sweet, we feel like she is ours when we are there. :) The pool: Perfect. The water is crystal clear and warm. The pool is big, not like other pools I've seen in boutique hotels.

They also have new lounge chairs which were nice for hanging out by the pool. Last time we had been upgraded but the hotel seemed to be pretty busy so we had a standard room this time. I knew the walls of the bathroom didn't go up to the ceiling however I was pretty surprised to see there is no door on the bathrooms in these rooms. Makes for very little privacy but we made it work. The safe in the standard room was also different from the deluxe rooms. Our safe was small and plastic and had a key. I prefer the ones in the deluxe rooms that are very heavy steel and have to combo. The bed in this room was 100 times more comfortable than the last one... it was a different style bed frame and it had a sealy mattress top.

Any question I had or email I sent was immediately answered in a timely fashion, in a very professional manner. When we arrived, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They helped us to our spacious, very clean and pretty rooms. The rooms were not fancy, but they were clean and pretty. One warning is that the single king bed rooms were very nice, but the bathroom walls don't go all the way to the ceiling, so you can hear (and smell) everything that's going on. But the rooms with two beds had \"normal\" bathrooms. The hotel was very quiet and peaceful for being right off of the main drag- 5th Avenue. It truly felt like an oasis when we walked in after being out in the town or on a tour. Not only was it quiet with reference to the location, but it was also very quiet and peaceful at any time of the day. The pretty, peaceful gardens and pools are very nice, but the lounge chairs are limited. The beach is a five minute walk away, and the hotel has coupons for $1 off the chairs at Kool Beachclub, which our party took full advantage of for our relaxing times on the beach. The hotel's location was perfect for us. We enjoyed walking on 5th Avenue to find different places to eat and drink farther down the road, but there were many good shops and restarurants within a block of the hotel also. The hotel provided a continental breakfast, which consisted of a lot of bread and pasteries, and the main menu was available to order a wonderful fruit, yogurt and granola dish, or eggs in many yummy ways. The fish tacos at the hotel restaurant were some of the best we had the entire time in Playa! Everyone seemed to enjoy the food, and the servers got used to us and warmed up. They always gave great service! I love coffee, and I thought the coffee at the hotel was the best I had the entire trip! The staff treated us like family by the end of the week. They were so very accommodating and helpful and wonderful. The concierge, Luis couldn't have been more helpful with any directions, restaurant recommendations, and tours. He went above and beyond the call of duty to help me with hair appointments, pedicure appointments, and even finding a place to get my dress pressed. He was so wonderful, friendly, and helpful!

The pools, although small were adequate enough for a dip after the beach or sunbathing on the sundeck which we utilized after a day at the beach since there are tables and chairs as well as loungers. Our balcony was small so this area helps if you want to relax with a drink and a snack before getting ready for any evening out on the town. Our room (1301) was a deluxe king and had a view of the beautiful grounds. The room was of a decent size with the most comfy pillow top king bed. There was plenty of closet and shelf space for our clothing, cable TV with American shows, a microwave, mini fridge, water cooler, dishes, fork, spoons, knives, and a couple of chairs. It was spotless clean everyday. The bathroom is as everyone states, no real door in the toilet area so if you are modest this is not the place for you. After 28 years modestly flew out the window for us! We stayed on the adult side so I cannot say if the family rooms have doors. There is a room on the ground floor, adult side, room 1401 that has a bigger sitting area and a door to the bathroom. This used to be their Jr. Suite but is now considered a deluxe king and you must request this room at time of booking. If it's available you will get it. It's the only one so I would imagine you need to book well in advance to get it. There is a nice restaurant on the grounds of the hotel and they offer free continental breakfast of croissants and sweet buns, white and whole grain toast with a choice of butter and jams, coffee, juice and water. More than enough for us as we are not big breakfast eaters. There is a breakfast menu available and I saw some great looking omelettes being served. They also offer one free glass of wine during your stay which you can get during happy hour. The happy is very good as well with 2 for 1 drinks, very inexpensive, especially compared to NYC prices!

With the added bonus every night we ate at many extremely taste restaraunts on 5th Ave. On our first day we took the ferry over to Cozemel and hired a taxi driver to take us on a complete tour of the island. Stopping at a small restaraunt and ate an amazing seafood platter! The food was very fresh and tasty, along with the beautiful view of the ocean, the sound of the waves and friendly service! The second day we went to Xel Ha....not a tour guided one. Which for us was perfect, as we spent lots of time snorkling and swimming. Xel Ha is a wonderful natural water park with lots of things to do and see. Cliff jumping, rafting through the mangroves and down the river, hiking, lounging and a great buffet to eat at! Don't miss this place if you want lots of water fun, the snorkling is great, you'll love it. Day three we went to Xcaret, we orginally planned on not going here. Because we thought it would be alot like Xel Ha...It's not at all the same. It is beautiful lots of walking, parrots, flamigos, rivers to snorkle or raft, caves, tunnels, ruins, humourous Mexican cemetary, scenery and the most amazing evening show. Don't miss going here...make sure to wear comfortable shoes! Day four we went on \"Tulum and Beyond tour\" with Yucatrek tours! They are a fanastic tour group. First we went to Tulum and toured the ruins for 1 1/2 hours, then to \"Grand Cenote\" for a refreshing swim, then to a ocean beach to play in the waves while our tour guides made us a shore lunch, then we went swimming in another cenote before returning to our hotel. Great relaxing day!!! A fantastic tour with Yucatrek tours, would for sure do this tour again!! Day five we went on the \"Coba Mayan Encounter tour\" first we stopped at the Coba ruins for a couple hours, here we had the chance to climb to the top of the Yuctan Pennisulia's highest pyrimid! Wow, what a sight from the top. Then we went to a Mayan village and treked into the jungle a mile or more on very uneven rock terrain. Then rappelled 50 ft down into a cenote, the zip lined, had an autentic Mayan dinner. This was a Very exciting tour and I don't think I would have wanted to be much older to have done it! Not for the faint of heart or physically challenged, as far as I'm concerned! Day five was a horse back riding at Rancho Baaxal, we rode through the jungle and on the ocean beach. It was a good tour and the horse seemed to have been looked after quite well! After the horse back riding we went to Dolphin Discovery to swim with the Dolphins. We were quite disappointed that we actually only spend 30 or so minutes in the water with the Dolphins! And that when we went to buy the pictures, especailly of the \"Foot Push\" that they didn't sell that picture like all the rest. If we wanted the \"Foot Push\" picture we had to buy the c.d for another $50.00. I would advise anyone interested in swimming with the Dolphins to look else where. Each day we were picked up either at the hotel or very close by between 7 -8 in the morning and dropped off between 6 -7 at night. I can't say enough good about the Hotel, cleanliness and Wonderful staff! I would go back to the Hotel Aventura Mexicana ina \"Heart Beat\" , great location, fanastic Mayan Bistro cafe and wonderful massage staff also!!! Plus the added pleasure of english speaking staff, that arrange our tours, needs and transportation to and from the airport!! This was an absolute perfect hotel for us, thank you staff of the Mexicana for the wonderful time and memories of Playa Del Carman!!

The hotel has 2 small pools, as mentioned in previous reviews. We only used the adult pool, as it was close to our room, and the nicer of the 2 pools, in my opinion. Pools are open 24 hours, which is nice if you want a late swim. Wear your shoes around the pool chairs because of the small landscape rocks. Not sure why they have rocks there, but they are not bare feet friendly. There is a resturant and bar on site called the Mayan Bistro. I think the specialty is Italian. Basic continental breakfast is included with room, which was fine. Wo ordered breakfast from the menu once, and it was very good. We did not eat any other meals there, so I cannot comment on that.

All waitresses were super nice and tried to teach our kids Spanish - thanks Rosalia, Yolibeth, and Maria for making our vacation so nice! The pools are small, but big enough for a quick dip in the evening. With the Caribbean so close (less than 5 min walk to the best beach in Playa), who wants to sit next to the pool all day anyway? They are set in a pretty, lush, tropical garden. Also, you can pick up new beach towels at the reception every day, which you can take to the beach or excursions.

No problems with any part of the booking. Greyline was there at the airport and we were off to our hotel. A note on Greyline transfers. I had read a few negative things on them and since this was our first time using them, a bit curious as to how it would play out. The only problem we had was when they never showed up the next morning to arrange for our return shuttle. I wasn\u2019t losing sleep over it, but it did bother me a bit. Our hotel called them for us the day before we left so I could confirm the transportation and the gentleman was there 10 min early to pick us up! Check in at Aventura Mexicana was typical and quick. We needed to give them a cc for \u201cincidentals\u201d and sign a form that we were given a room key, breakfast card, and towel cards. Lose them and you have to pay. Again, typical and nothing shocking or out of the ordinary. We were taken to our room on what used to be the \u201cadult\u201d side. We had a corner room, 205, and it was much better than I expected. I booked the Deluxe King but just didn\u2019t realize it was a small \u201csuite\u201d. Patio doors opened to a small living area with TV, water jug, and microwave. Around the corner was the bathroom. It is true that the walls do not reach the ceiling, but there is a door on the bathroom so I don\u2019t quite understand the concern over lack of privacy. I thought it was a cute attempt at style and uniqueness. There was also a rather large size closet with hangers and shelves. The frig was located here. The room safe was also in the closet, it was electronic and a bit tricky to figure out the first time. There was a different routine to putting in a code compared to the ones we were used to. Off to the side was the king bedroom. They proudly advertise Sealy mattresses, which is true, but both my husband and I had bad neck and back problems after the 2nd night. Bathroom was only stocked with shampoo and soap. I was glad I brought a small bottle of conditioner with me. Lotion would have been a nice touch as well. There were also two robes in the room, love that, but no slippers. I like to have them because the tile floors can be quite slippery and cold. Oh well, no problem! Maid service was fine. We always had towel art on the bed \u2013 and those were the only two towels we were given. At Aventura, if you hang up your towels, they will not replace them. I know this is common with all hotels, but AM was the first one we\u2019ve stayed in that actually did not replace them unless you put them on the floor. Air conditioning worked great! The hotel has wifi - but it was spotty and not that great. I have an iphone and I was able to finally connect in the lobby and near the restaurant. But even then it wasn't guaranteed. They do have a computer for use just off of the lobby. The grounds were very lush and cute. Two small pools and what looked like a Jacuzzi of sorts. We used the pool on our side only and it was refreshing (not too cold or too warm). We enjoyed sitting in the chairs with Olivia, the cat. We thought it was odd that the chairs were on harsh gravel - made it hard to get to your chair bare foot after coming out of the pool. Did I say this before? \u2013 No problem! Our room was located on 10th Ave, but we never once had any issues with any kind of noise, traffic or otherwise. In fact, our room seemed very quiet and with the shades all closed, very dark. If someone was right outside of our room and talking, you could hear, but that was it. We took advantage of the included continental breakfast one morning and it\u2019s quite simple, but we expected that. We were given toast with toppings and there were sweet rolls. Nothing great, but it worked. Discount passes are included for Kool beach club, but it\u2019s not a big deal. It is only a $10 peso discount. After getting to the club and choosing our chairs, we were told the discount only applied to the plastic chairs in the back row. We were already comfortable and it wasn\u2019t worth moving. $70 peso each for the chairs. Kool had great pina coladas and the chicken nachos were some of the best. Great service and not too bad prices either. Location of the hotel is very good, yet for us it was a bit far north for our liking. We found ourselves heading to the calle 10 area or so. A nice walk, but it was HOT and sunny, making the walk a bit harder than one would think, especially for my hubby who doesn\u2019t take the heat as well as I do. We certainly have no complaints with Aventura Mexicana. I have a few observations (not complaints!): - Room could use a full length mirror for us girls that like to check our outfit before leaving the room - Conditioner and lotion might be a nice touch to the bathroom amenities - TV in the bedroom as compared to only in the living room - Get rid of the rocks under the pool loungers - Front desk was nice, but shy and not outgoing at all. We had to see \u201chola\u201d first or you wouldn\u2019t even be recognized when you walked past them.

There are supposedly eleven hotels which are better but we cannot see what they have to offer in preference to this hotel. Despite the flu scare, you should go to Mexico. There are few cases of flu in the Yucatan Peninsula. The Aventura Mexicana is one of the oldest high-quality hotels in Playa. It occupies a prime spot away from the sometimes trying end of Avenida 5, close to the beach and to the classy end of town. The building is stylish and well designed. It has a small pool, two sundecks, and every room is dual aspect with a large patio door facing the beautiful internal courtyard which is the hub of the hotel. Much time and money is expended maintaining the gardens which are in tip-top shape. There is also a restaurant which faces a side street but which isn\u2019t used very much even though it is does the best ceviche in Playa and cheap cocktails. Breakfast is served in the centre of the courtyard in the sun and the staff are amazingly friendly and genuine. The clientele is honey-moon couples and older people. We saw no children. Every day, the maids made up the rooms brilliantly. They specialise in towel sculptures. One day, we had bought a cloth elephant and found that the maid had produced an elephant sculpture out of towels to sit next to the Elephant! You get a fridge, safe, TV, wi-fi, a fan, a good bathroom in every room, as well as air conditioning. Breakfast was tasty with plenty of orange juice. You can also have a cooked breakfast for approx \u00a32 \u2013 but you do have to ask for the menu (otherwise you don\u2019t get it!). The staff speak good English and are welcoming, caring and genuine. They arranged a fishing trip for us and took care of taxis etc. The staff make the hotel what it is and I very much doubt the other 11 hotels can match this quality.

We never did see anyone using the adults pool during our 3 day stay? Third, the bar area in the family section by the massage area could be used as something more than just an empty space with no use at all to it. Maybe they could put it to better use?

At the time of our reservation, if you booked 3 or more nights you got 30% off. I'm surprised to hear of other people paying $140/night since we paid only $85 or so. The room was enormous, with a living/dining/kitchen area, a raised bedroom, and very large bathroom. As others have said, he bathroom walls were not to the ceiling so privacy was slightly eliminated, but it did come with a door and with the AC running, noises weren't easily heard. The room was immaculately maintained, and the chambermaids did a wonderful job keeping things clean (and preparing some hilarious towel animals). The grounds are quite lovely with two small pools and lush shrubbery. There are three sunbathing decks, but we only used them briefly as it was too much (we prefered going to the beach). The complimentary breakfasts at Mayan Bistro are very simple (literally orange juice, coffee, and bread). However, for only $2 you can get an omelette, too. Some days, it was worth it to splurge on the extra $2, but most days we just had toast then went to Kool Beach Club and had lunch there. The staff at the restaurant and front desk were always friendly. My partner took advantage of their spa and had a massage (for $30, I believe...maybe $35). He said it was decent. Our only problem with our room was the occasional noise. This junior suite is located next to the restaurants storage room so you can occasionally hear them working. In addition, there is a room upstairs and since all rooms have tile floors, we heard every chair being slid...particularly at night when those guests returned from shopping/dining. But, being city dwellers ourselves, this wasn't too much of an issue. If your'e sensitive to noise, Id recommend reserving a room on the third floor (since there is nobody above you). Our reservation was initially for 5 days (we planned on spending the final night in Cancun), but at the last minute we decided to stay one extra at Aventura Mexicana. Long story short, we're already talking about a return trip to Playa, and would definitely stay here again. The location was quiet (in terms of street noise) and was so close to great dining and shopping (and two great beach clubs).", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cRelaxed and very comfortable\u201d", "Author": "cgerard", "ReviewID": "UR25841856", "Content": "Was there anything not to like here?

The hotel is located at the northern end of P.D.C. closer to 10th Ave. and a 5-10 minute walk from the beach clubs. The staff was always friendly, smiling, and eager to help. Check in went fine, we arrived at 1:00 pm and was told our room would be ready at 3:00 (check in time) and it was. They held our luggage and we changed into our swim suits and had a cool beverage and cool dip in one of the pools. The pools are not heated so they are very refreshing. We were there with friends and there room was closer to the front of the hotel. While there room appeared to be a little nicer than ours, I don't really remember what I had booked so I'm not complaining and all you do is sleep in it anyways. The room itself was clean and well taken care of and that's what matters the most. Our room was on the 1st floor at the back part of the hotel. The entrance to the room was a doorwall to a courtyard. The room backed up to 10th Ave. and with the window backing to the road I feared traffic noise would be a problem but this was not the case. The bathroom was a little unusual in that it was a partitioned corner of the room with no ceiling or door. I am constantly reading reviews from people complaining about hard beds. Every hotel we have stayed in have hard beds so I assume this is the way it is in Mexico so I don't know what else to tell you. We ate two nights at the Mayan Bistro on site and the food was excellent and well priced. Service was a little iffy as the meals seemed to arrive at different times and they also seem to have a hard time doing 2 bills, 1 for each couple. The continental breakfast was typical but we ordered off the menu and the food again was excellent and well priced.

The hotel is set in a nice neighborhood and within a few minutes walk to the beach, restaurants, shopping etc. I also disagree with the fact that most of the staff didn't speak English well. First, you are in THEIR country so maybe learning a bit of their language would be a good thing and second, you only needed to speak slowly and clearly and they usually could figure out what you wanted. Food and other things like taxis, shopping etc are really inexpensive. We took the city bus everywhere, to Tulum, Xcaret and more. Its extremely clean, comfortable and a wonderful traveling experience. The people were genuinely glad to see you each day. We ate fresh fruit and veggies every day with no problems. Bottled water is plentiful and about 7 pesos a bottle which is around 50 cents US. Do not miss Xcaret it is soo worth it. The Mexican show at night is amazing and very well done. The \"plus\" ticket allows you to eat at any of about 4 huge open air buffets. The food was really good and the setting is just pristine and gorgeous. Its very easy to exchange US money into pesos in Playa Del Carmen. There are exchange places on every corner. They tell you on a sign how many pesos equal a dollar so no worries. Tulum is spectacular and well worth the trip. There is a great restaurant there also. If you wish to swim in the ocean at Tulum you should wear your suit as there is no where to change and people were pretty much just taking their clothes off in front of you. Playa is a very clean, safe, fun, and beautiful area. The hotel offered massages and I cant recommend them more highly!! It was one of the best massages I have ever had and only $35 US!!

Personnel: The personnel is friendly, especially those who work in the reception, are very service minded and helpful. Rooms: The rooms are clean and the room service is provided on a daily basis. Perfect air conditioning. Free Internet wireless access is also an advantage. A small refrigerator also available in the rooms. Our only disappointment with the room was the toilet, where there is no door, no privacy at all, and this applies for all rooms, as we could see from the glass main doors. Sometimes I used the toilet by the pool area for some privacy. Another thing is, the main room doors are very big sliding aluminum frame/glass doors with curtains and you have to close the curtains very well for privacy from people walking the balconies or the corridors. It takes a couple of days to get used to this unusual setup. Hotel's Restaurant: Somebody has to take care of few things in the restaurant. a) Opening Hour for breakfast is 08 in the morning. That's not good if you have to leave earlier for a tour. Most of the days we had to have our breakfast in nearby restaurants just because we had to leave hotel at 7:45 b) Only one or two persons speak English in the restaurant, and it is those 2 guys that make things work. The days where those guys were not there it was challenging, to put it mildly. However, you can have Coffee, orange juice, toast bread,croissant for free, and you can order omelets for around 30 pesos. Generally the prices in the restaurant were good, but do not expect anything fancy. So we decided to have our dinners to other restaurants.

There's no way to reserve a balcony room on their website as far as I can tell, so I would recommend asking when you get there if that's your thing. I asked a guy at the front desk to recommend his favorite restaurant in PDC; he directed us to El Nativo on 30th Ave. just off Constituyentes. It was excellent, and the fresh juice we had there was well worth the short jaunt off of 5th Ave. The location of the hotel is great, just a few blocks from the water and in a quieter part of the town. We would consider staying there again. We only had two problems: one was tiny ants in our bathroom. I told the people at reception but nothing ever happened. The other issue were very loud, drunk American guys that stumbled into the hotel at 3 and 4 am on two different nights. They woke us up, but nobody from the hotel seemed to care or do anything about it. I was happy when they left and slept peacefully the other nights.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Week\u201d", "Author": "Calikidsgramma", "ReviewID": "UR23868139", "Content": "We have just come back from an absolutely wonderful stay from Jan 15 through 22 at this friendly hotel and we couldn't ask for anybetter service or any better \"anything\" Everything in this small hotel was very clean, and the constant maintance we observed kept it that way.

First, we checked in at night - which for some reason I'm not big on - you just don't see things the same at night as you do at daytime...at least I don't. The doors to the rooms are all sliding glass doors - not typical hotel doors, and they use actual keys - not keycards! The A/C in the room was cranked way up - go to Playa and you'll understand why. The room we were in has a concrete (?) floor - again, lots of sand in the area so carpet is impractical. The bed was extremely comfortable - I had a great night's sleep every day we were there. Facilities in the room were all fine and up to par. TVs in the rooms are OK - not huge, but a fairly extensive selection of channels, both in English and Spanish. But if you're going to Playa Del Carmen to watch TV - you really should rethink your priorities. The breakfast is a bit sparse, but it worked for us. There is lots to eat in Playa, so I didn't want to fill up every morning. A roll, coffee and OJ got my day started just fine every day. All the staff were exceedingly nice - they took care of everything we asked for, and let's just say you'll be impressed by their towel folding ability! It's located in a nice part of the strip - away from the real busy parts so the area is quiet at night. Plenty to eat and plenty close to the beach - just a few short blocks away. The on-site massage folks got high recommendations from some folks in our group - we didn't have enough time to grab one, but if we go back we will for sure. The pools aren't much to talk about - they're almost more decoration than functional. I did see some folks in them - but seriously - just go down to the beach and get some Caribbean Sea action instead of a hotel pool. One other potential drawback - no elevators. If you're on the ground floor, not a big deal. But it's a three story building, so if you're not game to take the stairs, ask for a ground floor room. Now here is the kicker -- I'm a total night owl, and I would often find myself outside on the second or third floor patio having a cigar. After midnight the front door of the hotel is locked, and you need to ring a bell to get in if the clerk isn't there. Well guess where the bell is - tucked up on the wall around the second and third floor patios. I'd usually nod off only to be awaken by the doorbell, which in reality sounds a bit more like a fire alarm. Not a problem if you're in your room, but a rude awakening to a nap in the warm evening air. But with that being said - I highly recommend this place! Great value, solid location, and an incredibly friendly staff that we got to know by name.

The hotel is an attractive building located around an open, palm filled courtyard and was spotlessly clean everywhere. Front Desk staff were friendly and courteous at all times as were all the employees we encountered. It's one block off the northern end of 5th Ave. Our room was spacious and kept very clean by Lupita. Sheets and towels were changed daily and the bathroom was fully supplied with soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. There was also a small refrigerator, coffee machine, fresh water dispenser, safe deposit box and TV in the room. The bed was a king size and, while quite firm, was also very comfortable and we slept well. Other than the fact that the semi-private bathroom (wall does not reach to ceiling) is not ideal, everything else about the room was fine. Despite being just off 5th Ave the hotel is very quiet and peaceful and the courtyard is an oasis of tranquility, especially at night when the lit torches and pool lighting give it a wonderful ambiance. Continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the Mayan Bistro, is good and you can pay an extra $5 for a cooked breakfast or visit one of the many restaurants serving breakfast within a few minutes walk. We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks nightly at the Mayan Bistro bar where we received very friendly service from Angel and Jolie and also had an excellent dinner on our last night. The hotel recommends Kool Beach Club which is just a few blocks away. The hotel supplies towels and you pay $7 per person for the wooden loungers at Kool. There are also cheaper and more expensive options. Our average bill at Kool, where we usually spent 4 to 5 hours on several days, came to about $40-45 USD, which we thought was great value. This included lunch for two, 4 or 5 beers, bottled water, lounger charge and tip . Food was very good (try the fish and shrimp tacos), beers were cold and service was fast and friendly. The sand is total powder and stays cool no matter how high the temperature.

The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and nice. Although I booked a reservation via Yahoo travel, the standard room was a good one. It was pleasing to find a 20-liter water dispensing system as well as a microwave and an unstocked refrigerator in the room. Some reviewers have complained about there being no door to the bathroom area in the rooms. Technically, that is true, but it will not really be an issue with most people. Our reservation talked about a room with a \u201cbalcony.\u201d What we found upon arrival that our balcony was really the open corridor to the room, which overlooked the pool and courtyard area. In the hallway corridor there was a small table attached to the wall and two chairs. My wife and I frequently used this table for our lunches and for having tea in the evening and found that the arrangement worked pretty well. Previous reviews noted that the hotel had a cat named Olivia. Even though I am a dog person, I found her to be a rather endearing animal with protruding teeth. She was an aggressive beggar that sometimes left me wondering if she was a dog trapped inside of a cat\u2019s body. She seems to eat everything but marmalade. The pool area and lovely grounds were very well kept. On several occasions when we thought about maybe trying the pool, we noticed that a fair amount of plant debris had fallen into the pool. The pool was rarely used by people, but added to the ambience of the hotel. Other reviewers have noted that the hotel is only a few blocks from Mamita beach. Actually, the walk is more like 6 blocks, but it just seems like a lot less because much of the inviting walk is in or near the pedestrian zone, 5th Avenue, with its inviting restaurants and lively ambience. One can rent chairs at the beach at calle 28 or one can simply go south a little ways and there are free umbrellas where one can just sit on the soft sand and let the world go by. There is a huge supermarket, Mega, about a half dozen blocks from the hotel. We bought bread, fruits, cheese, sliced meat and other goodies for our lunches there. Mega likes to compare its prices to the nearby Wal-Mart and claims its prices are lower. Surprisingly, many vendors on the streets were also making the claim that their prices were lower than Wal-Mart. Restaurants for tight budget people. The Mayan bistro at Aventura Mexicana offered specials for only $5 and \u201ctwo for one\u201d drinks all day long, which turned out to be a decent meal and drinks at a bargain price. Unfortunately, in our 10-day stay, the specials only changed once so that limited the number of times we ate there. At the front desk, if one asks for a map, there is a coupon in the pamphlet for a free dessert at the Mayan bistro. The dessert is enough for two people and very nicely done. Although the restaurant lists special prices for 60 pesos or $5, if one pays in dollars, the price can become $6. The restaurant seems to follow the traditional exchange rate of only 10 pesos per dollar, which is typically found all over the streets. There are money exchange places all over Playa on 5th Avenue where they pay the real exchange rate of about 12 pesos per dollar. Consequently, while one can pay in dollars in most places, it is almost always best to pay in pesos to avoid the extra cost.. On 5th Avenue, as one goes north, there tend to be slightly cheaper restaurant prices than if one goes south. At La Fe, we found a \u201ccatch of the day\u201d meal for only 65 pesos (about $5.50). The first time we ate there, the fish was excellent. Several days later, we went back for the same dish. My wife got the same excellent fish, while my piece was a lot less tasty and barely chewable, much to my dismay. La Fe has limited tables on the inside that resembles a campus beer bar in the U.S. The outside tables on the street are much better, but oftentimes there are no free tables and cigar smokers tended to congregate there during our stay. Many people mention Babes Noodles as a good place for dining. There are actually two of these restaurants in Playa. If one goes north on 5th Avenue from AM, the closest one is found. Babes looks inexpensive, but really is not. While I thought the food there was very good, my wife was less happy with her dinner. The 1847 restaurant right next door has more bargain dinners, and we both found the food to be pretty good. One place to maybe avoid is Aca Los or something like that near Constitution Avenue on the main drag. Their prices looked low, but the portions were so extremely small that one had to order more and more dishes to fill up and even then we went away a little hungry. Other Things. We took the ferry to Cozumel to spend a day there. Contrary to a lot of published items, the ferry did not run about every hour, but sometimes there were 3 hours between departures. We had hoped to walk around town and maybe swim on Cozumel beaches. We found the town to have none of the liveliness and ambience of Playa and quickly got tired of walking around the city. Also, there are no beaches within walking distance of the ferry dock. Ferry prices were recently increased to about $12, so round trip tickets for 2 totals about $48. Consequently, the trip for us was a bust and not worth the effort. If one is really into snorkeling (and one has to go outside of town and make arrangements for this) or diving, then Cozumel potentially has something to offer. X-caret, Tulum and Chichen Itza. We bought tickets on-line for X-caret beforehand supposedly saving 10%. But when buying the tickets on-line, a tax of about 10% gets added back on so it is dubious if buying in advance that way is worth it since it did not look like people buying at the window paid such a tax. I noticed that most people bought the \u201cplus\u201d package which really is not necessary. One gets snorkeling gear as part of the package, but snorkeling in the underground rivers seemed kind of silly given there is no coral or anything to look at in the river or even at the special snorkeling place as far as I could tell. I was advised that one could not bring one\u2019s own food into the park, but no one checks bags and no one seemed to object to us eating our own food in the park. We got to the park using collectivo vans that leave from calle 2 in Playa and then taking the free shuttle bus to the park from the highway. When leaving at closing time, the shuttle bus did not come after waiting a long time so we took the ADO bus back to Playa even though it was a few bucks more that way. The ADO bus is the \u201cCancun\u201d bus that also stops in Playa and there is only one bus at 8:45 pm. We also used the collectivo van to get to Tulum to see the ruins. One has to get off at the Arqueologica Zona before reaching Tulum itself and then walk a few blocks to get a \u201ctrain\u201d to the site or to walk another half mile to the entrance. On the trip to Chichen Itza, our bus guide promoted the buying of a pendant (\u201ccartouche\u201d) where one could have one\u2019s initials/name in Mayan symbols made into a piece of jewelry (silver or silver with gold). The jewelry samples that were passed out showed good craftsmanship. My wife ordered such jewelry and found that her finished piece that was available at the end of the day was a cheap, gaudy imitation of what the sample pieces were, probably just silver plated. Fortunately, one did not have to pay in advance, and she refused to buy the piece even though most other people accepted their pieces. The price for the pendent in pesos was equivalent of $44 (based on a 12 to 1 exchange). If one had paid in dollars, the cost was $58, which again, underlined the need to pay for things in pesos.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201c3rd times a charm!\u201d", "Author": "IAH", "ReviewID": "UR21822234", "Content": "This was my 3rd stay at AM, my Mom's first stay and first time in Playa!

We booked the hotel because of the great reviews and the price. Having been to Playa twice before I knew the location well however I was surprised by the how far the restaurants and activity have moved north on 5th Ave to the area of this hotel. When I was here the year before, this part of 5th Ave was very quite, with almost no restaurants and shops. Now, however, in this area of 5th ave there are many restaurant and shops that have opened. I actually prefer it to the southern part of 5th as it is more laid back, and further south it is getting to be very fast moving with people trying to get you to thier shop or restaurant and people shopping hurrying etc. This makes the Aventura Mex 's location excellent as it is also closer to the best part of the beach. The hotel itself is very clean and the service is good. The breakfast is only toast and muffins but you could buy eggs, waffles etc for only $3 more. THe pools are small but in this catergory of hotel in Playa, that is not a resort, it is about on par with other boutique hotels. (We have stayed at the La Tourtuga hotel a botique hotel, as well as the Royal Playa Del Carmen the big all inclusive resort downtown so we have a feel for the range of accomadations in Playa.) The grounds are pleasant and inviting. We stayed on the family side of the hotel and the beds are hard but not unbearable. The room was spotless and cleaned every day with the the decor and furnisinging slightly above average. However, given the reasonable price less than $100 a day we paid, it was an excellent stay and a very good chioce for a hotel in Playa. I would not hesitate to recomend to anyone if that can get it close to the price we paid.

The rooms are spacious and well decorated. The beds are firm, but I prefer them that way. The pools are just the right size for the hotel and the \"kids\" and \"adult\" pools are separated; although there was an occasion or two where there was screaming kids in the adult pool that was not addressed by management. The breakfast was very nice and the happy hour drinks and food were good, however the dinner was EXCELLENT! I couldn't believe how empty the restaurant was with such good food? I think people just didn't know? I do suggest you purchase the optional dinner with your reservation...you can't beat the price or quality for dinner in Playa. The hotel is on Calle 24 and 5th, as you walk down 5th towards Calle 10 it gets much busier and noisier. The location of this hotel is perfect! There are many great other restaurants as well...be prepared to pay about $50 per couple for dinner and a drinks. Yaxche has great Mayan food and an amazing back patio...a must. Our best meal was at 100% natural (not just vegetarian food)...the poblano chicken was amazing and fish was great too! Non-smokers beware...Playa has many Europeans that don't mind smoking and sharing that smoke with you while walking, dining, relaxing etc. Good luck trying to enjoy a meal without having smoke blown your way. There are also many massages available for $32-$35 all over Playa. We had ours at the one next to 100%Natual...it was great! Take the ADO bus from the airport to Playa $8 (purchase ticket in the baggage claim area at airport. You can catch a cab from the bus station to the hotel for only $2 (not worth hauling your luggage yourself). We were a little disappointed with Cozumel. It felt empty and run down, many stores were closed down. We also booked a snorkeling trip there...2 reef dives...turned out to be 200 feet off 2 beaches with very little corel and a few fish...not so great. We recommend you save your money by spending your time in Playa. Kool Beach club was very nice (discount available from hotel). If you get there \"early\" (10:00 or earlier) you can get the covered lounge chairs for $3 per person. They sell out after that and you will pay $7 per person for a nicer covered padded lounge chair. Both are great values. Food and drink are good and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this hotel and playa.

We were on the second floor with a balcony overlooking the \"kiddie pool\" and noise wasnt an issue at all even tho there seemed to be several families with children of all ages. The room is basic but very comfortable and very clean. Kept cool by a ceiling fan,A/C and a sliding glass screened door leading to the small balcony w/ 2 chairs. Your standard TV with a few English channels and several Spanish speaking channels with good reception. Hair dryer,soap,shampoo and fresh towels daily with the adorable towel animals adorned with fresh flowers left on you bed. So cute you feel kinda bad taking them apart to shower. Tile floors and a very large tile bathroom. All in perfect condition and kept sparkling clean. The grounds of the hotel are lush and green and have hidden art and statues if you take the time to explore. The restuarant are also both very good. The free breakfast at the Mayan Bistro of coffee or assorted teas and orange juice along with an assortment of pastries and toast and jam was good and plenty to start off all of our days except for 1 when we ordered a hot meal from them menu that was very tasty and inexpensive. We also had a late lunch here of a fish fillet which was very good and again reasonably priced. The sushi restaurant also located on their grounds offered up some mighty fine noodle soup. The staff were all kind and helpful. One employee who was often at the front desk whos name I cant remember (but really wish I did so I could put in a good word for him) actually ran down the street and around the corner in the middle of a pouring rainstorm on the day of our check out to hail us a cab to the bus station as the phone lines were all busy.

The hotel location is 1/2 block to the quiter end of 5th ave and the beach is about a 3 minute walk. The hotel felt very safe and has 24 hour desk staff and night time security guards just in case.

It is overall a nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay. We booked through the hotel website. They had a good rate of about $78 a day for a room with two beds (we have two little children with us) on their website, but even a better rate if you stay 5 nights or longer (25% discount). It would cheaper to book for 5 nights (and stay 4) then it was to book 4 nights. However, since the difference was not too much, and I wanted to avoid confusion, I simply booked 4 nights and paid the 50% deposit. A couple of weeks later, I found out through the website that they had a better deal, so now a 3 night stay would be entitled for a 25% discount. I called the toll free number and was able to have my rate discounted 25%. That was awesome! The check in was simple. No bell boys, you carry your bags, although the reception gave us a hand - we had to climb some stairs. The room was decent, had two beds, the AC was working, there was a mini fridge (don't set the temperature too low, we had our yogurt frozen). We were on the family side of the hotel. You can reach the adult side through their restaurant, the Mayan Bistro. I've heard that the rooms at the adult side were way better, but we had kids, so we got to stick with our rooms. At any rate, the hotel grounds were beautiful and well maintained. They have several pools and spas. They have a limited amount of parking spaces but we were always able to find parking. They have a free computer with internet in the lobby. The maid cleaned our room well, did the nice towel art sculptures but some days forgot to bring us the extra towels for the kids. Breakfast was in the Mayan Bistro. Continental breakfast is included and it's decent. You can help yourself with toast (white and wheat bread), several types of pastries (mostly croissants), coffee, cream, orange juice, butter, jam. You can also order hot food from 35 pesos to 50 pesos (note: the hotel website offers you to buy full breakfast for an additional 50 pesos pp per day - I recommend you to skip it, you can always buy it on the day if you wish). The location is one of the best things of the hotel. It is located North of the Constituyentes in an area named Little Italy, very close to fifth avenue. The area is nice, is a bit cheaper (slices of pizza costs 13 pesos, as opposed to 20 pesos on the other side of Constituyentes), less crowded but not less vibrant. There is a Ciao Gelato, a babe noddles, and even a little gem of a libanese restaurant beside babe noddles. You are also 2 blocks from Ah Cacao, some of the best desserts in PDC. Constituyentes is a major road that links fifth avenue to the freeway, but has less traffic than its sibling in the south, Juarez. I also found that parking is easier in this area. It is also close to some of the best stretch of beach in Playa where two of the best beach clubs are located: Kool and Mamitas. We have little children, so we don't need to be right on the action, just close, and that's where we were. Service is good. Maid cleaned the room pretty well, however, we wished she hasn't forgotten the towels for the kids. Also one day the AC broke down. We notified the reception, she went to check the AC, called the technician. By the time we were back from dinner, the AC was functional again. My only quibble, in addition to the missing towels for the kids, was that the room feels a little bit in need for a renovation. There were some cracked and stained tiles, and the shower curtain would not block the water from flooding the bathroom floor. Some reviews seem to point that the rooms on the adult side are way better. I believe so. However, because of the hotel was such a bargain, I thought it was an excellent value.

My husband and I stayed on the \"adult side\" of the hotel which was free of any loud playing kids. The grounds of the Hotel has a \"garden setting\" atmosphere which is nice to enjoy, sit and relax. There is an upper lounge balcony which can be used to take the sun, enjoy a drink, or just sit and relax. There is always nice Mexican style music playing on the Hotel's outside sound system. The staff is helpful and friendly. Compared to similar Hotels is the area, the price of this Hotel was very affordable and offers discount specials which makes this a great find for the money (we paid $65 USD per nite with 1 nite free booking directly on the Hotel's website). All guests were of a mature age group (no young spring breakers).

Over the years and probably 12 visits later I've moved up the quality scale and I could not be happier with this hotel. Many of the places I've stayed over the years are gone but I know the price range for different levels and this one is about right. I was a bit anxious about being billed the full rental in advance but it all alleviated as soon as my partner and I walked into the place. By the way, this place is not gay but noticeably gay friendly. It is family oriented on one side but the environment was safe and quiet. The front desk clerk is very cute...lol. Anyway, the best thing about this hotel aside from the nice clean room and firm bed is the wireless network. So if you travel with a laptop, this place is great. I write this review sitting on my bed facing the swimming pool in my really cold air conditioned room. The network is fast enough that I download my daily fix of iTunes newscasts ON VIDEO! Nice broadband speed. I was even able to use Skype every day to make phone calls from the comfort of our room. The connection was not perfect for phone calls but good enough that I was able to transact business back home via audio connection. The cute front desk clerk was very clear when we checked in that the Internet wireless connection was not stable but in our 5 day stay we never experienced down time. The wireless connection always worked. However, cute guy said it depends on the room location. Seems the hub is in the restaurant in the adult section and since our room was close, we lucked out. Worst case, you just sit in the lovely patio and get online. There is another wireless network in the reception area. Make sure you get the WEP security password when you check in. What else to say? I got certified for Open Water Diving with the training taking place right outside my room in the pool. The training was by the guys at Diversity Diving which has a shop next door. Despite it's name, it is also NOT GAY owned (I guess at least). By the master divers were friendly and didn't seem to be uncomfortable with my partner and I. This is an added plus to this hotel if you want to get certified to scuba dive. Location is great. Far enough from the busiest part of the main drag but still in the center of activity. Actually it seems that the hippest part of Playa has moved in this direction. I found all the staff helpful except for a wake up call that never happened. I almost missed my dive! But they successfully relayed messages between my partner and I or our dive instructors. When you come to Mexico, remember that tipping is customary. Tip everyone and your experience will be much happier. I get the impression that people who don't have positive things to say about this place are probably difficult, unpleasant people themselves. Anyway, my partner and I check out tomorrow morning but I think I will be back before the end of the year and I will be rebooking here at Aventura Mexicana. It's not high luxury but as luxurious and comfortable as I need or want. If you want the diamond treatment, go stay at some all inclusive resort. But for my buck, this place is perfect. Thank you to the staff for making it a great experience.

This was our third trip to the Riviera Maya. Previously we have stayed in two different all-inclusives, so this was our first time trying a hotel that was NOT all-inclusive. Our experience couldn't have been nicer. We had a room with a king-sized bed on the \"family side\" of the hotel. In general, it was very quiet, although there was a group of noisy people the first two nights we were there. After they left, it was blissfully peaceful. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful. One of the very best things about Aventura Mexicana is how CLEAN it is. Our housekeeper did an excellent job every day, and left us beautiful towel art as well. We constantly saw staff cleaning around the pool area and on the grounds. We usually used the adult pool to cool off after a day on the beach. It was so refreshing. We also loved Aventura Mexicana's location. It is close to everything...just a few blocks from Mamita's Beach and a hop, skip, and jump away from Fifth Avenue with lots of restaurants and shops. The continental breakfast every morning was perfect for us...good strong coffee plus delicious toast and jam. We met some very nice people who also were staying at the hotel, too. This was in huge contrast to some of the people we've met before at all-inclusives. The \"icing on the cake\" is Olivia, the hotel cat. She joined us for breakfast every morning and really made us feel better about leaving our cats behind at home! We really can't say enough great things about this property and their staff.

I booked my room on the hotel website. I received an excellent rate of $65/nite USD for booking five nights and paying in advance. Paying in advance was not an issue. I have been to PDC many times and know the area well. My room rate included daily breakfast and beach towels for two. The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful. From the desk staff to the chambermaids to the maintenance guys. My chambermaid was a sweet woman. The first day I noticed the floor was dirty from the construction dust blowing in from across the street. I left her a note in my broken Spanish asking her to please mop the floor. When I returned to my room later that day, not only had she scrubbed the floors but the entire terrace as well!! I spoke with her every day after that and she took good care of me. (Don't forget to tip the maids.) My room was awesome! I had room 402, the VIP deluxe adult room. This hotel has a family side and an adults only side. Nice. My room was actually not a room at all, but a small house with a private terrace. Pictures are attached. It had windows on all sides. It was light, airy and large. The room featured a sitting area, king bed, sink, dishes, microwave, filtered water cooler, refrigerator, coffeemaker, stereo, telephone, cable TV with lots of channels(which was great the day it poured rain), cold A/C, hot water, good water pressure, lots of closet space, a huge bathroom WITH a door. The private terrace was just off the adult sundeck and had its own chaise lounges, table, umbrella and chairs. It was a great place to start the morning. This hotel is located in a part of PDC known as Little Italy. There are lots of fantastic Italian restaurants as well as many other cuisines. Try Babe's for Asian/Swedish fusion. It rocks. The mojitos are great! My first day, I made the three block walk to Mega (like Super WalMart) to stock up on snacks, beer and sunscreen. I spent $30USD and was set for the week. The hotel grounds are lush and green is everywhere. Both pool areas are nice and the restaurant sits within the hotel grounds. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon chilling out. They have a 2-for-1 happy hour daily. The adult sundeck is nice and large, overlooking the pool area. The lobby has a small sitting area with a small library, materials on what to see and do in the area and a computer with internet access. I checked my email every day and there were always people hanging out here enjoying conversation. The hotel is only a five minute walk to both Mamita's and Kool beach clubs. Both are great places to sun, swim, eat, drink, chill out and watch the people of the world walk by. Don't forget to stop by the front desk and grab your beach towels before you go. The only drawback was the daily construction going on across the street from my room. This is no fault of Hotel Aventura Mexicana's. Though construction didn't usually begin until well after 9am each day, the pounding was intense in the afternoons. This made it difficult to enjoy a siesta or do some reading on the terrace. No worries, I just hung at the beach longer. PDC is experiencing tremendous growth right now so no matter what corner you turn, there will be construction. Head to the beach, you'll be fine.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, and they let us stay in our room till the middle of the day, on our check out day, allthough their check-out time is at 11, which was great and very helpful. We stayed in the adult area of the hotel, which is close to a big pool and the restaurant/bar. Every morning we got a new sculpture made of towels, which the nice cleaning ladies made. They even made small sculptures with the toiletpaper, which was really funny and creative. The room is equiped with a frigirator and aircondition, which was nice in the very hot and humid days. We found the bed perfect, eventhough people here remarked that the beds were a bit hard, we think they were just perfect. Our only remark goes to the breakfast, because the free continental breakfast contains the same thing every day: coffe/tea, juice, croissant, toast and the same kind of marmelade. It was nice the first few days, but we stayed there for 13 days, and we would have liked a bit variation in the pastry, or if they added youghurt a day or two. There was a possibility to upgrade the breakfast for $5, but if you don't eat much in the mornings, its a bit much for a bowl of youghurt or a piece of fruit. But the food it self was very tasty and nice- no doubt. When staying at the Aventura Mexicana, you realy get what you expect, a nice clean and quiet hotel for a very favorable price, with friendly staff and close to the beach and the 5 Avenue. Tips: make sure to visit the \"Crepe Factory\" just around the corner, which has great crepes and the best Jugos (friut juice/smoothie) in town! We bought one every morning and took it to the beach. Besides of being incredibly tasty and healthy, the Jugo stayed cool until the middle of the day and was very refreshing. Uhmmm I could drink one of those right now. Another tip is not to go to the beaches nearer the \"center\", they are crowded and a bit smelly. Personally we found the best beaches a bit north of the Kool beachclub, a bit near the SHangri-la Hotel and eve further away. Alla in all, a great hotel, a great town and a great country!

Day trip to Chichen-Itza, one of the the Mayan ruin sites, including tour, lunch and swimming in a cenote (definately swim in a cenote whenever you can!) 3. Horseback riding-if you're into the outdoors, no-frills and lots of local history, try a horseback ride at Ximbal. Restaurants we recommend: Babes-a great noodle shop, awesome menu and prices. Carboncitas-reasonably priced Mexican, friendly staff, no-frills, delicious. Crepe places are great, in general, especially the one next to the hotel. La Cueva de Chango-beautiful, cool spot off the beaten path, great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Blue Parrot-for drinks and fire show (show starts at around 11:00pm) General tips: Kool beach club (connected with Aventura)-bring a towel from the hotel and rent chairs under an umbrella right on the beach. $3 a person with discount from hotel. Great deal as you have access to showers, bathrooms, waitservice, restaurant and pool). Beaches are gorgeous! Walmart (I know, there are other big grocery stores, too)- a bit of a walk but great for groceries, bottled water and believe it or not, Mexican baked goods. Keep plenty of botted water in your hotel room. Bargain-don't pay full price for any souvenirs. Bargain your heart a way! Things are expensive in Playa, but you don't need to get ripped off! We are already planning a trip back to Playa and Aventura Mexicana-we can't wait!", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Scuba-in-Cuba", "ReviewID": "UR7852807", "Content": "We stayed at the Aventura Mexicana for 3 nights in May. The guys (and gals) at the reception desk were really helpful and friendly, and allowed us to check-in a few hours early. Our room was on the ground floor, by the pool which meant that it wan't very private. When we were in the room we had to keep the curtains closed, or it felt like we were in a goldfish bowl. We could have just asked to switch rooms, but my husband couldn't be bothered. The room was spotlessly clean, but smelled mildewy, I think that it was from the curtains. I don't know if that is true of all of the rooms, or just ours. The fact that there was no bathroom door was a little annoying, and I am pretty certain that people outside could see you sitting on the toilet if the curtains were open. The pool is small, but you really just need somewhere to cool off after spending the day in the sun. They have lots of sun loungers up on the 1st floor terrace which they didn't tell us about, we just found them by accident. Free beach towels are available at the front desk, so you don't have to take your own. Free internet access is available in the lobby which is a bonus, it's a good place to plan your trips. Breakfast is served from 8am, which we found to be a little late, we wanted to be on the road at 8am. We made good use of the happy hour in the bistro from 4 - 7. The hotel is in a really good location, just off 5 ave. In the evenings we would stroll down 5 ave to the restaurants and bars and then end the evening with a Mayan hot chocolate at cafe cocoa just around the corner from the hotel (it's so delicious, you must try it). We really did like this hotel, it's in such a good location and we were made to feel very welcome.

Checking in was easy and the staff very nice. The hotel is divided into two. First area you walk through is the family section with small pool for the kids. We only saw two kids the days we were there and they looked like they were having a fun time. I would not recomend this place for families with very little ones though. There is also a restaurant in that section that we did not try out but saw a number of people eating there. As we entered the Adult Section of the pool we really liked all the beautiful trees, plants and flowers. Our room was on the 3rd floor. No elevators and steep steps so if you have a disability make sure you ask for a ground floor. Our room was very clean and bright. Fixtures are not new looking and some of the chairs outside our room looked like they should be replaced but that really didnt bother us much at all considering we thought it was nice that we had chairs and a table right outside our room where we could sit and relax after a day at the beach or at night before we went to bed. Bathrooms do not have doors and the walls do not go all the way up to the ceiling so if your shy which I am you will have to ask your companion to step outside for a bit. Was not a problem for us at all. Pools and jacuzzis are nice and clean and I noticed the pool guys cleaning it every day without bothering the guests. The Mayan Bistro restaurant was very nice too. We went there almost right away after we checked in to have a couple drinks. Their Happy Hour had not started yet but we did take it advantage of it when we got back from the beach. It is buy a margarita get one free between 4 and 7pm. Very delicious coconut margarita!!! We ate there the 1st night. We really liked their tortilla soup and we both had the special which was either fish or steak and we thought it was just o.k. I would just order from their regular menu next time. The ambiance though we both thought was very romantic. Dim lights nice music and great service. Short walk to the beach maybe 10 minute walk depending on fast you want to get their and what we liked is that it was close to Kool's and Mamita's beach clubs. Very close to all the fun stuff on 5th ave. The hotel was on a nice quiet street too so if you like silence at night when going to sleep this is a great hotel too to stay.

The hotel is divided into two halves - the \"Family\" side and the \"Adult\" side. The family side has an interior courtyard with two small child-safe pools. Rooms have either sliders to the pool area or balconies that overlook it. The \"Adult\" side, where we stayed, is a whole different world. There is a beautiful garden setting of tropical plants and palms, a free-form pool, restaurant and dining area, and two spa tubs. One near the pool, the other on the third floor terrace. We stayed in room 1208. The \"Adult side of the hotel is an L-shape, forming two sides of the courtyard, with the restaurant forming the third side and a hedge of hibiscus (through which you enter the area via an arched opening) forms the fourth. The staff is very friendly. We paid the extra $5 US for the full buffet breakfast and overall found it quite good. They serve a variety of fresh fruit, fresh orange juice, hot drinks, an egg dish, a side dish - we had french toast one day, cheese tortillas another - it varies, so no guarantee you'll love everything every day. A nice plus is the availability of a PC in the lobby for guest use-easy and no cost to keep in touch with home. The location is ideal, on the corner of 5th Ave, two blocks from the best beaches (KOOL Beach club very nice) and the hotel provides a continuous supply of beach towels, so there's no need to bring. No cost to sit on the beach with a towel and only $70 Pesos (less than $7 US ) for a padded chaise and food/beverage service. Fifth Ave runs from 38th St to 1st, where the ferry dock is. The lower we walked down, the more congested - we were happy to return to the hotel.. A good selection of restaurants and tons of shops on 5th, as well. The only negative - the bathroom in our room was somewhat open - no door although the opening was discreetly positioned, and one wall did not reach the ceiling.

ERIC is the most friendly waiter in all of Playa. He was attentive to all our needs and made us feel very special. The happy hour margaritas from 4-7 included fruit flavors, tamarindo, and just about any other flavor you could imagine. OLIVIA is the resident hotel cat who graciously allowed me to share my spaghetti with shrimp with her. She even condescended to share my sunbathing time with me in the afternoons.

The Hotel Aventura Mexicana was just what we were looking for and would recommend to family and friends. The 2 of us stayed 7 nights in an adult superior room complete with king bed, ample closet space, mini-frig, tiled shower, TV, and shared balcony. The bed was typically hard and a little short for a 6' 1\"er. The shower floor had a few tiles missing. The water temperature was luke-warm the first day but learned to just to let it run a few minutes. The room was kept spotless. Never heard our neighbors. The air conditioner drowned out any 10th st. traffic noise day or night. We paid $131 per night including tax. The court yard was peaceful and tranquil. The clean pool was small but never crowded. We never took advantage of the jacuzzi. Several of the shrubs and vines were in bloom. The included continental breakfast was basic: orange juice, bread, roll, jam and coffee or tea. Perfect for our daily start. A full buffet breakfast was available. Never tried the 2 restaurants at the hotel, but heard reports that the fish was good. The staff was helpful, courteous and patient. The free Internet access PC in lobby was a great feature. Beach towels were available at the front desk. Car, tour, dive shop & restaurant recommendations were available. Tried Discovery Diving and Tank Ha. Both were professional, had quality rental equipment, small groups of from 2 to 4 and their dive masters worked hard to find all sorts of marine life not easily seen. Most double tank dives cost in the $65 range and $12 for full equipment rental. An ATM was 2 blocks south on 10th Ave. Mega grocery store was an easy 5 block walk. The north beach clubs were less than a 10 minute walk. The downtown beach clubs at 8th were less than 15 minutes. Restaurants are everywhere. Try John Grays for taste and presentation. Fusion Beach Club had a great vibe. The Blue Parrot Beach Club had free lounges & umbrellas for a drink or 2 and the fire dances at 11:00 pm. The farther from 5th Ave., the better the prices and the sparser the English spoken. A used $2 English-to-Spanish pocket dictionary proved helpful. Cancun Maps is coming out with an updated Playa map in 2007. The older map helped but restaurants can change quickly and new construction is everywhere. Took the $8 per person one-way bus between Playa and the airport. It is a little walk from customs when arriving but stops right at the main terminal when leaving. Very easy, comfortable, air conditioned & cheap. No bathroom. Takes 45 minutes to an hour. If arriving by cab, be sure to specify the 24th St. main entrance instead of the 22nd St. restaurant access.

Decor--nicely furnished and decorated rooms--tasteful and soothing Breakfast--generous buffet breakfast available each day--rolls, fruit, eggs and side dish each day, fresh orange juice and coffee. Staff--friendly and available to help when approached. They stored our luggage for several hours after check-out, which was very helpful. Cons: Our room--if I'd been given a choice, I would have preferred one of the rooms with a balcony facing the courtyard/ pool area. Our balcony faced the street and was very narrow with uncomfortable chairs--just not that nice for sitting outside. The bathroom was very dark and small and didn't seem really clean. Pool--very small --my son enjoyed it but I had no desire to get in the water. The pool on the \"adult side\" of the hotel appeared bigger, and they also had hot tubs which would have been nice. Things that would improve this hotel: Small table and chairs in room--we had nowhere to set anything other than in the TV cabinet. Purified water in room, or at least for sale in the hotel reception area--we went through a lot and had to keep returning to the store for more. Not a necessity, but would be a nice touch. Softer mattresses, Better discount on the beach club. A binder of restaurant suggestions & menus would be nice for those unfamiliar with the town. When visiting Playa again, I will likely choose a different hotel--I'm not sure the room we had was worth $120 a night considering it was several blocks off the beach and had no usable balcony. I would probably not recommend this hotel for people with young kids, as there is a lot of walking (which is fine with me, but with our son we dealt with a fair amount of whining when walking to/from the beach and to/from dinner).
