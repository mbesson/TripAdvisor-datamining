The Nisantasi branch of this wonderful hotel chain has a very welcoming feeling, if House Bosphorus is a relaxed quick experience, House Nisantasi is like having a trendy townhouse with best service. Even being from Brazil which is reasonably far I felt like home over there. STAFF: Everything is done in quick and efficient way, everybody from ground floor desk staff to front desk reception staff and bar is SO KIND and nice. I had a lot of attention from Mr. Fatih who gave me plenty of useful advice and told me about the hotel and the region, having even offered me the best capuccino I had in Istanbul until today. Like I said the treatment is very personal and welcoming, Ms. Senem, whose name I found out to mean \"top of the world\" really does make Istanbul feel like the top of any guests world because she has all advices and efficient suggestions for gastronomy, touring around the typically exclusive areas and once again the service excellence makes the guest feel comfortable and anxious to return to Istanbul. HOTEL/LOCATION: The location of House Nisantasi is prime, in the main street of this upscale shopping district where there are the most charming caf\u00c3\u00a9s of Istanbul and all the attention somebody can get, this is simply great. It is a very cool design hotel, mostly seemed useful for business people, young trendy people and couples, there isn't the common pool facilities that attract kids because the proposition of the hotel concept is more like a chic townhouse for jetsetters, anyway the prices are very reasonable, the room design is AWESOME and there is so much complimentary stuff... fantastic. Now they also have a spa on the top floor to which I didn't had time to book any treatment due to a busy business stay. OVERALL: The hotel is simply flawless, the breakfast usually included is delicious and the staff measures no efforts to make sure the guest is satisfied, which made it feel like 5 stars++ standard! Makes me say that next time I'll certainly return to the House Nisantasi on my upcoming business trip to town! And my congratulations to the staff.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kara_blanc", "ReviewID": "UR126043367", "Content": "the hotel is really nice. you feel the quality in every thing: service, design, bed, breakfast, bathroom and etc. shower amenities are from l'occitane, coffee is nespresso. they didn't miss any thing! will be happy to come back.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cFelt like we were home\u201d", "Author": "katerina k", "ReviewID": "UR125931782", "Content": "We stayed at The House Hotel Nisantasi and we loved it.

Having to deal with mediocre room the night before, this place is indeed a true heaven. To begin with, it is located in a very upscale part of Istanbul (Nisantasi), where you can rub shoulders with some of the chicest people in town. The hotel entrance is small, with lobby located on the second floor. Once you have reached the lobby, you will be totally wooed by the elegant a la Art Deco design. Smartly designed, warmth but not too overwhelming with too many decor elements. We were welcomed by a genuine smile of all staffs, ready to assist you in any way they can and to ensure that you are enjoying your time both at the hotel as well as the amazing Istanbul. Big extra point indeed ! They even going extra mile in preparing breakfast very early in the morning on our departure day to Athens. Something that we really appreciate. Don't forget to take the chocolate available on the reception desk, it's totally awesome ! The room is equally wonderful, smartly designed with a chic decor. Comfortable bed with a neatly designed bathroom, not too big but just in a right size. Breakfast food is good, too bad that we did not enjoy drinks or meal in their small restaurant next to the lobby which is rated quite high as well. It is located in a very upscale shopping district of Istanbul, where you can even directly jump into Prada boutique at the ground floor. It is a 30 minutes walk to the nearest tram station in Cabatas hence if you plan your sightseeing to the old part of Istanbul, this hotel may not be the most convenient choice. But I will surely choose this hotel for the luxury with a reasonable price tag attached to it.

The background music during the day and at breakfast was perfectly chosen. Breakfast won top of my list for my entire stay in Turkey ( a tall order). The mini bar - substantial The only problems I experienced with my room was a strange spot on the carpet - like something had been spilled there previously and although substantial effort had been made to clean it up, it was the one thing that was out of place, that and the ipod docking station didnt work - after calling reception they advised they had no idea why it didnt work - but it wasnt a big problem due to all the other amazing features of the room. I loved the design of the hotel and was made to feel more than welcome to stay there... I only wish I could have stayed longer, but I might never have left. The hotel is reasonably close to public transport and travellers should be warned when taking a taxi from Taxim Square - it should cost you around 10TL at the most.

Stepping out of the hotel is ofcourse easy because everything is downhill and the walks are lovely especially down past the macka park. The hotel is beautifully outfitted with elegant furniture artfully scattered here and there. Our room was luxuriously large, with a host of little touches like chocolates on the pillow, the L'Occitane toiletries in the bathroom, the usual but unusually-well-stocked snack/beverage facilities in the room.... and a weird glassed in cupboard which was the only thing that took some getting used to.

We had no way of getting up to our room 5 floors up, and laden with shopping bags that isn't an easy task, especially when there isn't any staff on duty to help you! These personnel issues aside our stay was fantastic. The breakfast lounge was a lovely and sunny overlooking the street below and ofcourse the breakfast was to-die-for. Limited in variety, but really thoughtfully done. There were, surprisingly no International Newspapers, other than the single local English daily, and ofcourse numerous Turkish Dailies. There is a library in the lounge with and interesting collection of books (mostly English) which is perfect way to unwind... though who'd want to spend time indoors in a city like Istanbul?? The staff on duty tried to be helpful and usually were except with even slightly-more-complicated queries. However after a couple of days, the haute couture feel of the hotel began to grate on the nerves. The overly-styled ambience lacks a certain warmth: This beautifully styled hotel is almost like a piece of haute couture that's great to look at but not something one can wear for too long...", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best\u201d", "Author": "connected2space", "ReviewID": "UR118052913", "Content": "I've found this hotel when I was looking for some place to stay in Istanbul and booked it immediately. It is located in a nice area with quite a few posh shops, from there you can walk through a park to Dolmabah\u00c3\u00a7e Palace and Bosphorus. If it's not too hot you could try to walk to Taksim otherwise it's a few minutes by taxi. The area is a bit quieter which means your sleep won't be disturbed yet it's a popular area with many cafes around (including House Cafe in about 5min walk from the hotel). The Hotel itself has cool design, loved the lounge/breakfast area. Our room was spacious, there's enough storage, big bathroom, nice bed. The room was full of those little details that make hotel stay especially enjoyable - enough towels, fancy toiletries, chocolates on the pillows, free water everyday (a blessing in Istanbul) and even a little orchid on a bed table. If you're a Nespresso fan - take a few capsules of your favorite blend as they have a coffee machine in the room (some coffee provided by hotel). We were too lazy to use the gym on the top floor, but came over to take a look - it's rather on a small side but machines look newish, A/C and a view over the city though the glass walls. The service during our stay was excellent, hotel staff is very helpful and English-speaking. On our last day we had to leave very early and I wasn't sure if we'd have time to have breakfast, however the breakfast area was opened precisely on time and we had our meal before leaving to airport. The breakfast is very good and I am very peckish with my food, seasonal fruits (better than anything you tried in UK), eggs the way you'd prefer, cheese/meats/cereals etc. Freshly squeezed orange juice - I was surprised how many nice hotels in a orange-growing countries have compromised on that, so couldn't help having 2 glasses with every breakfast, greedy me. Oh and don't forget those mini chocolate brownies...yum... Overall I definitely recommend to stay at Nisantasi House Hotel and I am looking forward to stay there next time we'll be in Istanbul.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel manager\u201d", "Author": "kenevans", "ReviewID": "UR117647575", "Content": "We stayed at The House Hotel for 5 nights in early August.

Just a couple of minor points, on location it was not that easy to get to the main sights as it is north of the central \"touristy\" area, so it involves either a cab ride to the tram station then tram or metro, or a cab ride all the way in. I would say it takes about 30 mins to get to Sultanahmet and it is not walkable. Also we felt there was a bit of a lack of attention to detail, the bathroom toiletries and even paper were not replenished. The breakfast was lovely with lots of choice but you had to ask for juice and for them to refill croissant basket, bowls and plates etc when this should be noticed and dealt with at this kind of place.
