The room was cramped, but had everything you could want. The front desk staff were excellent and attentive to our needs. If I had a complaint it was how you arranged to get the airport shuttle. I returned our rental car to the airport and needed to get back to the hotel. I assumed there was a courtesy phone to contact the hotel, for me that's the norm. I found out that you actually had to call the front desk of the hotel to get the shuttle to pick you up. Who carries around the front desk phone number of their hotel? It took a few phone calls and significant roaming charges to figure out the front desk phone number to arrange pickup. Once sorted, the shuttle was quick getting to me and the driver was very nice.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saucier, MS", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "Janice S", "ReviewID": "UR128458790", "Content": "Staying at this property was fantastic.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful when we were decided how to get to the airport the next morning. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but it only leaves on the hour and takes about a 45 minute ride for a 5 minute trip. With triplet 5 year olds, this wasn't going to work. The front desk made arrangements for us to take a taxi and we didn't have to do a thing but show up at the designated time and pay the driver ($14). It was definitely worth the money to be dropped off right at our airline with no worries of being late, or having to wait on others.

The price was very reasonable in comparison to the local hotels in the surrounding area. Overall I was quite happy with everything. The rooms were huge. (We got upgraded to a 2 bedroom for free) and it was like a mini apartment. The rooms were very clean for the most part- the washrooms were lacking a bit in cleanliness but this is something I am always quite anal about. I need a washroom to be spotless, mould free, etc. We had a very noisy air conditioning unit so that was a little annoying at night. We ended up turning it off and dealing with being hot just to rest. Front desk staff were courteous and friendly. Smooth check in and check out. The shuttle to the airport was free and on-time. Super convenient and easy. I did not have to worry. They do offer quite the spread for breakfast which is complimentary.
