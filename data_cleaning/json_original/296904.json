I would say it did not come close to a 3 Star. I assumed that there would be a swimming pool, That was wishful thinking. The room was clean but the bathroom left a lot to be desired like plugs in the sink and bath. The bathroom was small and if you sat on the toilet you were partly under the sink, The bathroom was heated by a radiator fitted on the ceiling with corroded valves, Not much use if you wanted a heated bathroom. There was a phone in the bathroom which was good as I nearly got locked in the bathroom due to the badly fitted lock. The air conditioning left a lot to be desired but it was not too hot at the time I stayed there. There were no Coffee or Tea making facilities in the room. There was a small TV in the room, This was an old TV that you cant give away in the U.K., Reception varied from good to rotten and the remote control left a lot to be desired but if I wanted to watch channel 42 I could click channel 9 on the remote and then push the channel selector 31 times to get to 42. The Breakfast buffet was rubbish, the best part of the buffet was the Bread and butter until I lookes at the sell by date on the butter and I found that it was 4 months past its sell by date but I survived. There were Eggs, well sometimes there were Eggs which is great if you want warm or cold hard boiled Eggs, I guess that is a choice! There was fruit and cerials, Corn Flakes and some Chocolate Rice chrispies which had congealed, The coffee and Tea were not good anf 'Coffee mate' was offered, Not much good in Tea so I used the Milk located near the cereals. I asked about the laundry listed and I told at reception that nothing was known about this be he thought it was done outside. The are this is in is busy to say the least, Noisey is the best way to put it. Nearby there is a Mosque whith a wonderful sound system, Very clear and very loud and not very welcome at 3AM. I was picked up at the Airport, This was fine, When I checked out I was asked if I was going to settle my bill and If I wanted a Taxi to the airport they coul get me one, I told them that I had paid my agent for the whole deal including the transer back to the airport. This is not a Hotel that I would by choice stay in again, Value for money was poor.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cIstanbul- a city like a beautiful carpet\u201d", "Author": "loriolivier", "ReviewID": "UR8254586", "Content": "I stayed at Fuar Hotel for three nights and I have to say it was a pretty good deal considering the quality of the services and its proximity to the important sights (Grand Bazaar, Topkapi, and Hagia Sophia were all within walking distance). The location in a commercial area (Aksaray) might make it less attractive for a longer stay, but for the three of us (I was there with my sister and my brother-in law) was an ideal choice as we came by coach from Romania (the coach terminal being next door). The services of the hotel were great. The room was very clean, and the staff was polite and helpful. One of the assets of Fuar hotel was the manager- Ferhat Soylemez.. He was the most reliable, hospitable and courteous guys I met in Istanbul. He sent us tea to our room several times, helped me with advice on trips, and made reservations for us to sightseeing tours and restaurants. Thanks to him the experience of a chaotic capital was a truly positive one. I will return to the hotel if I know he still works there. I loved Istanbul, as it is one of the most intriguing cities I have ever visited- as colourful and irresistible as a beautiful carpet that you can buy there. You will be impressed by the remnants of old civilizations, by the overwhelming richness in goods (especially jewelry and carpets), and last but not least, by the Turks. Of all the nations I got acquainted with, the Turks (Ferhat is a worthy representative!) were among the most hospitable. The small Anatolian carpet that I brought with me and fits perfectly in my living room is not only a souvenir of an exotic and remote place, but also an enticement to go back there.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with great service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4825675", "Content": "I was traveling through Istanbul on my way to Plovdiv, Bulgaria. A friend had arranged for me to stay at the Fuar hotel. The hotel had a car to pick me up at the airport, then droped me off at the International Bus Terminal the next afternoon. I returned the following week, and the driver had arrived 1 hour early to insure he would not be late. The hotel staff was very pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were furnished nicely, though not elegant. Breakfast was a moderate buffet, with very pleasant service. The small restaurant had a nice view of the Sea of Marmara. This hotel is perfect for the traveler who spends little time in a hotel, needing only a clean simple hotel, with a pleasant staff.
