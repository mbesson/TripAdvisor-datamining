The pictures on the website make it look like a Modern Little Boutique Hotel. This is not the case at all. I should have known, the reception staff were rude to me when I called two weeks prior to confirm and I hoped they were just having a bad day but unfortunatley that was just their level of service. There are no elevators so after 30 hours of travelling from Australia we had to carry very heavy suitcases up a flight of stairs with no assistance or even an offer. The room was so small, that I had to get on the bed for my husband to walk past. The bathroom is so small that you can sit on the toilet and brush your teeth over the basin at the same time! All the double decker buses stop outside and passengers were able to look into our tiny little room so we had to close the curtain and unfortunatley the lighting was very bad. I was happy to look past all of this because I was there to enjoy London and really just wanted somewhere clean to sleep, but the service from the staff was so bad, and they were unaccomodating with the few simple requests we had. We were ready to leave after the first night but did not want to loose the money we had already paid. The hotel's cafe was under construction (which we were not advised of) so the choice for breakfast was vouchers to macdonalds or to a 5 star cafe down the street that offered 1 piece of toast, nicely decorated though! Seeing as though we were in London to enjoy this gorgeous city, we had booked early morning tours and the hotel refused to offer us our breakfast vouchers before 7.30am, so we had to get our own breakfast as we had to leave the hotel at 7am. For a depature only 30 minutes earlier they would not offer vouchers or explain why or even try to accomodate. I was so surprised that a hotel in Paddington with so many other hotels and competition in the area would not even try slightly to please us. We loved London and would go back there, but would not stay at this hotel. It is not worth the hassle.

To worsen things the room actually had a door leading on to the street. That was the final straw. We then had the task of trying to find a hotel with vacancies which was not easy as it was wimbledon week so everywhere was full. We came across the castleton hotel but unfortunately it was booked up but the very kind manager MARK rang around hotels and found one that could accomodate us for the two nights.Our new hotel was the lancaster court hotel which was 10 times better than that of boulevard.

The hotel is very close to Paddington station, which was very convenient. It is also close to Hyde Park, Oxford Street and other attractions. When we first walked into the reception we realised that it was not a very big hotel and we had some trouble with our 2 large suitcases in the reception area. There is no elevator in the hotel so we had to lug both of our 20kg suitcases up 4 flights of stairs. The hallways are also tiny - 2 people can't walk together side by side. Our room? Well, I think the word small is not really appropriate - tiny maybe closer to the truth. We had trouble opening 2 suitcases at once, it was basically impossible to do. There was a double bed in the corner and almost directly next to the bed was the door to the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life! We could not fit the two of us in the bathroom at one time - it was just too small. Having said this, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean, and as we didn't spend much time in the room while we were in London, the size wasn't much of an issue for us. If we had've been staying for longer, we would have asked if they had any bigger rooms. The room also had a TV with lots of channels to choose from. The reception area is also the breakfast area and is not very big. They would have trouble if more than 10 people came down for breakfast at once. The breakfast was included in our room cost, and consisted of cereal, yoghurts, bread and a selection of fresh pastries, which were nice and tasty. Staff were friendly at breakfast and happy to serve you hot drinks. If you are fit, I would recommend walking from the hotel to the tourist destinations in the area. There is alot to see along the way and the hotel is close to some local attractions.

This is how it stands at the moment. We are people in the hotel industry and try to be fair on both sides. Our stay N\u00c2\u00b01 was just after the refurbishment and reopening about 4 years ago. Taking into account the small rooms and bathrooms, our stay N\u00c2\u00b01 was O.K., even though the hand basin and shower leaked. One year later, stay N\u00c2\u00b02, was bad. Walls were badly marked and dirty, hand basin and shower leaked (not the same room), bed linen was worn out and they had done nothing about the general wear and tear. We said 'never again'. So why stay N\u00c2\u00b03 ? We got the impression that they had tidied up the place and had put double glazing on the windows (the hotel is on a busy street and bus route). From their promotions, we picked up a good price for our four day stay. I had promised myself that if it was like our second stay, it would be check-in and straight away check-out. For our travels we only use hotel rooms for sleeping as we are avid tourist and spend all day and half the night out and about. We found on stay N\u00c2\u00b03 (Jan 08) that it was O.K. They have made efforts and appear to be making efforts to keep the standards up (two star level). Our shower leaked again and after asking for two days, they finally gave us a sheet to put on the bathroom floor so that we didn't have to stand in water. We had forgotten about the size of the rooms. WARNING We don't recommend this hotel for people over 80 kgs (220 pounds). People above that weight will have problems using the bathroom and passing in the room. We are in the region of 70 kgs (220 pounds) each and we have to work out a plan to pass one another in the room. Think of a camping car and that will give you an idea of the size of the room and bathroom. We travel light but if you have more than one suite case plus hand luggage, you'll have no room left in the room to move. Positive side of the hotel ....location, price (if negociated) d\u00c3\u00a9cor that is modern and a pretty good continental breakfast which is included in the room rate. If you are over the weight we quoted, explain and see if they can help you with a room a few inches bigger (or take two rooms). I think the size of the bathroom/s will be the same. We may stay there again, but we won't if we can find something better for the price and in the same location (a very difficult task in London).

The Boulevard Hotel is in an undeniably fabulous location 2 min from Paddington Stn but, sadly, that is all there is to recommend this closet-sized dump. THE ROOM A steep, three-flight climb up the narrow staircase found us in a room no larger than a prison cell. Immediately to the right of the room entrance is the bathroom, in which one has about 2 ft sq. to manoeuvre. The sink was so small (1 ft wide) that I couldn't wet my face without also wetting my feet. The glass shelf over the sink was placed so that a false move could bring your forehead crashing into it. The drainage in the sink was so poor that you could only leave the tap on for about 15 seconds before it filled up, after which you had to wait 5 min for it to drain. The shower stall was standard, but water leaked onto the floor. Without a bath mat or towels other than a bath towel to mop it up, this presented a bit of a problem. Moving into the room, one finds a double bed. The space beside the bed is just wide enough for one standing suitcase, as is the space at the foot of the bed. The vanity is in a little alcove to the left. CLEANLINESS The sheets on the bed seemed reasonably clean, though the mould near the bottom of the shower stall was a little worrisome. We didn't look in or use the kettle provided, but used one of the spoons for a chocolaty dessert one evening. We left it well away from the mugs so that the staff would know that it had been used. Imagine our disgust when we pulled the spoon out from the mug to use the next day and found sticky chocolate on the tip of the spoon. The cleaning staff also repeatedly left the shower dripping after tidying the bathroom so that we would return to the room to find water splattered all over the bathroom floor. When a call was made to reception, the staff member merely handed me a towel, with no apologies and no offer to mop the floor for me. THE HOTEL Twice, our key stopped working on the door. The second time I made the three-flight journey to the reception desk to have it reset, the staff member greeted me with, \"Oh, let me guess, your key isn't working.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"how did you know?\" \"Oh, it happens all the time. Our security system is reset every day.\" \"Isn't that somewhat of an inconvenience?\" \"It's for your own security.\" I asked him to set it so that I could keep opening my room door for the duration of my stay, which he did. Clearly, the hotel can set an expiry time on cards; why not set it for the day you check out? There is zero soundproofing on the room doors. Indeed, all fellow travellers could be heard in the hallways, their doors opening and closing sounding as if it were your own. The bathroom door was not large enough for the door frame, allowing sounds to be heard from in there, too. It needs to be mentioned that on our second night, the hotel's fire alarm system malfunctioned, causing the alarm to sound 6 times between 3:30 am and 8:30 am. The alarm consists of a siren that sounds for 30 seconds before all of the lights in your room are turned on. The night staff failed to call the alarm maintenance people during the night because \"they wouldn't come anyway.\" Neither compensation nor apology was offered. I have put up with small inconveniences in my stays in various hotels throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America. Never have I come across such indifferent staff.

My criteria: a low-priced, reasonably comfortable lodging in close proximity to Paddington Station (and the Heathrow Express). I am happy to report that the Boulevard hit all the right notes. My 3rd floor single was just 50 pounds for the night (booked about 5 weeks in advance online) and it met all of my needs very nicely. Yes, the bedroom was quite small and the en suite bathroom was closet-like, but the spaces were well-designed and tastefully decorated. I slept okay, despite some moderate street noise (ear plugs recommended if you're a light sleeper like me). The room did not have any instructions regarding a wake-up call nor was there an alarm clock, so I set the alarm on my cell phone and that sufficed. Good thing, since I needed to catch a 5:30am-ish Express train to LHR. This was easily accomplished since the hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station (from the right front entrance of the station, walk straight ahead to either platform 6 or 7; the Express ticket kiosk is right there and the trains leave every 20 minutes to Heathrow from 5:10am on). The neighborhood was decent and had I stayed in town any longer, I'd have likely explored the tree-lined residential area surrounding the hotel and the shops and food options nearby on Praed St. In summary, the Boulevard was ideal for one night, especially given that I was a solo guest, traveling light.

(A choice I definitely recommend if you can get it: the noise difference between the front and back of the building is substantial.) The rooms are, um, cozy even for one person in the \"small double,\" but perfectly functional if you just need a reasonable place to sleep. Each has its own air conditioner. I don't think anyone's told the staff that they need to clean the filters once in a while, though - I hosed down one set in the shower and afterward the box blew about three times as much air. :-) Turning the mattress helped with sleeping comfort - the \"foot\" end was higher than the \"head\" end, so I turned it around (no small trick in a single-sized room!) and remade the bed. Rooms come with towels and tiny soap bars: no flannels (washcloths) and no shampoo - bring your own. Housekeeping was OK - I certainly wouldn't describe the hotel as \"dirty\" at all. Noise from adjacent rooms is noticeable but not obnoxious, which is no surprise in a budget hotel. Norfolk Place is on several great bus routes - coming back from contral London the 15 bus drops off right across the street from the hotel, and going toward the center picks up right around the corner.
