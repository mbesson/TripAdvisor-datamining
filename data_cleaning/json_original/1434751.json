Minor things to note. Beware of taxi rip-offs.\u201d", "Author": "ViVaCeAA", "ReviewID": "UR127987364", "Content": "We stayed in room 26, which has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The Suites Avenue has a fantastic location on Passeig de Gracia - in the middle of the action and across the street from the Pedrera. In our room the master suite had a huge bedroom and bathroom with tub, shower, toilet and bidet. However it had no door separating the bathroom and the bedroom and so it is unsuitable for anyone but a couple or a single person. The other bedroom had a tiny single mattress and a rather tight bathroom. The kitchen was small but serviceable. Whoever thought of putting the dishwasher right in the way of the sink probably never did any dishes in his life. We wanted this room because as a family, having 2 bathrooms was a necessity. Unfortunately our lower floor meant we felt rumbling every time the metro passed underneath. I would definitely recommend a higher floor if possible. While it didn't bother me it could be bad for a light sleeper. The apartment was very modern and clean - I had no complaints except the handles to cabinets and closets were difficult to grasp and more stylish than practical. We appreciated the laundry and the dishwasher greatly and took advantage of the opportunity to eat in. The amenities are great too. There's a great rooftop deck with a pool and a lower pool for lap swimmers though it was too cool to swim while I was there. Internet was good although there was only one ethernet jack in the whole unit which was slightly inconvenient. Overall I was pleased with my stay although the checkout process was annoying - really why was the inspection needed? During checkout the clerk was very concerned about the piece of glass under the tv in the living room and told me it was worth 400 Euros. It was a minor annoyance given the quality of the stay. I'd definitely recommend this for families and people who want to have an option to eating in. Beware of the taxi cabs that are parked outside the hotel. 3 out of 4 times we hailed a taxi the driver tried to tack on a \"supplemental\" charge although we were not going to the airport, port, train station or convention center, nor did we have any luggage - which are the only instances where extra charges are allowed. If a cabbie tries to pull this stunt point to the taxi charge table that is posted in the car and ask \"por que?\". Unfortunately we didn't know how to handle this \"tourist tax\" until our last day but maybe someone will learn from our mistakes. We got overcharged twice this way and the third time I asked them to reverse the charge.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva", "Title": "\u201cLovely setting, great stay.\u201d", "Author": "Laura K", "ReviewID": "UR127800367", "Content": "suites Avenue was a great choice.

I was surprised to find both a dishwasher and a washing machine. Passeig de Gracia could be compared London's Regent Street; it's central but not crazy busy. The metro station Diagonal is half a block away and we used the metro a lot to get around, though we could also walk to all the central locations. It was cool to have people taking pictures of our hotel as being of architectural interest! The front desk is manned 24 hours a day which was really comforting, and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. There are two small and very stylish pools but unfortunately it wasn't quite hot enough for us to use them in March. The only criticism I have is that the free wifi service wasn't great, but better service would have been available had I been willing to pay for it! We did hear noises at night because the rooms are located around a central atrium, but it didn't bother us or stop us from sleeping.

This is really a residential hotel so don't expect full touristic hotel services but you have your own luxurious apartment, beautifully appointed and spotless. Only one person is at the desk and there is no 'hotel' lobby per se.

The apartments are stylish and modern with good quality fixtures and fittings. It is definately worth paying a bit extra for a view of 'La Pedrera', wow what a view!! We stayed in room 66 on the sixth floor and had a great 2 bedroomed apartment. We were really impressed with how easy it was to get from Barcelona Airport to the apartments. Simply buy a 'T10' ticket which costs around 8 euros and entitles you to 10 journeys on any form of transport in zone 1 (you can also share it between as many people as you like rather than having to buy one each as you would in London) The train takes aprox 30mins to get to the 'Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia' where you need to get off, its literally 4 mins walk from there. The apartments are literally opposite La Pedrera which is a great point of reference. My only minor quibbles regarding the apartments (and they are minor) are that they don't provide you with bath robes as advertised and that there was no microwave or kettle. We had to boil water in a pan. The apartments all have a Nespresso machine but you have to buy the capsules at 1.5 euros a pop so my tip is to take your own. Loads of lovely places to eat and drink near by. We visited lovely places for breakfast and there is a mini supermarket a couple of blocks away to buy provisions from. All in all we loved Barcelona (if only the weather had been better). The Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is breathtaking, i am not in the least religious and felt moved to tears at the beauty of the building. The Catalonian people are fantastic and very proud of their heritage. The only warning would be to be aware of your handbgs etc at all times as pickpocketing is a real problem, however we didn't experience any issues.

I was looking and looking for a well located, modern, affordable and comfortable place to stay for an extended stay of 10 days/nights. I almost booked at the Mandarin Oriental and then decided on Suites Avenue since it was on the same street and virtually 1/3 of the price. The staff was so accomidating from the second I arrived. I was arriving at a different time than my boyfriend so I was a little nervous about arriving alone but the location is 100% safe and the most exclusive street in Barcelona. Anna recieved me and checked me in with such ease and comfort. She spoke English and Spanish so it was easy to communicate my needs to her. When I got to the room I could not believe it, WOW it was exactly like the photos but even better. The view was great, we were in 725 and it was the best view in the best floor of the building under the PH facing La Pedrera and with amazing light. We had a small yet effective kitchen (where we cooked at least breakfast every morning). They had all of the items to cook with and so much more including wine and cava, sodas and beer. The Nespresso coffe machine was perfect addition and instead of paying for each one we went to the Nespresso store a few blocks away and bought some coffee inserts for the machine. Not a far walk and a very cool store too. The bathroom was perfect in size with a full shower and tub. A toilet and bidet and ultra modern slate and tiles with a modern sink....the bathroom products were given each day and smelled delightful!! The sinks and fixures were the brand name \"Duravit\" which are ultra modern. Whoever developed the building designed the closets and storage so well since there were at 4 closets total and much more space in the kitchen. A full washer/dryer are in the ktichen and made things much easier on us rather than going out to try to find someone to clean some socks (which my BF ran out of) The 1 bedroom was addequately sized and the queen bed was plenty big enough and comfortable for us. The sheets were changed daily and the only thing we didn't like was the silky and slippery duvet cover, although the color was nice the material had a kind of polyester feel. We just removed it from the down comforter. I wished that there would have been an extra comfy and soft blanket in the room but I never did ask for one. We spent so little time in the room and relaxing since there are so many things to do in this magical city. We are a younger couple who was there for a romantic getaway and it was quiet and so appropriate. We hardly ever saw or heard anyone in the building. It was serene yet you walked downstairs and you could hop in a cab anywhere for a reasonable amount of euro (under $10 euro) If you do not mind the METRO you are even better off with 3 stations within 5 minutes. The neighborhood is busy with lots of local professionals and tourists. BUT it is not a tourist trap like Las Ramblas where you cannot sleep at night, we slept like babies!!!! In the morning the sunrises were beautiful glowing a bright orange and looking out into the Gaudi Masterpeice across the street made it seem surreal being there. There is a small gym, pool (which the weather wasn't that warm to swim), and a rooftop terrace where you can sit and enjoy views all around the city. The views are breathtaking up there. We opened a bottle of cava and enjoyed! We were around great shopping, restaurants of all types, mercados ( markets) and there is a pharmacy directly across the street. An atm is right in the building of the Pedrera and easy to find. I am 100% satisfied with the Suties Avenue. I would not have wanted to stay anywhere else in the city. We enjoyed the location and it was so safe and the best value of any of the other hotels which I was looking at. Our room was around 60 sq meters, which is DOUBLE the average size of a hotel room in Barcelona. The building and apartment were so new that it felt like you were the first one using it. Oh I forgot to mention that the internet is free and they give you a cable to connect. If you want to connect wireless you obtain a code downstairs for a free 1 hour. We loved Suites Avenue and we loved BArcelona!! What a special city and the Suites Avenue is on the top of my list!!! Don't waste your $$$ at the other hotels. The staff Chubby and Anna were so pleasant and helped us with maps and directions all of the time. It was helpful to say the least.

You are steps from the Diagonal Metro stop and the Passeig de Gracia stop is a little further down the block. It is an awesome part of town and you will feel totally safe walking around late at night. 15 minute walk down to the Las Ramblas area. There is a Caprabo gocery store about 5 min walk away. This was absolutely central to everything we did and everywhere we wanted to go. There are tons of restuarants and cafes to sit at. Chocolate shops, bakeries and yes.. fast food down the street (if you want it). Starbucks is right up the street a block away but I prefer the local coffee shops. The Hotel itself is gorgeous from the inside and out. Hardwood floors, minimalist decorations, clean lines. The 9th floor has an amazing terrace providing views from all over the city. Don't miss it. The hotel staff is very nice and can provide great tapas restuarant recommendations a few short minute walk away. There is no room service or restaurant and that suited us just fine.

Ameneties Master Bedroom + Ensuite Full Bath, Single Bedroom + Ensuite Bath + Kitchen + Eating Area + Sitting Area + Balcony (no room to sit) Your own air conditioning/heating system. Safe in the master bedroom. See Details below: Kitchen: They expect you to keep the kitchen area clean. We had no issue with this. They do provide 1 small kit the first day of liquid soap, cloth, towel and a disherwasher cube. The kitchen has all the basics to pull together a meal. Toaster Washer/Dryer Combo (for clothes not cooking) Microwave/Oven Combo 4 burner cooktop glass Fridge/Freezer Wine Cooler Pots, Pans, Winer Opener, knives, tongs Hand Blender Nespresso machine (didn't use) We had 4 place settings, dishes, glasses and eating utensils Drinking glasses included: Wine, Champagne and Water. Bedrooms - we had two. We had 1 single Twin in one small bedroom Two Twins in the \"Master\" bedroom that could be separated into two beds. Housekeeping comes every day to clean up the rooms and provide fresh linens and bathroom towels. Bathrooms - we have two The showers are heaven. Big rain showerheads with lots of water pressure and hot water. The single bath was a little tight. Shower, Toilet and Sink. No where to place your things. The Master bath was very spacious and included Shower, Tub and Toilet in separate screened off section. Plenty of counter space. They provide 1 blow dryer as well. Provided are a towel for the floor, a hand towel and full size body towel. Bring your own wash cloth. We always do when traveling to Europe. They also provide you a small bathroom amenity kit with shampoo, conditioner, body wash. TV's We had 3 flat screens: Sitting area and one in each Bedroom. All Spanish channels. We enjoyed watching the local channels trying to make out the news! Closets Plenty of closet space and they provided a few hangers. Drinks: They do provide a couple bottles of wine, beer and water which they will charge you for. Go to the grocery!! Recommendations you should bring. Traveling with a hungry teenager we knew we would be eating some meals in the room. Food in the grocery stores is very reasonable. Spain has the most amazing bread, lunch meat (jamon) and cheeses! If you don't want to buy all this stuff, bring it with you. We did. It will save you time and money. Additional Liquid Detergent (put some in a small bottle). Additional Dishwasher Detergent (cascade or finish cubes). Additional sponge or Cloth to wash counters in the kitchen 1 roll of paper towels Napkins Paper plates, plastic glasses, plastic utensils (for morning breakfast).

Would like a little more information in the hotel room. Example: to Dial 9 for reception Local amenities close by in the neighborhood Simple guide on how to use the appliances. We figured it out for the most part. The room must be \"inspected\" prior to departure. Would be nice if the hotel provided an \"inventory\" of what they had it in. (ie 3 TV's but only 2 remotes?) Would love it if they provided ice cube trays for the freezers. We hooked up our computer to their wireless (it was free for our room). Just ask for the code at reception.
