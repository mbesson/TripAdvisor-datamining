I finally had to physically go to the desk to request a computer cord, as they do not have wireless in the rooms, only in the lobby. Why is that guests are not getting wireless, but visitors and freeloaders get free wireless? Later in the evening 3 attemptes to call roomservice...no answer. I called front desk 4 times and finally got a response, and she would go over and ask room service to call me. After another 15 min I walked to the restaurant. They said the ringer was turned too low and did not know it...yet the counter clerk said he was busy filling room service orders...? How did they get through? The next morning I observed all the socializing among workers...phones ringing off the hooks...and employees too busy on texting on their cell phones to approach me while trying to check out.

Certainly easy for two of us to navigate about the room. (Though the sink area is admittedly small!) The property is located amidst several airport hotels, including the full service Sheraton and the Aloft hotel - each of which have options for eating - albeit it a good bit overpriced. We also like the parking option that allows you to park for $7.00 a day if you wish to leave your car during your travels. Particularly impressive during our most recent stay was the excellent service from the desk staff. Same girl checked us in around midnight, then out again early the next morning. She was very helpful and cheerful during both interactions. One thing worth noting - they DO run a shuttle to the airport, but this is the same shuttle that stops at the other two hotels in the complex as well, and the Four Points is the last stop in the circuit. A little annoying as you see you bus arrive, but it takes another 10 minutes to make it to your doorstep.

However, the following morning (like 9 am), the Direc TV reception still did not work and there were no clouds in the sky. I was just ready to go, so we did not complain. It was just another sub-par experience at this hotel. Finally, the internet showed that there were coin-operated laundry facilities in the hotel. The laundry was not in this hotel, but in the other Sheraton-operated hotel across the parking lot. This was inconvenient and a bummer, but not a huge issue.

I caught the airport shuttle at about 5:30 PM. The shuttle made stops at the ALOFT hotel and the Sheraton Suites before getting to the Four Points. The lobby was nicely decorated and looked newly remodeled. Check in was fast and I was on my way to the room. The first thing I noticed as I exited the elevator on the 3rd floor was the old dated carpet, the harsh lighting and the lack of any attention to decor. Room 302 was at the end of one of the halls. The awful carpet continued throughout. The room doors are those big heavy steel doors painted a deep burgandy color. I entered room 302 and immediately felt like I was in a remodeled hotel that was never finished. When you enter, on the left is a cut out area for the sink with literally no counterspace and on the right the entrance to the bathroom with the dated white marble floor. The entry to the room was redone with some kind of wood laminate. The wall plate covering the air unit was coming off (see photo). Get past the bathroom and you get to the room itself. The bed was impressive, the flat screen TV more than adequate, the desk new and very modern looking, a lamp in the corner with a foot clicker to turn it off and on...all very nice. There isn't a traditional dresser though. There's a cabinet under the TV that has baskets instead of drawers. One thing, the desk seemed to have many bells and whistles but seemed overly complicated for what it's used for. In that desk is a built in filing system that housed the hotel info, etc. Unfortunately, it was incomplete. It was missing the room service menu and details on how to use the free internet. There was a rolling cart to use as a desk, I guess, but seemed like it wouldn't be much use. The desk chair was comfortable and unlike any others in hotels I've stayed in. The air...I prefer a cold room and was able to set it to 68 and it stayed that temp all night. I connected my netbook to use the internet and the ethernet cable was broken and a call to guest services brought the maintenance man with a replacement but I still couldn't get the internet to work. They gave me the number to the company that handles their tech service; an 800 number, but I was charged .99 to make the call. The internet then worked. Without a room service menu I decided to go to the lobby restaurant to order dinner to bring back to the room. At the bar I ordered an angus burger and a slice of cheesecake. The bill was $24. I brought it back to the room and was eating when the hotelwide fire alarm went off advising everyone to leave the building until the alarm was investigated. Along with my other 3rd floor hotelmates we trudged down the emergency stairs only to get to the bottom floor and be told it was a kitchen fire and we could go back to our rooms. The alarm continued to blare for another 15 minutes or so. At around 11 PM I set the alarm on the alarm clock and went to bed. At 4 AM I was awakened by the sound of garbage trucks emptying the dumpsters that are directly below the windows of all the rooms on that side of the hotel. That's also the side with the interstate and noise from cars, etc. I went back to sleep until 5 AM when the alarm went off as set. The shower was fine but this is where you can really tell that the hotel was remodeled but not completely. The shower nob and sink nob were the old 1980's acrylic nobs. One nob to control hot and cold and you turn it to get to the temp you want. It was dated and you could defnitely tell it wasn't part of the remodel. You could also see built up grime on the double toilet paper holder built into the wall, another hold out, I assume, from the pre remodeled room. I use a hairdryer and flat iron and there was limited space on the sink counter for everything I use to get ready for the day. The mirror above the sink was a full wall mirror like you see in dated hotels. My flight was delayed and I stayed in the room until 7 AM. I caught the 7:05 AM shuttle to the airport. The driver was courteous enough but upon arrival at the airport, where it was misty and lightly snowing/raining, he dropped us off in the uncovered area. This hotel was over $150 with the corporate rate I get. I wouldn't stay there again. The ALOFT across the street was the same price and new. I think they did a great job with the remodel but they stopped short of a complete remodel and you can tell.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Chroma9", "ReviewID": "UR46092092", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights while we visited Philadelphia.

I know the shuttle is supposed to leave the hotel on the hour and on the half hour, seems it doesn't apply to pick guests up at the airport.

The next day.....no lotion, no shampoo replenishment. If you go to the bar, plan on spending $10 for a glass of house wine, and the food prices are astronomical as well.

I would think if you have a king size bed you should have king size pillows to go along with it. Our room also included a nice flat screen TV and reclining chair. The TV had a wide selection of programs which was great, so you could easily find something that you would like to pass the time away. The bathroom was split, with the toilet and tub in a room with the sink and counter right outside the door area which was fine. The bathroom worked well but you could tell it was of an older style but it was clean and worked well which is what you want and it included the usual soaps/shampoos/conditioners for showering. The sink located on the outside worked well too, but had limited counter space in our room, so if you were going to stay here of any length of time you would have to leave your toiletries on the dresser.
