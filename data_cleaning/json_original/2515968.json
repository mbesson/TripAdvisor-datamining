I'm really glad that I shopped around before selecting a hotel. After looking up hotels all over town, both on Trip Advisor, and by actually going to each hotel's website, the Donatello won hands-down over all others. I couldn't be happier my selection. The location is convenient to Union Square. The room was spacious, had a very comfortable king-sized bed, a sleep sofa, a kitchenette with a coffee maker and a microwave, as well as some dishes, cups, glasses and silverware - and they don't charge extra for these amenities like many of the hotels in town do - they are included at the price. The staff was very friendly. My husband had an injury which required surgery to a tendon in his ankle/foot prior to our vacation, so we had a scooter delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival. The hotel staff held onto the scooter until we arrived, and then delivered it to our room upon our arrival. They put us in a handicapped accessible room, which was probably a little larger than a regular room. We were very happy with the room that they put us in. Upon reading many of the reviews on Trip Advisor, I saw many people complained about noise from the street and noise from the elevators. We were in a room right next to the elevators, and didn't have any issue whatsoever with noise from the elevator. In addition, our room was on the 6th floor and faced Post Street. We didn't have any problem at all with noise from the street. The first night, we heard sirens from an ambulance or firetruck, but other than that, no problems whatsoever. The windows are tightly sealed which helps to keep the sound from the street down. The hotel is currently being renovated - new carpeting installed, some painting, etc., so it will be even nicer for those who stay there in the future. The staff was very friendly. We were greeted by Jesus upon our arrival - he was very friendly and had a great sense of humor. Kara was also very helpful in telling us about places to go and things to see around town. There were several other people who worked the front desk, and several concierge team members, all of whom were friendly and accommodating. Even the cleaning people were friendly! I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family who plan to go to San Francisco.

The other noticeable thing is the relatively thin main door as you can easily hear normal level talking right outside.

One block from the Union Square. The staff was very accommodating. At the moment unfortunately they are under going renovations and it was a little inconvenient in terms of the elevators, one elevator was reserved for the construction staff since their service elevator was out of order.... So it was a challenge getting one. We stayed at Donatello for one week, the went to Hawaii for a week than came back and stayed for two more days at the Don. Whe we first arrived we were put on the 7th floor but due to construction on the floor beneath us, and being on the corner near Post and Mason and also right about the patio it was quite loud on the Thursday. We requested a quieter room and the staff promptly switched us took care of moving all the luggage and everything. We were moved to room 911, was nice peaceful and quiet. If you are going during the construction, I would recommend asking for a quiet room from the day you check in at least two floors away from the construction and away from Post st. Downtown San Fran will always be loud so that is not the hotels fault, there were protestors at the frank hotel near by and they often started really friggin early....!!!! It woke me up (light sleeper) but not hubby. The room was awesome! Very spacious, had a microwave, sink, plates, mugs, utensils, glasses, coffee machine, fridge. There was a tv both in the bedroom and one in the bathroom mirror - that was such a hoot!! I loved that!!!! Go to the C (club lounge) on the top floor every morning for a free coffee! Also, on Fridays they have a wine and cheese for the guests check the binder in your room for times. We didn't make it so I can't comment. Also, did not eat at hotel restaurant, did order room service though, it's expensive with all the added on tax, but what room service isn't? Nice grilled cheese :-) The ballet parking was 28$.

Workers at the nearby Hotel Frank have been picketing for over a year and they want everyone to hear them. Protests continued through the week, culminating in a day long siege that began at 7 a.m. on our date of departure. Best thing about this visit (aside from leaving) was the housekeeping staff -- friendly & efficient. Average things: Front desk service. Worst things: #1 - NOISE. In addition to outside noise, the plumbing is incredibly noisy. The toilets sound powerful but are not. Security personnel need to turn down their walkie-talkies while patrolling hallways. #2 - Showering was slightly dangerous as the water temperature fluctuated wildly depending on whether or not anyone else was using water. #3 - WiFi is hands down the slowest I've ever encountered -- anywhere in the world. #4 - Zingari Restaurant. Very average food & service and very overpriced. #5 - At check-in there is talk of a \"welcome package\".

The restaurant on site, ZINGARI, is wonderful. They have a wine special on Sundays and Mondays. Just ask your server! Let me not neglect the staff.

The 'club' on the top floor which all guests can access is a nice touch, free morning coffee with newspapers and a TV. This is also where the Concierge is located. Another plus side is this hotel still does a turn down service with chocolates, which was quite nostalgic.

It includes the cable car which is fun attraction once but not a regular mode of transportation as lineups are 30-40 minutes most of the day. One final hint, book a limo to and from airport rather than a taxi. It is about $5 cheaper and a lot more comfortable.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - a little noisy\u201d", "Author": "Bongo_Craigy", "ReviewID": "UR119590614", "Content": "Hotel was very nice, staff were very helpful and efficient - just what's needed after a long flight.

I felt like I was trying to sleep inside a club. I could hear music and yelling and almost make out the words to the songs. In the morning I could hear the recycle trucks dumping the glass and I was on the 10 floor. One solution is to turn on the air or heat and let the fan noise drown out the noise. (It took me several days to learn this.)

There is also a lounge on the top floor with coffee and newspapers - and a nice view over the city. Many reviews of this hotel comment on noise. Folks - you are smack in the heart of a major city. There is going to be traffic noise. And since a city of this size does much of its servicing at night the garbage and recycling is going to happen in the wee small hours. We noticed no noise from withing the hotel - no elevators, people talking or doors slamming. With the windows closed and the A/C fan circulating it is just background. But - you are going to hear the city. The valet service was excellent and the doorman can whistle you up a cab very quickly. The BART is handy by, but downhill - something to remember if you are towing a lot of luggage. It will be a bit of a climb up from the station.

We found several great places to eat in the area ( special note to the Honey, Hoeny Cafe, and Sears Fine Foods) There is some street noise even in our room on the 10th floor but it never bothered our sleep at night and we found the nightclub across the street provided endless entertainment to three old ladies with bunoculars (the dresses are getting lower and shorter all the time and how do they walk on those Shoes?)", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilson, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for comfort, location, and price\u201d", "Author": "northernstar747", "ReviewID": "UR118391860", "Content": "We spent 3 nights while in the city to attend the opera and explore museums.We had chosen the hotel based on information on-line.

My requirements was pretty much simpler: - in the town, but not in the downtown or close to the bay area - close to the bart - normally priced I bet the Donatello matched all of my requirements, as in 10 minutes you reach the Bart / Muni or the closest Westfield center. The area is surrounded with a lot of places to eat of have your breakfast, and also you have the Apple center that is easily reachable (just in case) :) What I didn't really like of the hotel, but this is my personal opinion is: - some cracking in the bathroom tiles, - the very noisy airco, which probably is not required during the night as San Fran is quite chilly - the broken ceiling in the cupboard These are all things which really can't ruin your holiday. The hotel room was quite spacious, and surprisingly was having a sofa bed too, that means you can narrow down your staying sharing the room with your mates or comfortable staying with your family. It was including a small \"kitchen\" area with a fridge and a microwave for you to have a quick snack or continental breakfast. Very nice big LCD tv (not so much complicate in terms of functionality - please buy one with the sleep function) with DVD reader and micro hi-fi. The complimentary wi-fi connection was pretty much a rubbish, this is the only thin I can complain with. Even the ice machine, which seems close to every room 19 of each floor that is noisy, tend to not run so often, so the disturb is limited. The hospitality of the hotel staff was superb; they gave me plenty of suggestions and they have been able to accomodate my requests in full.

I loved the Rooftop Terrace area as it meant I was able to go up there through the day and have a cigarette (without feeling like a social outcast) and a coffee or cup of tea. There is a separate smoking section on the Rooftop Terrace which is a credit to the Hotel. They are obviously keen to cater for both smokers and non-smokers which I respect.

Bathroom was average and a bit dated but it was clean and functional. In room safe and plenty of room for luggage, view from room was alley and a roof top car park.

Plenty of good places to eat within a block to suit any taste, and may open 24 hours. Room was made up each day (we were out each day but by the time we got back room was always made up), they also provide a nightly turn down service as well. The wifi was pretty bad, and only worked a few times (I overheard a conversation another guest was having with front desk and they were aware of problem and were in process of changing wifi provider), they did have a computer and printer for guests to use in the lobby which worked well and had very fast internet. The hotel has a club room for guests on the top floor which was nice, plenty of room and free coffee/tea etc all day provided, nice place to relax after a busy day and wifi worked well in the club room so we went their when we wanted to connect. Club room had an outdoor patio area with view of the city from 3 sides, lots of lounge chairs to relax on out there, but a bit chilly in San Francisco. Lifts were fine, waited no more than a couple of minutes at any time during stay. We were not leaving until late, so they held our bags while we did some last minute shopping and they allowed us to use the club on the top floor which was a nice area to full in some time before our coach arrived. Overall a great stay, would highly recommend to anyone visting San Francisco, we have stayed at a number of hotels in San francisco over the years, many far more expensive than the Donatello, but none felt so welcoming and comfortable, which made for a very relaxing and pleasant stay.

In short, this hotel (is it a timeshare that rents rooms?) offers excellent value relative to others in the Union Square vicinity. As others have mentioned, the club room on the top floor is a very nice retreat with comfy seating indoors and outdoors, newspapers, coffee and Friday evening wine/cheese reception where they tell you what's happening in town that weekend. Also, the lounge downstairs has a good happy hour - $5 for house wines and several cocktails. The location is great for Union Square and everything east and north, however the Tenderloin lies immediately to your west, which is still a dicy place at night. Whenever we needed to walk west (like to the Civic Center), we just went up one block to Sutter across then down Van Ness to avoid the Tenderloin. If traveling on the metro rail, getting off on Powell and heading up Powell street (rather than Mason) was better because of far fewer panhandlers. It's a shame SF hasn't been able to manage the homeless/begging problem better .. we only had one (of dozens) get physically agressive (on Mason St., we just kept walking). Walking to Nob Hill, Chinatown, Pacific Heights is very easy (hills excepted), and points farther away (Waterfront, Telegraph Hill) are also very walkable, so we only needed to use public transportation to get to Golden Gate park. Our room had a microwave, coffee maker and mini-fridge, so we had breakfast in the room, which saves money for other things (it's not a cheap town).

We were told that the manager was out of town for a week and we should try back later. We checked out of the hotel and realized that our son left his iPod when we were an hour away. We immediately called the hotel only to be told that they couldn't find it and we could try back later. There was no offer for them to call us if they found it. We were off to Yosemite and would be out of touch for 5 days. Upon returning to San Francisco, we called again to see if they had found it. Still nothing. We were also unable to get in contact with the manager at that time. We expected a lot more of this hotel. They did NOT live up to their mission statement, or even make an attempt to.

Located one block west of Union Square and the Powell Cable Car line, this hotel is ideally located for easy access to all of the sites that San Francisco offers. You are only about a short 5 block walk to Market Street and all the shopping and public transit options. Check-in was a breeze and very efficient. And for those that stay over on a Friday, they have a free wine and cheese eveing at 5pm for the hotel guests on the top floor This was a nice bonus, as was the concierge service. The staff go out of their way to provide you with all sorts of info. The best part of the stay was the rooms. As this was our first visit to the SF area, we were expecting to have to put up with the small hotel rooms that most of downtown SF offers. Not at the Donatello - the rooms are as large as advertised, more than 400 square feet. The king size bed and pillows were so comfortable. The room also has a mini fridge, microwave, sink, dishes, glasses, cutlery, and coffee maker. I was also very pleased how clean the rooms and the hotel is. And finally, I slept like a baby as the rooms were very quiet and we never heard any of the street noise.(stayed in room 609). If you're unsure where to stay in SF, this is the place for you. Close to everything, and a very comfortable room.

We chose the Donatello because of proximity to Union Square's shopping, Chinatown and train. On arrival, we were met with the feeling that the desk clerk was actually happy to see us! What a welcome departure from those apathetic jerks that make me feel as if they were called them away from their last meal to do their job! When we got into the room, we found it more than adequate. It was quite large. There was a small 'fridge to put our bottled water and snacks into. A microwave was most excellent for reheating restaurant leftovers! The sink area with coffee maker was great, several teas and coffees to choose from. For a homey touch, there were jars filled with candy, sugar and sugar substitute packets, etc for our use. The bed was big and comfy. I generally cannot sleep in a bed that isn't my own but this one was good. Extra pillows and blanket were available in the closet for use without having to bother housekeeping. I slept most nights without waking. Only the city noise that could be heard once in a while woke me a few times-sirens mostly. Not unexpected in a large metro city, especially when you ask for a room facing the street! Bathroom, while somewhat dated and in need of rehab, was spacious. I have absolutely no complaints about the cleanliness or amenities. Personal preference would lead me to make this statement, nothing else. It was in perfect working order. On the second day of our stay, the toilet seat seemed a bit loose (hubby reading too long in there??) We called the desk and it was fixed within the hour! Service was tops. Room decor was nice. Again, my preference is that it be updated soon. Sofa was BIG. Chair was comfy. Television was LARGE! Again, all in good repair. Carpeting in the room was not worn or stained. All furniture was in great repair. Large closet in the entry area with additional dresser for my clothing was nice. I don't like to stuff a weeks worth of clothing into a tiny little space. There was room for everything, even my husband's items.. and he overpacks!. I'd like to have seen a work space or desk on which to work.

We were several hours early for check in, but, without our requesting it, the clerk checked to see if we could check in early. Within minutes we had our room keys and went immediately to our light persimmon & blue room. A tall table by the door was ideal for placing items we wanted to remember to take when we went back out. A letter was on the table welcoming us to the Donatello. I thought our bed at home was comfortable. Ohhhh, it was difficult to get out of bed each morning, the mattress was soooo nice. Placement of furniture was ideal. Service excellent. Everyone courteous, helpful, and made us feel very welcomed. The concierge always had time to answer my questions, give aid in chosing what to do next, and even confirmed our return airline reservations. Listening to the music in the evening in the lobby just below the bar was soothing and fun. The drinks in the bar are strong, so we definitely got our money's worth there, also. My only (very slight) complaint is the piano is a bit loud for the size of the bar. But for those who like loud music & have no desire to talk over their drinks, it would be ideal. The \"Club\" is a very nice touch. A place for exercise and a large room for relaxing. The Club room (set apart from the exercise rooms) had a television, DVDs, games, multiple tables, delicious hot coffee, and water for cocoa & tea. The balcony around three sides of the hotel (club level) was romantic. It gave my husband a place to smoke his cigars in the evenings after dinner. I was delighted with the selection of teas availble. I even took some back to my room for morning tea. I could babble on ages, but just know that if you want a comfortable, delightful place to stay in uptown (it was uphill from the Bart) San Francisco and be treated like VIPs, go to the Donatello. ,", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cIt's OK, not #4 in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "Mountain_travel", "ReviewID": "UR104077129", "Content": "I was a bit disappointed, I use trip advisor a lot and usually when something gets this high a rating from travelors, it is something special.

The rooms were superb. Here are the details. Two luggage stands for your bags and trolleys. A safe big enough for an iPad and lots of accessories and camera. Night table and floor lamps had dimmer switches to fine-adjust light levels. This was especially helpful late at night. Washroom also had a night light visible only on entering and invisible from the bedroom/living room (I had a studio room). Spacious bathroom countertop. CD player with speakers were standard, and TV was flat screen with DVD player. Plenty of closet space along with two tall shelf cabinets by the TV and CD player stands, and a kitchenette with microwave, utensils, glasses, and fridge were standard. Bathroom had handshower. Bed was perfect, not too soft, and I had a great sleep each night. A two-person sofa and table, plus a single easy chair with ottoman and writing desk rounded things out very comfortably. Wow. The room never felt cramped, as space was very nicely utilized. One concierge (fellow named Peter) was exceptionally knowledgable about the transit system and the best transit routes to key attractions like the de Young, Legion of Honor, and the Golden Gate Bridge. Another concierge (his name escapes me) gave me full details on how to book a CalTrain ticket to see Stanford in Palo Alto, providing train schedules, and how to get to the depot by bus from Union Square. In all my travels, I have not encountered such proficient concierges. Bravo. Service at desk: Very smart and efficient; knew the locations of local drug stores nearby, without consulting any guides. Check-in and check-out were trouble-free. Even booked a shuttle to airport for only $14. Negatives of room: not many, but fixable with some long-term inve$tment from management. - Water pressure was low in the shower, and had to leave hot water on full blast early in morning, to get the pipes humming with warm water. Perhaps an upgrade of the boiler system is overdue. - WiFi was erratic, and I couldn't connect on my iPad. Apparently, this was widespread, as one concierge mentioned it on my way out, in the elevator. Fortunately, hotel offers free use of a desktop in their biz center. Location: Perfect. One block from Union Square, transit buses nearby. No problem getting to the west end for museums and Golden Gate bridge (take the open top bus tour -- I listened to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries on my iPod, as the bus drove across the GG Bridge at 45 mph in the bright sun and cool breeze. Bay views spectacular on both sides of bridge. Was a better thrill than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which is boring by comparison. What an adrenaline rush!). Overall: A super hotel with lots of fine details that are missing in big chain places like Hilton and Marriott. And at these rates ($159-179/night) why settle for anything else? Will stay here again.

Parking rates were significantly lower than most of the hotels in the area, and it also offered free wi-fi (most of the 5 star hotels charge a fee for internet access) . (The only disappointment was the internet as it was dreadfully slow and frustrating to use. There was a computer for guest's use in the lobby area, and this seemed to be faster than the wi-fi in the room.) Overall we were very satisfied, and the hotel met all of our expectations. The room was very spacious, bed was especially comfortable, and location was fantastic. There was free tea, coffee, and hot chocolate available on the 10th floor, with a lounge . The concierge was available to assist with any sightseeing and booking of restaurants and entertainment, but we didn't require any of these services. We enjoyed the welcome wine and cheese reception on Friday late afternoon, and we were very pleased that there were no sales pitches for the Shell time share properties, which is a common feature when we have stayed at timeshare resorts. It was noisy at night from the street below, but this seemed to be an issue from the reviews for any downtown hotel .

Just a block away from Union Square, near to the Cable Car, BART, everything. Ok, parking has a charge, but you have in and out privileges, so it is a good deal for $25 a day. 3. The building has some years, but the rooms were all renovated, with lcd tv, sound systems, fridge, microwave, coffe makers, etc. The club at the 14th floor is veeeery comfortable, and you can go anytime to have a cup of coffe, chocolate, or tea. If you are lucky, you could find the hed concierge Peter, and have an interesting conversation about almost anything. Regards from Argentina Peter and Miss Almajose ! I was there always bothering them, asking to use their microwave and looking for directions.

It had the BART, MUNI, and the cable car that would take you up the hills to fisherman's wharf with in very close walking distances, with in a few blocks. It got a bit noisy one part of the night on Saturday but only for about 10 minutes. We were glad that we didn't book a hotel at the Fisherman's Wharf after visiting there... there were so many tourists, and just so congested in general. The Union Square area that Hotel Donatello is in was perfect. Not too far from any of the key places, and most places were very walkable. The service was always prompt and friendly, by everyone including the porter and the concierge. We called the front desk for a taxi at the last minute to get to a wedding, and a limo service was waiting downstairs- and the price was better than what a cab fare would be. The cleaning ladies even washed the dishes I had brought and neatly laid them out to dry on the counter. The rooms were kept clean and neat and they had plenty of closet space. I had read some reviews before the trip about how things look very worn-out, but in reality, there is some wear, but still maintained nicely. I think if you take flash photos of corners of a bathroom floor or walls in any hotels you'd probably see some worn-out areas. This is not a newly constructed hotel, but still up-kept nicely. The kitchenette has a small sink, a coffee maker, a microwave, and a small fridge (no freezer compartment, though). In a small drawer are metal utensils, and up on the shelves are mugs, glasses, bowls and plates. The bed was a bit high but incredibly comfortable. We just had our son sleep in between us, but they do have cribs if you need one. One extra note-- I had left my son's favorite DVD in the room and didn't realize until we got back to the east coast.

We searched for several months to find a hotel that was reasonably priced and in a central location to many of the tourist attractions. We had other destinations in California; therefore we rented a car at the airport. Our package deal for this stay included valet parking. Reaching the Donatello from the airport was an easy feat. Upon our arrival we were greeted by a valet and a bellhop. They were extremely courteous and helpful. They provided instructions on checking-in and valet parking the car. We next met with the front desk personnel who were extremely helpful. They provided information on the room and entertained questions about the area. Our interactions with the hotel staff including the front desk, the house keepers and the concierge were always pleasant and professional. The hotel features a club level with concierge and fitness room. Each morning we would double check our plans with the concierge and she would provide input on the proper mode of transportation.

The hotel is two blocks from Union Square (shopping), a block from Powell Street (street car access), about four blocks from Market Street (major shopping district), walking distance to China Town, Little Italy, museums, and Whole Foods. Fisherman\u2019s Wharf can be reached by foot or cable car. We chose one day to walk back and forth to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The second day we chose to ride the Hyde/Powell Line Cable Car from Fisherman\u2019s Wharf to a block from the hotel. The hotel is located in a business district with restaurants, convenience stores and other hotels allowing us to feel comfortable with an evening walk. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. We had a microwave, small refrigerator, sink and dishes. This allowed us to save on meals by stopping at Whole Foods and preparing meals in our room.

We could not find anywhere that did genuine cappucino or latte with breakfast. Evita steered us to Encore cafe, diagonally opposite the Donatello, which did very good coffee, with a range of beans including Yergacheffe, Sumatran, Ethiopian, etc. Best coffee (and pastries) is in North Beach (Little Italy) at Stella Pastries on Columbus Avenue, where you can also access the wifi from Hotel Boheme next door. Very easy access to and from SFO via BART to Powell and easy walk to Donatello. Everyone helpful, never any concerns for safety. We took buses everywhere - Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate, Golden Gate Park, Legion of Honour. These and the Cable Car just minutes away.

Valet parking - simple and fast (but expensive - $28/day), check in fast - altho our front desk person (Bobby) didn't give us a great room. First we were going to be on the 10th Floor, but when he heard it was our first time in San Fran, he moved us to a \"better\" room on the 7th floor. We got to the room and excitedly ran to the window to see the beautiful view of......the backs and roofs of a lot of other buildings!! I'm still not sure how this was better than the 10th floor, but.... The room was really large and well laid out. Huge closet in the entry hall with plenty of room to put up a luggage rack and still get into the closet. Nice bathroom and shower. The room itself was interesting, big bed, couch, chair, cocktail table, TV cabinet was also the dresser - a big unit on either side of the TV with doors and lots of shelves. The kitchenette was kind of a pain - it was a unit with one sliding door, so either the sink and cupboard with dishes and glassware was open, or the side with the microwave and compact refrigerator. It worked out OK - we were only there for coffee in the AM and perhaps an adult beverage in the evening after a long day of sightseeing. The bell captain gave us great advice about where to get a quick hamburger our first night - The Daily Grille - very close and very good. The only problem we had was with the internet, evidently, someone got into the hotel and stole the servers on several floors (including ours) so we had no internet for the last 2 of our 3 days there! Kind of odd. All in all it was a great stay - make sure to visit the piano bar on the 2nd floor - nice bartender and really good piano player and jazz singer! Also ate at the Tadich Grill in the Financial District - oldest restaurant in SF - had a wonderful Cosmopolitan salad with about a pound of lump crabmeat and tons of shrimp over different veggies including lettuce - really good.

The room was cleaned everyday and the bed was always turned down when we got back every evening after s stroll. We visited the club lounge where you are able to get free tea/coffee.chocolate and spoke to the concierge Peter who was very helpful and more than willing to book any tickets we needed. This was our second visit to the City. We had a three day stop-over three years ago and did not have time to see everything we wanted to. On that occasion we stayed in a cheap hotel on Van Ness. The Donatello was much better for eveything. When planning out trip this time we had thought about staying down at Fishermans Wharf but decided the location of the Donatello would be better for travelling from as all routes on public transport systems seem to virtually go outward from around Union Square and Markert Street. We enjoyed a visit to Alcatrtaz and walks through Golden Gate Park and over the Bridge from Sausolito which we got to by ferry. The sites in San Francisco are superb and it has so much history. We would recommend a visit to the Winhester Mystery House in neerby Santa Carla which is just over an hours train ride away on the CalTrain. Also a vist to Macy's and a meal at The Cheesecake Factory is not to be missed. The ONLY negative we have is that there was a little bit of noise from the road outside the hotel, early in the moring on two occasions, according to my wife, although I slept through.

Part of this property is given over to time share and we thought this may be the opportunity for a sales pitch but this proved not to be the case.

Our room was very big and had all the additional facilities of a small suite.

I was tired so I didn't want to wait for someone to come but i phoned down to reception and told them. They were not apologetic and were happy for me to leave a note for the cleaner the next morning. Which I did and still no apology! When I asked at the front desk for directions I was never informed that the concierge was upstairs. It was interesting how you would stand there and wait then when they were free they would not walk towards you and ask if they could help just look at you and wait until you walked over to them! Interesting approach to customer service. When I came before there were pastries and coffee upstairs each morning. I contacted them before my arrival to ask whether or not they supply anything gluten free and i was not advised then that this facility no longer available. I also remembered the sauna and spa being a welcome addition so my friend and I looked forward to this. However when we spoke to the concierge who showed us how to use the controls even he did not tell us the the sauna no longer worked! So we sat there for half an hour like two stuffed lemons getting chilly! The morning I was leaving to catch the plane to the Uk was the morning of the first flight disruptions due to the volcanic ash. The lobby had a kiosk where you can use the internet but the room was locked and the key could not be found! Eventually they broke into the room and we queued to contact our airlines.

The bathroom is a little dated but adequate, has had a facelift but will need gutting and replacing in a few years. (How much water do standard USA toilets require?)

However, \"certain people,\" are a little bit shorter and found it infuriating to have to continually ask me to put things in, take them out or else drag a chair across the room, not an option for the less able bodied. It is large enough to hold a big laptop.

There is free wifi, which is not password protected. No chance of having your laptop screen-shot by a thief then! It's OK with a computer, not so great with an iPhone and the bandwidth and stability of the connection is poor. Skype calls were problematic. The 'club' level is at the top of the hotel and has tea/coffee facilities, nice armchairs and some pleasant views. it also has a concierge service that takes 5% commission and presumably then would seek a tip. We didn't use them, the trips they recommend are more expensive and appear little different from the ones we chose and booked elsewhere. The spa and gym are small and almost deserted. Beware the spa pool, there was a high concentration of chemical in it when I was there. There are a number of good restaurants in the area, I have reviewed some of them on TripAdvisor. Didn't eat in their restaurant, which does not have a great reputation. There is parking on site.

We ended up microwaving coffee mugs of water to make the formula, we did the best we could but it was a pain and there should be a kettle or a big bowl they had that was microwave safe available. other then that we will be returning to san fran in a few years and will stay here again!!!", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "tourist2468", "ReviewID": "UR65643515", "Content": "We live in the East Bay but often travel across the bridge to spend a few days in San Francisco!

When one became free we were checked in early and fast. It was wonderful after the long flight to finally be there and to be greeted with a smile was nice. When we got up to our room it was a wonderful surprise. I have traveled to other big cities and most do not have this size of room. King size bed, couch and chair, small desk, little kitchen. What more could you want. The kitchen was a bonus. First thing we wanted to do was get some groceries for breakfast, so down to the front desk to ask where a good grocery store was. The man at the front desk was very helpful and directed us to a bunch of different options and gave great directions on how to get there. The location was fantastic. We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go, even to the Legion of Honor (which is about 6 miles from the hotel). The cable cars are 1 block from the front door and the bus system is right out the front door. The cable car line that is close goes right to Market Street and all the way to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf making it a very convenient and fun way to travel. The Donatello is also right by Union Square which is the shopping district in San Francisco. The only thing is that there is a dance club, Ruby Skye, right across the street. This was not a problem for us because after a long day walking in the sun we powered down at night and slept right through the weekend noise. During the week the streets around the hotel are quiet at night but we were woken by street noise around 8 am each morning. This was fine because we could get up and get going to see the beautiful city. We did not use all the amenities they had to offer at the hotel but we did check out a few. The hot tub is very small and I would not want to sit in it with more than 4 people total in there. But it was nice and warm and wonderful after walking all day. The restaurant was fantastic. It was small but the food was great and the service just as good. My boyfriend is a chef and he recommended that other guests check it out while they were there. The lounge has nightly jazz and it is very good. It gets very full and we didn\u2019t get to sit and listen in the lounge but we went down to the lobby and listened from the couches. On our last night we wanted to go for a very nice romantic dinner and saw a restaurant on the waterfront that we thought would be nice. We did not have time to go in and make a reservation so we went to the concierge upstairs in the hotel and asked him to make a reservation for us. He immediately picked up the phone and called. Within a couple minutes we had dinner reservations at the place we wanted and the time we wanted. Every day we left the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on the door and one day housekeeping did come into our room while we were out. A nice surprise to come to a clean room but it did make me feel a little uncomfortable to think that they didn\u2019t abide by the sign on the door or our request I put in at the front desk to not have housekeeping enter our room except on certain days.

However the bed sheets were not crisp being a little gray and wrinkled. Don't want to \"dis\" this hotel as it is more than adequate and a good value. However, excellent really is a stretch.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "iversonj88", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Staff, Great Amenities and Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "iversonj88", "ReviewID": "UR59951278", "Content": "I was extremely pleased with my stay at the Donatello in San Francisco this past week. They had a variety of \"unexpecteds\" that made the stay outstanding. To start, the staff at check-in made a fine impression, but then the relatively slow elevator bummed me out (I got over it later). I got to my very clean room, but felt so-so on it- the decor was nice but not particularly luxurious, the view was only decent, and overall it was somewhat forgettable, though very spacious. I will say I really didn't like the shower. But, everyday after returning from perusing the city, our lights were on, the curtains had been drawn, and there were mints on our pillows- it was awesome. HOWEVER, from this initial impression on the stay got better and better. We went to the club house, where they have complimentary wine and cheese tasting opposite their excellent fitness center- it housed updated and slick machines and a beautiful coed hot tub area, coupled with saunas separate for the boys and girls. Further, the concierge can be found on this level and they were all amazing- the best I've come across. We got a variety of recommendations on restaurants and activities that were all enjoyable, plus they got us a reservation to a VERY exclusive restaurant that we had contacted not an hour before and were told it was full. From here we went down to the excellent bar/ Zingari restaurant. Happy hour had very good pricing, and while I didn't get a full meal, the appetizers we tried out were delicious, if slightly small on portions. The bartender made me the best Tom Collins of my life, and as we continued to return over the next few nights, we had great conversation, all my variety of drinks were made fast and better than the last, and I felt like my patronage was truly appreciated- really the bartender was excellent. Further, they had live jazz music scheduled for every single night- maybe not the best singers in town, but they were all very enjoyable and it made a great atmosphere. The location of this hotel is about as good as it comes, very satsified. While the rooms were very comfortable, it was the unparalleled staff that made this stay fantastic. Its not like I sat around the hotel for 6 hours a day, but I spent a good amount of time here and it was one of the highlights of my trip. I travel pretty regularly and this beats most other places I have ever stayed, probably all of them- and the price was phenomenal. I can't recommend it highly enough because you will really feel like an important customer, and also reap a heightened experience of the city because of the resources they make available to you.

I was also impressed by the reviews on TripAdvisor, and the location (~1 block from Union square, about 4 blocks from BART). I was not disappointed. LOCATION: I was attending a conference that took place in Moscone center and in several other hotels in the city. The Donatello is about 8 blocks from Moscone center, but it is a nice walk through downtown SF, with lots of high-end shops to look at along the way. The Donatello doesn't have a continental breakfast, but that is OK with me. There are lots of little coffee shops and diners in the area to get breakfast. If you want to get to the Fisherman's wharf area, the Donatello is only a few blocks from the Cable car line. Being close to BART means that you can easily get to and from the airport inexpensively, or travel to other parts of the Bay area (Berkeley, Oakland, etc). ROOM: My room was large with a King Size bed and a Queen size hideaway. There was a separate nook with the closet, a chest of drawers, mirror for dressing. It was nice to be able to keep all of my clothes etc. in this nook rather than clutter up the main part of the room. The closet had a safe that was easy to operate and worked well for storing my laptop. There was also an iron and ironing board. There is no real desk for working, but I set my computer on the coffee table and worked from the couch, which was OK, but someone wanting to do serious long-term work might not be happy. The free-WiFi worked well, if a bit slow. There were also spare outlets around which I appreciated. The TV had a good size screen. I really appreciated the fact that the refrigerator was NOT stocked with anything. That way I could buy a few groceries at a nearby store and use the fridge. There were also a few plates, bowls, glasses, utensils etc., and a small microwave so if you are on a budget and don't want to eat all your meals at a restaurant, you can easily stock in some provisions for breakfast and lunch. BATHROOM: Spotless and well appointed. SERVICE: The staff were all friendly and helpful. I wanted to continue working out while on my trip, so I talked to the concierge. (Somewhat unusually, the concierge is located on the top floor \"club\". ) The concierge recommended a run along the waterfront which was great -- although you have to run about a mile through town to get down to the waterfront, but after that it is a great running route. GENERAL AMENITIES: There is a nice little workout room on the top floor with a treadmill, stairmaster, and various small weight machines. The \"club\" on the top floor also has a room with plush chairs/sofas and a wide assortment of teas, hot chocolate, coffee etc. The \"business center\" is a bit of a joke -- just about the size of a large phone booth containing one computer and a printer. But it was adequate (just barely) for me to get my online boarding pass for my airline flight.

But I didn't hear a lot of street noise from the 5th floor. The hotel staff were friendly and responsive. The rooms are large and we lucked out by getting a terrace room. It's not luxurious but it's clean, spacious, and you can't beat the price. My only criticisms would be that my teen son found the sofa bed to be uncomfortable so there was some complaining. I understand that they have cots also, so that might have been better. However, I found the king bed to be comforable. Also, I am surprised it is highly-rated for business as there was no proper business desk and chair which is typical in hotels. You either sat on a low bench at a table, or on the couch with a low table, to work on a laptop. Or you sat with it on your lap. We stayed for five nights so this was bothersome. also, they don't have breakfast anymore which is too bad. we did some breakfasts in the room but also had a few expensive diner breakfasts nearby. I thought the hotel restaurant was a bit expensive - $9 for gelato one night -- but they do have happy hour with half price appetizers. I found SF to be generally an expensive city - restaurants, museums, etc. More expensive than New York and Washington. one place that we liked for a reasonable dinner was Postrio at 545 Post Street, just next door. they had a bar menu that was tasty and perfect for a light meal. Having the microwave, sink and fridge in the room was handly. they should provide dishwashing liquid and dish towels though. I did wonder if dishes were properly cleaned by the housekeeping staff. All in all, if you aren't too fussy and you don't require top notch furniture, linens, etc., you will be happy here.

It would have been nice to hang up our coats on when we came in from the rain. :) Also I really liked how close The Donatello was to everything we needed such as shopping, food, drugstore, Starbucks. The concierge, which was also very helpful, gave us maps and suggestions for activities and nearby restaurants. We ate at a couple of those restaurants and the food was wonderful. Although we didn't pay for parking with the hotel, there was another parking structure right next door that was a little cheaper ($27 including tax) for 24 hr parking with in/out priveledges.

With an ideal location (one block from Union Square, 10 mins to Fisherman's Wharf by cab and six minutes from AT&T Park), you would think this small, European boutique-style hotel would cost an arm and a leg, but it does not. I paid about $125 a night and it felt like a $300 a night hotel. Rooms are very spacious and there is a kitchenette in room. The hotel is very quiet, and the staff bends over backwards to make your stay the very best experience. Free internet is in every room. Wolfgang Puck coffee was a nice choice of coffee. Bathrooms are quite large. Ironing board, iron, blow dryer, coffee maker, microwave, cereal bowls, and a really nice extra comforter are all in the rooms. The bed was very comfortable. Nice touches include a personal wake-up call, not automated. The first wake-up call I received was funny, because I was half-asleep when the phone rang. The front desk called back a few minutes later just to make sure I had woken up! They knew I had not. The hotel has an Italian restaurant down stairs called Zingari, and while I didn't eat there, it was full both nights. There is a continental breakfast every morning, and it's better than most offerings of this type of breakfast. Fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, eggs, pastries, English muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, an assortment of juices and more await you for ten dollars. For the tourist who is not familiar with San Francisco, here's one important point: the hotel's front entrance is facing Mason, not Post Street. So coming from the East Bay, after you turn left on Geary, you turn right on Taylor, right on Post and when you hit the corner of Post and Mason....turn right on Mason. The hotel's entrance is about 20 feet down with a blue canopy out front. it's confusing- it looks like the hotel is on Mason. Parking at the hotel is $28 per 24 hours with in and out privileges, but here's something to think about: they ran an early bird special both days I was there. In by 9:30 AM, out by 6 PM,and it's $10. That's a steal in San Francisco proper. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. You can't beat the price, the service is fabulous and it's very quiet. I'm guessing there are only ten rooms per floor, so you don't hear a lot of people in the hallways. The location is superb--you are walking distance from some great restaurants, including Morton's The Steakhouse which is a half a block down on Post on the left side.

Check in was great and a very helpful front desk person offered me a larger room on the street or a smaller room in the back on a terrace. I chose the terrace room which was still plenty roomy. The weather was gorgeous and we had a table and chairs out on an attractive plant-filled terrace. This is all one block from Union Square. Unheard of. The Donatello is a time share so rooms come with a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. They supply a few more things than a standard sf hotel room since people tend to stay for longer periods.

The microwave, fridge, DVD player, complimentary high speed internet and 2 big beds (two adults can sleep on each bed comfortably) are advantages for family travelers. The hotel location and proximity to pretty much everything a San Francisco tourist can wish for is superb! I have been to 4 star and 5 star hotels before and the facilities/services I received from the Donatello were comparable and in some cases even exceeded what I experienced in those higher star hotels. In my opinion, if the lobby and reception area is renovated and remodeled to a more modern style and if the carpets and wallpapers of the floor corridors are updated, then the Donatello definitely deserves 4 stars or higher.

Desk with chair and lamp. Also had 2 additional lamps and bedside/sofa-side tables. Also, club level lounge. It had coffee, tea, hot chocolate, hot water, tables and chairs to sit, eat, relax. We brought our lunch up there on a warm, sunny day. The doors to outside deck were open. Very nice. Useful and quiet. Saw a few people working on their laptops here also. Also had a wine and cheese hour from 4-5pm which looked to be well attended. Small gym on club level floor. Stayed here Nov. 3-8. Great location. One block to cable cars. Bus stop outside. One block to the heart of Union Square. Cafes, restaurants very close, same block or one to two block walk. Plenty of stores for shoppers. Lots to do in San Francisco. Hotel very well priced considering its location, room size, amenities, etc. Very nice room to come back to at the end of a day of sightseeing. Would very definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this hotel. Our first visit to San Francisco. Loved the city. Loved the hotel. Only suggestion. Request a higher level floor to be away from sounds of the jazz music in the 2nd floor restaurant if you prefer quiet.

A great deal of energy flows through this area, as well as the accompanying noise. So think of yourself as being part of a daily performance art exhibit including laughing, yelling people, honks, bus brakes and bums. It's quieter during the work week but spikes on the weekends. For the most part, it was invigorating. However, when you want to 'turn it off', the huge single-pane windows can only hold back so much - although they do partially compensate by opening a crack to let in the brisk air. It can be especially rancorous when the beer bottles start to fly or your neighbor uses the powerful plumbing (Mgmt: try looking into some hammer arresters). If you can deal with the hubbub, you will be treated with a nicely sized room with all of the necessities but not much in the way of trendy furniture (or calming color choices - unless you are a Bears or Gators fan). Beds are just to my liking - not too hard and not too soft. Yes, there is an icebox, safe, and wet bar. As you will typically find in this great city, service is great and friendly. Getting to your room is always a snap w/ two quick elevators and short hallways. For the money, you probably can't beat it, but it's not for the overly picky or sensitive tourist set that shouldn't be despoiling the city anyways.

The front desk even gives you little maps with your key card to help find your way around town which was invaluable. The free continental breakfast was a bit light on healthy fare, but it was as advertized.

Several fifth floor rooms shared a common terrace, but we were afraid that the street noise at that level might be more of a problem. The concierge (Peter) suggested we eat at Colibri, a wonderful restaurant serving Yucatan specialties, rather than the more typical fare one finds at most Mexican restaurants. The food was delicious, and the restaurant is located just around the block. Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived.

This was our first time in SF, so I cannot compare to other places. The room (King, standard) was of sufficient size (400 sf) which I hear is a rarity in the city. The location is downtown amid the tall buildings. It is very close to Union Square and all methods of public transit. I chose the deal that included parking. I highly recommend this unless you are familiar with SF and know \"where\" to park already. Otherwise, Donatello is part of a property network that offers comps if you to listen to their sales pitch for an hour. Parking was one of the comps. We didn't do it, since I had parking in the deal already. In a city of this size, night time noise is expected and SF does not disappoint. We were 10th floor though I'm sure we could have been 1000th floor and it wouldn't have mattered. No biggie for me, I hope I didn't disturb the street life with my snoring. The city is busy and safety was of no real concern until dusk and later. When the throngs of people with permanent residences thin out, things looked a little tough a couple of times. There are some begging homeless, but I found them no more of a nuisance than the people that hand out girl cards in Las Vegas. Don't make eye contact and keep moving. In their defense, I saw a number of them giving directions. This is a characteristic of the city - not the hotel. I did not see anyone \"living\" near the hotel at night. You want service? You got it! We were immediately checked in and dished off to the concierge for a warm welcome and some useful information. Special mention of Ed (It's always Monday at the Donatello) at the desk, Sarah the concierge, and Joe the bellman. I'm sorry I don't remember the valet, but top notch there, too. Sarah was spot on with restaurant recommendations two out of three times (Fino's downtown and Alioto's on the wharf). Even the third was good - just not \"San Francisco\" good. The room also included a complimentary continental breakfast, available from 7:00 to 9:30. We were 0-2 on finding anything other than a muffin or a banana / apple. This was a bit of a disappointment (which I have also seen in other reviews). Sheesh, get a big fridge, have some cereals, pastries, jams, jellies, fruits, bagels, cream cheese - you know, the standards - and have enough to last the entire 2 1/2 hours.

That being said, we travel frequently as a family so I am familiar with similar such options in general. The valet parking package for an extra $20 a day is simply unbeatable in THIS city and there were no issues in that regard. I found other places charging $30-$50+ per night, so as \"locals\" making the trip from Monterey, we really had no options other than bring the car and were pleasantly surprised with it. The room itself was fairly spacious, but the layout a bit inefficient. This may have been due to being next to the elevator, but for the amount of space, separate living and sleeping areas would have been nice. The sofabed was located in the same room as the bed, so no luck in being able to put the kids to sleep at a different time. The furnishings are in a modern blue and tan decor, and the tv was nice so we still enjoyed the room and found it a pretty good value. Free wireless internet was also included and worked without issue. A small fridge and microwave were also included. We stayed on the sixth floor on a Friday -Sunday on Mother's Day weekend and found outside/street noise to be very prevalent at night with Saturday noise levels being enough to disturb sleep repeatedly. This may be common for hotels at Union Square as there are several night clubs in the area. I don't blame the hotel for this, but may be a consideration for travelers. Within hotel noise was not really an issue, even by the elevator, with only a rare loud grouping passing by. Other than the night noise, everything about this hotel was pleasant. Staff was friendly and attentive, the property clean, and the value for the space is outstanding. I would definitely come back if it was just my wife and myself, but might look for the quieter financial district when bringing children or perhaps insist on a higher floor to see if that alleviates the issue. Finally, a few notes about the trip itself to help others. First, skip the cable cars. Yes, I know that they sound like a romantic experience but the reality is long lines and packed cars, so you are far more likely to be viewing another rider's behind than parts of the city. For the same price ($5 a person) you can get a limo from Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf. If you absolutely must get on one, you will likely need to get on at either end of the line as we saw people repeatedly be told no room at each stop. Second, go to touristy spots early. We went to Pier 39 at opening (10 AM) and without the crowds, is actually a great place for sightseeing and to take the kids. By 1-3, the crowds are there and expect waits for a lot of stuff. Same goes for the Exploratorium. We got there at 10 on a free day expecting the worst, and again, not too bad for the first hour or two. Then the crowds commence. From a practical standpoint, we found 2-3 hours sufficient to view each. We also did the 1 hour Bay Cruise and found that enjoyable. Bring your jacket though. All in all, a very nice stay-cation and well worth the weekend.

I got a room on the 5th floor with a little terrace, but in Feb it was of no use. It was too close to street level (the noise was too much), and I didn't have a very good sleep that night. When I walked into the room I found it to be tiny, and the carpet and bathroom a bit tired. I asked at the front desk if I could get another room, and the the girl left a note for the day staff to set me up with a *better* room (she claimed there would be none available until the next morning) . The next morning I headed downstairs and talked to Jesus (yes that's his name) and he was very nice, and relocated me and my bags (while I was out) to the 10th floor. The room there was mich nicer, however the noise was still problematic, but not as bad. There was some kind of shrill that kept coming from across the street, and it occurred to me on my last night that it's the doorman (I think) of the hotel across the street, using a whistle to hail cabs. It was rather annoying, but if you kept all the windows closed I managed to get some sleep. The cleaning staff kept opening the windows every day, so I had to keep closing them. Oh yeah...the maids knock on your door at 8:00 a.m. !!! which is incredibly stoopid...so you need to leave the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out, or expect to be waken up, and they will come in unless you go to the door to tell them to go away ! The shower-head was a disaster. You cannot adjust the pressure, and instead of a nice \"shower\", it bolted out like a firehose, and I literally had to get on my hands and knees in the tub to keep my scalp from blowing off from the water pressure (it was the same type of shower-head in both rooms I was in, so I suspect it's the same all over the hotel). It was also too low vertically. If you're 6 feet or taller, you'd have to be bending over regardless. Either way...you'll be on your hands and knees to shower, so good luck with that ! The breakfast room on the \"Club Level\" (same floor as the gym) was nice enough, and the continental style food was fine. Good coffee, bagels and pastries ! There is only seating for about 10 people though, and the hotel has about 20 floors...so you do the math. After one attempt, I just took the food to go after that. Once I just went up to get it and came right back down to my room with a paper plate of food. The front desk staff and the doormen were great though, they were very accomodating in listening to concerns, and orfering airport shuttles. They also have a map pad that is handy for when you're heading out at the strart of your day. I got a new sheet every day, and never managed to get lost ! The beds are hard to describe, but they are very comfortable, and linens were good. The rooms have FREE Wi-Fi, so I was happy about that. I could check my email and FaceBook every night without getting gouged with extra fees ! The price I paid was based on a \"recession special\" and for San Fran it was pretty good ($620. for 5 nights), so there is value for the money ~ I was happy once I got the 2nd room, otherwise my stay there would of been a negative one I think. It's at a good downtown location, just a block from Union Square, and a couple from Market St. (major shopping). You need transportation down to the wharf (waterfront) area, but that's Ok. I pre-bought a 2 day \"On/Off\" double-decker tour bus ticket, and it's main stop is at Union Square, so my transporation around town was taken care of, and I got the narration as I went ! All the \"On/Off\" tour bus companies stop at Union Square, so all good there - I hightly recommed them !..they only stop at the major tourist stops/areas all over town (including both sides of the Golden Gate Bridge), and you get a narration as you go...I only took cabs at night after the tour bus's stopped (after 5 p.m.).

The Donatello would likely get my business again, but keep in mind the above, and the fact that the actual rooms do not look as nice as their website.

Although the hotel is part of the Shell Vacations Club, anyone can stay there. The staff at the hotel were friendly, courteous, accommodating (E.G. Late Check Out), overall \u201cAwesome\u201d. The hotel was very clean & well kept. Both our rooms were Hugh compared to some rooms I have stayed in San Francisco & included a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, coffee, utensils, etc. The room had a pull out sofa which was larger than normal & the king size bed was awesome. There is lots of storage space for your clothes, either in drawers or in a closet. The bathrooms were a good size which I think could accommodate someone in a wheelchair, but if you are someone who needs wheelchair access I would suggest you contact the hotel just to make sure. All rooms have flat screen TV's, CD & DVD players. There are windows in the room that do open just enough so that a child can't fall out, which I like as I prefer fresh air over a ventilation system, however it did have both. With the windows open I did sometime notice the noise at night but I did have the option of closing the window plus you are in San Francisco what can one expect. The hotel provides a FREE, yes free, continental breakfast every morning, which included bagels, muffins, pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, orange juice which was good enough to get you through the morning. On Friday afternoons they also provide a FREE, yes free, 2 hr wine & cheese tasting on the Club floor which is at the top of the hotel where the continental breakfast is provided each morning & where there is a small but adequate gym, co-ed whirlpool & sauna\u2019s in each of the change rooms, which also have showers. The Gym, whirlpool, sauna's & change rooms were VERY well kept. The hotel is conveniently located about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the BART's Powell St station, which is San Francisco\u2019s light rail subway system that runs from San Francisco International Airport & only costs a mere $5.35 US per person one way & takes approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get from the airport to the Powell St station, which I highly recommend as its quick & cheap plus I think the BART is the cleanest public transit system I've been on in years, in fact there were people walking through the train on our way to the hotel picking up garbage, talk about impressive. The overall location of the hotel was great, close to Union Square for those who like to shop, lots of restaurants, China town was a few blocks away & access to the BART, MUNI, buses & street cars were only a few minutes away. I took a street car (not a Cable car, they are $5.00 per person) from one of the many stations located on Market St ( which is which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel) to Fisherman's Warf & it was only $1.50 per person one way & the transfer I was given was good for almost 3 hrs. At the hotel both the Concierge desk on the main floor or the one on the Club floor can make arrangements for all your travel needs (Tours, Restaurants, etc) & at reasonable prices. One thing to keep in mind parking in San Francisco is not cheap, so if you can get by without renting a car try using there transit systems, it\u2019s awesome. This hotel was great for me (a 46 yr old professional male) & my friends, in short, if you want a clean, friendly, well located & reasonably priced hotel, try The Donatello. I hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.

And while some other reviews recommended asking for a room away from the street to reduce the noise.....my room was on the 8th floor and facing the street and I only heard noise outside at night a few times (more so during the weekends than during the week.) The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows were great (two things I'm very picky about!) Turn-down service each night with chocolates left at your bed side. I did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel because there were so many wonderful restaurants to choose from within one or two blocks from the hotel. Great location...near Union Square....about four blocks from the BART station at Powell street. There was only one thing that I had an issue with....and that was the wireless internet service. The signal in my room was too low to ever connect to my laptop. However I was able to use the hotel guest computer the few times that I needed it.....plus I used my computer all day long at my work location so not having a computer in my room was not a huge issue - although it would have been nice to have during the weekend when I was planning my stops at some of the tourist spots. I only went to the breakfast buffet on the weekend. Not much there other than pastries, bagels, juice and coffee.....but again, plenty of restaurants close by and if you're there on a Saturday morning, the best bet for breakfast is the Farmer's Market at Ferry Plaza.

We booked here after looking around the web for quite a while, trying to find a hotel room in the right price range and yet also big enough for our stay. My husband and I were traveling with our 9-month old baby and needed a room large enough to fit a crib off to the side. The Donatello fit the bill perfectly. It is not the most luxurious hotel room I have ever been in, and the bathroom was a bit on the duller side, but it is clean, large (ESPECIALLY for SF), and pretty well appointed. There was even a little foyer area where we could put the crib so that our baby could sleep in the quiet dark while we had some lights on in the room. It might not be what you're looking for in a honeymoon suite, but it's a perfect fit for a business trip, a nice little get-away on a budget or a family vacation. Our hotel room was NOTHING like what the previous user's was like, with mold and peeling paint. If it were, we would not have stayed. The crib DID seem a little old and I will warn you to BRING YOUR OWN CRIB SHEET! The crib sheet was so big and loose it was a potential suffocation hazard and we did marvel that the hotel was risking a lawsuit, not to mention a child accident. Fortunately, we had own own. We really appreciated the sideboard with the empty refrigerator and the sink. It helped a lot with being able to bring in food, keeping formula and the washing and rinsing of the baby bottles. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and quite willing to put up with our check-in confusion. The maids did a terrific job everyday. One problem: The walls are somewhat thin. We could not hear other people for the most part, but my mother stayed in the room next to ours and, when the baby was having a particularly fussy night, my mother could hear her crying. Short of a screaming baby, however, not a lot of noise gets through. And, as we didn't receive any complaints, we're assuming it wasn't horrible for other guests.

Is there another hotel Donatello in SF? This is a nice hotel? A nice lobby? There is hardly any lobby at the hotel and it is as simple as your can imagine. People who wrote that must have been sitting in the the lobby of the JW Marriott across the street and not the Donatello. As far as the beautiful rooms, maybe we just got unlucky and got a bad room but we checked other rooms from outside while the doors were opened for cleaning and they all looked basically the same. I have lived in SF for many years so I know the area and was not surprised by all the beggars and other bad and ugly elements that show up, mostly late at night, in that area. What I did not expect was to stay in such a disgusting room with paint peeling and mildew. The people at the reception are very nice but were totally ineffective. We arrived at the hotel two hours before the check-in time. Jesus, who somebody recommended for a review and a raise, and maybe he deserves it, welcomed us and checked us in. He took our mobile number and said that he will try to have us checked in as soon as possible and will call us when the room is ready. We never received the call and upon our return to the hotel we found out that the room was ready but that they forgot to call us - no big deal. What was a concern to us was the fact that the concierge could not find our luggage. It took him several minutes to realize that his colleague has left them in a conference room near the lobby - the door to that room was unlocked and anybody could have entered the room and take the luggage from there. With our hearts still pounding we took the elevator (dirty and in need of renovation) to the ninth floor. Our room was away from the street, which is highly recommended in this area, with a view of a car rental place and some other shady hotels and apartments in the same block - just next to the ice-maker and the door to the maintenance room - not such a big deal unless you want to sleep late in the morning. The worse part was the bathroom - SEE some pics attached. I called the \"effective\" and nice people at the reception and asked to speak to the manager. \"no problem - he will get back to you very soon\". I called 3 times and left 3 messages and I never received a call back from the manager.

Based on TA advice we requested, previous to our arrival, a room on the highest floor and on the backside of the hotel to get away from the noise. We were given room 1011 (Floors 12 & 14 are apparently VIP/expensive rooms). Our view was poor as expected, but with the AC on, we never heard any noise at night, and very little during the day. Loved it. After getting information on activities, we were given an offer to see Muir Woods free if we sit through an information spiel \u201cupdating us on using our benefits\u201d. No thanks! The ROOM was an ugly orange and blue as expected, but was spacious and comfortable with enough space to put away our clothes and \u201cstuff\u201d with ease. 30\u201dx 20\u201d refrigerator, small microwave, toaster, coffee maker, condiments, a couple plates, cups and silverware; nice 34-36\u201d widescreen TV, DVD player, mini music center; USA Today every morning with the San Francisco Chronicle available in the lobby. INTERNET: We used it everyday and never experienced any problems. The BATHROOM was a little smaller than expected. Only 5x8 including the tub/shower combo. The whole room is well planned, except for the waste of space across from the bathroom. If the room entrance had been moved from the center, the bathroom could have been at least 50% larger. The toilet flushed very loud. The BED was reasonably comfortable, but a little hard. We are spoiled with a foam mattress at home. We ended up putting the extra sofa sleeper sheets from the closet on top of the bedding/comforter, and then covering ourselves with the extra sheet and blankets. We then slept more comfortably. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: See pics - Reg & Nonfat milk/various coffees & teas/tasty OJ; good donuts/pastries/muffins; bananas/apples/oranges; bagels/cream cheese/butter/jams; Many TA folks have complained about the breakfast. Perhaps some do not understand that this is a classic continental breakfast \u2013 not a buffet. Nonetheless, how hard is it to add little cereal boxes? And regardless of anything else, we are in the year 2008 and it is just very poor not to have yogurt, which is a staple of quick breakfasts today. If you get in there in the first hour, food selection is fine. After that, the selection diminishes quickly. The selection also seemed to diminish during the week from Monday to Thursday, but then Friday and Saturday were decent. Outside there were 2 tables with 4 & 2 chairs, and also 2 lounge chairs. With a light jacket it is very nice to enjoy your meal outside. Inside there are 4 caf\u00e9 tables with 3 chairs each, and also 4 sofa chairs and one sofa. Seating is hit and miss after about 7:30am. We ate there a couple of times, otherwise we just brought our food back to the room. FITNESS CENTER: Very minimal EQUIPMENT: 1 stair stepper, 1 stationary cycle, 1 treadmill, set of free weights; meager universal machine, scale and water dispenser. Small but adequate separate SAUNAS. You may need to turn it on and then wait 15 minutes or more for it to warm up as I did on all 3 occasions I used it. The aluminum JACUZZI is brand new and a bit small. The first time I could barely fit in with several other people in it. The next 2 occasions, there was never more than 1 other person. They have towels, locker room, showers etc. LOCATION IS EXCELLENT! Just a block from Union Square and 5 blocks from Powell and Market. You can get half-price tickets at TIX in Union Square for numerous plays, comedy clubs and entertainment venues. 1 block from Biscuits & Blues where we listened to some great blues. Ruby Skye club across the street. 1 1/2 blocks from Colibri Mexican Restaurant which was great. 1 1/2 blocks from the American Conservatory Theater which is a very nice theater where we saw \u201cRock n\u2019 Roll\u201d. 1 1/2 blocks from the Curran Theater which was a decent theater in which we saw \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d. 1 Block from Honey Honey Caf\u00e9 & Crepery which is great for a sandwich or burger and excellent for an omelet or a crepe. Innumerable eating, shopping and entertainment establishments very close by. MASSAGE 4 blocks from the Union Square Stress Reduction Center (on Sutter before Kearny) where we both got an excellent massage for $50 per hour \u2013 if you don\u2019t want to spend a ridiculous $105 per hour at this hotel. If your calves hurt like ours, this was almost a necessity. IF YOU WALK places like we love to do, and you are here for more than a couple days, we highly suggest that you take the cable car or buses when going upward or downward. We both jog/walk a couple times a week. Nonetheless, walking up and down the hills now and then during our stay caused both of us significant and unusual discomfort in our legs and shins after a couple of days. We used the sauna and Jacuzzi only 3 times, but we needed to use it every single day. TRANSPORTATION: Unless you are traveling away from San Francisco, driving is completely unnecessary and probably frustrating. Public transportation is fun and inexpensive. The MUNI pass is only $24 for seven days. We highly recommend the City Pass for $59 which includes the 7-day MUNI pass and the $25 admission to the California Academy of Sciences (a MUST SEE!), a 1-hour bay cruise which is cool, and a few other good attractions. Last year we stayed at the Le Meridien Hotel on Battery Street near Embarcadero Plaza and Pier 1. It is a better hotel with a great location too. However, given a choice of the two at the same price, we would stay at the Donatello because the location is the best, and the free internet which we used to explore SF every day.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cFelt welcome\u201d", "Author": "Den08", "ReviewID": "UR20598371", "Content": "This was my second stay at the Donatello.

If you are returning from the waterfront, you get off at Post which is only one block away. Pleasantly surprised at the large size of the room and the amount of drawers and shelves (double closet with safe and 3 drawers at the entrance), also each side of the TV stand opens up to about five shelves. We unpacked completely as we were staying 6 nights and did not have to live out of our suitcase. There is a microwave, toaster, bar fridge, coffee maker, sink and glasses, plates and cutlery provided. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful with any of our questions. Good continental breakfast included - excellent choice at 7:30 a.m., however by 9:00 a.m., it can be picked over. The coffee maker in the room makes one large coffee, but that wasn't a problem - I just went up each morning and brought two large cups down to the room from the Club Floor. Coffee is available 24 hrs. so if you sleep in, you miss the food but can still get coffee. We were on the street side (facing the Marriott Hotel) and it was somewhat noisy, but we are sound sleepers, and it didn't bother us. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not facing the street. Several very nice restaurants within walking distance and at all price levels.

We used Alamo and the wait was four hours to get the pre-booked car (although they ran out of cars and we were upgraded). Hertz next door to the hotel also had an extremely long queue of people waiting to pick up a car at mid-day. This is apparently a common problem in the city during the summer.

But we were not hassled at all. Also the fitness center is a tad anemic; just three cardio machines and one weight machine -- but like I said, it's free, and there are also men's and women's saunas and a co-ed jacuzzi (though that was out of service when I was there).

When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they were able to honour my request (since there are only a few select rooms with balconies). Asides from the occassional police sirens, we did not hear any noise, perhaps because of the location of the room, & the fact that the weather was cool enough for us to sleep with the windows closed. I did not get a welcome pkg upon arriving, but they called a few days later for us to pick it up. We were too busy to pick it up, so I don't know what's in it. Also, despite other guest's comments, we were never bothered about attending timeshare. The breakfast was nothing special. I say you're better off buying some cereal & milk from Walgreens & eating that each morning than eating their sugary offerings. I am also puzzled @ how they would offer just orange juice, & not a choice of juices in the morning (my boyfriend & I can't have orange juice). I have a bad back, & don't usually like hotel beds, but their bed was only second to the sleep-number beds offered @ other hotels. The location is great, you don't need to rent a car, it is very close to everything. Housekeeping vacuumed, & very thoroughly cleaned our place every day. Even our dishes were washed! Turndown service everynight was lovely to come back to after a long & tiring day of sightseeing. It rained one night, & the hotel lent us an umbrella (just ask front desk) They even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday. My boyfriend & I were also @ another hotel on this trip, but enjoyed the Donatello so much more! Tip: If you are an AAA member, check the website of the hotel direct before you book because I found booking direct with them using the AAA discount was cheaper than doing it through on-line travel sites.

We were EXTREMELY SATISFIED with our stay this March. The property is quiet, clean, all of the staff are friendly (front desk, bell desk, concierage, cleaning staff) and very helpful and the rooms are large (high ceilings) and well appointed. We did not expect the room to be as large as it was, and the king size bed was a welcome sight at the end of each day after a lot of walking. The turn down service was very nice and cleaning staff were super friendly. The mini fridge, micro wave, wet bar and in-room safe (which was free and very easy to use) came in handy. The free in-room wireless was very nice as was the flat screen TV and DVD and CD players. The location is awesome- easy to walk to dining, shopping, cable cars, bus stops, etc. This is a high class place! Nearby are Cafe Mason (good Italian food), coffee shops, a live blues place (Biscuits and Blues), a live jazz restaurant (Les Joulens), Walgreens, etc. Plenty of places to eat, drink, and socialize. Do not be swayed by occassional review comments that make light of the complimentary breakfast. The continental breakfast is fine. No, it's not a free buffet, but includes gourmet coffee, tea, fresh squeezed orange juice and pastries (muffins, scones, crossants, doughnuts) are served on the top floor (Club level) each day. We stayed 8 nights and I'd estimate that about half of the days also had fresh fruit tarts. We thought it was fine. The coffee and tea are available until late in the evening, which we found to be a nice touch. Though this is very minor, one annoying thing was the front desk concierge who asked us several times about attending a presentation about another Shell property (time share) in exchange for a free gift or car rental. It wasn't a big deal, but she asked when we checked in and called the next morning to ask us again. When I declined, she dropped it and did not ask again. The bell desk staff were very helpful in arranging a shuttle back to the airport for us and shipped a package and postcards for us. The concierge also recommended a number of tours for us. Instead of going with the Grayline large bus tours, we actually booked online with Incredible Advertures, which offered a small, 12 person van and pick up service from the hotel. Here is their website: http://www.incadventures.com/. We took two tours- the Yosemite tour and the Muir Woods & Sonoma wine tour. John, our tour guide was excellent and we'd recommend this company to others. The Donatello's super friendly staff were much appreciated.

There was a great little cafe across the street (think it was La Tezza), lots of yummy fresh food, soup was killer! The refrigerator & microwave in the room, along with the kitchen amenities made it easy to skip restaurants. Tip: go to the ferry building & get some wonderful cheese, sourdough, & some wine & have your own little feast. The Donatello has a GREAT location & easy to get to transportation...BUT make sure you buy your Muni pass at the airport, then take the BART in to Montgomery Station & walk straight down Post Street to the hotel, about 5 easy blocks. DON'T get off at Powell Street, especially dragging luggage, crowded, crazy people, and some folks begging. Always go straight down Post to Montgomery/Market, then you can catch the underground Muni to the Embarcadero & the ferry building, or catch the F-Market, the old streetcars that will take you all along Fisherman's Wharf.--although it was an easy walk down Market to the ferry building too. There are taxis right across the street from the Donatello if you need one too, fare was about $6 to the ferry building (I was running late for my Napa tour) and fare was about $9 from the end of fisherman's wharf by the Maritime Museum (my feet just couldn't take anymore walking/standing!) Although do venture down Powell to the beginning of the cable car route, fun way to see different neighborhoods & heck, you have to if you're in San Francisco!! 8-) Tip: Get a Muni pass at the airport, it will be good for the underground Muni, street cars, buses, and even the cable cars. The Underground Muni is not the same as BART, even though they share terminals, BART is the train you can take in from the airport, RT to Montgomery was $10.70 My fav. travel book: Dummies Guide to San Francisco, gave me all kinds of great tips!

Granted, the \"breakfast\" is only orange juice, coffee and rolls, but it is served in the top floor lounge with three terraces with views and free newspaper and a fireplace.

When I raised the issue the next morning that the air conditioning didn't work (nothing in the room indicated that), I was greeted with somewhat of a response of \"duh!! you were in a Terrace Room!...and a Terrace Room has no air conditioning!\" In addition, we had a service tech up to our room twice because we could get no hot water in the shower. He said he did not have the replacement part, and he could only take it apart and have it scalding hot or cold. So we had cold water ..and I mean cold water for showers. In addition, the television was barely visible with \"snowy\" reception.

The location one block from Union Square and from the theaters was good. I selected the Donatello over other high-rated boutique hotels because of the famous San Francisco hills. If you are an active mountain hiker, this criteria won't enter into your decision making. Front desk staff was efficient and professional. Concierge (lobby and club level) was friendly and helpful. Club level on the 15th floor was for guests only had the continental breakfast plus coffee/tea all day. Club level has a patio and the gym. The room was medium size with a hotel-quality king bed, end tables, amoire with 27\" TV, VCR, and mini-stereo, sofabed, coffee table, desk, and a shelving unit for the refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, wet bar, glasses, dishes, and silverware. These amenties make sense since the Donatello is also a timeshare hotel. The furniture/decor was all coordinated. The furniture had a nice, contemporary natural wood finish. All electronics had separate remote controls. The mini-stereo was appreciated for playing music. Evening turndown service is provided. The bathroom was on par for a four star hotel, though not exceptional. A hotel bathrobe was hanging ready for use in the bathroom. The lighted dressing area in front of the bathroom was flanked by the closet and a dresser matching the room furniture. A high-mounted electrical receptacle next to the dresser was handy for charging the cell phone. The closet had a room safe sized for a laptop. A few minor quibbles. The bed and linens are very good for the room rate (e.g. Marriott, Crown Plaza), but not up to the same quality as the rest of the room. The latch for the sliding door to the terrace was sometimes difficult to latch/unlatch. I am accustomed to urban noise, but if you are not, beeping car horns may be disquieting. We did not try the restaurant since we dinner plans for our wedding anniversary. Tips: (1) request a room not facing Mason street, it will be somewhat quieter, (2) request a 5th floor terrace room if you like a little sun and want to view the urbanscape, (3) downtown is safe for walking about in the evening, much better than 10-15 years ago, (4) lower level Food Emporium in the Westfield's San Francisco Shopping Centre (old The Emporium building for you old timers) is a worthy low cost lunch/dinner alternative Overall, TripAdvisor travelers came through again. The Donatello is a winner. I was very pleased with the stay. Twice in the elevator I encountered very satisfied repeat guests with strong endorsements for the Donatello's fantastic combination of luxury and value.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merced, California", "Title": "\u201cDonatello always good with exceptional staff\u201d", "Author": "lessalt", "ReviewID": "UR8268276", "Content": "We always stay at the Donatello when we can get away to San Francisco.

We drove up Saturday morning from Monterey, CA to see Spiderman 3 on the IMAX at the Metreon and to go to the nightclub Ruby Skye. We couln't have picked a better location. Period. Upon our arrival, the bellhop was curteous and very patient as I unloaded ALL the crap I had brought for my 1 night stay (you know how many shoes women like to bring!).

It was very modernly designed and the comforter on the bed was one of the softest I have slept under. We hadn't been in our room more than 10 minutes when there was a knock at the door and the maid was there to give us our complimentary bath robes. The concierge also called to say she was sorry she had missed us when we checked in, and to come down for our free maps of San Francisco (which had an AWESOME map of all the shopping places).

We could literally CRAWL home from the club if we needed to. ;) So instead of showing up at the club at 10pm to avoid the line, and then waiting until 1am for the headlining DJ to come on, we were able to drink our alcoholic beverages in our room and peek out the window every 15 minutes or so to make sure the line wasn't getting too long.

Our king room on the 12th floor was quite spacious with interesting but not overwhelmng decor (like the Monaco down and around the block)- perfectly and tastefully furnished. I like a nicely arranged room. Big means nothing if there's wasted space (Omni in Los Angeles). This room had a nice balanced aesthetic to it in terms of layout and color. It was just like home, having morning coffee on the sectional couch with feet propped on the coffee table and the sun streaming in from the south window. I loved the all-mirror entry way in the room, the Oriental brass pulls on the mirror closet doors, the variety of lighting options. The bathroom was small but I liked the marble elegance and it had plenty of amenities. The lighted magnified wall mounted make-up mirror was a great bonus. Bell hop, valet and guest service desk were very friendly and the room service prompt. Did not think that any of the service attendants were tip greedy at all. Great proximity to Union Square and theaters, entrance to Chinatown. We had a hearty walk up hill to Grace Cathedral so we didn't use the health club. Dottie's on Jones had quite the queue so we breakfasted at the Olympic Cafe. I probably won't return to the Olympic despite the tasty pancakes. Nor would I wait that long for Dottie's (go earlier or on a week day) but would have opted for Max's - always a solid choice. The only problem we had was that the hot water ran out mid-shower! Normally, that's the sort of thing that will make me immediately black list a hotel. Having Engineering look into it after the fact really doesn't warm me. The rest of the experience was so pleasant, however, that I would give this hotel another chance, asking in advance if the hot water is going to be problematical.

Our room was beside the elevators but we could not hear them. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. At no time were we approached about attending a time-share presentation and no employee ever put his hand out looking for a tip. The bell-hops were always around, friendly, helpful and just generally polite. The cleaning staff were just as nice and it was a treat to come back to the room in the evening and find the bed turned down and the proverbial chocolates on the pillow.

It was blue, yellow and orange (my husband was convinced that he could not spend another night there due to the nightmarish colour scheme!). There was a neat little kitchen area which was useful. However, The Donatello has the worst designed bathroom that we encountered in our 2.5 week, 9 hotel experience. You can barely get into the shower without sitting on the toilet and if you are above 5'3 as both my husband and I are, you literally have to bend over backwards to get your head under the shower! The location of The Donatello was just great as it was one block from Union Square. The room itself was nice and quiet which was good as we were exhausted after all that driving. Upon both arriving and leaving, we felt immense pressure from anyone who helped us at the Donatello for tips (we'd been in the US enough to know that tipping is expected) but we felt that they were almost holding out their hands the moment you spoke with them which made us feel a little uncomfortable.

The dishes, sink and fridge made this very easy. The room was a very pleasant place to spend time (while the baby napped or ate lunch, for example).

We did not use the Club level with fitness room, jacuzzi, or concierge. We did however, go up to see it and were quite pleased. We could hear street noise from our room, but it wasn't that bad. The windows all open which is nice if you like the outside air, but the in room climate control was adequate.
