There is no phone in the room to call reception, it is expensive for how awful it is (even though its likely the cheapest), and we did not feel safe there whatsoever.

This is great if you want to get a feel of what a g&y-prostituti-n hot bed is like - it was like we were on bleepin' tv! amazing! 2. There was a really cool hole in the floor - a big one - it was exciting because we don't know how far down it goes!! 3. It was exciting because it smelled like p*e and was obviously uncleaned - other people that night found used razor blades and used soap in their \"$130 room.\" 4. The bathrooms were exciting and built trust because they couldn't close since they were half ripped off (the top hing was almost entirely ripped off, probably by some cool-a5s plmp) I got to shlt in front of my date if I had to! Hahahaha, who doesn't want an excuse to do that?! 5. The excitement was sky-high because the sprinklers were cut! Fire meant certain death - eXciTiNg!!!!!! 6. If you've ever wanted to see protltutes in the wild - they are everywhere! They surround this place! Awesome! 7. There were cool razor blade marks all over from cutting up (baby asprin?!) it made it authentic and real!! Rustic! 8. They found a dead h0oker in one of the rooms a few weeks before we got there - did she die of excitement?!! 9. The bathroom floor was caving in (preparing us for our swaying cruise) and smelled like celebrity urine. Were we in a room with celebrity urine?! I hope so! I took a swab home for my collection! 10. The ice bucket was already used and dirty when we got there (I almost stole it as a momento - was it Johnny Depp who used it last?!!!?!?!??!!!) 11. They won't let you leave the premesis with the keys or you are charged an extra $10. (I assume so many people steal the keys to prove they actually were awesome enough to stay in such an awesome establishment). 12. The theme or our room - I can only assume - was \"celebrity toilets\" - it must have been because there were a bunch of used run-down toilets out our window, in front of a house that looked like it was about to fall down (movie prop??!?!!?!!?) 13. The grease-like substance which covered nearly everything was left in-tact for our enjoyment (celebrity c*m?!!!) 14. We didn't want to disturb the sheets - which were obviously used many times over by celebrities - I think a few of them had even pissed on them based on the smell!! 15. Someone (I assume they were high-profile) was bold enough to put his/her cigs out on the coffee table! Oh, boy! 16. A bald, cross-dressed (celebrity?!!) pretending to be a pr0stitute was arguing over his \"rent\" (lol) when we got there. 17. They even pay a man to dress like a pimp and pretend to be eye-f@cking your date when you come/go - just so it's exciting!!!! 18. I kinda fell for all the stagecraft - I really felt like myself or my date was actually going to get raped! I wouldn't even let her go in the hallway while I cr@pped with the door open!!! (There were \"s#x\" noises like crazy in the hallway - so authentic. We couldn't even find their speakers! So real!) 19. There was more awesomeness - but I can't divulge it all and ruin it! 20. They wouldn't give the people (who obviously thought it was a ReAL wh0rehouse) their money back! These people thought it was a scam, lol!!! 21. I'm not making any of this up - they went to that level of trouble to make sure you had the experience of a \"real new orleans wh0rehouse!\" for only $75 - $175 and up!! 22.

While going through the process of checking in, we were told that there was a $10 deposit required of all guests- the deposit is to ensure compliance to hotel rules. I was a bit turned off by this surprise fee (as it was not mentioned to me during previous communications with staff), but I could understand why such measures were necessary. On to the room - It'll help for you to know that it was 96 degrees (F), with a heat index of 110 degrees. On the second floor, where our room was located, there is NO A/C in hallway - they also keep the balcony doors open around the clock, so there's never any real relief when the weather is on \"Hell\". We enter our room - it was even more unbearable than the hallway! There is a small a/c unit of prehistoric design, which is immediately turned on upon our entry. The accomodations are meager; small room, possibly 10ft X10ft, equipped with a small bed, chair, nightstand, portion of rug, a mirror and then the bathroom. My boyfriend and I decide to give the a/c a chance to work while check out the city and, much to our dismay, the clerk informs us that THE A/C IN NOT ALLOWED TO RUN WHEN NO OCCUPANTS ARE IN THE ROOM. <-- In 100 degree heat!! We later found out that throughout the day, front desk clerks enter each room with the sole purpose of turning of a/c units! And forget the fact that it takes at least 2hours of constant running for even the most minute of temperature change to occur! Further exploration turned up dirty pillowcases; The toilet lever was ghetto-rigged ( you had to lift up and rotate level for 10 seconds or so before the commode flushed); The tub had a slow drain - I mean, this place was just awful. They don't have an ice machine - instead you must purchase ice from the front desk - $5.00 per bag! Laughable!

Our shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. yuck. The good thing I can say about the Empress is that it served its purpose well. The only time we were at the hotel was to sleep and get ready in the morning. It was very close to Bourbon street and it was cheap. When I checked out, I had no problems, but my friend who had stayed in another room at the Empress had a little trouble. They refused to give back her key deposit because she failed to turn her key in to the front desk every time we went out even though she returned the key to them upon checking out. Overall, we had an awesome trip! In the future, we probably won't stay here again, but it was definitely an unforgettable place.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat price.....sucky service AND they will trick you out of your money!!!!\u201d", "Author": "billybobbb", "ReviewID": "UR95715974", "Content": "To be perfectly honest, I wanted the cheapest price close to the quarters and agreed to the room after seeing it .

My stay ended early. The room was less than desirable and I later learned that there was no phone in the room. No way to reach the desk clerk. I wasn't pleased to be staying there as they changed my room from upstairs to down when they realized I had a dog. I asked about taking my dog on the balcony upstairs and I was told that she wasn't allowed there due to liability. This was supposed to be a pet friendly establishment. Even with all of the discomfort I knew that I signed a non-refundable contract and that I had to make the best of the accomodations. I settled in for the night and just as I fell asleep there was a knock on the door and it was a man. I was staying alone in this hotel and when I heard the knock I was startled. I immediately jumped up and asked who was there he didn't answer me and then told me to open the door. I refused to open the door and then he repeated his actions again. I got really scared when I realized that I didn't have a phone in the room to alert the desk clerk. The man knocked again and told me to open the door. I shouted out that I was not going to open the door and for him to go to the front desk. Then I took my cell phone and called my son crying and asked him to come and pick me up. It was he that alerted the desk clerk who was doing laundry when he arrived. She told him that she heard nothing and saw nothing. After he arrived and we searched to internet for another hotel to stay in. As of now I have called several times to the hotel in an effort to get a refund for something that was out of my control and to see what the owner had to say and I was told each time that someone would call me back. Finally I spoke to the owner who was rude and told me that she was going to look at the surveilence tapes after we hung up. Before we got disconnected she reinforced her position that I signed a non-refundable contract. She also asked me where I was staying assuming that I had left to stay with my son at \"his apartment\". I assured her that I had checked into another hotel and that I was not staying with my son. We got disconnected upon her inquiry as to where I was staying and as of yet I have not heard back from her. So that is my review if you want to stay here be prepared for anything that might happen knowing full well that there are no phones in the room and scant locks on the doors with no peep-holes to look out of if someone decides to knock on your door in the middle of the night and that you don't have anyway to access the desk clerk if there is an emergency. I hardly think that safety is anything that you can exchange for a reduced price. I don't think I will hear back from the owner of this so called hotel... I wish her the best of luck and it is a shame that the only way she can make a buck is by taking advantage of other's. Too bad she doesn't have the decency to refund my money as an effort of good faith and to value her reputation as the owner of the EMPRESS HOTEL!

The Empress is situated near, and it takes reasonable precautions: it has cameras, inside and outside, locks doors at 11:30pm (bring an ID to get in), recommends cabs, and so on, there are locks. It's not the best neighborhood, (nor even close to being the worst), but I had no problems walking to and fro in the day. If they recommend a cab, use it, but daytime seemed alright, and I kept with at least one other person.

Tiny window that looks out on a dilapidated building and neglected garden. We never felt threatened though, after dark we ensured taking a taxi back, which we would have done anyway regardless of where we stayed. I agree with other reviewers, this hotel is acceptable for a short stay; we changed hotels after 4 nights as we were in dire need of a bit of luxury.

But when outside you should walk with a buddy. One of my friends was mugged two blocks from the hotel and thank God he was not hurt and only lost a few dollars. It is located three blocks from the border or backside of the French Quarter and the neighborhood looks old and in need of a very good paint job. The rooms are small (we were warned of this) and I brought with me an air mattress because of the one double bed. Glad I did because the bed looks so old and used that sleeping on it may be hazardous to one's well being. The carpet looks like it should have been replaced back in 1984. The tv is a small 15 inches plus no cable tv or radio. No closet or drawers to hang clothes on. The window faces a garden consisting of an old tub and weeds. The bathroom is also small and the toilet backed up when we first used it and continued to get backed up each day of our stay. We requested our own plunger so that we could flush and plunge at the same time. The plunger was cheap and it sucked. There is no vanity or counter area in the bathroom and the towels are paper thin. There was a strange odor in the room which only got worse as our stay progressed. The staff is very friendly and helpful and will do anything to best of their ability but the owner needs to renovate this hotel big time.

But when we arrived by taxi I was concerned, I consider myself to be some what street-wise, but with my 60 year-old Mother in tow, I was afraid that this would be too much for her to bare. As soon as we went up to the front desk, I inquired about the price, AND WAS TOLD THAT THOSE ROOMS WERE NOT AVAILABLE! We were charged the going rate of $57.00! I couldn't believe the room! The only good thing I can say is that the air conditioner worked like a freezer. Oh, and \"Aimy\" who was at the front desk was very nice, and it was too bad that she had to work in a dump like that. She had to handle a bad guest who was promtly kicked out! Some of the users who claim that this is such a deal for it being cheap and close to the Quarter probably don't care if they sleep in the ditch, whitch is probably more comfortable, but I have a bad back and my Mother is not built for this sort of thing. As for the price, you can stay at plenty of places that charge $65-$75 that are less than a mile away from the action. All you have to do is search for them on a good site like this one. 1 night was ok for needing to flop until Amtrack could get it in gear, but if you want to injoy your stay with out wondering if the hotel owner is America's Most Wanted, then do some research and find yourself a better place to stay.", "Date": "July 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cDUMP\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1130979", "Content": "Dump with all caps; it should be condemned.", "Date": "July 8, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't leave my garbage at this dump\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1075676", "Content": "I found this pit on the internet...The site looked good as did the discription.
