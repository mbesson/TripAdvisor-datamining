The hotel was modern looking and clean. The staff was extremely courteous, friendly and effficient. I had two meals and both were correct and priced well for a hotel. The location was very convenient and there is easy access (walking) to a vast amount of excvellent restaurants and bars. Negatives: As mentioned before, the availability of wi-fi. Too expensive in this day and age. Also, the \"wood\" flooring in my room was peeling. I am not sure how old the hotel is, but that was not right. I did have some problems with the television, but it was fixed immediately. All-in-all it was a good value for a business hotel in an upscale area", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cupscale rooms\u201d", "Author": "hseofbel", "ReviewID": "UR124466678", "Content": "I had the need to stay one night in this hotel.

Let's start from wi-fi: you need to pay for it and you can only log one device (and nobody tells you this). Do you want to LG another device (even not at the same time)? Desk told me to buy another card! Of course I worked around (bridging). Breakfart area is a construction area with too few seats. Reception is not so welcoming and they are not proficient in English. Room are cold and noisy. Bathroom is not properly clean.
