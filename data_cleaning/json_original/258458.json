The room was booked for me and after reading reviews here I rang up well in advance to request a quiet room with aircon. Upon arrival I was checked in by a young man. He handed my my key and said nothing. I had to ask where my room was and was not told anything about the place including the included breakfast - which I discovered on my second last day. The room I was initially given was near reception, next to a stairwell and opposite the breakfast area - clearly NOT a quiet room. When I went back to reception another man abruptly told me that they were very full. He also advised me in a condescending tone that I had been upgraded, almost implying that I should be grateful for the room. I explained that I would prefer a quieter room and that I had requested one. He then gave me a key to another room. Room 26 was up a flight of stairs accessed off a back porch. Not so secure, but that didn't bother me. There is a sign on the door accessing the landing to keep the door locked at night for security - and my room was on the outside. The room was clean and comfortable, but tiny. As a business traveller staying for 5 nights, I'd assume I'd at least have a desk for a computer or do work plus a wardrobe. Unfortunately no to either. There was a chest of draws I could put my laptop on and had to sit sideways to work. All my business suits and shirts were hung over hooks with a couple of hangers provided. The bathroom was compact, but clean. A tiny shelf above the sink had a box of tissues and nice amenities. No room to put my toiletries, so had then on a side table in the bedroom. Every morning when I showered, the temperature would fluctuate dramatically and without notice (obviously depending on other occupants) from freezing cold to boiling hot. The buffet breakfast was limited but adequate. I wish when I checked in they told me about it. My colleague, who booked the room for me, rang up at one stage to complain about the room. He had been shown and selected another room for me that had a wardrobe and desk. The manager advised him that this room was under renovation or something. I also got a note that night when I returned explaining something similar and asking me to contact the manager about the matter as they were not full. clearly this was different to what I had been told at check-in.

Now, however, the hotel seems to be returning to what it does best: being a warm, welcoming home-away-from-home; offering friendly, smiling service; providing well cooked breakfasts and vastly improved dinners;having staff who seem to be enjoying their work.

Firstly the service was exceptional, the reservations team welcomes you like a close friend you have known for years. We stayed in a King Deluxe suite to celebrate the occasion, it looked like the bathroom had been recently been refurbished as it was very modern and fresh looking. The bathroom also had a bath which was very nice after a long day exploring the city (we spent the day in Manly, a quick bus ride to circular quay and then a scenic ferry trip across the harbour). We had dinner in the Hughenden Caf\u00c3\u00a9 both nights of our trip, I had the Lamb Shank Pot pie as recommended by the waitress the first night and then the Beef tenderloin the 2nd night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so succulent! My girlfriend had the market fresh fish and the Kangaroo fillet the 2nd night, we were both very happy with our meals! Not to mention dessert, we shared a souffl\u00c3\u00a9 which took about 20 minutes (as told by our waitress) however it was well worth the wait! Breakfast each morning was really generous, a selection of fresh fruits, muesli, yoghurt, spreads, toast and not to mention the weekend breakfast menu, I ordered pancakes and my girlfriend ordered eggs benedict on our last morning. The hallways throughout the hotel are filled up with history and information which you could read for hours! My favourite was the section about cricket, my grandad would love it!

We booked two rooms for just one night. I had last stayed at this hotel in 2003 and it was good then and still is in terms of friendly and good service, adequate and interesting guest rooms, great public areas (you could spend hours \"reading the walls\") and very satisfactory breakfast and dining service, all at a good price. Our friends from Brisbane arrived very early due to unexpected transport changes, and were delighted with the efforts made to cater to their needs until a room was ready late morning. We were upgraded from a Victoria room to a family suite on the first floor. The room was on the upstairs south western corner of the hotel (18) and although very satisfactory was a bit noisier than we are used to, due to proximity to a busy intersection. Next time we will ask for something a bit more remote from the traffic. Our friends were downstairs towards the rear of the hotel and slept in total silence. The parking (or lack of) was something that caused concern. Immediately after making the reservation, I did receive a call from the hotel telling me all of their limited spots were booked but I was on \"a waiting list\". On the morning prior to our arrival I enquired and was told I was \"number 1 on the waiting list\". On arrival there was no parking and initially I had trouble finding a \"2 Hour\" spot within cooee of the hotel. At checkin one of the most helpfull staff advised she was going off duty in a couple of hours, was parked in an unrestricted spot (very rare in this area) and offered to hold it for me when she left. This meant some inconvenience waiting for her spot to become available, but we filled in the time over lunch in the restaurant. I couldn't fault the caring and helpfull attitudes of the staff but just be warned that it may be an issue if you intend staying at this hotel with a car. I did find it strange and somewhat surprising to observe from our room, which overlooked the carpark, that 4 or more spots remained vacant all that night. Obviously the \"wait list\" system has some deficiencies. However, I'll be back, access to the SCG is excellent.

Oxford Street, while extremely central and convenient, is SUPER loud at this intersection. While the hotel rooms are a bit back from the road, the terrace apartments are directly on it. Even with double doors facing to that street, it was very, very loud, especially at night when you are trying to sleep. Roaring semi trucks and motorcycles, some shaking the windows. Thank goodness we got in late most nights or were very tired - I wore ear plugs also though. It didn't bother my boyfriend but I would never stay there again because it was so loud. It makes me sad because I thought the staff was very lovely and friendly, there was internet included, the lobby bar was quaint and nice, the rate was pretty good for expensive Sydney, etc. But if you want a good night's (quiet) sleep, the Hughenden will need to put in some thicker windows to have me back.

Nice high ceilings meant the room was relatively cool, but we got one with AC anyway. We had a fair bit of noise from people walking down the corridor of our room at night, but we did have the window open to avoid using the AC as much as possible.

The staff were relaxed and unobtrusive, but professional and, without exception, incredibly warm and genuinely friendly. If you are looking for a hotel with charm and character, look no further. It's not modern, it's not huge. It's cosy, relaxing & endearingly eccentric - stacks of books, armchairs occupied by well loved teddy bears, glass fronted cabinets with stacks of old china, traditional wooden rocking horse, piano. The Hughenden is located on a charming tree-lined street filled with art galleries, antique shops, and quaint little specialist shops.

The rooms I've stayed in have had a small wardrobe but I found it easier to simply live out of the suitcase, which slides easily under the bed. You wouldn't want to spend much time in a room as small as most of the Hughenden's seem to be, but then that's not why you come to Sydney. And if you want to hang round the hotel there's the lounge (sometimes complete with piano player), the reading room (with an eclectic a mix of books as I've ever seen anywhere), or the outdoor mezzanine area. The beds are perhaps the best thing about this quaint and charming place. They're firm, comfortable, and a delight to sleep in. The staff are harried at times - I heard the girl who seemed to be in charge of breakfast mention that she'd been the night porter the previous night!! But they brought in two delightful girls to help her and I didn't see anyone go without their breakfast. Breakfasts, by the way, are incredible - be careful what you ask for. I asked for \"a little bit of everything\" and received a plate so full I didn't need to eat till dinner! Great value considering breakfast was included in the very reasonable tariff. Overall the cleanliness was good. I left a pizza box outside the door late at night because I didn't want the smell in the room and it was gone early the next morning. The room was always well serviced and spotless except in those \"hard to reach\" places like the fan blades on the high ceilings which clearly hadn't been wiped down in a while... quite how they'd managed when the bed occupies 90% of the floor space and you'd need a 2 metre ladder to get up there, I'm not sure! They also made an error in my bill but I picked it up when checking out and they corrected it quickly and cheerfully. The owners perhaps need to care about their staff more and their friends a little less (there seemed to be an 'elite' set of guests known personally to the owners, then 'the rest') but if you're sick to death of chipboard furniture, bland rooms, tasteless decor and tasteless food, then the Hughenden is great. Haven't seen the larger rooms, so can't comment as to whether it's any good for more than a single traveller. And my one complaint isn't with the hotel, it's with some of the guests... it isn't a multi-storey building with lots of \"public\" areas where you can create noise without disturbing other guests. So to sit in the outdoor area outside someone's window at 3.30am discussing your domestic problems at the top of your voice is inconsiderate. Testament to the Hughenden's popularity is that I had to delay my trip by a week to wait till a room was available and then, when business took longer than expected, I couldn't stay the extra 4 days because it was fully booked again.

I arrived straight from the airport at around 6.30am and was met with a warm welcome. I was told that they had a nice room available which I could go in to straight away. The room was quite large and offered a balcony. The breakfasts are fantastic and offer a very good range and variety. The decor is very diferent from most corporate chains and has been decorated with interesting antiques and art work. Thisd hotel certainly has its fans and some will find this rather charming- I personally felt the hotel was more of a large B&B (in need of further renovation) than a 4 star hotel (as advertised by the 'hotel'). Cleaning at this hotel is also a little hit and miss. My room was not supplied with a bin. I drank a couple of bottles pf beer on the balcony one evening and left the empties to be cleaned away- they remained however where I had left them throughout my stay and they didnt appear to take the hint. Service is the largest area of concern in this hotel as the staff here can be really quite rude, surly and unhelpful. On chequing out, there was a confusion over payment and they made me feel as if I was trying to rob the place and tried to make me investigate the matter myself using my mobile. The fiasco took about an hour to resolve during which time I grew to feel quite sorry for the guy working on the front desk as he couldnt handle all the incoming calls and had to hang up on at least ten people- I would have probably been less than impressed if I had been at the other end. Service at breakfast was similarly chaotic- I would wait for 20 minutes or so to be asked whether I would like the cooked breakfast (which I had already paid for) and then was forced to approach the waitress myself and ask if I could possibly have something to eat- her reply was less than apologetic and rather more distainful. I found the location of this hotel a little inconvenient as the bus journey took about 20 minutes to the city centre. I enquired about other forms of transport and was told that there might be a train but they didnt know exactly where the station was.
