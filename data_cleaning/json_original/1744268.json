Beautiful bathroom fully furnished with toothbrush, razor and soap given by the hotel. We enjoyed also the wellness center with a jacuzzi, a sauna and a small gym. The hotel is just 200m far from Bilbao metro stop, that is three stops far from plaza del sol metro stop, metro closes at 1.30 am and we found it always very safe. The only negative aspect was the fact that our room was found not locked when we came back each day in the afternoon. Probably the cleaners forgot to re-lock the door after they had cleaned the room. Our neighboring had the same problem. Nothing was stolen from our room.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kunming, China", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "Fritz K", "ReviewID": "UR128321624", "Content": "Very simple, WiFi is good, but other than that this hotel doesn't have anything that makes it stand out, therefore I give it a 3.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "pariroo", "ReviewID": "UR121167527", "Content": "This hotel is fine. Nothing special. The location is good. It's near a metro station and not far from points of interest. The mattress was not comfortable.

Our room on the top floor (Six floors in hotel) was large, with an attached lounge furnished with opulent solid furniture and very comfy Leather sofa and chairs, the Balcony is huge at a guess I would say 20' x 20' the only downside was there was no furniture so was unable to sit out and enjoy this, however, it is still a fantastic sun trap. The bathroom was large with a fantastic whirlpool bath, and the extras (toothbrush, shaving equipment etc) was a great touch, finally the bedroom is a great size the 7' bed was comfortable and the room was well decorated. Breakfast has been quoted on TA as being expensive, maybe a tad more than local cafes but nonetheless it is a good breakfast, with a great choice, attentive service, o.k., we were the only patrons at 0930, but all in all very well presented fresh food and as much as you could eat. In conclusion, if you want some real quality accommodation and service then pick the executive room, its scores high on all points, location, quality, value for money etc. Oh and there is a spar and gym although we didn't get to try/investigate this.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClose, clean, friendly & helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Lila2008", "ReviewID": "UR81781542", "Content": "I now realize that friendly and helpful staff IS important when ou come from far away. The personnel from a hotel can improve your vacation a lot because they give you advice on where to eat, how to get somewhere, etc. At this hotel they were especially helpfull. The hotel is very clean and they came to fix a thing with the shower within 5 minutes of asking when we arrived.
