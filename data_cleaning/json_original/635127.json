Both times I have been extremely happy with the hotel. Pros: - Good location, accessible by lots of buses that go anywhere from Termini train station to St Peters to the center - Great rooms, clean, modern furnishings, warm blankets, heater/AC, hot water in the bathroom - Helpful english speaking staff - Good selection of broschures/maps in the hotel reception - Free wifi throughout the hotel Cons: - Not really in the centre of Rome (although to stay in the centre you'd have to pay a lot more) so there aren't a LOT of restaurants/shops near by (you could pop out to get a slice of pizza for example but probably would have to catch a bus to find a decent restaurant) - No breakfast provided - Rooms are quite noisy because of the street traffic, although I slept quite well (probably because I was exhausted) Would definately stay again next time I'm in Rome", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann ARbor", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Pruitt M", "ReviewID": "UR121102091", "Content": "This hotel, located about a 5 minute walk from Borghese Gardens and museum, was clean & quiet. With the window open, there was some traffic noise from the street as locals headed off to work in the morning, but with the window closed and a/c or fan on, the room was quiet and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions to nearby cafes, bus lines. They also arranged for a taxi for us when it was time to head to the airport. There is a nice 'bar' - cafe a block away which served fresh fruit, pastry, & hot coffee. Prior to arrival, I suggest taking a 'street view' look at this location on an internet map, to make it a little easier to find. Look for the black doors. The termini station is about 15 minutes walking but you may want to take a cab if you have a lot of luggage. Good price for the room & services.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and comfortable room!\u201d", "Author": "Brooke_Miller", "ReviewID": "UR115847863", "Content": "Hotel Versailles was an excellent place to stay in Rome. Our room was a bit above average in size for European hotels and very clean all the time. There was enough space for 2 people to spread out their luggage for 5 days. Although this hotel is not too close to many of Rome's more famous attractions, we found this to be an asset as there were many great and inexpensive breakfast and restaurant locations within a couple of blocks. You can't beat spending 2 euro on breakfast every day. And it wasn't hard to get to the main areas of Rome. A 15 minute walk at the beginning of the day and you're into a more busier district. We even felt safe walking back to the hotel after 1AM. Tips: 1. There are no major signs for the hotel, look for the address and the big black doors. 2. Let the front desk know if you are leaving early in the morning on your check out day. 3. Make sure the shower curtain is inside the small shower space so you are not spending your evening mopping up water in the bathroom.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "stacigu", "ReviewID": "UR107998734", "Content": "This hotel was excellent - it was clean, the staff was nice, and they had free wi-fi!

However on arrival the reception had no record of my booking, the manager was extremely apologetic and called several other hotels to try and find me a room. Eventually with no luck, he did some room swapping and upgraded me to a double room on the fifth floor. The room was great, really clean and big, the bathroom was very modern, clean with a hair dryer. The only thing was the shower takes about 7 minutes to get hot. The street noise is well insulated from the room so with the window closed it's quite quiet, however the wall to wall insulation between rooms is terrible and at night I could hear my neibours using the bathroom, and awoke several times to banging doors. There was also a couple next door, and due to the poor sound insulation I was woken up several mornings by their love making. The only thing I would say that is negative about Hotel Verseilles is that although the manager is very friendly and helpful, there isn't a whole lot of tourist information, and as it isn't necessary to pass the reception to leave the building, you don't really feel like it's convenient to stop to ask questions. Once you check in, they pretty much leave you alone until you check out, which is great for an independent traveller but if you were in a family or aren't great at navigating/booking things/finding out information alone, it isn't ideal. The other small thing is that Hotel Versailles is quite hard to find for the first time, as it is in a residential/office building with no signage, the only clue is the little name tag on the buzzer next to the front door. Pros: - Good location (4 min bus to Termini station) - Well worth the price (mind you I did get a discount booking through wotif and as mentioned my room was upgraded) - Really clean, modern rooms - Comfortable bed - No street noise - Air conditioning - Modern TV with cable tv and an english channel - Fridge and safe in room - Free unlimited fast wifi - Friendly staff - Elevator - Restaurants close by - Just metres from Taxi rank Cons: - Bad sound insulation between rooms - No breakfast - Lack of tourist information", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGood value for your money\u201d", "Author": "dangtwyn2", "ReviewID": "UR30167990", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in Rome. All of the hotels were expensive so we were weary of a 1 star but they should be given at least a 2 star rating. They were so nice. Only a recptionist is there 8am to 9pm or so . Very clean. The room shown on the website and tripadvisor is the best room they have so it looks cute. the one we gotten wasnt the same but it was updated and ikeaish style. not as nice but still very clean and updated. the staff was friendly and nice. metro we didnt even use bc the bus transports seemed a lot more easier . there are 2 different bus stops near the hotel. a tiny bit off teh beaten path fromt eh center of the city but if you take the bus its only a 5 min bus drive to the Main Terminni bus staion wher eyou can take any bus anywhere in the city and any train. we took a train to florence for $42 euros a person and had enought ime ot spend about 6 or 7 hours in florence and head back to rome in one day. nof rills hotel . doenst even have a tv in the hotel room. but for a cheap palce that is safe area and clean it is worth it.
