I travel a lot, but this is my own personal hotel low. I can see however, how different travellers have rated the Mora so differently -- read on: I staid one night alone, then with my partner for three more nights. I was more or less forced to book a double room for the first night as well -- they just refused to give me a single room with any conveniences. I did not mind so much expecting a more comfortable stay, so I moved in. The \"double\" room I was given was extremely small and the bathroom smelled of foul water. I was in a newly renovated section of the hotel (1st floor), so I assume that the repairs had gone badly. I did everything I could to get the smell out with no help from the staff, but it was too strong and as I woke up repeatedly because of it I asked for a change. I got it. The second room was about twice the size, odourless and overall much much nicer. When my partner arrived, things started all over again. We were told that we could not stay in the second room, but had to move back to the first one. Of course we refused -- I could smell the foul water even from the hallway, so it was obvious nobody from the reception cared. I never heard a word of regret, it was as if the fact that the hotel could not provide us with a usable room was our problem. We had never intended to spend our few days in Madrid hotel-hunting, but it got worse every day. Finally, we were just tired of fighting the reception hazard every day, and started looking for another hotel. We found a free room right at Atocha. The moment we got back to Mora to check out, they changed their course. My partner was finally told they were \"sorry\" (a luxury I never enjoyed) and figuring we would rather spend our last day in Madrid enjoying the city instead of moving to another hotel, we spent also our last night there. I can only say: I should have followed my first instinct and just moved on.

Our flight from Tenerife was delayed and we arrived at 2AM. The hotel had saved us a room. The room was clean and quite, but small. The bathroom was very small. Eventually we figured out that what looked like a glass wall actually had a hinge and that made it easier to get in and out of the shower. Prior to discovering this, we had squeezed into the shower between the glass wall and the sink. We stayed 3 nights and left at 4:30AM on Monday morning. The hotel had a taxi ready to take us to the airport for our flight to Amsterdam. The location is fantastic!!! Midway between the Prado and the Reina Sofia and across the street from the Botanical Garden. Directly, behind the hotel is a new cultural cente that recently opened: the Caxia Forum. They had a fantastic collection from the Uffizi Gallery that was free. They also had several concerts for adults and families. When we were there concerts were only 10 euros. Lectures were 2 euros. Additionally adjacent to the hotel and next to the Caxia Forum is a living wall. The wall had been highlighted in the airline magazine that we had read on our way from Tenerife. Imagine our delight when we discovered the wall with all of its living plants. We were close to the Madrid Vision city bus tours, the beautiful train station, and so much more.

Mora is almost directly across from the Prado museum, 5 minutes away from the Museo Nacional Reina Sof\u00eda and a further 10 minute walk from Retiro Park (you must go here)!!! I woke up every morning, opened my curtains and stepped onto the balcony that overlooked the tree lined, bustling Paceo del Prado........Fantastico!!!! Ok.....it can be a noisy street but the windows are soundproofed and you can't really hear the traffic at all during the night. My room (301) was spotless and I think it had been recently renovated as it still smelt fresh. The air con worked fine, the bathroom was very clean and the shower was in perfect working order! Rooms are cleaned every morning and you can obtain the safe key from reception. The staff (as always) were very polite, patient, helpful and spoke perfect English. Special thanks to Sonia!! The quickest and easiest way to reach to hotel from Barajas airport terminal 2: Take Metro line 8 (pink) to Nuevos Ministerios. Here you catch a RENFE train (not a metro) to Atocha Renfe train staion (almost same price as Metro ticket). A quick walk up the Paseo del Prado and hey presto!!! For trips to other parts of Madrid, the nearest Metro station is Atocha, which is situated across from Atocha Renfe train station and is really easy to find. I paid 60 euros per night for my double room (breakfast not included) and it was worth every penny. The hotel food is also pretty good, although I never ate there this time) and the restaurant is always full of locals (a good sign if you ask me).

Booked to stay there for 4 nights last week. Location looked to be perfect from guide books because of its proximity to the museums and to Atocha station (we came in overnight from Barcelona) but with hindsight I would think that hotels around the Playa Major and Playa Santa Anna are better located. Yes the hotel is close to the museums but then it is far away from much of the nightlife eating/drinking. Anyway there are extensive building works going on outside of the hotel. The whole block next to and behind the hotel was demolished and large construction machines were in operation throughout the day. On top of this they were carrying out renovations to the interior of the hotel at the same time. We were given no advance warning of this and there was only a small sign in reception apologizing for the disruption caused. However the constant hammering and drilling continued from 9am to 6pm without breaks. On checking in we were allocated a small room at the back of the hotel with a view of a building site - this was despite having paid the highest room tariff and it was then that we could hear the banging going on in the room directly above. We went to the reception and asked if they had any other rooms (the rooms at the front at least have a view (even if it is of one of Madrids busiest highways). The staff were completely unsympathetic and said they had no other rooms available despite the fact that it was 1pm, we had booked 3 months in advance and we must have been one of the first people to check in that day. When we told them that this was not satisfactory they told us fine - go check into the Hotel Mexicana around the corner. My fiancee was livid so went in search of alternative accomodation. She found an extremely nice hostal where the staff were friendly and polite, the rooms had daylight and were bigger and more comfortable than the rooms at the Mora. The price was also 20\u20ac less per night. We were committed to staying the one night so the next morning we checked out and my fiancee paid with her credit card. The woman on reception was helpful but she forgot to return the card and at the same time we both did not notice until later that night when we went to pay for a meal with the card. We returned to the hotel where we knew the card had to be only for the guy on reception to tell us that the hotel did not have the card, that he would have a note if they did and that we should come back tomorrow. We phoned the bank back home and they confirmed that the last transaction was with the hotel but as we no longer had the card they deactivated it. So in the morning we returned to the hotel and the woman who had forgotten to return the card was on the desk and apologised and pulled the card out from below the desk in a secure box. She could not explain why her colleague had refused to look for the card as it was immediately below where he had been sat and it was normal procedure. She had also left him a note. The hotel is just not up to the standard you would expect, hostals in the city have the same amenities only nicer rooms and nicer staff.
