{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Re above comments I am pretty sure the 2 reviews above from N0nnapn, and Gafia are posted against the wrong hotel as they both describe views that don't relate to the Mitsui URBAN Hotel. I think they are both describing the Mitsui GARDEN Hotel which is about 1km away from the URBAN hotel. The line in NOnnapn's post refers to the DON K store which is directly opposite the GARDEN.Anyways, I am actually writing this review from the room within the URBAN hotel. The hotel is well situated, 30m away from Metro station Shimbashi. We arrived in Narita airport and the shuttle buses (3000 yen) are quite regular into Ginza HOWEVER be aware that the shuttle bus DOES NOT stop at the URBAN hotel but rather the GARDEN hotel as above. Dragging your cases 1km in 35 degrees is no laughing matter, especially after a 10.5 hour flight from Europe so just be careful if you are not easy on your feet.Facilities at the hotel are fine but as this is Tokyo, prepare yourself for a small room, I'm talking small here folks. We are on business here for a week and there is no closet to hang suits and shirts but just 3 coat hangers on the wall.Staff are quite friendly though the level of English is not brilliant - mind you, it's better than my Japanese :)Restaurants are plentiful and great quality for reasonable (for Tokyo) rates. Beer and alcohol however are very expensive e.g. 1200 yen (\u62e25-6) for half litre. Trouble is, I drink more than I eat :)All in all, perfectly clean, adequate hotel in a great part of town.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR738845347", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mcnev"}, {"Content": "Never again Arrived at the hotel for check in. Lobby was very modern and nice. Problem with the room. Had booked online and according to description and photos the room had two beds but was told the room we were checking in to had only one bed which was a problem. Complaining to no avail (unfriendly staff), and already being late for dinner decided to get an additional room. Room was small and very modern. Nice view of Tokyo/Tokyo bay from window. Large bathroom included shower and bathtub. There was hair on the shower floor which was nasty. Also found blood on corner of comforter which was gross. During check out complained again about the room snafu but staff didn't offer any sort of compensation only blank stares and shoulder shrugs. I would never stay here again. During this trip I also stayed at Park Hotel Tokyo which is pretty close in proximity to this hotel and had a fabulous experience there. Save yourself any potential headaches and also some money and book a room at Park Hotel. Also, nothing was in English at this hotel as was most everywhere else. Staff didn't speak English well either. Again, everyone at Park Hotel Tokyo did.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR190303331", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "creining"}, {"Content": "Would stay again Rooms were small but immaculate.
