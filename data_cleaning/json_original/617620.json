Fortunately we found the Hotel Porta Pia, via tripadvisor, and we were happy with every aspect of the hotel. It is a short taxi ride from Roma Termini (although the ride is a bit 'round about due to one-way streets). We were greeted by Marco, who speaks English well, and shown to our spacious room with one large bed and a single bed for our daughter. The room also had a nice sitting area overlooking the street (which is quiet), a compact bathroom, and even a refrigerator. After a month in Sardinia without air conditioning, this room was wonderful and the AC worked very well. The hotel occupies the second floor of an old building and is reached by a fabulous old elevator. The front desk is always occupied, and the hotel also has a breakfast room/bar. Marco, Alessandro, and Claudio did everything for us and advised us on many different things. There is a very nice selection of restaurants nearby (one to two blocks), several good bars, and there is also a wonderful market in the next block, where we bought fresh fruit and vegetables (you can buy just about anything here, including meat and cheese). Claudio (who speaks only Italian) was wonderful and even recommended a great barber at the shop around the corner. The barber, Mario, was a genius and gave me one of the best cuts of my life. This is our new favorite hotel in Rome. It is a bit out of the way, but in reality it's only a couple bus stops from the main areas of interest (and the bus stops a block away). As it is on a small side street, it is very quiet and there is seldom traffic on the street (and essentially none at night). We felt safe walking around the area in the evening and got the impression that it was in a residential area. We will definitely stay there again (and hopefully see Marco and Claudio again).", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cIt Did The Job!\u201d", "Author": "SamsonW", "ReviewID": "UR14491268", "Content": "See my review of the Baltic Hotel in regards to background.

The room was clean and appeared like it was recently renovated, it had all that we needed including a flat screen TV & airconditioner. The bathroom was compact but clean & pleasant. The hotel itself is actually a few apartments put toghther in an apartment building on the second floor. There is an old but classic elevator that can take you to the hotel. The front desk in manned untill midnight but if you plan to come back later then that tey will give you a key to the front door. The staff is very nice but not all of them speaks English. Breakfast is not inculded in the price of the room but you can add it for an extra payment. The location is reasonable, very close to a bus stop but quite far from a metro station. Termini (the main rail metro & bus station) is about 15 min walk from the hotel. The area around the hotel has a few shops (that close early), at night its quite deserted so it doesn't feel very safe. Overall the saty was nice, if you are looking for a good price & willing to compromise a bit on the location this is the good option.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Porta Pia Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d617620-Reviews-Porta_Pia_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$69 - $132*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Messina 25</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00198</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "617620", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b2/57/b257968872a9d224eede0fc4c79a42491large.jpg"}}
