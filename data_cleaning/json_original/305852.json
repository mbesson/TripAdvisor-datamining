{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Close to HK Convention Centre We attended a conference during a very peak time so rates were extremely high ($1880 HK was a special group rate). Excellent views on the peak side and great location (right on MTR Wanchai station). Service was excellent, room was clean and bright - no complaints. Breakfast not very good but Starbucks and other amenities right next door. Lobby bar is lacking in excitement but the excitement is literally outside the back door in Wanchai.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR824138737", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "orgchaos"}, {"Content": "Good value! This was a good experience the first time I stayed, I enjoyed it very much. Due to the short stay I could not make use of all the facilities on offer but would believe they are fine like the room I lived in. I don't think it is a hotel for budget travelers since rate was rather on the higher side. (Yes, I know, there was an exhibition going on making accommodation more expensive but still.). All in all, I think I got good value for the money. It might well be that I will stay in your hotel next month.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR953885017", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "easytrip37"}, {"Content": "Great hotel in HK If you're planning to visit HK, for bussines or pleasure, this hotel its a very good option for you to stay, they have excellent i mean EXCELLENT treatment from the staff to the guests.The location its great for bussines or to look around HK.I travel all the way from mexico to asia.. and trust me they make things a lot easier to me, especially with the language handicap.", "Date": "Mar 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551565017", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JorgeMTZ"}, {"Content": "Luk Kwok Hotel - It's Alright ! I stayed here for a couple of days on a business trip. It's well located in the business district and easy accessible. The hotel was undergoing some major renovations when I stayed there so there so I didn't see the best of if it unfortunately. The breakfast was OK nothing great but I was only ever in the breakfast room 20 minutes so wasn't bothered. The room as large as was the bathroom. It was a non-smoking room but stank of smoke. Staff were very efficient and friendly with excellent English.This wouldn't be my choice hotel if I return but wouldn't mind too much if that's all that was available.

The hotel is comfortable enough, although the mattresses are too firm (i later discovered this to be the case throughout China, so we Westerners must be spoiled!). The customer service is very pleasant and accommodating, with good English skills. Another plus -- they have dedicated non-smoking rooms and their clientele doesn't seem to smoke as much as the guests in many other hotels in China (including in the elevators -- ugh). The amenities were minimal (no pool, restaurant under renovation, no coffee shop, broadband only available sometimes), but there's so much nearby, that there's little reason to stay in the hotel when you're awake.BTW -- this IS the hotel of Suzy Wong fame, although the current hotel was rebuilt in the late 1990s on the site of the original Luk Kwok Hotel.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR401148085", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LisaArlington"}, {"Content": "\u95c0\u950b\u6e61\u5a4a\u70b2\u6e6a\u9287\ue0a0\u4f05\u935a\u6219\u4e9c\u9287\ufe3a\u4e9c\u9287\u4ff1\u4eda   showReview(19169475, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR872837419", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d305852-r21543051-Luk_Kwok_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "305852", "Price": "$217"}}
