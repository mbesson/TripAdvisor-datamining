{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Average Booked the Losari for 4 nights on Agoda after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. We arrived early but the reception staff let us leave our bags there and had everything ready for us when we returned at 12pm as arranged.When we arrived in the room, the floor was still dirty and covered in black hair from the Malaysian tour group they had in before us. Not a great way to start but we put that aside and tried to enjoy it.Was not happy with it and by the last night, when we were woken at 3am by a tour group arriving from Taiwan and ringing our doorbell to see if the room was free I had had it! When I complained to staff after this and the noise that followed for over an hour they laughed and said sorry!Cons:- Very noisy. Due to the layout of the hotel (5 stories with rooms in a square looking onto the pool) all noise echos and any talking in the hallways bounces into the room. Two nights I was kept awake for over an hour with loud voices in the hallway.- Pool only gets sun for a couple of hours a day and the water is always very icy cold- Only 4 English speaking TV channels - one being sport being played 24/7- Cater to big Malaysian and Taiwanese tour groups who can be exceptionally noisy- Don't think the balcony have even been swept and cleaned.- The cleanliness of your room each day depended on which housekeeper cleaned it - thankfully the last two days the guy we had was fabulous and always happyPros:- Is a great location but many others in the same area to choose from- Most staff very friendly and helpful. The gentleman who checked us in and the man who drove us to the airport we lovely.- Breakfast exceptionally limited and very Asian focussed (which I loved but my husband wanted variety). However, Staff we very willing to cook up omelettes or pancakes on request for no additional chargePersonally wouldn't stay here again as the noise nearly drove me mad!", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR531308658", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GillyGoldCoast"}, {"Content": "Really enjoyed our stay at the Losari We stayed at the Losari in December 07 - 2 adults and one teenage son. We had two rooms and these were clean and well appointed for a 3 star hotel.

Just stayed 4 days at Losari. If you are looking for an American 4-star hotel w/ all high class amenities, this is not it. If you\u9225\u6a99e looking for a decent hotel in a great location at a great price, this is the one for you. There are some cons but the pros totally outweigh the cons\u9225?There are some great places to eat that will only walking 1-3 minutes: Our\u9225\u6a9a restaurant, Posers pub and several others which are quite tasty and good on your wallet for $5. I had the chicken breast Caesar salad at Posers and it was quite tasty. Ours\u9225?had some lasagna and a nice surf turf. There is an Indonesian warung which is even better priced about 7 minute walk away for $2/meal. There are mini-marts all around and a close ATM machine. I even found several places to get your clothes laundered if you wanted to save some money and not do it in the hotel. Posers and the mini-marts are open late night. There is plenty of shopping up and down the street and it\u9225\u6a9a easy to get a taxi or ojek. Legian Beach is a 5-10 minute walk away or a 2 min motorbike ride. The web says its in Kuta-Legian for marketing purposes but I would put it the other way around\u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a in Legian closer to Seminyak. The good thing is that it\u9225\u6a9a not crazy like in Kuta but has everything you need or want as a tourist and a 10-15 min ojek or taxi away from getting to the hustle and bustle of Kuta depending on traffic. I got the Superior room (2nd least expensive) for $15 off the rate at the front desk, which is still a good price, from the tripadvisor.com/expedia.com website. It was $35-$40/night. The Superior is pretty spacious and like the other remark, the AC really is very strong. I actually had to turn the AC up in temperature/lower its strength because it got too cold when I slept and I love AC, especially in Indonesia. Another thing I loved was the in-room safe. I was traveling alone and I didn\u9225\u6a9b want to worry about my passport or valuable items so it was reassuring that I didn\u9225\u6a9b have to check it in at the front desk or worry about house keeping doing something to it\u9225?it rarely happens but it does happen. The in-room safe was very nice\u9225?took a couple tries to use but was fine afterwards. If you have a family, they have higher priced bungalows in a separate part of the hotel which are reasonably priced. Some cons: there are 2 pools which look quite nice but both of them are small, more of a play pool. It\u9225\u6a9a not a place to get a workout in. I didn\u9225\u6a9b even bother to try because after I pushed off from the wall, I\u9225\u6a87 only get in 4 strokes before I\u9225\u6a87 have to turn around. There is a nice Jacuzzi though and the pool has a swim up bar. No internet in the hotel (as mentioned in previous post) but there is a warnet/internet caf\u8305 next door. This was a hassle because I like staying logged on 24-7 but for I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b want to spend $70/day more just to stay connected to the internet. The cable tv was decent, you get HBO, but no ESPN!!!! \u98e6?Quite disappointed with that\u9225?you do get some football/soccer and rugby certain times of the night. Breakfast is edible but not great. Toast and croissants were good. You get mie goreng, nasi goreng, potatoes, sausages, 2 types of juice and coffee or tea. It comes in the price and it saves 1 meal you have to pay for so I can\u9225\u6a9b complain that much. I would stay here again. The staff were nice.

I was a little worried when we pulled up to the hotel off of the small street that looked like an alley, but I realized that this was not America, so I would have to be open to a new style of life. The night was rather humid, and the hotel is open-air, so as we checked in, I wondered if this would be tolerable. As I was led to my room, I looked out over the railings and noticed the beautiful pool and exotic look of the place. When I finally reached my room and opened the door, I was shocked and pleased at the coolness of the room: the air-conditioning had been turned on and it was almost freezing! (I happen to LOVE A/C, so this was great for me!) I later adjusted it with the remote control that was provided. The room was lovely, with teal blue walls and white-tiled floors, and CLEAN. That's the major thing for me. The sparsely furnished but well-appointed room was very romantic-feeling, and just what you could want for a few days in Bali. (Note: There may be a few really small ants, but they don't pose a problem, really. Perhaps it's the humidity?) Enjoy the view from the balcony!", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR970034142", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jdiva"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d626892-r22764572-Losari_Hotel_Villas-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "626892", "Price": "$45"}}
