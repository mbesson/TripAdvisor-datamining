Though the ceilings were high and it felt spacious, the furniture and bathroom needed updating and was scuffed. The design of the room was odd with the basin outside the bathroom. The pool was running winter hours(?) so was not open till 4 pm each day which was disappointing as we chose this hotel partly for this amenity ( with kids in tow). The pool itself was very clean but a touch cold and the towels were tiny! The tiny gym was just adequate. Breakfast was included which was a big plus, and this suited us fine with an adequate choice of cereal, yoghurt, juice, breads and hot drinks. Apparently the coffee was very good. The location of this hotel is it's best feature. It's just two blocks from the harbour where we visited the aquarium which the kids enjoyed. We also took the free bus from very close by up to MT Vernon and the art museums around there which was a big success too. Another thing too, though the bed felt OK we slept really badly. If one person rolls over, it feels like the whole bed is shifting on the other side. It suited us fine for what we wanted but for this price we have stayed in rooms with a far more luxurious feel in downtown Washington for example though admittedly without breakfast thrown in.

The rest of our stay the breakfast area was over crowded and the hot food was always empty, the wait for the waffle maker was about 10 people and even the cold items like cereal or mufins were empty. Then there was not enough seating for all the people. I know this is probably a seasonal thing but it was frustrating. I would suggest that they have extra waffle makers that they could put out during peak times or make sure they have more staff working that area to make sure it is always stocked. The other issue was that the pool had very limited hours 3-9pm. Maryland requires a lifeguard be present and I imagine that is the reason the hours are so limited. The best reason to stay here is the staff. I do a lot of travel for work and family and this hotel has some of the best staff members I have ever come across. We arrived very early after a red eye flight and I knew we would not be able to check in yet but the staff welcomed us, held our bags, let us eat breakfast and made note that we were there so that our room would be ready as soon as possible. We did some site seeing and came back a short time later and they had our room ready. Any time we had any contact with staff members they called us by name and remembered our names later. The bell staff was great as well. Over all this was a great stay and we would definetly stay there again. If you are looking for a great place to stay that is close to all attracations and has the best staff, then look no further...", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the price\u201d", "Author": "Grandmalynn", "ReviewID": "UR114625521", "Content": "Loved the place.

Unfortunately, this one, which has typically decent reviews on this website, was not what former visitors had described. Perhaps we got the worst room in the place. Upon arrival, the vivacious valet parking staff were so efficient that I left several items in the car as the swooped us into the lobby. Certainly a good quality, but it was too bad that they had to retrieve the car from where it was parked 6 blocks away just for me to get my hat and gloves (cold blustery night). The whole hotel has very tired decor, especially our room. It just did not feel clean in any way. The carpet was worn and stained; the bathroom was older and dreary and there was a serious ring around the tub. I do not like their new \"green\" concept of no toiletries except the refillable pump ones in the shower. I am certain that they are just \"topped off\" so some of the soap and shampoo in them must be quite old. The three of us stuck with the tiny \"communion wafer\" sized lone bar of soap at the sink which was gone by morning. We could have asked for another, but were not enthused to wait for another bar at 12 midnight. Thankfully the half box of tissues and one roll of toilet paper were enough. The towels were thin and old (like my old ones that we now use to bathe our dog). After I showered I realized that mine was so yellow (but was supposed to be white). Not a surprise though. I didn't notice it sooner because the lighting everwhere in the room was very DIM. There is no way anyone in that room could have read anything. We tried to watch the up to date TV, but there were only a few channels available. At 4 am when I could not sleep due to the perfectly alternating rumbling of the heater with the beep-beep alarm clock noise of the mini fridge placed next to the head of my bed , I considered asking for the Hampton 100% guarantee refund. Instead, I turned off the fridge completely which helped somewhat. I had actually thought it was my husbnd's alarm clock going off every time the fridge kicked in. Thankfully, I was wide awake when we had to get up at 6am. The breakfast was typically Hampton, which although basic, I always appreciate because it is so vey convenient for us when we travel and hate to waste time. Also, the pool was old and brown at the bottom.

For me who had never been to Baltimore, I chose this place based on the location and price and hoped for the best. The Hampton Inn did not disappoint. After an exhausting eight hour drive, we were greeted by the friendliest hotel manager that I had ever had the pleasure to meet. He allowed us to check in earlier, handed out maps and pointed out spots of interest, fantastic for someone that had never been to the city before. Our check-in was quick and trouble free and the manager insisted that if there was anything that we needed, we shouldn't hesitate to get in touch with him directly. Major points for that. Our room was on the sixth floor, and only a short walk from the elevator. The room itself was a good size, more than ample space for the king sized bed a nice seating area next to the windows and a desk. The bathroom was massive. The cleanliness is the upmost importance to me when staying at a home away from home and this place did not disappoint. The place was spotless. Linens were clean and crisp, plenty of towels and complimentary soaps and lotions. The flat panel tv was great and the free HBO was a treat as it was the season finale of True Blood! There was also free Wifi available, great for checking email or tooling around online. The room was quiet, and the bed was soft and comfortable. If you're going for the view, this might not be the place as our room overlooked the building across the street that may or may not have been slated for demolition. This view was easily rectified by closing the blinds. The proximity of this hotel to all the activities, dining and entertainment of the Inner Harbor are what puts the Hampton Inn head and shoulders above the rest. With a quick five minute walk you were in the heart of it all. We chose to take the MARC train to DC one of the days of our stay and we were only a ten minute walk from the Camden Yards Station, meaning our car could stay parked in the lot. The parking is a big hefty at $29/day but its the price you pay to stay in any area that doesn't allow the luxury of its own on-site lot. The free breakfast each morning was a great selection of bread products, make your own waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs or omelets, fruit, cereal, juice and coffee. A great addition for those traveling on a budget. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and I would definitely be back again.

Negatives- I had a very bad cold the day of our arrival so at night I was very much looking forward to getting a good nights rest because we wanted to see more at the harbor the following day. The air conditioning unit and the mini fridge in our room was SO loud that i was up wide awake the entire night. It sounded like it was going to fall out of the wall. On top of that we were near some night clubs and a very busy area of Baltimore so the cops and ambulance sirens went off multiple times throughout the night also keeping me awake. While the hotel was a VERY short maybe 2 walk block to the harbor it was not worth it. We ended up leaving very early in the morning and not doing anymore sightseeing because I was sleepless and had to go home and rest. ALSO more importantly they claim to give you a hot free breakfast the next morning. By \"HOT\" breakfast, they should have said, stale gross western tiny omeletttes with awful potatoes.

Otherwise, the reception staff were generally helpful. The valets outside the hotel will park your car in a car garage around the block for a daily charge several dollars more expensive than parking it yourself in one of the several garages also located within a block or 2 of the hotel. We found checking in difficult because of this, as there was nowhere immediately outside of the hotel where we could park eaily to unpack the car and get to our room. Breakfast was included in the room price and breakfast tables are arranged around the far side of the hotel lobby, so there is no \"breakfast room\" as such. The food was simple but tasty (cereals, make-your-own waffles, breads, muffins, hot drinks, juices) and enough to start the day off. Our room was modern, had 2 big beds, built-in wardrobe, bar fridge, large bathroom, TV and airconditioning. The room was adequate, but not especially large. In the block behind the hotel was a bar that hosted music bands playing outdoors. We had a lot of trouble sleeping one night as it was very loud, even above the airconditioning. One very big complaint was about the cleanliness of the indoor pool. There was clearly a coating of green mould around the lights, which when brought to the attention of reception staff, was unfortunately not taken care of (at least within the 3 days we stayed there), therefore deterring any potential swimmers.

They were WONDERFUL - very reassuring that they would have the exact type of room I wanted near an elevator, etc. Plus they were very concerned that I would be staying with them post surgery to have easy access if necessary to the hospital. The hotel was formerly a historic insurance building - so there is clever signage referring to the remodel of this hotel and others in the brand. The rooms were very very clean, very very quiet. Breakfast was good, not amazing, but standard Hampton Inn fare. The parking attendants and bell service guys bent over backwards to make sure I was OK the day of surgery. We checked in the day before. They even called up to the room to check in! They offered wonderful nearby takeaway dining ideas and a great restaurant in Little Italy that was low key - Germarno's for the night before I had ortho surgery. One of them even offered to go to the CVS and pick up a few items like Ziplocs and a few food items for our room - how much nicer is that?

The reality is that appearances are deceiving; the amenities and service level were just as basic as at other Hampton Inns. The bathroom had limited, basic toiletries and the water from the shower ran around the top edge of the tub and flooded the floor. There was an individual coffee maker on the wet bar but only enough coffee to make one cup each of regular and decaf. The \"glasses\" at the wet bar and in the bathroom were plastic, wrapped in more plastic -- so annoying and environmentally unfriendly! This hotel would be a great place to stay with a group.

It is $28/night for parking if you find a garage on your own it looks like $21 \u2013 Valets were patient and answered many questions. Check in with a reward voucher was OK. When we asked about the manager\u2019s cocktail hour we were told they decided not to have one because the hotel didn\u2019t have enough guests \u2013 this was one reason we booked this hotel. Brian at the front desk offered us 2 drinks and 2 snacks from the store area. I wasn\u2019t sure that was because we were gold members are whether it was due to no Managers cocktail hour being cancelled. The room #635\u2019s only view was of an ugly building across the alley and if you looked really hard right you could see some blue sky \u2013 there are no Harbor views from anywhere in the hotel.

The bed did not seem like the typical bedding that I expect and love from the Hilton chain. It was so bad I got up in the middle of the night to take a sleeping pill, hours later I was awake stretching kinks out of my back. My girlfriend had the same experience. Ha, then I go to log on to the complimentary free internet service and find they did not give me an access code. So I had to call downstairs to get one. The health club is a joke three tired pieces of cardio equipment next to a claustrophobic looking pool area. I went down the next morning and asked to speak to a manager (tall redish-blond hair guy). I told the manager about the issues I had \u2013 he immediately reversed the charges and said it would take about a week to get the reward points reimbursed. OK so we had a bad night you expect them when you travel\u2026 I think the manager is great for acting immediately to rectify the situation.

I hung the sign up for two of my four nights stay - and got no maid service (and I had it down each day before the posted check-out time).

When we arrived, the valet parking was a little confusing; there was a little sign on a pole that explained the charges (Note, it is $28, not $25 as their web site indicates), but there was nobody around, and it didn\u2019t seem obvious that you just stopped there. I parked at the curb and went inside where I found the valet guy. Check-in was simple and fast, we did so at about 4:45 pm. LOCATION: The location is good because it is only a short 2 block walk to inner harbor attractions. The area seemed ok during the day when there were people walking around to work etc, but I would be a little weary of walking around at night. Because we have the little one, we were back at the hotel by 8:00 so we didn\u2019t need to walk around at night. ROOM: We were in room 627. The room was large but seemed to have a bad layout. There is a big space in from on the closet, but then the chair/ottoman is right next to the left side of the bed by the windows. It is a little tight getting in and out of the bed in the middle of the night in the dark. There is a desk with a standard office chair, a sitting chair with ottoman, king size bed, small \u201ccoffee\u201d table, bench, and dresser/entertainment unit. The room has a TV small microwave, mini refrigerator, and coffee maker. There is no safe in the room. There is complimentary wired (cable provided) and wireless Internet access. The TV has pay per view and HBO, but only about 20 regular channels. The view from the window was an abandoned building (see photos). The room was quiet, not much street noise, but there were a couple of sirens during the night. BATHROOM: The bathroom was a decent size. Toiletries were \u201cPurity Basics\u201d brand, which I believe is a Hampton Inn brand. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, moisturizer, shower cap, shoe mitt, cotton balls/q-tips/nail file. There was a hairdryer as well. Water pressure in the shower was good, water stayed hot and the shower head was at a good height. RECREATION: There is a fitness room and pool on the lower level. I didn't use the fitness room but it looked small and seemed to have an elliptical, bike, and treadmill. There was also a TV in the fitness room. The pool was an ok size for an indoor hotel pool. There was a very strong smell of chlorine when you entered the room. I was a little itchy after exiting. The towels at the pool are a joke, they were very small, not even 3 ft by 2 ft and very thin. MISC The breakfast was pretty much the standard free continental breakfast. There was also a hot item, but I couldn\u2019t tell what it was by looking at it. I think it was some sort of sausage inside an egg. All of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. We forgot our toothbrushes and got 2 from the front desk.

We had a king room which had wonderful modern furniture and a huge bathroom. Our room even had a mini refridgerator and small microwave. The bed also had very nice bedding. The only advice would be to pack conditioner as they only provide shampoo, lotion and soap. The location is great, only a short walk from the Inner Harbor and a $5 cab ride to the great restaurants in the Mt. Vernon neighborhood on N. Charles Street. We ate at Ixia which was nothing short of faboulous. If you don't go for dinner, definately go for the martinis and kick back in the hip lounge area adjacent to the bar. We live in Northern Virginia and like to take trips to Baltimore often to \"get away\" and the HI will definately be our regular hotel.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hellertown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cSuperb, warm, helpful staff - great building\u201d", "Author": "JerryReilly", "ReviewID": "UR6628283", "Content": "I was in Baltimore for the three day Mid Atlantic Nursery Trade show in Mid January 2007.

It was a great find - perfect location, friendly service, nice amenities and the most comfortable bed I've slept on in a hotel in ages! We pulled up to the entrance and were immediately welcomed by the valet, who explained how the parking service would work during our stay. Check-in was fast and efficient. There is some construction going on across the way (new Springhill Suites). Our room was small, but with plenty of room for three adults to lounge and be comfortable. I was happy to find two queen size beds (not doubles). And speaking of the beds - they were heavenly! The down comforter and pillows were so comfy and the mattress could not have been more perfect. Just an all-around pleasant experience. Our view was of an abandoned bank building - I suppose if it was occupied it would have been just slightly disconcerting to be so close to another building. However our only neighbors were the pigeons roosting on the windows! We didn't spend much time in the room, so I was okay with the view (or lack of it). The room came with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker - all very welcome. The bathroom was renovated nicely and the shower had an adjustable shower head for massage, etc. The towels were fluffy, clean and plentiful (I mention this because I HATE thin hotel towels!). The staff was friendly and efficient - including the housekeepers, front desk, valets and breakfast attendant. I love the Hampton chain for the hot breakfast (eggs, biscuits, ham, cereal, bagels, english muffins, fresh fruit, muffins, juices and more (sausage and french toast on the second morning instead of the eggs and ham)) which saves me a good amount of money. Coffee and tea are available all day. There is also a managers reception each Monday - Thursday night from 5-6 - the one we made offered wine, beer, soda, swedish meatballs, mac and cheese, broccoli. Location is quite convenient - two blocks to the Inner Harbour, McDonald's for the kids and a CVS for snacks and emergencies on the next corner, plenty of shopping and restaurants and an easy 10 minute walk to Camden Yards. Really, I couldn't have asked for more from a fairly inexpensive hotel right in the heart of the city.", "Date": "July 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lindenhurst, Long Island NY", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at the Hampton Inner Harbor\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5427369", "Content": "My family and I just returned from a weekend stay at the Hampton Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor. We have 3 small children and finding spacious hotel rooms is sometimes daunting. Hampton Inn Studio Suite offered 2 double beds with a pull out couch, microwave, fridge, coffee maker and PLENTY of space for a reasonable price. Breakfast was plentiful and having complimentary coffee all day is a plus. Hotel is within walking distance to everything in the Inner Harbor. We did not have to use our car the entire weekend. Parking is $25 per day, but that seems to be the average among the other hotels as well. There is a small indoor pool which the kids enjoyed, however, because of the size of the room it gets quite loud in there if there are more than a few people in the pool. I found housekeeping to be efficient and friendly. Some of the Front Desk staff could use some brushing up on customer service. They were sometimes unfriendly and short with their responses. I usually like to stay at a full-service hotel, but our stay at Hampton was nice and would not hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, NY", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, Good Breakfast, Quiet\u201d", "Author": "amazingrace214", "ReviewID": "UR5421893", "Content": "My boyfriend and I came here for the holiday weekend- I had to modify my reservation by cancelling a day out of my 2 night stay-Hotel staff understood and charged me the same rate for 1 night, without any penalties even though it was less than 24 hours before my reservation date. This hotel is only 2 blocks from the the Inner Harbor Restaurants, malls etc. We left the car in valet and walked everywhere else in the area. Although we got there early, (11:30am) and check in is not until 3pm,we were able to store our luggage and take the convenient walk around the Inner harbor (went to the National Aquarium, had tapas and Sangria at Pesca, played some hoops and bowled at ESPN zone, and relaxed on our own paddle boat.) The Gallery is also a great simple mall to go to getting out of the sun only about a block around the corner. Only complaints: Parking ($25 a day). And the view is of an Abandoned building-but we just kept the curtain closed- Other than that, you'll see the other hotels nearby which look just as nice, but as far as value for Hampton Inn, nothing beats the free hot/cold breakfast-Unlimited Tea & Coffee and awesome down comforter. I'd probably stay here again. Oh, and watch your kids during breakfast---the attendant doesn't seem to tolerate them being in the way, especially when there's a hot plate in her hands.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe best Hampton Inn we've ever stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "sunmaide", "ReviewID": "UR5394338", "Content": "We stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites Inner Harbor for one night this past weekend. We were traveling with our three- and five-year-old sons, and our seven-year-old nephew. We arrived in Baltimore at around 12:30 PM, and the hotel check-in time wasn\u2019t until 3. I had requested an early check-in, but was well aware of the fact that it would most likely be denied due to it being an extremely busy weekend in Baltimore. Even though we weren\u2019t able to check in, the valet did park our car and store our luggage for us. We just walked the two short blocks to the harbor and did our tour of the Harborplace and aquarium while we waited to be able to check in. When we came back to the hotel, our check-in was handled promptly and the staff referred to me by name, which is always nice. We did have to wait about ten minutes for a valet staff member to turn our luggage over to us, but again, it was understandable because they were very busy. Our room was assigned to us per our HiltonHonors preferences, and was in turn very comfortable. We always stay at Hampton Inns, and this is the first time we\u2019ve visited one that actually had the down-like comforters. It was just like home! The pillows and beds were also perfect! The room was actually bigger than most of the other rooms we\u2019ve ever had, and it included a huge ottoman in front of the sofa. Did the boys ever love that! My only complaint is that the TV had a very limited number of channels, and since we were with our young children, that made it somewhat difficult. They wanted to watch Playhouse Disney on Sunday morning, but the hotel didn\u2019t offer the Disney Channel. We tried to have them watch Cartoon Network, but when we put the TV on that channel, all we got was one screen that never changed, but there were the voices for whatever the show was supposed to be. Luckily I was able to take over by saying I needed to watch the Weather Channel so we could plan the rest of our trip accordingly! We didn\u2019t visit the pool, nor did we order from the room service menu. Our package included a bottle of champagne and a package of chocolates. Both were great, and the deal we got by booking that package was excellent. Somehow we managed to save $60 by going with the package deal instead of the hotel\u2019s \u201cBest Available Rate.\u201d I definitely recommend checking into all of the available rates when you\u2019re looking to stay at this Hampton Inn. Another great feature that we\u2019ve not experienced at any other Hampton Inns was the convenience story in the lobby. We were able to purchase sodas and snacks and charge them to the room as we needed them. This was very useful to us, as it started to rain on the evening of our stay and continued to do so until and after we checked out. The free \u201con the house hot breakfast\u201d was great; we all found something appealing to have for breakfast, and that can be difficult when you have young children! Everything was being restocked constantly, and the staff members that were doing this were very friendly. Overall, I would say this was the best experience we\u2019ve had at a Hampton Inn, and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the Inner Harbor area. Should we ever return to Inner Harbor in the future, we will most definitely stay there again.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn & Suites Baltimore Inner Harbor", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d309189-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Baltimore_Inner_Harbor-Baltimore_Maryland.html", "Price": "$152 - $264*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">131 E Redwood St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Baltimore</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21202</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "309189", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/05/b5/05b58ef9ea1fb312ebdd2147ea4d60605large.jpg"}}
