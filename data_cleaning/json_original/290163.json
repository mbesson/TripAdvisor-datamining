The hotel is a little out of the centre, but it's only about 10 minutes on the bus (number 48) which stops right outside. To be honest, when you see how busy the centre can get, we were pleased to be that bit away from the bustle. We did buy the Iamamsterdam card which we found very useful. A 3 day card cost 60 euros each but this includes entry to museums etc and all transport, including a free canal cruise. It did work out cheaper and is also worth it just to not have to carry cash everywhere. One word of advice if you're flying back from the airport - the queues for passport control can get very busy. it also took us 20 minutes to walk to the gate and go through security, so just leave yourself plenty of time.

The public parking in front of the hotel is free in the weekend. In the hall you will find an internet room and there is Wifi in your room, both are for free. We aksed for a double room at the rear by e-mail, and within one day we a got an answer that this was o.k. (room 714; the quiest room we ever had). The room is medium sized, double glazed and has individual air conditioning. The double bed has a very firm box spring mattress. There is a workiing table, a rather small TV with channels in many different languages, and a safe (no fridge or mini bar). There is an open linen cupboard for your clothes. The bathroom is a kind of cabin in the room. It contains a wash stand, a bath tub with shower and a hairdryer. Alas the temperatur of the water changed sometimes from warm to hot or cold. There is only liquid soap. Breakfast is abundant with several kinds of bread, cheese and meat products, 3 kinds of yoghurt warm pan cakes and waffres, but no scrambled eggs, ham and sausages. There are several kinds of juices, cereals, jams and a variety of fesh fruit. Coffee is excellent. We once had dinner in the restaurant which was of mediocre quality. The waiter is very friendly.

When travelling there from Centraal Station, the hotel is right in front of the stop immediately after the Kabelweg stop.

Just get off the train at Sloterdijk and take bus #48 towards Centraal and it'll make for a much more convenient and less chaotic trip. Now about the hotel itself, it is not conveniently located, and it's a cramped room, even by European standards. But it is clean, quiet and the beds were comfortable. And of course, the price is very reasonable. But we did not like the Ikea-ish pod-like bathroom. I'm not that big of a guy and I even found the shower way too small to manoeuver in. I can't imagine how a big or overweight man would be able to have a decent shower. We stayed two nights here and on the final night we stayed at a 4-star hotel right in the city center. If I were to travel to Amsterdam again, I would definitely spend the few extra dollars for a more conveniently located hotel. Amsterdam is such a walkable city that we found it very nice to be able to take a break or refresh ourselves in our hotel room whenever we wanted. With the Ibis West hote, that was not possible because it required us to walk back to Centraal Station to take the 12 to 15 minute bus ride.

If you've ever been to an Ibis hotel, you know what to expect. This hotel conforms to the Ibis standand, a no frills economic hotel with good service and clean rooms. We never had a single problem here. Check-in and check-out was smooth and the front desk was accommodating with any questions we had about the city. Our flight landed at 8AM and by the time we got to the hotel (walked from the train station, about 15 minutes), we were able to check in right away. The hotel is in what seems to be a business district so it's a bit out of the way, but the 48 bus goes to the centre of Amsterdam in about 10 minutes. The only issue that might arise with the location is that there are no food places around except a Burger King attached to the building. However, this wasn't so much a problem for us as we were usually out in the city for lunch and dinner and would come back late at night. Be aware though, after midnight you have to take the night bus which runs every half hour and takes two or three times as long because it goes through other parts of the city first. On the bright side, the hotel is very quiet because of its location so you'll be able to get a good nights sleep. I read in another review that the hotel does not have A/C. This is false. However, when the ventilation is turned on, it automatically defaults to 22 degrees, as one of the workers at the front desk told me. It isn't possible to make it cooler, but it's alright. You can open the window for a little bit of air. We used the internet in the lobby a few times. It's pay per use, 5 euros for an hour but you can put in as little as you want. Usually we put in 1 euro for 12 minutes, good enough to check any emails. We never tried the breakfast as it is quite expensive at 15 euro per person so I can't comment on it.
