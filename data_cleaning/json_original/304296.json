{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap and cheerful. We stayed in a double room, which was big enough for a bed and standing room next to the bed. We were travelling light, so it was fine. We only used the room to sleep, we were out and about the rest of the time.The room was smallllllll and a bit stuffy, but it was cleaned daily, there were shared toilet and shower facilities, which is fine in theory but we were fighting for access with a massive high school group who were also on our floor. Breakfast downstairs was simple but cheap, unlimited coffee/tea refills and toast once you'd paid your small fee. Free wireless access downstairs was also a big bonus, and something we really appreciated.It's located close to a few subway stations, and fairly centrally placed, not far from the Imperial Palace East Gardens. Staff are really friendly, and everyone speaks English and Japanese. Lots of information about Tokyo is available at the desk and the staff were happy to help out.We were happy with the place, particularly for the price, and would probably stay again.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR457783066", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "femcastra"}, {"Content": "Simple and functional option for travellers on a budget Sakura Hotel offers basic accommodation with low rates and a great location. You get what you pay for, however. The rooms are clean, but very small (only fits a bed and enough room to walk past it), even for Japan. Toilets and showers are shared, which is not so bad as they were cleaned daily. The wash basins are right out in the corridor, however. It was pretty weird to stand there brushing one\u9225\u6a9a teeth right next to another guest. Towels are not included but can be rented (almost for free, merely 100 yen per towel).We chose Sakura Hotel because it is called a hotel and I dislike hostels. It felt much more like a hostel than a hotel however, so the name is rather misleading. For a hostel, it was ok.The staff speaks English, and is really helpful and service minded. They seemed slightly undermanned at times though. There is a caf\u8305/bar, but it was unmanned most of the time, which meant that you\u9225\u6a87 have to call for the person at the front desk to come and take your order. He/she would have to leave the front desk (possibly with people waiting in line) just to make your cappuccino or whatever. Felt kind of weird. There is a basic breakfast served in the morning (included in the price if you stay in a single room, otherwise costing a mere 315 yen). It is very basic (tea/coffee and toast), but it is nice to get something before going out sightseeing. The location of the hotel is excellent in terms of transportation. Although there is not much happening in the Jimbocho area, the hotel is only a few minutes' walk from Jimbocho station, from which you can easily get to more interesting neighborhoods. The subway system is easy to understand. Just make sure to get a pasmo card, and you won\u9225\u6a9b have to worry about transfers and costs. All in all, Sakura Hotel is a fine place to stay if you are on a tight budget and don\u9225\u6a9b mind staying at a hostel. For my own part, if I had known how low prices actually were in Tokyo, I would have paid up to stay at a real hotel instead.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR426086941", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "arevan_1"}, {"Content": "Smelly, Sweaty Locker       This was the room we got...not the one we wanted.

It was very difficult for me to pick a hotel as Tokyo is such an enourmous place but I liked Sakura's website and the price was right for a budget traveler like myself.I arrived Tokyo by train from Nagoya, and getting around first with a big backbag in July heat in rush hour Tokyo was rather challenging. Despite of the instructions I had printed out (which were not very specific as I trusted I could find the place as it was close to the station) I had major difficulties finding Sakura at first. I managed to get to the Jimbocho metro station and although Sakura was very close to it, I almost gave up and slept on the street instead :) The Japanese aroud either knew nothing, spoke no English or were pointing at all different directions!Anyway after finding Sakura I had a friendly welcome and got my room. It was teeny tiny but I didn't anticipate spending much time there anyway. There was just enough room for a single bed and walking past it. The room also had tv. The window was covered because of some construction they were making so I saw no light at all. It felt like staying in a closet but I didn't mind too much although I would have appreciated some daylight. I got a hair drier from the desk, and the air conditioning worked well. In July in Tokyo air condition is a must... The showers and bathrooms were shared and in the same floor. They were always clean and nice. The room had a rope and slippers so you could just put them on going to shower. Breakfast included to the private room rate and Sakura had a nice and often busy cafe-bar downstairs to have it. Basically it was toast and coffee, but that was good enough and it is always nice to get something before leaving. There was also internet but using it was very expensive.Overall, I had a pleasant stay in Sakura. It was far from luxury but for a little budjet hotel it did its job well. As a solo traveler I felt safe, comfortable and welcome. I would recommend Sakura to travelers like myself that need a modest and reasonably priced place.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR562959656", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "miyu_princess"}, {"Content": "clean and simple The Sakura Hotel, Jimbocho is an excellent budget hotel. It is really cheap for Tokyo and although the rooms are quite small they are functional and spotlessly clean. The bed size wasn't really a problem for us and we're quite tall.The hotel staff were friendly and all seemed to have good English, which is handy. The front desk is manned 24 hours and the cafe is 24 hours but I didn't observe anyone using it really late at night apart from using the internet.There's a few computers for internet use, the charge is \u951f?00 per 10 minutes which isn't great (compared to the fantastic internet cafe prices in Tokyo) but fine if you just want to check your email.The showers and toilet facilities are shared which I was apprehensive about at first but there were never any problems with this and they were cleaned daily. Good water pressure in the showers. Towel hire is \u951f?00 which I didn't think was very good since it is called a hotel rather than a hostel, I feel that if you have a private room, with the extra you're paying compared to the dormitories you really could do with getting a couple of towels included.Breakfast was \u951f?15 per person but all you get is toast. There's a loaf of bread and a toaster and little packets of butter and jam. There's a large selection of tea which is included as breakfast and also packets of dried soup granules. The breakfast wasn't BAD as such but not really worth paying for. Would be fine if it was complimentary.Good location right next to the Jimbocho subway line where you can get to anywhere you want to in Tokyo once you work out the subway system! If you stand around any station looking confused then you're basically guaranteed to have someone try to help you and then you'll figure out what you're doing. God bless the person that decided to put the subway lines in romaji as well as kanji!Overall this was a nice place to stay on a budget. If what you want is a clean and cosy room for the night then that's what you get. I would stay here again because it was clean and the price was good.", "Date": "Jan 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486777666", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mittencats"}, {"Content": "Wonderful, simply marvelous! Hello!Having stayed at Sakura Hotel on numerous occasions I can recommend it to travelers the world over! The place is cheaper than the ladies of Shinjuku, and that's pretty cheap for Tokyo! The rooms are clean with a daily wake up call by their friendly cleaning staff who barge into your room unannounced while you are lying naked in your bed or in an intimate moment with a lady friend, I am a ladies' man after all! The desk staff are always friendly. Dealing with your problems with a smile and no thanks necessary. A Continental Breakfast (which I believe is Japanese for Toast and orange juice) is provided in the mornings to guests. PROTIP: The staff don't check if you're staying at the hotel, so if you're staying at the Hilton or Mandarin Oriental and feel like a free breakfast stop by, no one will notice! Toilet and shower facilities are shared and if you are a voyeur this hotel will be ideal as there are windows on the toilet doors that, if you press against hard enough, will allow you to see what's going on inside! They are cleaned daily and always in pristine condition.TVs are provided in the rooms with pay TV available from vending machines on the floors. The channels that this gives you is some sport and a whole load of pornography, which is nice.All in all I would stay at the Sakura Hotel everytime I come to Japan!
