Make sure you get this number before you leave home (this is NOT your Confirmation number or Itinerary number - we tried both)!A kind German guest rang a couple of telephone numbers stuck to the machine and sorted it out and we got our key after about 10 minutes. After this rocky start, our room was fine. Plenty big enough and everything was clean. There was a kitchinette with cooker, fridge, sink and table and chairs to eat from. It would have been fine for a few days, though we we're there only one night.There's a big building site right across the road. It didn't give us any trouble but we arrived late and left early.The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the main railway station, which was our reason for choosing it.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR366571392", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RolandT"}, {"Content": "No-frills, friendly hotel The hotel staff is friendly, but they seem a bit overworked. They sometimes overlook things (eg. we ordered a room with breakfast and onthe first day, they forgot to buy enough bread for the breakfast for us). Our room lacked soap in the bathroom and we had to ask for an electric kettle. Apart from that, it was OK: WiFi worked in the room without problems and the room was itself very clean and tidy. The location is very convenient, the street was quiet despite some construction works taking place nearby. Overall, I can recommend this hotel for budget travellers wishing to visit Berlin for museums and sightseeing.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR567049856", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "katastrofa"}, {"Content": "Preiswertes Hotel im Berliner Zentrum   showReview(10566606, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR261339372", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lotling"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d666684-r22420962-Gastehaus_Berlin_Mitte-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "666684", "Price": "$147"}}
