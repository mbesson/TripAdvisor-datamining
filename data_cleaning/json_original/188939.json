From the moment we arrived everything was bad; my wife had made the booking and I arrived two hours before her as we were travelling separately but I wasn't allowed into the room until I paid up-front despite my wife making the booking with her credit-card! And with another 4% 'admin charge' on top. The room itself, on the very top floor (with no lift or no-one offering to help with our luggage) was absolutely tiny. In fact, it was impossible to get around the bed to the bathroom with having to clamber over part of the bed. The bed was hard and lumpy with one small pillow each. The television was placed on the bedside table and angled away from the bed so it was impossible to watch. The floor was polished wood over which they had placed two small rugs which meant you slipped over constantly when standing on these rugs. The kettle could only be used by placing it on the floor as the only plug was too far away for its lead. The bathroom consisted of a toilet that broke on our first night and wouldn't flush and a small bath. There was a shower attached to the bath but no shower screen and the shower-head had to be held by hand to use it. There were no toiletries whatsoever except one minute bar of soap and for the two of us there were three towels which were really just large flannels. The following morning breakfast was left for us outside our room; what a disappointment (although we should have expected it). The breakfast tray for two of us consisted of two small packets of Bran Flakes, just enough milk to put into two cups of coffee (not that we had any hot drinks served with our breakfast), two small glasses of orange juice, two stale croissants, and two blueberry muffs that had been seen better days. We also had two small packet-portions of blackcurrant jam but no butter, only one knife, two spoons and two cereal bowls which were really egg-cups in size. Needless to say, we left most of this and went elsewhere for breakfast In addition, you have to leave your key when going out (meaning anyone can get into your room), you have to pay up-front before even seeing your room, and the staff are incredibly uninterested in customer service and decidedly rude.

They said they would but sometimes the taxi firm they used didn't show up. Sure enough, twenty minutes later we were still waiting. They then said they would hail us a black cab. Ten minutes later we went outside ourselves in the dead of night, only to find that the hotel attendant who was supposed to be hailing a cab was idly standing in the car park. Very odd.

We were offered to use their private shower as an alternative, but we did not want to use someone else's bathroom. They basically said, 'It's not our fault there's no hot water'.

This hotel is affordable yet kitschy and cozy inside, steps from the Edgeware Road tube, Paddington Station, and buses to Oxford Street shopping as well as 24 hour convenience stores, and an array of nice middle-eastern restaurants. Even though I've had so many positive experiences staying at this hotel in the past, the reviews on Tripadvisor nearly put me off staying at *my own favorite hotel in London* and made me *question my own personal positive experiences* - how crazy is that? By the time I arrived at the Pavilion I expected it to be tatty and horrible, but it was the same as ever; clean, colorful, kooky and delightful. I snagged the incredibly fabulous Enter the Dragon room, decked out in Chinese satins and with crazy Chinese lanterns to light it. Just being in the room made me smile and smile and smile. The bed was ample and comfy as was the room, definitely the best room I've stayed in so far. The 2nd floor room faces out to Sussex Gardens and has a small balcony (you can't go out on though). There is street noise but with window closed this is pretty dampened. We are in London after all so I do expect some noise! The radiator warmed the room when it got a bit chilly in a totally sufficient manner. Only downside is the bathroom is minutely small and if you are 'big' you may not be able to squeeze into the shower, which you have to approach sideways - ! Still, at these prices, and with this style, having ensuite facilities was a luxury. The breakfast is nothing to write home about - cheap boxed muffins/croissant, cereal juice and milk - again, not very different than most other tourist class hotels I've stayed at. The front desk people were helpful, looking up information for me and allowing me to pay by traveller's check (you need to email and get this approved in advance, but it will save you a 4% surcharge on your room if you use a credit card) and offering to store my baggage on the day of my departure to pick up later. Requests for hairdryer and extra teabags were swiftly answered, nice! One of the desk people even remembered me from staying there two years ago. Aw! Makes you feel like family! With so many negative reviews below I have to ask, what are these other reviewers talking about? Were they staying in the same hotel as me? The only thing I can guess is that somehow it has gotten past them that the Pavilion is a TWO STAR HOTEL, for which you pay a TWO STAR PRICE. Due to that fact, yes bathrooms could be updated and there is no air conditioning (like many London hotels and homes) though I did get a nice little flatscreen TV in my room. Still, I booked my double-bedded room on Ratestogo.com for \u00c2\u00a379 a night, a rate that could have gotten me a pretty shabby place otherwise, in a worse location, with the kind of faceless institutional rooms that makes me cry (see the Tavistock for details on what I'm talking about). I had a hard time finding any hotels in London under \u00c2\u00a3100 a night that were not inherently depressing *and* had an ensuite. The Pavilion is the exception to the rule. If you are looking for a really *nice* hotel with a lot of style, there are plenty to go to in London - for 2-3x the price of the Pavilion.

Rocknroll hotel sounded great to me and since I like fashion photography (the rooms have served as sets to many photoshoots) I booked a room for me and my boyfriend for 3 days. PRICE: 100 Pounds for a hotel room in London is not really a lot. It seems a lot but if you think about how a private room in a hostel costs 60 pounds a night, it was okay for the money. ROOM: We had the Casablanca Nights room on the ground floor (everyone could look into our room from infront of the hotel). The size of the room was okay. The decor was extremely kitchy but alright. The bathroom was really small, the sink was outside of the bathroom next to the sitting area. QUALITY: The windows were not really tight so when we came in at night it was freezing cold. After that we put the curtains infront of the windows so the air wouldn't come in. The mattress really was hard as hell but I actually slept pretty well. The leopard bedspread was full of holes and burn marks...it was a little icky but I didn't have a problem with that. FOOD: Haha, \"continental breakfast is included\". It's just kinda like, just ignore that part. Breakfast included: a glass of orange juice (of course not fresh), Cornflakes with milk (not even frosties??), a mufin (not fresh either), and the most boring-tasting croissant ever. Fortunately there is complimentary tea and coffee in your room (hostels have that too though...). Well, we just ignored the breakfast. INTERNET: I had brought my laptop and we found out that we had free wireless internet at the hotel which was great. All in all it was an interesting hotel, 10 minutes walking to Hyde Park/Oxford High Street and 2 minutes to the next tube station. Something really annoying though was that every morning while we were still sleeping the manager (some young dude) would start up his Lamborghini (one of his many luxury cars parked infront of the hotel) and let the engine howl for 10 minutes until driving off very loudly which woke me up every time. It's like a slap in the face since his cars are infront of the hotel and inside it's really crappy.

My girlfriend and I were originally booked into the 'Indian 'Summer' room, having been tempted into staying at this hotel by it's rumours of being a favourite with celebrities and it's quirky themed rooms. On being shown to the room and having been asked to pay for the room up front on our arrival (which automatically caused alarm bells to ring), we found an overly cluttered, dingy and noisy wardrobe-sized cave of a bedroom full of discarded Indian restaurant furniture and a four poster bed clinging on to life. We were scared to even breathe too close to it, never mind actually sit on the bed in case it collapsed and took the whole oompa loompa-sized matchbox of a room with it. The bed dominated this dungeon and it was a mission in itself to make it across to the window (about three pidgeon steps) to close it and so mute the traffic noises of the big City, only to find the window WAS SHUT. No double glazing = noooooiiiiiiiiiiissssse. How trading standards haven't been summoned leaves me bewildered. Having paid \u00c2\u00a3100, we decided to air our misgivings to the receptionist as to the rickety bed and the rooms general claustraphobia and were thankfully given a key to a room above, named the 'Flower Power' room. This was better in the sense that it was a bit bigger, more airy and had a bathroom that could at least fit a bath in it. However, it was still very noisy, still too small compared to general hotel room standards and the bathroom appeared to be HAUNTED. No lie. Twice my girlfriend heard a loud growling behind her when she was using said room.....and me? I heard what can only be described as a loud toy duck quacking directly behind my head! It sounds ludicrous but this is a true account of events and left me empassioned enough to write this review. As for the breakfast: tiny, no butter, nowhere to eat it and you had to get on your hands and knees to make a coffee. Incidentally, is it too difficult to put wall sockets on straight?
