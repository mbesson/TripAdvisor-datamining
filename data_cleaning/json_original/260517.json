If you don't mind staying in a place that reminds you of a run down youth hostel, then that's ok, but the towels and bed linens are old and gross, the floors seem to be sticky and the rooms get really dark once the sun goes down since there are only 3 small lights. Since its right by the street there is a fair bit of party noise too, so bring some ear plugs. If you're on a major budget you could consider this place, otherwise find a better spot.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cMore than we expected - we will come back soon\u201d", "Author": "maxist921", "ReviewID": "UR115485551", "Content": "Siesta & Fiesta was the perfect choice for vaccations in playa del carmen. In a town full of hotels and night-life-possibilities the hotel siesta & fiesta differs significantly from all the other hotels. The nice arcitecture of the hostel gives the whole place a nice, typically mexican flavour and we immediatly liked the wooden \"siesta & fiesta\" style, which is easy to find out, even from outside on the street - just take a look. The food was really good and you have next to the typicall stuff a variety of mexican specialities, so we didnt check out a lot of restaurants outside of the hotel. Another big plus is the live music every night - perfect to start playa del carmens night-life! The bar offers every kind of alcohol, but we stayed almost all the time with beer and tequila. The rooms were clean and quite big and you can chill out on one of the hammocks, which come with the room. The staff was really friendly and everybody spoke english - so our spanish-skills didnt really become better. We had so much fun there that we decided to go there another time! We recommend this hotel to all our friends!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201creview about their bar\u201d", "Author": "Enny87", "ReviewID": "UR114930641", "Content": "Went to the Siesta Fiesta bar last week and they had a good band playing which was fun. Had a good time there with my boyfriend and we drank 7 corona's each. The staff was ok, untill we got the check. They charged for every corona too many pesos. They also put 20 pesos extra + 15% tax + 15% tip. These last two where ok for us, but we were wondering where the 20 pesos came from. We thought \"ok, just a mistake, no problem, we'll just tell them\". But when we told our waiter about the corona prices and asked him about the 20 extra he just put a menu in front of us and said loud \"here! you see, 20 pesos!!\". So we read where he pointed at and there stood that when you sit on a table, there has to be a minimum consumption of 20 pesos pp. Let me make this clear; we are never difficult with tips or what so ever. It was just that they first make every corona more expensive than there was standing on the menu, and then they add an other 20 pesos out of nothing. If they charge 20 pesos out of nothing extra to every table, then that's a lot of money at the end of the day.. And when you just ask about it, the waiter becomes extremely rude to you... He didn't wanted to give anything back and threw our change at our table. We just never come here again.. and we will never recommend it to anybody to go to this bar..", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cbitten and jacked\u201d", "Author": "jazzer24", "ReviewID": "UR15875848", "Content": "was happy to find this place. cozy rooms, warm water, private balcony, all for $40US two short blocks from beach... the problems? okay...... dirty linens, and I got eaten alive by bedbugs AND someone came into my room, took my credit card out of my wallet, wrote the numbers down, and put the card back. clever, eh?

In addition, the top 40s/U2/marly music bumping from the place downstairs continued until about 1am each evening. Bugs were all over the beds in the rooms that were supported by styrefoam and were less than comfortable, but for $40/night (for 2 people) it wasn't so bad as long as you didn't plan to be in the room. It was a little sketchy when we were \"checking out\" b/c on the table where you check in/out was a large butcher knife just chillin...not sure what that was for. A plus of this hotel was the location since it was 2 blocks from the beach and on the main drag of playa. Also, there is a cute little coffee shop accross the street that serves excellent pastries and coffee. Each room also has a balcony with a hammock that was great for relaxing.

Sheets that smell like they've never been washed? Pillows that emit funny smells? Then the Siesta Fiesta Hotel (better off in a youth hostel) would suit you fine. We arrived in late April and paid for two nights. After a siesta my travel friend woke up with a bad mold reaction causing respiratory problems and I woke up with a stiff back and stuffy nose. On a positive note they do provide one towel per person about 1 x 2\" and see-thru. Their room lock system is a pad lock so if you have two people in one room and you do your own thing at night like we did, one person will not have a key and you must pray they wake up to un padlock the door from the inside. We told the manager after waking up from a short nap that we would suffer the loss from one night we paid and leave immediately but would like a refund on second night. He said he would refund it when he returned. We quickly moved to another hotel and came back to obtain our refund. The manager was not there but a new manager on duty was but he told us he just arrived and was too busy so we said we'd have a drink and wait the 15 minutes requested of him. After the 15 minutes we were told he was showering. We came back a couple of hours later and were told he was having dinner with his girlfriend.
