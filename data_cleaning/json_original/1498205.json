It has fantastic location, few minutes from La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya or Port Vell. Hotel itself is situated in an historic building in Barri Gothic, medieval center of Barcelona, just a minute away from Barcelona Cathedral. It is newly redecorated with very modern furniture and it could be easily cold boutique hotel. You can choose between room facing street or facing beautiful inner courtyard designed like zen garden. I choose former because they were more peaceful. Room itself is also modern, have air condition and free wireless internet. Highlight for me were terrace at the top of the hotel with relaxing area and pool overlooking Barcelona Barri Gothic roofs, and live music in restaurant at night (girl singing accompanied with man playing acoustic guitar). Hotel stuff are all very pleasant and replied quickly and friendly to every request I had. I didn't took breakfast at hotel because it was 19 Euros. There are a lot of nice places where you can eat far cheaper. I personally enjoyed having breakfast at El Mos in Carrer Comtal and in Buenas Miguas foccaceria just at the back side of cathedral.

If you are one of these people, you will breath an enormous amount of relief followed by a huge smile at the Catalonia Catedral. This was our first time in Barcelona, so beyond google maps and tripadvisor, narrowing it down to one hotel was a shot in the dark. We stayed in a superior room, which is my understanding is a bit bigger than the regular rooms. Our bed was comfortable, lots of pillows, fluffy towels, plenty of closet space, and an a/c that pleased. The staff were always warm, friendly, and personable, even at 4:45am when I am pacing back and forth waiting for my buddy to get back from the bar because we have to go to the airport at 5am. And yes, they always have someone at the desk. At night, they lock the doors and the person can see if someone approaches and will open, so you will feel very safe in this place. The bad? Before you read this, just let me say I hate typing anything bad about a hotel I liked. All hotels have their quirks, and considering the location of the hotel, I wouldn't really think the \"bad\" is limited to this hotel. That said - at night the hotel is so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. I'm someone who needs white noise, so this made it hard for me to sleep. But then since the hotel is so quiet, as soon as housekeeping starts at 7am, you hear it. Luckily the shops and action don't get cranked up until 11:30am/noon, so you're fine there. The other annoying thing was the internet. They do have free wireless, but I think because of the location, it's probably not the most wireless friendly setting. Sun-Wed while there, we got spotty internet, but by Wednesday evening, we were never able to get on again. Even the laptops downstairs didn't work. HOWEVER, the staff said we were welcome to go to any of their sister hotels (one was not even a minute walk away) and use the internet there. The Amazing: Staff is awesome, location is awesome. I don't speak spanish, so being able to jump in a cab and just tell them \"Catedral\" made it so easy to get back to the hotel. You have it all right there - the Catedral, Rambla right around the corner, the port is a 10 minute walk away, metro stops at Catalunya, Rambla, and behind the Catedral. Never had problems getting a cab thanks to the Catedral and Placa Catalunya. Shopping all around, food, ice cream, ahhh....I miss it so much and I haven't even been gone a week. Also, we arrived in Barcelona at 9am, and they offered to keep our bags and bring them up to our room for check-in time around 2:00/2:30. Bottom line: Even with the whole wireless internet frustration, I never once thought I wished we stayed somewhere else. I'm a hotel snob, and I don't regret the 7 nights we spent there at all. I would stay again, just this time, I'd buy something that made some white noise for sleeping. But full disclosure, I own a very loud snoring pug and have slept with a desk fan on every night for the past 5 years. I never sleep good in quiet hotels.

The rooftop pool/garden area with sunbeds was relaxing and surprisingly peaceful- not very big but enough to cool down at the end of the day! Towels are provided. A drink service was available from the bar but a bucket of ice and glasses were provided which was handy for our own drinks which we took up ourselves.

We booked a room via booking.com and were very disappointed upon arrival by the size of the room. The small double room felt suffocating (mind you, it doesn't look like the hotel pictures at all!) and therefor we asked for a superior at reception. Our superior was a pleasant size, so we decided to pay the extra 40 Euro's a night. However, the bathrobes and slippers were not in the room, as mentioned as a \"standard\" in the description. We were told they were out of stock and would be provided the next day. Also there was no newspaper, no Oreo biscuits, Wifi was out of order and no turndown service, as mentioned in the description. Ok, so far, no problem, these things happen. After roomservice cleaned our room the following day, we arrived back in our room, to find no bathrobes nor any slippers. Also the instant coffee had not been supplemented, nor were the showergels or any other bathing products. Our dirty towels had been neatly folded, but not cleaned. Again no sight of a newspaper and no turndown service. We had to telephone reception to ask (again) for bathrobes and slippers and decided to forget about the other things. After all, we are on a city trip, not on a hotel opinion/testing trip and all the other stuff is not really a necessity . I must say, we are not the demanding kind of people and (because of our airlinejobs), have stayed in a lot of different 4 star (or more) hotels all over the world. But this non existing service we never experienced before. Since we don't want to act as a \"bore\", we left after 2 nights, being charged 420 Euros, feeling somewhat disappointed. The good side of this hotel is without a doubt the location, walking distance from the catedral and a very pretty neighbourhood surrounding the catedral. But, if you are willing to pay over 400 Euros for 2 nights, I would pick Neri or something similar to Neri.

The hotel is small in the entrance but has an amazing style. It is clearly new, very stylish and a sophisticated (but not exaggerated) luxury.

Also, if you're touring Barcelona during the summer, the small-but-adequate swimming pool is a great afternoon refresher. But the staff is uneven - some good, some not -- maybe even shady. At 7:35 one evening we needed a cab to take us to the train station -- since there is a very busy taxi rank about a block away, we were just going to pull our suitcases down the pedestrian block to where they were. However, the desk attendant insisted on callinng one for us. Fifteen minutes later we went back in to inquire about our cab. No problem, he said. At 8:00, still no cab (remember, there are at least 20 of them one block away), so we told him that we were going to walk -- No, he said, his cab was almost here; true enough, we hadn't walked for a minute when the cab intercepted us at 8:05 -- Guess what happens at 8:00 PM? THE TAXI RATES INCREASE!!! That was too much of a coincidence for us, Either the attendant called his special pal from way across town, or the hotel and taxi company have something going on -- because in one minute we drove right past the 20 cabs sitting and waiting at Placa Catalunya!! As a tourist, you have to be able to absolutely TRUST hoteliers, train station personnel, etc., and that was the exact opposite of our experience at hotel Catalunya!! (Perhaps that is why their ranking on TripAdvisorhas dropped so much since we visited Barcelona in July -- #9 back then!) However, Don't miss Barcelona -- Definitely one of Europe's greatest cities. Also, the on-and-off bus systems are the best (and most reasonably priced) in Europe -- and we've ridden on an awfully lot of them.

Our hotel room overlooked a bustling little square where many people pass through on their way to or from the Cathedral, the nearby shops and boutiques or the lovely Placa de Catalunya. We asked for a balcony room on one of the highest floors because of a recommendation we saw on trip advisor. It allowed for great people watching but the noise from the square and street below wasn't too loud. Of the 5 nights we stayed in the hotel, only on Saturday night did we hear some loud voices for about an hour. But having the balcony was well worth enduring a little noise as we enjoyed the ambiance of the Barri Gotic in our room. Note that when we first looked at the room with the front desk attendant, the balcony doors and shades were shut and the room was rather dark. When I asked him to open one of them he said that the doors could not be opened and it sounded like they had to remain closed. I was disappointed but of the two rooms available at the time we preferred the one with the balcony because it was more spacious (also cost more but it was worth it.) I was relieved that he must have meant he himself could not open the doors because the bellhop had no problem opening them for us, which made the room so bright and enjoyable. There's a pool on the rooftop and even though the weather in May was delightful and warm, the pool water was rather cold. But we found it relaxing and quiet up there and enjoyed the warmth of the sun. Overall, the service at the hotel was very good - the housekeeping was impecable and once when we needed assistance from engineering because we blew a fuse, he came right away and fixed it. The only exception was the one guy at the front desk - perhaps he was new or didn't understand English well. Our friends were visiting Barcelona at the same time and we had planned to meet at the Catelonia Catedral if our cell phones didn't work, which they didn't. But when they went to our hotel on the 3rd day of our 5 day stay and asked for us, the front desk guy said there was no one staying there by that name! We highly recommend you take the Hop On, Hop Off bus tour. We did it 2 days in a row and saw and experienced so much very easily that way. The stop near the hotel is close to the Cathedral (cross the main street that's along the square for the Cathedral.) You can walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas in about 10 minutes and all the way down to the marina and beach, it isn't far at all - maybe a 20 minute stroll. I also walked to the Block of Discord neighborhood to see the Gaudi casas. Highly recommend going into Casa Mila, especially the artistic rooftop where you can enjoy 360 degree views of the city. Our room overlooked a great little restaurant with an outdoor patio that is above the Dali museum. We ate there twice and enjoyed the food and ambiance. A block away near the Cathedral, you'll find a great little place for tapas and next door is a gelato counter - both allow you to sit at tables outside and enjoy the amazing diversity of people walking by. There are also some restaurants in that square for breakfasts that have decent food, although the service is not like we are used to in the U.S. The servers we encountered in Barcelona seldom smile and don't go out of their way for you, so if you find the same kind of service, you won't have to take it personally!

It is situated in the heart of the massive pedestrian area that is the gothic quarter. This is a great launching point to do almost anything in Barcelona. We walked everywhere with our 5 month old in the stroller. It really is a boutique hotel that gives you the feeling you must be paying so much more than you actually are to stay there. The design and attention to detail in the whole hotel is clear. Everything is so clean, and its easy to spot staff constantly ensuring everything is spotless. Also, the pool is really great to have on those days you want a swim/tan, but don't want to go to beach. The beach is a 30 min walk, but you can take the metro and then its only a 15 min walk from where it lets you off. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was beautiful. The linens were of a superior quality too. We had one of the rooms with a private terrace. The terrace was HUGE, and fun to unwind on at the end of the day. We had a travel cot (baby cot) set up in the room as we had pre-arranged. It was even set up with really cute linen with trucks printed on it. This, despite the unfriendly man at the front desk who had no idea if one was set up in our room, nor would he help us get one he said until the morning, that is, if one is available. I had pre-arranged over the telephone weeks ahead to ensure that we would get one. I truly want to say the staff was accommodating but we seemed to get stuck with this rude and distracted man at the front desk most times when we passed by or had a question. His name was Ricard I believe. Avoid asking this guy anything. He's too busy looking at his computer screen and clearly resents being interrupted. If it weren't for this experience we kept having with this man, we could have given 5 stars for service. In fact the only reason we gave 3 stars was that on the last day we lost our camera. The manager, a woman whose name I did not get really went out of her way to help us find our camera.

The restaurant is great, very comfortable delicious food and the bar is a hip, little area with a flatscreen playing soccer. The only complain, a pretty major one at that since it cost my wife and I much sleep during our three nights there, was the hallway noise--specifically the shutting of doors. For some reason, all of the doors in this hotel are all weighted to shut with the most impact right before closing, giving off a deafening, eching \"BAM!\" every time one shuts.

The breakfast room was nice although service would have been better. If you like cake and pastry for breakfast you are going to enjoy it. There is also a wide choice of fresh juices, fruit pieces and the eternal spanish \"jamon\". If you like healthy breakfasts, you might have a problem. And last but not least: location!!!! The hotel is situated on a pedestrian street that is just a few meters away from the cathedral in the old city (barrio gotic). Since there are no cars it is very quiet and peaceful both in the lobby and in the rooms. (Please note though that no cars will be able to let you off at the entrance). When looking for \"action\" you just step into the sreet: to your left is the cathedral square with restaurants, bars and coffee places (when we visited the was a huge christmas market covering most of the square). If you turn right you get right into one of the nicest shopping streets (although there are many more places to shop). The historic area and the Ramblas are 3 minutes away.

Perfect for anywhere in the Barri Gotic and also for excursions into Eixample. The hotel is very modern and the staff friendly and approachable. The only reason we could find to knock some points off this hotel was the astronomical prices at the bar (the barmaid even apologised before telling me the price of two drinks) Overall this was the perfect way to experience Barcelona.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Catalonia Catedral", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1498205-Reviews-Catalonia_Catedral-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$227 - $397*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ dels Arcs, 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1498205", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d0/33/47/fachada-catalonia-catedral.jpg"}}
