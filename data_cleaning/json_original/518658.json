It is a family business, something very important for me. The owners work as receptionists and this is great for the customers, as their service is the best. The brothers who own the hotel are very polite. Via Milazzo is a small road that begins from Termini station, exactly in front of Terracafe. So, if you come from the airport with a Terravision bus you are lucky as you will find easily via Milazzo. You have only to walk 2-3 minutes to go to the hotel. And of course is near the Termini metro station (4 minutes) where you can find a supermarket to buy water etc. The problem was that when I found the number 42 of via Milazzo, nothing minded me that there was a hotel there, as it forbidden to owners to put something like a neon sign outside the building. So you have to ring the bell. The building accommodates two hotels and many other companies, but you will find very easily the reception office of the hotel if you turn right and then left. The building is old and the rooms are large. It is not a super duper hotel, but it is clean (very clean) and actually you will not have any problem. If I want to find some negatives I will refer that the water was not very hot in the bathroom and at breakfast the croissants were not so fresh. I recommend it for those guys who don\u2019t search for a luxury hotel but can do with something more simple. I understood that the receptionist was the owner by myself, as he was not had a typical behaviour, but he was really interested to serve me, something that only the owner can do.

The hotel is in a quiet street near the Termini station. The entrance is a little hard to find - there's no obvious hotel sign, just a name on a door buzzer, so don't give up when you are looking for the door! There's a tiled courtyard, and the reception is off to the right towards the rear of the building. One of the brothers is always at the front desk, and the brothers seem happy to answer any and all requests for assistance - they speak excellent English. When I arrived the router providing wi-fi on the second floor was broken: because i required it during my stay (I was there on a work trip), they immediately suggested moving me to a room on the third floor. Breakfast is in a small room behind reception. I've seen some comments here that's it's basic, but I was perfectly happy with what was provided: really good blood orange juice, water, tea, any kind of coffee you like made to order. there are plain bread rolls (with jam or nutella), yoghurts, and also some sweet pastries like almond croissants. I stayed here for 4 nights, went elsewhere for the weekend and then for one night the subsequent week. The brothers kindly allowed me to leave one suitcase at the hotel while I was away for the weekend; when I returned on the Monday, the bag had already been taken up to the room for me - very thoughtful. There's a small street market in the mornings outside the front of the hotel, which is nice, but be aware that this means stalls set up from about 6am, so there is a small amount of noise as a result. If you are in a room at the front on a lower floor, you might need to sleep with your window closed (there's air-conditioning, so having windows closed on a hot night isn't a problem). I was on the third floor, and the noise wasn't an issue. In terms of Roman neighbourhoods, the Termini area isn't the most scenic, but it is not as dingy or as unsafe as some guide-books will tell you. Watch out for pickpockets around the station, but otherwise it seemed fairly safe. It's really convenient to be close to the intersection of two Metro lines and to the station if you are travelling elsewhere in Rome. However, be aware that many interesting parts of Rome (eg Trastevere, Campo dei Fiori) are a pretty lengthy walk or a very awkward journey by bus from Termini - allow lots of time to get to and from your destination.

When we first arrived, we thought the area was a little dirty and seedy but it turns out, most of Rome looks like this - not a very clean city. We felt perfectly safe walking around the neighboring streets, looking at different buildings and finding good places to eat (all the places around were delicious). The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with a smile. The breakfast was very simple, bread and yogurt, juice and coffee. However, each morning but Sundays, there is a little market that sets up on the street that sells fresh fruit and vegetables, clothing etc... so I just went out and picked up some plums, peaches etc... and the 3 of had snacks for the day for 5 euro. The room was a little small for a triple (150 Euro/night) compared to what we had in other cities but we were there to see Rome, not the room. It held the 3 of and our suitcases and that's all we needed. The girls seemed to think the water in the shower was a little \"gritty\" but I didn't notice any difference. Again, the location is perfect because we took the subway to the Vatican, The Spanish Steps and the Coloseum. 5 minute walk, 5 minute ride and you are there. Subways were definitely crowded heading towards to major sites unless you get an early start (8 am)... If you are there to do the tourist thing, this is a good place to stay... it's not fancy, frilly or romantic... It's a good, basic hotel with clean, comfortable rooms with a great locaton to get around. On a side note, if you are doing the tourist trip, I'd highly recommend the Segway Tour of old Rome. 3 hours of cruising around old Rome seeing the ancient sites without having to walk everywhere in the heat (It was about 86 degrees in Rome at the end of June). You don't get to go in an visit inside the sites, you see them from the outside but it gave us a good perspective on the layout so when we did go visit the Coloseum, Forum etc... we knew where we were. Well worth it and the guides were great. www.italysegwaytours.com Also, if you are doing a tour of the Vatican, we hired 7hillstours to give us a private tour. Andrea gave us three hours of detailed information that you just won't know if you go in on your own. It was $160 Euro for the 3 of us but they do have group tours that are cheaper and this tour is at 2:30 in the afternoon so the crowds have thinned out and you don't have to wait in lines. We also did an underground tour of the Necropolis under the Vatican and you see St. Peter's Tomb - incredible.

It is one of these city hotels located in the converted apartments. The (24hr) reception is on the ground floor and the blocks of rooms are situated (at least) on a couple of other floors of the buidling. But they all (it seems) share a common starecase. The rooms are large (at least ours), with high ceilings, wooden floors, etc. The only thing I disliked about the rooms was \"weak\" flush of WC (sometimes you need to wait for 5 mins just to do it... sorry for this detail; but maybe the hotel management reads reviews and fixes it).

I had no problems finding the hotel, it is two minutes from the termini rail link. The area around the hotel isn't great, a littel burt run down if anything. Upon arival was shown my room. No issues with the room, large, and had a nice bathroom. My room faced the street, but had no issues with the noise etc (even with the flea market outside early in the morning). The bizarre things about this hotel is that it has a very tiny lift, and to get to your room, you have to go through a large door to get to your landing and then another door to get to your room. In the morning when I tried to leave the room the landing was black, and you need to find the light switches.I did after several minutes (this may be discerning for some). To get off the landing you have to go through the large the door, having arrived very late the nifght before, I struggled to get off the landing (lol), you get used to this after the first time. Breakfast was fine, nothing great, but not bad either. I was offered coffee by the waitress who then made it, which was nice. The brothers are very good and pointed to the places that you should see. they gave some good recommendations of local restauarnts etc Overall, the hotel was ideal for what I was looking for, somewhere quite cheap, easily access to transport, safe and breakfast included.

At any price.\u201d", "Author": "marinlicina", "ReviewID": "UR38009990", "Content": "To say it short and sweet: Domus Praetoria is one of the best places to stay in Rome. At any price, let alone in it's low price category. As many at TripAdvisor probably thought, I wasn't expecting the hotel to really be as good as all the reviews suggested. Maybe the people just enjoyed Rome so much they overlooked the hotel's flaws. But I can honestly tell you to believe the hype. It's the cleanest hotel I have ever been in, including 4 and 5 star Hyatt's and Hiltons. The service is personal, exceeds expectations and at a very pleasant point between formal and amical. For Italian (or European) standards, the room are above average in size, and what I liked about our room was that it was furnished so well: I usually hate when the bed is crammed into a space leaving you with only a few centimeters to walk by, when closet's cant open fully etc. etc. Our room wasn't large by any standard, but it never felt crammed. Airconditioning is good and not limited to some low-power consumption mode like in some hotels: you can crank it up to cool as much as you like. Another superb thing: cloth hangers! Most hotels provide you with 3 or 4. Here we had around 10. It's such a considerate detail that most hotels decide to ignore. The bathroom is also the cleanest I have ever seen. No dust, smudge, anything at all. The toilet, bidet, shower, everything was as clean as it can possible be. Towels were switched daily, even though some of them were only used once or not at all. Our showerhead was damaged by the previous guest, but it was something the maid overlooked. So the shower was spraying around, making it a bit difficult (but not impossible to shower). We pointed them to this detail and they fixed it immediately, while we were away for dinner. New shower head. Problem more than solved. Breakfast is ok if you like Italian breakfast (brioche and jam, capuccino and some fruit juice and/or yoghurt). No luxurious breakfast here, but I'm in Rome to go out and have some fun, not to have 2 hour breakfasts. The breakfast room was very, very clean, the food was fresh and plentiful. So it might be a very simple breakfast, but done very well. The brothers make a great capuccino. The staff is friendly and ready to answer questions, their english is very good and they even allowed us to check out of the room 1,5 hours after the regular checkout time, although there were other guests coming in the afternoon. A very big plus in my opinion is free and quite fast Wi-Fi. I hate it when expensive hotels decide that being able to check your e-mail once in a while should cost 10 euros or whatever a day. Our Travel guide specified the neighbourhood as 'shady' and said it might be better not to be there for too long at night. We didn't notice any of this. Yes, it does have a large concentration of immigrants, some characters loitering around the central station (Italian and foreign alike), but we never felt unsafe or saw anything unusual or treathening. The police is ever present around the Termini station, day and night. Speaking of the station, Termini is the place you get off when coming from the airport and the only crossing of Rome's two subway lines, which I find really valuable, instead of wasting time going to and from your hotel, you can be almost anywhere in central Rome in less than 20 minutes. To summarize: if you don't need a sauna, swimming pool, restaurant or conference room in your hotel, this is the one to choose. It's clean, the rooms are very good, the service is fantastic and the price is unbelievably good. If you just want to stay comfortably in Rome for a few days and don't have any special needs only a large hotel could fulfil: go to Domus Praetoria.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi", "Title": "\u201cThanks to Hotel Domus Praetoria\u201d", "Author": "FADI1981", "ReviewID": "UR37542589", "Content": "Me and my wife had stayed at the Domus Praetoria Hotel for 4 nights and it was really a great place to stay.

The result was complete satisfaction. Here are some highlights form our stay . LOCATION - If all roads lead to Rome, they more specifically lead to the Termini Station. The Hotel DP is 500 meters from the station and that is a huge plus for catching the train, shuttling to and from the airport, and taking the metro anywhere in Rome. Some folks wrote about the area after dark being a little shady. We had no issues with that, and if you do feel funny, there is a police/guard station about 100 meters from the hotel. There is also a internet/laundry cafe close by. They do a great job on your clothes and are reasonably priced. Additionally, check out the Antique Tavern on the street for good food. HOTEL - The actual hotel is run by 3 brothers, aided by their father. Everyone speaks English and the service is excellent. The hotel is clean, quiet (no kids running around) and a free breakfast of yogurt, pastries, and cappuccino is provided daily. The room was large, big king bed, private bath with tub and shower, safe and mini-bar, and wonderful windows that opened two a courtyard. You turn in your key as you leave the hotel, and they buzz you in. The process made us feel very safe about people just coming in and out. SERVICE - The service is top notch. They helped with tours, maps, always followed up on our visits and anything we needed we received ASAP. The internet only works in the breakfast area, but they are working on that, and they are fine with you using their printer if you need it. The building does not allow Irons, but if you find yourself in need the laundry/internet cafe up the street can help. PRICE - for 14 days they charged us $1600 (USD) 1200 EURO. That was the big sale for us. We got a discount for booking so long, but 90 EURO a night in Rome was a great deal which allocated funds for some amazing day trips and other things. All in all, I agree with the above reviews. The Hotel Domus Praetoria is a hidden gem in Rome. The place belongs in Frommers and other travel guides. I have already recommended to several friends and if we visit Rome again (we did throw a coin in the fountain) we will always stay at the Hotel Domus Praetoria.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExactly as advertised and reviewed\u201d", "Author": "alice063", "ReviewID": "UR25210707", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my family because of all the rave reviews and we were not disappointed.

The bathroom had recently been renovated, so everything there was new and in perfect working order. And the place would have passed a white glove test with flying colors! The father and 3 sons were all friendly and accomodating. The breakfast room was small, but never full. Typical european style - bread, pasteries, yogurt, juice, milk, cappucinos. Extra kudos to the cleaning staff - my daughter has a bunny that she takes with her on every trip. It's \"well loved\". Anyway, they washed it and proped it back on her bed. Bun looked, and smelled much better! Also, the kids like to be really cozy, so they were using extra blankets on top of their covers. The next evening, we came back, to find that the maid had incoporated the extra blankets under the covers! And of course, there were always plenty of clean towels. The only reason why I didnt give the rooms a \"5\" is that the tv reception was bad - just a lot of snow. My kids would have liked to veg in front of the tv to unwind before bed. The location wasnt bad. It's 3 - 4 blocks from Termini, so easy to find. And easy to catch trains and metro. Very safe, if you keep an eye out for cars and motorcycles... : ) However, it wasnt in the middle of everything. It would have been nice to stop by the room in the middle of the day.

We stayed in the \"new apartment\" which is one floor above the reception office.

You enter a room that has a coffee table and two chairs and a mini-fridge. A long hall extends from this room, and off the hall were the two bedrooms and bathroom. The bedroom with the three single beds actually had another room adjoining it which had a wardrobe in it. Also, there was a large \"spare room\" off the hall which was not specifically intended for use but actually had a large table in it which we used once for a family meal. The mattresses on all the beds were very firm (great if you have a back problem) but still comfortable, and the queen-size bed was actually larger than an American standard queen-size bed. The entire \"apartment\" was immaculate. Heat and hot water were plentiful, although the water in the shower every so often gets reduced pressure or heat for a minute or so and then goes back to normal operation. The three Menichelli brothers and their father, who own the hotel, are incredibly nice and always accommodating. Although the Termini area is a little \"sketchy\", we always felt completely safe at this hotel. Also, the access to the Termini down the street makes metro and bus transportation easy. (We took the Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini and then walked the short distance to the hotel.) The small breakfast (roll and pastry, yogurt, cappuccino, coffee, or tea) was just right to start the day. Also, if you occasionally get tired of going to restaurants, note that what is called the \"Drug Store\" in the Termini is actually a supermarket and has all the foods you could possibly want.

My room had excellent air conditioning and I was really happy about that! The hotel is mid-block, and there are huge wooden doors. There's a rather small plaque out front with the hotel's name, so it's kind of hard to locate. You press a button, and the door buzzes and automatically opens.

There's a breakfast room now. It's small but quite adequate. You can sit down at small bistro tables and have great rolls, cereal, cappucino.

The 5 star reviews in Trip Advisor on this hotel are accurate. The best part of our stay in the hotel was the superior attention to customer service from the owners and operators of the hotel, the Menichelli brothers. The hotel even picked-up our Trenitalia train tickets from the main station and mailed them to us in the USA and then answer every tourist question we threw at them in Rome. Our room #210 was oversized, even by US standards. We enjoyed wood floors, high ceilings, a granite tile bathroom, an excellent king size bed, and lots of storage space. Breakfast each morning included fresh fruit, Italian pastries, yogurt, juice, and their new espresso machine worked perfectly. The hotel is a quick five-minute walk from the main train station in Rome and is located in a larger condo complex. The map provided on the hotels web site allowed us to walk straight to the complex\u2019s door to ring the bell to find the lobby of the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with a large lobby and a pool I would suggest another hotel at more than twice the price. However, I wonder if the service will be better? The hotel rates were fair, the service and room were superior, and the location was convenient to the train station, and neighborhood was safe. I also enjoyed the market that was on the street right in front of the hotel. Another bonus was the convenience of boarding the express train that went directly to the airport from the main train station only 5 minutes from the hotel.

Another really nice thing about this hotel is that although Rome is a very loud and bustling place with lots of traffic, this hotel was QUIET. We had a courtyard room not facing the street so this could be part of the reason but the street outside is not busy. Some people rating this hotel complained about the lack of breakfast. If you want breakfast, don't come to Rome (or Italy for that matter). The complimentary \"breakfast\" at the bar across the street is in and of itself a quintessentially Roman experience with locals stopping in on the way to work and sharing the day's stories.

When carefully choosing the hotel in Rome (as Rome was the main goal of the journey) I've read lots and lots of surveys about different hotels. Domus Praetoria was #33 out of a thousand Rome hotels - this had convinced me, finally. And this is the first time, when my choise (based on what other TripAdvisor members said about this hotel) have totally failed. (I've had great expectations, sadly). 1) First of all, this is NOT a good location. I can't understand those who mentioned location as \"great\". Yes, it's close to Roma Termini train station, but there are lots of hotels as close as this. And if you need a hotel which is close to the station (or airport, whatever) - yes, it's alright. But the area itself is grey and totally uncharming (compare to the streets around Borghese Gardens!). Every morning you can witness some local market right on the streets with lots of chinese, vietnamese and northafrican people selling their stuff&food. There are also - yes, - some local restaurants, but still I disagree to consider them as good. They are cheap, but lack atmosphere and service is above average. So the only positive thing here is that you can easily walk to hotel from the station and save a few euro on taxi. That's good, but not enough. 2) The property itself disappointed me too. The hotel even has no outdoor sign, so we could hardly find it (it looks just like an ordinary house, not a hotel). The rooms are of a good size, but why on earth did they paint the walls blue? Reminds me of a ward, really. But that's no problem, after all. The only (and the main) problem was with cold. I mean the room - it was really cold inside. Radiators were cold as ice and didn't even seem to have worked ever. Aircon was only blowing the cold air, so every morning we woke up either in a cold, or in a stuffy room. Remember we talk about the end of October - it was +8 at nights! So the morning shower was a torture, not a pleasure. Then the view...well, I'm not kin on it, but the inner yard was not only dark and gloomy - it was noisy, thanks to our Italian neighbours. (Yes, there was also a problem with the card which opens the door - and it was NOT solved until the check-out. But it didn't upset me at all). 3) And, in the end, this breakfast in cafe on the other side of the road. I don't wanna put on a coat every morning to go and have a cup of coffee with a small croissant! Even in small pansions where we stayed on our way to Rome, there was a room (big or small, beautiful or not - it really doesn't matter) where they served breakfast. Here you have to go outside. To be honest, there are also positive moments. The staff was willing to help - that's nice. The size of the rooms and the furniture were good - and that's nice too. Well, the price was not that high (for a Rome hotel). Sadly, that's all; and I advice you to think twice before you made your choice. It's not that bad, but a #33?

It was only approx 150m walk from Rome Termini and I felt very safe walking around the area right up to 11 or 12 at night. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes around the area and I did not perceive it to be \"seedy\" at all! There were 4 or 5 \"wino's\" (drunks) who seemed to live just outside the Termini - I saw them every night, but they were of no threat to my safety! The 3 Menichelli brothers who ran the hotel were the most gracious, patient and kind gentlemen - they helped with tourist information and were very welcoming. Personally, I thought the location of the hotel was fantastic - you could get anywhere you wanted from Via Milazzo - you have the train, the Metro and a bus station with at least 20 different routes, including all the \"Hop On Hop Off\" buses just outside the Termini. I have never seen that many buses in one terminal! There were even Hop on Hop Off open top buses that specialised in all the relevant Christian sites. Amazing! Being a tourist is very easy in Rome (provided you have the patience to wait with the other 20,000 tourists!) The Praetoria was excellent, clean, safe, spacious accommodation for very reasonable $$. I paid approx EUR82 per night for a single and it was like a 3 or 4 star hotel. The furnishings and bathroom were all fresh and new. There was a minibar, TV, lift, and hairdryer (albeit it was the wall mounted kind with a hose like a vacuum cleaner - a bit difficult to handle if you have long thick hair to style but OK). The breakfast is just a pastry and a coffee across the road at Robertos Cafe - but in saying that, Roberto's makes their own pastries and it was the best custard filled brioche I have ever eaten and still warm out of the oven. The coffees were fab and if you wanted another one, it was like 70 cents. The market in Via Milazzo each morning catered more to local residents than tourists, with fruit, veg, laundry and household items, underwear etc. but you could get some great silk ties for EUR5 each. There are some good imitation designer bags too. All good fun and I would definitely stay again. Rome is one of the worlds most expensive cities and to stay in such lovely accomms for EUR82 a night is almost unheard of - in fact several travel agents laughed at me and said impossible!

I am the guest who could not be moved from Rm210 & who forced the management to displace the pre-booked Finnish guests. I had a fractured spine & had to wait from Mon [morning 1 of our holiday] to Sat to be medi-vac'd out (2 planes, 5 ambulances) - neither they nor I had much choice. I have to say that ASIDE of the nightmare of my accident (in their bathroom) I cannot understand paranoid guests who write frightful reviews that make potential guests, some already with bookings, panic. The last few reviews indicate one or two 'weaknesses' - sadly I couldn't stand to have my breakfast & it was brought to my room each day - but I suspect by morning 4 we too would have ached to sit (tho' the Adriatic B&B we were supposed to move to had this, & we like variety). I would have been most unimpressed by a broken bathroom door & a non-functioning safe BUT they are mendable & don't ruin a holiday. Enough said. The hotel is of a certain style - converting part of a Roman apartment block, on part of 2 floors. There is no communal area. It bears NO resemblance to any 'hostel' and has excellent air con & good beds, which were sadly too well used by us. The inner courtyards are sporadically noisy, because sound carries & echoes in certain ways, & Italians don't know how to speak quietly, nor their dogs to bark quietly, & the person above me did seem to be aiming to walk more kilometres each evening, while moving furniture about, on the wooden floor. However, I am a problem sleeper & none of this would have caused real trouble. The double-glazing, & especially the shutters, are among the best I've seen in Italy. The area around the hotel welcomed my husband/carer with open arms (it is easier for a man) as he travelled from pharmacy to bar to restaurant, on his rare forays out from our joint confinement. Everyone asked after me, all Romans were anxious that we should return (God - who knows!?) and the food he ate was good and reasonably priced. Two more comments as I lie on the floor at home, in a body brace 1.DON'T HAVE AN ACCIDENT IN ROME - the hospital experience was like Dante's Inferno - not hot just hellish & totally lacking in compassion 2.DON'T STINT ON YOUR TRAVEL INSURANCE though we have much paperwork hanging over us - they got us home, door to door, with me totally immobile.

It's a European breakfast of fresh pastry and coffee or juice that you pick up at the coffee bar across the street. Pastries were great and you got your choice from many varieties. The desk staff was very helpful and spoke excellent English. They provided maps and advice. We chose this location in Rome because we didn't want to hire a car or rent one. The hotel is two blocks from the terminal and we could hop on the Metra system and be anywhere in minutes. Our room for two was about 200 euros, but when we checked out, it was less. We think the staff gave us a discount because we met some Americans the first night we were there and told them about Hotel Domus. They booked two rooms that same night .

It is a set-up! Look through all the reviews .. you will see they are very similar and it is obvious the owners of this hotel posted most of the reviews. First off, this hotel is in a terrible location. If you are a tourist and want to see any of the Rome sights, this hotel is in the wrong place. About an hour walking distance from the Vatican .. everything else is 30 minutes away. The hotel is in a very shady and scary location, which is why a guest basically has to enter THREE security doors just to get to his/her room. I did not feel safe walking in this area at night, and I am an avid traveler. Second, the rooms are monastery-like. Quiet, boring, segregated. There is a TV but it only shows Italian cartoons and infomercials. NO CNN, BBC, etc. With no TV and the boring room, it felt like you were in prison. The rooms are clean, however, but our toilet started leaking, and the bathroom tiles were dirty. Third, we traveled all over Italy in hotels where breakfast is included. The hotels we stayed at were similar in price to this hotel. This hotel gives you a \"voucher\" for a cafe across the street and gives you no direction to how to use the voucher. The cafe has very little options. In the other Italian hotels we stayed at, breakfast was served on a patio or inside the actual hotel. The breakfasts were always continental - fruit, cereal, coffee, tea, etc. A HUGE disappointment. Fourth, this hotel basically ruined our trip because we felt so ripped-off. We read these reviews on Trip Advisor and trusted the \"visitors\" who wrote about this hotel. It is obvious after reading them, that they were written by the hotel administration itself, most referring to the \"3 brothers\" who run the hotel, and whom, we had never met.

There were 6 of us traveling together, we spent 3 days at the Domus before heading off on a Carnival cruise. The night before we left, we needed to arrange transportation for a short ride across Rome to a destination where the cruise line was picking us up. Well, no taxi service could accommodate 6 people with a lot of luggage and the ones we called did not want to be bothered with such a short fare, so we told \u201cthe brothers\u201d about our problem and they worked endlessly into the night and the next morning they had 2 taxis waiting for us to depart.

I was concerned as I am really fussy, and have to feel comfortable, otherwise I feel like my whole stay in a town can be ruined by bad accomodation.... After loads of research, I came across the the Hotel Domus Praetoria in Rome. It was reasonably priced, and that concerned me. So I did even more research, and trip advisor was just fantastic. I email the hotel, and the brothers who run the property were great! Very helpful!! The hotel is near the Roma Termini, and not really slam bang next to the sights..but it's not that far, and within easy walking distance. Obviously, as it is close to the Roma Termini, it's not in the prettiest part of Rome, but we never felt unsafe at all. We were two female travelling alone, we arrived into Rome in the early evening, and it was nearly dark...we walked to the hotel, and while it was a little hard to find the actual door into the apartment block where the Domus Praetoria resides, it didn't take us long. It is a door along the street, where you have to buzz the intercom, then they let you in into a hallway into the area. So be mindful, you are looking for a big wooden door- there really isn't alot of signage. But it's not hard to find. The room was big, and clean. We had a big window covered with lovely drapes, and the beds were comfortable. It was sparse, but had all the comforts required. The bathroom was really clean, and quite quaint with its cute tiles..it was also a good size...rare for Europe! The staff were really helpful and friendly. One of the brothers pointed un in the direction of a great restaurant around the corner, where we had the best food we had during our entire stay in Rome. Infact we went back there 3 or 4 times while we were there as no other place really compared...I wish I could remember the name to tell you all! Breakfast which was included was a vouchure which we took across the road of the hotel to the bakery where we had the best coffee in Italy and a really delicious pastry! It was simple, it was Roman, and it was fantastic! This hotel is not 5 star glitz and glamour, it's more like 3 star at 1 star prices- a little more than simple, clean, comfortable, and friendly.

I chose the hotel based on reviews and recommendations from Tripadvisor. Though the Domus is not the cheapest *** hotel in Rome, I was more than satisfied with the service and quality of the hotel. Great value. While making your way down Via Milazzo from Termini Station, you start to expect to have walked too far and right past the hotel. The reason is that the hotel doesn't have a sign besides a plaque on the wall and a note by the buzzer. But don't get fooled, there is a hotel here, and a very good one at that. Staff: The hotel staff is very helpful and speaks excellent English and will show you to your room and how to operate the elevator. They are always ready to answer questions you might have about the hotel or Rome. Rooms: The rooms are average too small size for European hotels. They are very clean and tidy with a comfortably firm bed. The best feature of the rooms is how dark and quiet they are. Double insulated windows with shutters makes an excellent shelter from the noise of the street. Actually, I was surprised to find that there was a street market right outside the window on the first morning. I had heard no sound of that before opening the window. The air condition unit works efficiently and is remote controlled. The wall has a built in safe deposit box. The breakfast: Non-existent besides a pastry and a cup of coffee from the locally popular cafe Roberto across the street. Note that the breakfast is standing - no chairs or tables. The staff at the place is very friendly. The location: The hotel is located a five minute walk from the east side of the Termini station. I had heard about reservations about this location prior to the visit, but I felt perfectly safe on the street during the day as well as during the night. The location of the hotel is very convenient as two subways intersect at Termini and can take you to many sights in town. Given the size of the city center, you can even walk all over Rome using the hotel as a base. Dining: I never dined around the hotel during the stay, so I cannot review the neighboring restaurants. Conclusion: A clean and convenient hotel that will guarantee you a good nights sleep every night.

I have to say that I was hard-pressed to find a better cappuccino anywhere in the city (even Taza d'Oro, at three times the price, didn't compare). Light breakfasts are a great excuse to have a mid-morning pizza anyway. As for the location, well, you are only three blocks from the Metro! While Rome's Metro is not as efficient as London, Paris or Barcelona, it can still get you into the \"ballpark\" where you simply go on foot. If we could do it with a one year old I am confident that most travellers can manage. If you want to be more centrally located you will have to pay a lot more.

Instead, my wife and I were definitely disappointed because we could not see why this hotel was so popular--and my wife and I are comparing this to the twenty or so other moderately priced hotels we've stayed at in Western Europe. What we liked: 1) The room was nicely appointed, quiet, and surprisingly spacious for Europe. 2) The staff at the hotel was nice and helpful. What we didn't like: 1) The hotel location I had two problems with the location. First it was too close to the railroad station. Being close to a railroad station often means not being in the best part of town. I don't know why I ignored my instincts in booking this hotel. Is a 5-7 Euro cab ride to get to a hotel located away from the railroad station that much of a hassle that some people actually prefer staying around the station? The other problem with the hotel's location is that it's not centrally located. From the railroad station, it's roughly in the opposite direction of anything you'd want to visit as a tourist. So everything you'd want to see is either a long walk or a 5-10 minute walk to the subway plus a ride on the Metro. Any time you saved by being close to the railroad station is wiped out as soon as you leave the hotel to visit a tourist attraction. 2) Breakfast Breakfast was a coffee and a croissant at a bar across the street. I bet I've been to fifty hotels offering a free breakfast, and it's never been so little. Lastly, as a warning to anyone thinking of making a toll-free call within Italy from your hotel room at the Hotel Domus Praetoria--don't do it. I HATE hotels with ridiculously high long distance rates, but what's even worse is a hotel that gouges you for toll-free calls.

There was not a lot of storage space or moving around space in the rooms and two people in a double will be cramped. The bed was very comfortable, however. The lack of an inhouse breakfast could get old, I expect, but I didn't mind. Regarding directions from the station, the ones sent to me were not accurate, so here are mine: When you leave your train, walk along the platforms in front of the trains, aiming toward binario number one. Straight in front will be a side entrance to the station (in other words, do not go out to the terminal proper at all.) As you exit that way the road alongside the station is via Marsala. Cross at the light right in front of you. Go right, down via Marsala, for one block, then turn left onto via Milozzi. The hotel is in the last building on the left at the end of the street.

As one previous post mentioned, the hotel is located a couple of blocks on the right side of Roma Termini FS Train Station (train platforms at your back) and despite having been in Roma many times, I was always leery about that side of the train station (flashbacks of the right side of Napoli Centrale). I panicked weaving my luggage through a small street market toward the hotel's address; my heart sank when I found out that the hotel didn't have a \"storefront\" but resides in a building where you need to press a button to get in. Also to reach the front desk, one must go up a couple of stairs which with heavy luggage just added to the disappointment. However, the front desk person, a thin Gabriel Byrne-look-alike, was very kind and dealt with my reservation quickly and helped me with my luggage so my outlook changed. Also, the hotel staff offered to call the airport shuttle people to confirm my reservation(I declined). Unfortunately, there was no hot water in the room. I called the hotel's front desk and I ended up leaving the problem with them as I went out to sightsee. When I returned, the staff apologized and in the room the hot water worked. The fact that the shower head's cradle (room 209) was a bit broken luckily didn't affect its functionality. The toiletries included were two wrapped plastic cups, pieces of soap wrapped in paper, and some packets of shampoo. There were perhaps 6 towels The small refrigerator under the TV didn't seem to work, but I didn't bring it up to the hotel staff as it wasn't important to me. I didn't go onto the room's balcony which seemed to face the inner dmz-area of the back sides of several buildings. There was a temperature control system in the room, however, I didn't use it. Also, I didn't eat the breakfast in the morning as I needed to leave early. It's fascinating that the area outside the elevator on each floor was lushly decorated with stately wooden doors, thick royal blue carpets, and gold accents. However, the hallways to the rooms and the actual rooms had standard ceramic tile (probably easier to clean). Also, the a fluorescent bulb was installed as the room's main center light. IMHO a flood light would have brought out the decor downplayed by the current stark hospital-interrogation room-like fluorescent light. After having walked around the area more, it seemed that the hotel is actually in a pretty quiet area between the two metro stations,Termini and Castro Pretoria. Watch out, the pizzeria across the street from the Castro Pretoria metro stop/Roma Biblioteca library was expensive (\u20ac1.90 for a small slice) and served inedible pizza. I received my requested 3:15am wake-up call and later because the airport shuttle hadn't yet arrived, I decided to listen for the shuttle from the inside of front main door leading to the street due to my early morning crime paranoia. The hotel staff person was nice enough to wait with me and made small talk to pass the time. When the shuttle arrived, the hotel staff person was the one to identify what was going on outside, open the door, flag down the shuttle driver, and help me out with my luggage. Also, I don't remember hearing neighbors' noises such as pens dropping/heels clicking from above or doors opening and closing in general. There was no memorable outside noises either, however, I left the room at 3:30am. I arrived at Fiumicino Airport without any problems.

They do have an elevator if that is a concern, but it is very SMALL (room for three people at the very maximum). The room was very large by European standards, as was the bathroom. Both rooms were spotlessly clean, and the electronic safe was a welcome addition. Breakfast is a voucher for a bar across the street. We started our day with the locals and we enjoyed it very much. There is a street market outside the hotel every morning, but our room was overlooking the courtyard so we never heard a thing in the mornings. Our only complaints (and these were very small) were that there is no internet access at the hotel and no English language channels on the television. I know, this is Rome and we didn't spend much time in our room anyway, but we were hoping to have had a way to keep up on some of the news from home while we were away. Again, very SMALL things in the grand scheme of things, but nonetheless. The newsstands at Termini do carry a couple of English language newspapers, so we ended up buying those. Just as an aside, there are several internet stops in the neighborhood, but we ended up finding one located at Piazza Barberini (two metro stops away) that we liked very much. 250 terminals, 2 euro per hour.

Booked the room directly with the property, a large double for single occupancy at 110 Euros per night. The reservation system was very straightforward, and they were expecting me. The room was large and clean and quiet, but totally featureless. A friend staying at the same time in Rome in a monastery at half the price had a better-decorated room with more amenities and certainly a newer bathroom. The TV was too small to see from the bed, and reception was snowy. The cheerless bathroom is out-dated and had tiny worn towels, a dribbly shower and no decent soap or shampoo. Air-con and (dim) lighting work only by the insertion of the room key card, although my library card from home also worked when I went out. Domus Praetoria occupies about two half-floors in a typical faded grandeur Roman mansion building, and with more personality and generosity of hospitality, it could be a charming pensione. But it claims to be a hotel, which is certainly is not in terms of amenity, quality or management. Everything seems mean, from the rationed soap, electricity and towels, to the punctiliousness of checkout time. The three brothers who operate reception on a shift system are individually charming, but there is little overlap or handover and so my request for 2 prebooked tickets into the Villa Borghese turned out to be only 1 when I got to the museum. And it was sold out. However Brother A was very kind to me when I came home with food poisoning from the dismal tourist trap restaurant Brother B had recommended. What annoyed me most was the paranoid security. This is indeed an \"edgy\" area, but aggressively challenging daylight visitors accompanied by registered guests is ludicrous. I had a business colleague who had arrived to collect a courier package from me at about 10.30am, and was pounced on to leave his driving licence at the desk. Heaven knows what might have happened had I brought back a romantic encounter in the evening. A strip search and a blood sample? I also don't understand why, since room access is by key card, it's necessary to LEAVE the key card at reception when venturing out of the hotel. \"Because we prefer it\" is not an adequate reason. Because there's no breakfast room or other opportunity to interact with other residents, single travellers may feel more isolated and less charmed by this property than couples, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone really. Nor do I see the value in staying close to the Termini Station. It's a dirty and depressing area, and isn't close to anything a tourist would want to see in Rome - the Villa Borghese is a 35 minute walk, and you'd need the metro to get to the Vatican, the Piazza del Popolo, the Trevi, the Piazza Navona, Trastevere .... everything, really, except the wretched railway terminal. I don't normally worry about edgy locations, and could easily sidestep the prostitutes working the corner, the drunks between the hotel and the station entrance, the hustlers with their 3 Euro bottles of water, or the backpackers sharing a slice of pizza from a greasy spoon - but why bother, when there's nothing you'd want in this locality anyhow? Taxis across Rome rarely cost me more than 10 Euros, so I would suggest staying in a more pleasant property with the facilities you might require - and a reception team that doesn't act like the secret police in pre-glasnost Russia - and to not worry so much about location.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Hotel - Unique Character - Freindly Staff\u201d", "Author": "Holtyboy", "ReviewID": "UR5938733", "Content": "We chose this hotel becuse of the Trip Advisor rating - infact the hotel displayed a Trip Advisor award on the reception desk!

Though not exactly filling, the service was courteous and fast and one could easily go out to the open air market on Milazzo and buy fruit to complete the meal. The open air market also offers items ranging from undies to lemon zesters, providing a fun, cool local experience.

Hotel is literally 4 minutes walk to TERMINI (excellent location). Once I arrived I was welcomed by Maximo whom explained to me how the hotel facilities and breakfast vouchers worked. Once he showed me to the room I must say it was FANTASTIC!!!. To Austrlian standards the room is comparable to a 4 star hotel. Clean beds, air cond works, safe facilities and beautiful bathroom Top marks here!!. Breakfast was across the road at \"Bar Robertos\" which gives you a coffee and a croissant of choice, no tables though but having a quick breakfast at the bar is very common in Italy. You know its a good venue when it quickly fills up with Italians living in the area. For dinner I highly recommend \"Mama Angela's\" which is around the corner. This was recommended in a prior review and I must definitely give it the thumbs up!!. Food was great, service was excellent, the ambience was great!!, and last but not least, prices very very reasonable. Full marks go to this hotel. Do not search any more!! just book this hotel, you will not be dissapointed. Metro is cheap 1 Euro a one way ticket. It is not recommended to take a daily ticket for 4 Euro because you will be doing a lot of walking and you will find before you know it you would have walked back to the hotel. If you are considering a tour contact ODYSSEY Tours as they honestly did a fantastic tour, Jason the tour guide was out of this world in knowledge and funny! It is recommended you buy your water before you go out otherwise they will charge you higher prices. At TERMINI station you can buy a 2 litre bottle of water for 1.85 Euros.

Each of the three brothers who run the front desk has lived and worked in London, Paris, and Germany for over a year to hone their language skills.

Video cameras monitored by the 24 hour staff assured that you could feel secure, even in Rome! Individual safes in the rooms made securing valuables even easier. The rooms were spacious, recently updated, very comfortable and very clean. The air-conditioning worked very well and was a new, efficient unit (and we needed it in the over 100 degree weather!). The bedding was excellent. We were in their smallest unit (120 euro/night) where the bathroom was quite small (although the shower was large by european standards) and we would have liked more places to hang towels to dry. Another member of our party was in a much larger room with a larger bath at 145 euro/night. Both rooms were very quiet, with double paned windows blocking all street noise. There were plenty of restaurants nearby which had traditional Italian food at reasonable prices. The staff's recommendations for restaurants were very helpful and accurate. Inexpensive internet access was also available within a block. A local \"farmer's market\" was set up daily outside the hotel, offering fresh fruit and inexpensive merchandise where you could mix with locals looking for a buy. An excellent bakery was almost next door, and the shop that provided the food for the breakfast voucher was just across the street. We liked the location, being 3 blocks from the main termini (railroad station), so that we could catch buses of the underground metro to see the sites. The neighborhood within the first block is a little \"rougher\", as around most train stations, but we felt safe at any hour.

This hotel has a lot of good things going for it. I did have one issue with the hotel. First, the good: 1. Room. I have traveled a lot throughout Europe. I was given room 210, a room at the end of the hallway facing the courtyards. The room was spacious, with plenty of room for luggage and belongings, without having to step over every thing. The bed was large and comfortable. Room and bathroom were cleaned spotlessly every morning. In-room refrigerator with mini-bar, plenty of lighting and the air conditioner worked flawlessly, a great comfort after full days of touring through Rome. 2. Location. Three blocks from Termini Station where we could hop on to the Metro or bus to virtually anywhere in Rome or points beyond. Due to construction, the Metro \"A\" line closed every night at 9PM, but buses and taxis were easy to find to get us where we were going. 3. Price. Compared to similar hotels I've stayed at in major cities throughout Europe, you can't beat the rates. Plus, the free breakfast... while not a lot to eat, some of the best capuccino you'll find in Rome. We always drank our free cup at the counter and then ordered another \"di portar via\" (to go). 4. Safety. A lot has been written about the safety of the area where the hotel is located. I guess I'm just a seasoned traveler because honestly, I can't see what the problem is. During our stay, we regularly returned to the hotel after 1AM, on foot. The streets around the hotel are well lit and never did I feel threatened or in any kind of danger. Termini Station is similar to any other train station. It's huge, busy with folks from all walks of life passing through. Yes, there are several homeless that congregate near the exit to the station, however, I've seen just as many similar types at Grand Central Station or Port Authority in New York City. The one issue with the hotel: During our stay, it appeared that they were having trouble with the hot water system. When we checked in, we were told that since our room was at the end of the hall, we had to let the water run for a couple minutes before it got hot. First day, it kind of got luke warm after running the water constantly for 15 minutes. Second day, ran the hot water for an hour and it never got hot. Called to the front desk and they sent someone up to check, and they never got hot water after about 15 minutes of fiddling with things. However, when we returned at 5PM, the hot water worked fine. Next day, no hot water any time of the day. 4th day, no hot water in the morning, but some in the afternoon. Last morning we had to wake up at 5:30 AM to get to the airport. Hot water worked fine. After chatting with the front desk a couple of times, they were actually very good about it. They explained that a couple other rooms were also having problems, but since it was over the weekend, they had places a call to a technician to look at the system. They also discounted our room price to compensate for the problem. So, overall I give the hotel a 3 rating. It's a good hotel. If the hot water had worked consistently, I would raise my rating on this hotel to a 4.

The staff speak excellent English and are very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, well equipped, recently renovated and was a welcome retreat from our busy days in Rome.

It is a slightly odd set up where the hotel is co-located in a building with other offices and apartments and fairly spread out amoung the other tenants. While that is OK, I just was not really expecting it. While you get a key card, the owners really want to hold onto it while you are gone, which I thought was a little strange, but very traditional. I stayed with 2 friends in a large room with tile floors. It was very basic, but that was fine because we were mostly out and about seeing and doing things in Rome. The bathroom was a bit small. Overall, we were comfortable and the room was clean, which is very important to me. All three of us are women, and we did not feel the least unsafe in the neighborhood. Then again, we live in NYC and are probably more used to urban settings than some of the other reviewers. We've seen sketchy, and this is not really sketchy. Once we had to walk by a group of hooligans at night, but it was OK. You'll be fine. You can actually avoid all of this and walk up a different street to get to the hotel if Via Marsala makes you uncomfortable, so that also is good. The breakfast is fun. You go to a cafe across the street and eat a pastry (value: less than 1 euro, otherwise not free) and drink coffee or tea at the bar with regular people who live in Rome. While the value is not much to speak of (probably a whopping 2 or 3 euros in total), it is great to be in Rome and do as the Romans do... Anyway, for what you get (a clean spacious room, private but small bathroom, easy access to lots of public transportation, walking distance to lots of sites), I thought it was a very good value.

After spending 4 days there we left with mixed feelings as the hotel had good points and bad points. Good Points: 1. At \u20ac140 per night for a double room would have to be seen as excellent value for a central Rome location. 2. Our room was large and spotless and cleaned fully each day. 3. Very central to the main railway station and also to the subway system. In fact we often chose to walk to many of the sights. At a strolling pace we would reach Colliseum in arond 30 minutes and on a few nights we walked back to the hotel from the area around the Trevi fountain in about 30 to 40 minutes. 4. Staff/owners at reception were always very helpful & spoke good English. Bad Points: 1: Area is quite dingy and whilst never felt threatened the walk from the station was through quite a run down area. 2. If you are in room 301 at the front of the building be prepared for lots of street noise which meant that we kept our windows closed fully by night and even that didn't deaden the noise that started around 6:00 AM as the street traders set up their stalls on the street outside. Stalls were a mixture of fruit stalls and what seemed like second hand clothes & books etc. We never spent more than a few seconds looking at them. 3. You have to go across the street for breakfast which consists of a cup of coffee and a croissant. The staff there are friendly & welcoming and you do share an 'Italian experience' however would feel that most people would prefer a sit down leisurely breakfast. 4. The room had an air conditioning unit high up on the wall but the remote control was removed and presumably is only there during peak summer months. As we had to keep the windows closed due to street noise the room became warm and would have liked ability to reduce room heat level on occasions. 5. Didn't like access arrangements where you had to buzz outer door and then collect your room key before using an elevator. Once you got out of the elevator they then had to unlock a door leading to the corridor with the bedrooms. No doubt security was excellent but prefer ability to simply come and go from your room without making it a shared arrangement with the hotel owners! 6.

I read on reviews to request the room with the balcony and sure enough we got one. The bathroom was the largest we had during our 18 days in Europe. We loved the fact that we had breakfast across the street at a local bakery with the locals.

However, from the moment that we pushed open the large, and heavy, door to the hotel, the feelings of safety were predominant. The greeting by one of the brothers (Fabio) was friendly and not with that over effusiveness that strikes one as false. The room and bathroom were very clean,and sufficiently large. It was also very quiet. One setback was the lack of breakfast facilties, which the brothers are attempting to rectify, but still awaiting their licence. However, the small cafe across the road, with whom they have an arrangement, is very friendly. There is also a large number of pleasant restaurants in the vicinity.

There was also a safe, hairdryer, fridge, television and plenty of storage space. But the thing that really makes this hotel special are the owners. The brothers, Massimo and Fabio, were the sole of courteousy and amiability and nothing was too much trouble for them.

The 3 brothers who run the hotel speak brilliant English and are always on hand to give you suggestions, timetables and make reservations. They provided us with a map with street maps which proved invaluable throughout our trip. They also provide a breakfast voucher, which can be used across the road, where you get to mingle with the locals/market traders. In terms of location its great. Termini station is at the end of the road, which means you have access to the metro ( most of the main tourist attractions have a metro station stop) and train lines in/out of Rome (inc the airport). This saved us a packet on taxi fares and transport costs eg we got a cab from the airport to the hotel which cost Euro 50approx and a train back to the airport from Termini which cost 19 Euro for 2 people.
