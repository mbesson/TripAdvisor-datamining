This is not your \"normal\" inn. It is very dirty, the towels are threadbare. There are no heaters in the rooms, you have to ask for a room heater. There are bed bugs in some of the rooms. There are burn marks on the sinks and tubs (I was in several rooms). The water temperature is dangerously hot, so beware if you have children. I personally would not bring a child here, Housekeeping doesn't clean often. The carpeting on the stairs is filthy. There are no working laundry facilities available. This facility is our tax payer dollars at some of their worst. Many families, in transition from homelessness or other circumstances, have vouchers to live here compliments of the county. There are many children, recovering and using addicts. The people are decent, but unaware that they deserve more than what they are given here. If you are seeking a place to sleep that is in close proximity to the downtown/UDistrict area and that is cheap, this is the place. It's interesting to say the least, safe enough (but you do have to be careful and aware) and you can shower.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSwindle Inn\u201d", "Author": "rollingstone206", "ReviewID": "UR118062110", "Content": "Well I have stayed here before and it seemed like a real nice atmosphere.

The rooms are decent and clean enough, the price is negotiable ($50 seems to be the best rate available), the staff is friendly and attentive, and the building is secure. The problem is that the Everspring is dressed up to appear as if it should be compared to places like Days Inn, Travel Lodge, and/or Extended Stay, when in reality it's more closely related to The Orion, Seals, and/or Sunhill (which btw is owned by the same folks who own Everspring Inn). If cost is the main factor when deciding where to stay, then the Everspring Inn is the perfect place.

But lately with the economy that hasn't been able to happen. Last month we sprung for a night at the Everspring Inn. Hadn't stayed there before, but we were cruising around Aurora Ave., saw it and decided to check it out. The parking lot was clean, we were greeted warmly, and there was coffee. So far so good. We got the nightly rate but it was a bit pricey at $65 so we were about the leave and the clerk stopped us and asked what we had in mind to pay! I'd never negotiated pricing before so I just threw a number out there. $45. She said she could do $50, so we took it. The room she put us in was a one bed room with a small kitchenette. Not too spacey but it was very clean. We had a wonderful, comfortable night that night and definitely plan on visiting again! Also, because our monthly escapades are known well among our friends, anytime someone asks for a recommendation, we always say the Everspring Inn!", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver,BC", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3262382", "Content": "This was a Terrible place.
