The vallet parking is nice - our car was whisked away upon checkin and brought back to us when we checked out the next morning - no need to worry about parking downtown or theft or vandalism. The bellhop service was great - he unpacked our car, brought our cart up to our room, unloaded our luggage from the cart, hung up our coats, put our shoes in the closet, and showed us the tricks and treats of the room! There's a programmable safe in the closet, automatic window darkening shades at the press of a button, a door bell, and a snack bar & mini fridge (but everything is overpriced and the fridge is on sensors so if you even lift a $4 can of soda from the track, you pay for it!). The bathroom is huge with separate tub and shower, but the tub doesn't have jets. The lighting in the bathroom sucks though! I had to take a hand mirror to the window in the morning to get some daylight to put on my make-up. The dim, yellow light in the bathroom was disappointing. The bath amenitites are nice - good quality shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc. There is even a real hairdryer for your convenience - not one of those mini ones hooked to the wall - but a real one! There is also an iron and ironing board in the closet if you should need it. Oh - and the coffee and tea is nice in the room - in the maker you can either run hot water through it for the tea or use the pre-packaged coffee trays to brew a cup. The bed was not very comfortable. Neither my husband or I slept well. The pillows are those horrible overstuffed down filled ones that are either too high or you sink down to the mattress. Save your neck - bring your favorite pillow from home! We didn't have time to use the hot tub...and note, there is not a pool at this hotel. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel was nice for visiting with friends in the lounge area. We didn't eat there, just had drinks. There is a Starbuck's in the hotel too, so that's nice for breakfast! The hotel was very clean and we would stay here again. I only gave a \"very good\" rating because of the lack of pool, the horrible pillows and not very comfortable bed, the bad bathroom lighting, and the lack of jets in the bathtub.

The other option is the Olive 8 which was listed as a boutique hotel and I feared overly modern and cold d\u00c3\u00a9cor (not what I am looking for when traveling for work).

The staff was incredibly friendly (with one exception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my checkout front desk person was quite short with me and bordered on rude, but I was half asleep so some of my opinion may have been colored by that). I had access to the Grand Club (formerly the Regency Club) and the staff there was over-the-top friendly and helpful. I was checked in by Lily who was an exemplar of welcoming warm friendliness.

The check-in staff was very friendly and efficient and had me on my way up to my room in short order. Off-street parking is convenient, though a bit pricey, with a parking garage located right behind the hotel. The rooms, while not large, are very comfortable. Much of the space was taken up by the bathroom which had an enormous shower plus a separate tub and expansive counter and sink. It seemed luxurious until I tried out the towels, which appeared to be made for a middle tier fitness club rather than a top notch hotel. The room was very quiet; I didn't notice any noise from adjoining rooms or the hallway, although I didn't see many people on my floor so I'm sure that helped. There were some other very nice touches such as electrically controlled window shade to block out the downtown lights and a lighted closet for hanging clothes. The king bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows to choose from. Besides the disappointing towels, the thing which made this less than a perfect night's stay was the WiFi connection. I'm always amazed that Holiday Inn Express can provide me with rock-solid WiFi for free, but a place like the Hyatt will charge at least $10 per night for flaky internet access. I even splurged for the \"Premium\" WiFi at $15 per night, and found it to be painfully slow. I gave up trying to get work done from my room and switched over to using my phone for basic web access.

Used the Hyatt points, but looking at the price listed, it is very reasonable, especially for such a great location and amenities. Customer Service: I have been a member of Hyatt for years, and I must say, I have never been as impressed by the customer service as at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Normally, at more corporate hotel like this, you receive the more courteous type of customer service, more like \"I'm doing this because I have to, not because I want to\". But here, everyone is very friendly and seems generally happy to help. We were also greeted by our names, which hardly ever happens anymore in this type of hotel. In fact, after our stay, the Mr actually called the hotel to find out where they got their salmon served at the Grand Club was from and they actually contacted him back w/ the information. It was a simple gesture, but I have contacted other hotel to find information on something they served during our previous stay, and was ignored even though they're known for their excellent customer service. Room: We had a gorgeous view of the water from our room. The room itself is not too big, but not too small; very comfortable size for a hotel room. The bathroom however is not the typical Hyatt bathroom. It reminds me more of the Vegas hotels bathroom (think Bellagio, Wynn, etc). Loved the soak tub, and my request for bath salt was accommodated without any problems, although I am still confused as to why hotels w/ tubs don't provide bath salt/soap for this purpose without having to request it. You can't exactly use regular shower gel to take a bath. The bed is typical Hyatt bed, comfortable enough. However, the pillows are so flat we had to fluff them up by sleeping on two (three for me). I don't understand why hotels spend so much money on every other aspect of their hotels, except for the pillows. You spend most of your time on top of them, comfort is necessity! Location: you know what that say, location location location. Walking distance to pretty much everything. Granted Seattle is not that big and easily accessible, but this location is located in a perfect spot for tourists. You are literarily smacked in the middle of the shopping area when you walk out of the hotel, and just a short few blocks walk to Pike Place. It's only 1 or 2 block walk to the bus stop so hopping in and out of busses is not a problem at all. Fitness Center: I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the fitness center. Plenty of machines and selections. Minor incident which really wasn't the hotel's fault. Perhaps they should put up a big giant sign before the door to the hot tub area instead of the corner so everyone could see that proper attires are required to enter the area. Sure, it should be common knowledge that this area is coed, but apparently it is not common knowledge at all. We had the unpleasant incident w/ three women who let's just say not dressed for a coed area. It was uncomfortable for all, but especially for the Mr whose hot tubbing time was cut short w/ this incident. Grand Club: Okay, I've heard a lot of complaints about their Grand Club from another travel forum, so I wasn't expecting a lot. Sockeye salmon they served in the morning is the Mr's favorite (thus the calling the hotel for info on it). They don't serve hot food for breakfast, but honestly, I quite enjoy grabbing something quick here and having breakfast/lunch/brunch elsewhere later on. A lot of time, the breakfast served at the hotel isn't exactly the best quality anyway. The afternoon snack consists of hot appetizers, veggies and dips, and drinks. Not a lot of selections, but good enough for snacking purposes. Alcohol is extra, which we weren't aware of *not that it'd stop us from ordering, but it'd be nice if there's a sign to indicate that* (the last day, the magic sign was there; perhaps someone complained?). I must disclose that we had free access to the Grand Club because of my status. Not sure if I'd pay extra for it honestly.

Hotel offered a \"shopping package\" for 199. The rate included 75 in gift cards to local retailers, free valet parking and an in room movie....A great deal, considering it drops the rate for the hotel room to under 100 easily. We booked a King Room, but did the Hyatt upgrade option that is available when you book a room. Ended up getting the upgrade to the Grand club floors and to an Executive suite The upgrade was well worth it. Executive suite had a separate sitting room with TV and wet bar, and single bath, and through french doors that lead to the bedroom. Standard work station (that lacked AC plug in on desk), and a gigantic closet and bathroom. Bathroom had separate toilet area, huge shower and gigantic soaking tub. Great amenities to spoil yourself with. Loved the room and and push button darkening blinds. Was glad we upgraded to the grand club floors as it provided complimentary evening snacks and reasonably priced adult beverages (5 bucks), plus a great morning breakfast spread. The club is open all day with coffee, soda and water and the folks working in it are awesome. Did not use the health club but took a look. Great set up plus a nice whirl pool. Images on web site are accurate, keep in mind that there is not a pool at this property. Check in, check out and Valet were flawless. Great public area staff that were spot on and did a great job. The only downer on the trip is related to the work station in the bedroom. It did not have plug ins on top of the desk, so was forced to plug two I-phone chargers into the wall outlet under the desk. We left the chargers by mistake and didn't realize to later in the evening after we checked out. I called the hotel and asked if they had found them. Was told that house keeping did not report any found items from the room, but that security would take a look in the room as it was vacant that evening. NO luck as they said the room was clean. That leaves only a few options. House keeping threw them in the trash, House Keeping put them in their pocket, or the hotel does not have a good lost and found tracking system. What makes it even more of a bummer is that we tip well and did so for the house keeping staff as we always do. This is totally our fault for leaving the chargers in the room, but I was hopeful based off our great experience during our stay that they would be located. Don't let this sour your thoughts of staying here, as we will certainly consider coming back to this property. We have stayed at 8 downtown 4 star + properties in Seattle and this is one of the best, just wish they could have found our I phone chargers.....", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location if you're staying downtown.\u201d", "Author": "NicollFamily", "ReviewID": "UR121866633", "Content": "If you're staying downtown, location is excellent.

As you would expect from any Downtown hotel, this is oriented to business travellers. If you're looking for the romantic weekend getaway, however, there may be better options (Fairmont?). I gave it a 4 overall for service. Nice furnishings and updating are important, but really great hotels distinguish themselves with the calibre of their service, and that usually means the training of their employees. As a rule, on this point Hyatt is fine, but not great. And this hotel is no exception to that rule. One word of caution - downtown is a little edgy at night for my liking. The people we encountered while walking around looking for our restaurant at 9 pm did definitely make us a little unconfortable at times.

Hyatt calls this a luxury hotel and I agree. The hotel has a huge beautiful lobby that sets the tone of the place. I paid a little extra for a view room and Grand Club Lounge access and boy was it worth it. My room was very nice with a beautiful view of downtown, Pine Street and the water. I loved watching the ferries come and go. The Grand Club Lounge is easily one of the best I have ever seen. Very high end spread in the morning and evening with coffee, sodas and water all day long. The Hotel is right next to the convention center and short walking distance to tons of shopping, restaurants and the Pike Place Market. Everything in downtown is close and easy to get to. If you are going to stay in downtown don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to rent a car. Just get a taxi to and from the airport and save the hassle and cost of parking. Restaurant service is from the attached Ruth Chris. Good food but not cheap. There are tons of restaurants in every price range close by and all over downtown if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat there. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was modern and immaculate with a huge bathroom. My only small gripe is the single power outlet at the desk. In order to plug my laptop and phone charger in I had to unplug the desk lamp. You pay a little more for this place but I feel you get what you paid for. I will definitely come back to this hotel. Tips: Ask for a high floor with a view. The Roosevelt hotel is right next to the Hyatt and could block a water view if you are on a lower floor. Make sure you are above it. The Grand Club Lounge is well worth the extra money. Terrific high end spread in the morning and evening with very reasonably priced wine & liquor during happy hour. It has great views and is a very comfortable place to hang out. I have seen many lounges and this was easily one of the best. Bring a power strip if you plan to work at the desk.

It cost $30 for 24hrs, we paid $38 as we stayed 25hours. I would assume valet is the same price? Helpful bellboy took our luggage to the room, although a tad-unprofessional with his jokes, was very friendly. Love the \"electronic\" black-out blinds. The room we had on the 20th floor was gorgeous.... the decor was very modern and the room had alot of wood in it. The bathroom was HUGE, separate shower and tub, even toothpaste was included, nice bonus. Only one robe though, thought that was kinda of weird for a room for two people. There was an umbrella to use in the room, along with a pricey (of course!) censored mini-bar. Electronic \"do not disturb\" button. The hotel doesn't have a pool,but apparently has a hot tub and sauna. There is a Starbucks, store/deli, and Sushi restaurant on site. Free wifi only at Starbucks, otherwise it's $10 up to $15 a day in your room. The location is great! Walking distance to a great sports pub \"Fox News Sports Bar\" -- all the refs from the Washington Huskies game were there when we there. Close to a nightclub called Pink -- top 40. Huge 2-story American Eagle just down the block and a couple movie theatres within 2 blocks. And of course not too far from the Pier, about 15 min walk or so. We caught the bus from 3rd and Pine to Century Link stadium where the Seahawks played. It was free (???) not sure why. Free both ways! Otherwise it should have been $2.25.

I loved being able to open the little window and get some fresh air into the room. The room was large, had a chair and ottoman as well as desk and chair and the large bathroom was spectacular! Loved the bath and giant glass shower (no clingly wet shower curtain here!). Water pressure in the shower was great, the bath was relaxing and a decent size. I did find that the tv while a newer flatscreen, for some reason some of the channels were very poor quality in terms of pixilating and being fuzzy (CW and the channels below), while others were in HD, and I found the number of channels very limited, considering the wide vairety offered at other hotels. Also having to pay the $9.95 daily internet fee (14.95 for faster internet, but to be honest I didn't notice a difference surfing the internet/uploading photos etc) was per device which was frustrating! Other hotels charge per room, not per device. Its annoying having to pay for internet in this day and age, especially such an amount per day, but the per device is just over the top. Customer service was impecable, in particular to the staff member that checked me in, Jocelyn at reception when I had a problem with my key, needed a fridge for my room and had a message to pick up, and Eric the bellhop. All of them provided service with a smile, that seemed genuine and not forced. It made for an enjoyable and memorable stay. The hotel is well located in downtown Seattle.

The bed was made but all the decor pillows were left exactly where we deposited them the night before. Although the room was clearly cleaned, it was not \"made up\". Part of the hotel experience, in my opinion, is coming in to a freshly made up room after a day of sightseeing. That didn't happen. I also didn't say anything mainly because we were rushing from place to place and it just wasn't top of mind. Now...what can Hyatt corporate do? Stop nickle and diming people who are paying top dollar to be in your luxury hotel. Extra charges included WiFi (come on, Hyatt, get with the times!), a DVD player for the room and parking.

I travel with clorox wipes and cleaned behind housekeeping. The staff in the club lounge was quite friendly and attentive. The front desk staff was friendly, however concierge was not very helpful in providing information regarding dining options in the area ( for nice dining the hotel only offers Ruth Chris Steakhouse). The concierge representative either did not know of the many restuarants nearby or did not want to be bothered in telling us about them. There is a mall across from the hotel with several dining options also a Cheese Cake Factory is on the corner of the hotel.

I called the desk and the guy I spoke to repeated same thing that no one reported it. I stated that I am a person who has good technical knowledge of computers and internet and would like to speak to someone who can help. they gave me a number to call, the cord on the desk had the name Guest_Tek, so when the tech answered the phone I inquired if this is guest Tek, he replied no we are a different company.

The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt. The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer & drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view. The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk; just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait. They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a high-end hotel; and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and each gave us four of each.)

I didn't know exactly what this was when I requested it online, but it turned out that these rooms are typically on the higher floors (ours was on the 20th) away from ice machines, elevators, and other \"noisemakers\". Our room was very quiet! Another feature that I think is underrated on their website is the bathrooms. We stayed in the standard king room, and the bathroom was wonderful. Typically you have to book a higher grade room to get a 4-piece bath. They have Kohler fixtures, marble tile, and adjustable lighting. Everything you want for a relaxing bath. The view from our room was spectacular, especially at 7 this morning as the snow came down over the city.

It was a choice between the Grand Hyatt and the Hyatt Olive 8 across the street. We decided on the Grand Hyatt due to a great room rate, we were familiar with the property and while the room at the Olive would have been larger, it just seemed a bit cold and stark compared with the Hyatt. Check in went smoothly and we were pleased with our room overlooking Pine Street. Our double bed room was comfortable and clean, I still get a kick out of the movable window shades there. The bath was large and roomy with a tub and separate shower stall. Overall we received very efficient service from the staff there. My interactions with the front desk, concierge and bellman were professional and courteous. The only glitch was with housekeeping. Usually Grand Hyatt service is extremely prompt, but this time there were a couple of minor issues that really surprised us on this visit. Upon arrival in the late afternoon we noticed only two sets of towels for our family. We called down and requested extra towels and drinking glasses. After a couple of hours we called again, but never received them that evening so had to share towels and glasses. The next morning we asked the cleaning staff to put them out for us which they did. The other issue was our ice bucket was not emptied and our used drinking glasses were still there on the desk after our room was serviced. Nothing to ruin our stay, but very noticeable and hopefully not something that happens regularly. This is a great property in a very convenient location which is the reason we stayed here. Pike Place Market is an easy walk and there are many stores, several malls and lots of restaurants in the immediate area. Free bus service is available at the Westlake station to get down to Qwest Field and Safeco Stadium which we used to see the Seahawks game. We will definitely consider the Grand Hyatt again when visiting Seattle.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geyserville, California", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel value we've had in years\u201d", "Author": "MikeM57", "ReviewID": "UR85043467", "Content": "What a wonderful stay!

The lights are dimmable over the tub which was great to relax in after long days of sightseeing. The beds were okay for me. I was able to sleep, but not as well as I would like to on vacation. There was a full closet, bathrobes, and ample dresser space. A very roomy room. Also the electric shades were a cool touch. I found the staff of the Grand Hyatt Seattle to be friendly and obliging.

Shopping is nearby and so is the monorail to the Seattle Center where they have the Space Needle, the Experience Music Project, and Science Fiction Museum. Good restaurants are also in walking distance and so is the Columbia Tower observation deck and Seattle Library.

The check-in was smooth and quick and the room was adequate for its price range. The standard marble bathroom, separate tub (with a foot wash) and shower, is larger than a Bellagio standard bathroom. The maid service was adequate, always enough towels, but no evening bed fold and chocolate. The hotel has a Starbucks, a convenience.

The business center computer required a credit card to activate it. One of these things would be fine, but the combination of all of them just feels... Miserly.

I was sitting in the bathroom reading my book (where else could I go while they were napping? LOL) and I could seriously hear the person next door going to the restroom. Yikes! Because I could hear all these noises, I knew that our neighbors would be able to hear our kids...that's the part that stressed me out the most...trying to keep them quiet so they didn't bother anyone else. We stuffed some towels in the crack under the door to keep some of the noise out, but it didn't work too well. We thought ahead to bring our own fan for some white noise, but even this didn't help much. I guess another issue would be that we didn't have a fridge or a microwave that we could use for our little guy's milk. I had to go down to Starbucks each time and buy some heated milk. $2 each time. Spendy! If you aren't traveling with small kids, these issues will mean nothing to you because most adults don't need naps at 3 pm nor have to worry about keeping beverages warm or cold. Would we stay there again.? If it's just hubby and I...in a heart beat. If we need a place to stay when we are traveling with our kids....ohhhhh....I don't know.

The best in Seattle. The bathrooms are incrdible. Marble, granite, soaking tubs, large seperate showers, plush robes, wonderful lighting. The space is simply amazing, inviting, plush, elegant. The entry doors are the most beautiful wood ... & the rooms actually have doorbells. I had to chuckle w/ that amenity. The beds are quite comfortable, the linens fine, the draperies are electric. So you can open the drapes in the morning to see the sunrise without leaving your bed (I chuckled at that one, too!). Large picture windows & some rooms have spectacular views over the sound.

During this stay we were treated like outcasts. Unfortunately, I was unable to check in with my boyfriend early in the evening but at that time he was immediately downgraded from an executive level suite. During the time there we had a couple of friends with him coming over before dinner, to quietly enjoy the sauna. We were extremely polite and never disruptive. My boyfriend and I returned to the hotel later that evening and had a terrific time. The room was nice and the bathroom was beautiful, as people in our mid 20's we don't often have the opportunity to enjoy such lovely accommodations. However we were still disappointed about our downgrade, as it was a charitable donation of most likely more than the room we ended up staying in is actually worth. The part of our stay that made us the most uncomfortable was when the valet staff went to pick up my boyfriend's truck. He is a hard working landscaper and with a messy work truck he depends on to get around. I understand it isn't an audi or a mercedes, either way it is his car and we wanted to get home. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes and watching about 15 or so other cars come in and leave with guests, we were finally attended to. At that time the staff didn't even know what had happened to his key. Fortunately, one gentleman was very courteous and tried to hunt it down. When the truck finally arrived, a young guy pulled it up to the side of the street, where I would have to get into the truck in traffic. He didn't speak a word to us, and my boyfriend who is probably one of the most generous tippers gave him nothing. My point for writing all of this is not to receive compensation or anything, but just to make a point. I have worked in the hospitality industry off and on in order to get myself through college and survive at times for about 10 years. I understand that management at upscale facilities wants to cater to those with money, after all they are the ones usually spending the most, but I also know that a lot of the most generous, kind and hard working individuals make this city a place that people want to visit. I was approached by a manager one time to treat a customer extremely well because he was worth $3B. At that time I turned to him and said I will treat him just like I treat everyone else who walks through this door, with respect and kindness and I did. As a matter of fact they were one of my most rude people I had ever served and ended up spending way less than the awkward guy in the corner with a T-shirt on who tipped me almost 40%. It makes no difference what you look like or what car you drive, we are all hard working, educated people just trying to make something of ourselves. In the future unless clients are rude to you, please don't be rude to them because in reality you know nothing about them. Kindness and hospitality go a long way, and in the end will make your business much more profitable.

Next I moved to the registration desk and was helped by Katie. She was AWESOME, friendly, efficient and offered up some good local spots for dinner. Just what you want when you check in. Next, I headed up to the Regency Club to get some water and I met Alex. Great young kid who went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and help with directions and traffic to the airport. I had a note from Mark Stiebeling, the GM, and I called him to let him know how great the staff was and to thank him for the room I am in. He was friendly and I enjoyed our chat. I then headed to the 4th floor gym. It is excellent, clean/modern look, enough space with cardio, weight machines, and free weights. I always like a bench press, but that was the only thing missing. I also used Louise the concierge to book a reservation for dinner and she was very friendly and efficient. Excellent service!! Only thing that was below expectation was the maid service on Friday....I left early in the morning and when I returned at 3 pm the room was just as I left it....no maid service. I called down and they came in and emptied the trash and delivered fresh towels.

The concierge at this hotel is fantastic. especially Scott. His directions and recommendations for food were on point each time we spoke. Check out was smooth and easy on the first day. When we returned to the hotel after the cruise, we encounted the same type of fabulous service we received the first time we were there. We were upgraded to a room with a wonderful view on the 24th floor. And the entire staff was courteious and gracious. The hotel is located within walking distance of great high end shops and boutiques. It is also within walking distance of Pikes Market.

The room was large and extrordinarily clean. The bathroom had a large shower, and an inviting bathtub, that looked like new. The in-room coffee was the best \"hotel room\" coffee I have had in any hotel. And if you don't like the in-room coffee, a Starbucks is located next to the lobby. The bed and pillows were comfortable, but not as nice as the Marriott. The location can't be beat. It is next to the Convention Center, and a short walk to Pike Place and the Waterfront. Restaurants and shopping are near, including Nordstrom's and Nordstrom's Rack, Macy's, Barnes & Noble, and Coldwater Creek. A movie theater is across the street. My favorite places to go include \"Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe\" at the Waterfront; the Underground Tour; and of course, Pike Place, where the original Starbuck's is located. If this is your first time to Seattle, I recommend the 3 hour city tour. It is a great overview of the city, and they take you to beautiful places for photos. The downside of the hotel, for me, was a stark and unappealing lobby, no gift shop for forgotten essentials, and no restaurant or bar area (however,Ruth's Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel.Too pricy for me.) So bundling up and going out in the freezing rain to get a cola or a snack was inconvenient. If you stay at this hotel, be prepared with your own snacks.

We arrived at our room and were very pleased with the decor and the cleanliness. The bathroom is huge! There is plenty of room to spread out all of your toiletries on the counter. The shower has enough room for two! I called down to request more hangers, and in fewer than 5 minutes they were delivered. 30 seconds after the delivery our phone rang to inquire as to whether the hangers were \"satisfactory for us\". I couldn't believe how attentive the service was. The location is great, as it is one block from the convention center, near great shopping (Barney's, Tiffany's, etc.), and just a few blocks from the Pike's Place Market. It is about a 10 min. walk to Belltown, which is where a lot of great restaurants and bars are located. I recommend the Dahlia Lounge! It is also a few blocks to catch the monorail ($2 one-way) to go to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project, etc.). I had colleagues staying at other hotels in the area that didn't seem nearly as nice as the Grand Hyatt. The only difficulty is getting from the airport to the hotel/downtown. It is about a $40 cab ride one-way. There is an $11 shuttle that comes every half hour. It is convenient, but takes a bit more time than a cab. There is a Ruth's Chris steakhouse in the hotel that we didn't try. The hotel also has kiosks in the lobby so that you can check in for your flight and print your boarding pass. We ordered fish from the Pike's Place Fish Market to take home. The fish company delivered it to the hotel and the hotel held it in the fridge until we were ready to take it.

Not Grand.\u201d", "Author": "RonDunn", "ReviewID": "UR24518350", "Content": "Only the staff saved this hotel from a \"terrible\" rating. At every contact they were friendly, efficient, and went out of their way to be helpful. So what went wrong? NOISE. Loud, banging, wall-shaking, sleep-destroying NOISE. Every room in this hotel has a gap under the door of at least 1cm of clear air, some much greater. That means every noise outside your room has a perfect method of entry. And every door in this hotel is very heavy, and automatically shut by a very strong door closer. Not just shut, but SLAMMED with a click-BANG-CLUNK which echoes around your room every time someone within six doors of you decides to go in or out. If you have the misfortune to get a room in a corner you have two doors immediately adjacent to your own, and your walls will shake when those doors close. What makes it worse is the oddest air conditioning design I've seen in a hotel room. The gap under the door supports air flow-through to an extraction vent on the far side of the room. It actually accelerates the flow of noise into the room. On the subject of air conditioning, it can't have the fan set to a constant white noise, it comes on and off at its own will. The next horror comes when you open the bar fridge. There is a special place in business traveller hell which is specially reserved for the person that invented the computerised bar fridge that automatically charges you when you move an item, and won't let you place your own items in that fridge. And that place is surrounded by mini torture chambers for any hotel GM cheap and nasty enough to put those instruments of the devil in any hotel pretending to be \"Grand\". Let's try to be positive for a moment. The room was nicely furnished. Comfortable bed and sitting chair, good sized desk, but a little spoiled by a \"designer\" chair making the wrong ratio between desk and buttocks. When will hotels learn? Save money and make happy business customers by getting rid of your fancy desk chairs and giving us a nice, simple, adjustable office chair! The television was a large flat screen with a good range of channels. There was an innovative drip-filter coffee machine of a type I've not seen before, but which worked very well to help me wake up each morning. The bathroom was a great size and everything worked well. But here we go again with the \"not Grand\" theme of this review. This hotel has the most hectoring anti-laundry policy I can remember. Not content with the typical, hypocritical \"Save the environment, re-use your towels\" we usually get, they extend it to making you telephone Housekeeping and actually ASK for your bed linen to be changed! And you only find this out if you notice a small card in the bathroom. No card to leave, you have to CALL and wait for them to answer, then beg for a little luxury in your life. I was there for 8 days, staying by myself, and I don't THINK the linen was automatically changed once in that time. Even if changed, the linen is too small for the size of the mattress, which means it doesn't tuck in on all sides, and you wake up in a crumpled, lumpy mess instead of a smooth sheeted bed. Let's move to the hotel facilities. A rhetorical question: how many \"Grand\" hotels don't have a buffet breakfast? This was the first in which I've stayed where only a limited a-la-carte breakfast was available to guests, served in the attached restaurant. As someone described in a recent review, this area doubles as the hotel bar, and is more like a cafeteria. Eminently forgettable. The further we move away from the core of the hotel, the poorer the facilities become. There used to be a gift shop. Empty. There used to be another restaurant. Abandoned. In fact, the general exterior of the hotel makes me wonder if it is beginning to suffer from an economic downturn in the area. The property needs to let those spaces to vibrant businesses to improve the ambience of the hotel! You know, I was trying to think of something good to say to wrap up the review, but I can't. Apart from the GREAT staff, already mentioned, there is nothing I saw in this hotel to justify its position in the Tripadvisor ratings. The next time I'm in Seattle I'll definitely stay elsewhere. There's a lot of work to be done to justify the name of this hotel.", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

Since it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rated by TripAdvisor Contributors I decided to give it a go. I have to say I was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from what I was expecting for a Grand Hyatt (their flagship property). By no means is this a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, it really just depends on your likes and dislikes. Here is a summary of my experience and my opinion on this property: Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I give it a 50/50. Yes, you are semi-in the heart of downtown Seattle (but on the edge, close to the freeway). You are near shopping, businesses and the convention center BUT you are also close to the freeway so many of the rooms have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freeway view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My room/suite actually had a combo-freeway/water view (peek-a-boo on the water side)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I honestly expected more water and less freeway for what I was paying. Now, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear the freeway too much but you do get to look at it depending on where your room is. For a comparable price, there are several hotels in the area with much better views that are much closer to the water and sites. Charm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There is not much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to this hotel but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that is the objective either. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly corporate with clean lines but so many properties in downtown Seattle have special touches like wine tasting in the lobby, fireplaces in room, etc. where they really make it feel special (think the Monaco, or Mayflower or Vintage Park, etc.). Food - Well yes there is a Ruth Chris on property but while that is a nice high end place, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chain. Give me something with true \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd personality. Seattle is such a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foodie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd town, I can go to Ruth Chris in any major city in the U.S. Rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The best part is the bathroom in my opinion hand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down. Spacious, modern, clean, etc. Sure that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great, but how much are you really in there? The bedrooms while fairly standard for Hyatt and most the chains these days (comfortable beds, flatscreens, etc.) the furniture was a little worn. Some of my furniture had lots of nicks and scrapes. Additionally the \"attractive leather\" chair at the desk was not adjustable nor that comfortbale so I could not really utilize the desk in comfort as I could with an ergonomic chair many hotels provide these days. The bedroom portion of the room itself reminded me a bit of the size you find in NYC at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or something similar. There is not much area between the bed and wall/dressers so if two of you are trying to pass to get to the door or bath at the same time, it will be tight. Realistically that is not untypical for an urban hotel but in many of the Seattle downtown properties, they appear to be a bit more generous in the size of the bedroom itself (in this case, a decent amount of square footage goes to the bathroom). Perhaps it was just the layout or usage of the square footage but I was not that excited about it. Gym \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Well I am always fairly happy with the Hyatt facilities for their gym and one of the reasons I come back. Maintaining a workout on the road is important to me and they are always well equipped, clean and spacious and are more like a real \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gym\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than just a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fitness room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that many properties offer.

However we experienced a number of problems this time which detracted from their previous service. We made a booking for a room with 2 beds, one for us and one for our teenager. They turned out to be very small double beds, (almost incapable of holding two grown adults), not queens which are the usual size in most upscale hotels of this category. Unfortunately they were also very uncomfortable which is strange as we have found Hyatt beds so comfortable previously we even considered buying one! Secondly our room had a connecting door to the next room. There was a lock for safety, unfortunately it didn't stop any noise which meant that we could hear every conversation, cough and pin drop next door. Thirdly when we tried to fill the bath the plug would not work and the bath drained quicker than it was filling. Unfortunately we only found this out at 11pm on our first night. After reporting it next morning it was mended before 6pm. It meant that we only had a chance to use the bath on one of our two nights stay, which was a bit of a let down. Fourthly, when we tried to arrange a later checkout they could not accommodate us. Odd as we didn't have a problem the previous time we stayed, even though we booked the room on points on both occasions. Lastly, when we went down to catch a taxi to the airport there was no porter to be seen anywhere. We were jumped on by two taxi drivers parked in the loop who ended up heatedly arguing over us in the middle of the Grand Hyatt driveway/lobby door area. Not exactly the behavior expected in a hotel of this class. A porter should be there at all times to organise transport, baggage, etc and to assist guests of the hotel We ended up walking onto the street to hail another taxi to avoid the argument.

The 4th was ready after we returned from a late lunch. Although I requested all rooms to be on one floor, they weren't able to accomodate that. However we were only one or two floors away from each other so it wasn't a problem. Room : the corner suites are nice, a little on the smaller side though. But we did like having a small \"sitting room\" with couch/chair and TV area. It fit about 3-4 people comfortably. A long hallway connected it to the bedroom (king bed only). Our bathroom was wonderful. We used both the shower and bath. What a great way to end a day of walking, by taking a hot bath! When we checked in, we were assured there was going to be a crib in our room, however when we opened the door, there was a rollaway. I called the front desk and explained the situation and within minutes, someone brought a crib (pack'n'play type) and took away the rollaway. Grand Hyatt provides a blanket and small travel pack with the crib (shampoo, diaper rash cream, etc). That was a nice touch. We had two big closets. They also provide an umbrella (which is hanging in the closet) and robes for guests to use during their stay. The electronic shades are nice and the \"do not disturb\" sign lights up instead of the typical door hanger. Housekeeping : was great. we asked for extra towels and soaps which we received promptly. Area : is good. Two blocks from Nordstroms, 3 blocks from the shopping center & monorail (to the Needle), 4 blocks to Macy's and about 7 blocks to Pikes Market. I loved that everything was relatively flat (except the hill down to the Market). We walked almost everywhere since we didn't rent a car. We also used their free bus system to International District and Pioneer Square. Bus \"depot\" can be found underneath Nordstroms. You will pass a lot of homeless people though, but they never bothered us. Restaurants : We ate at Ruth Chris right in the lobby. Although pricey, it was delicious. We also ate at Pikes Market Chowder (at the Market and at the top of the shopping center kitty korner to the hotel). Shiro's Japanese food on 2nd Ave was very good. Their sushi is, of course, fresh. Reservations is recommended. We also went across the street to Dragonfish (lobby of the hotel across Pine St). It's an PanPacific restaurant and we enjoyed that too. Crab Pot along the waterfront was recommended by a local so we went there for lunch. Enjoyed the food there also. Hotel : Starbucks and Ruth Chris in lobby along with a sundry store. There are 2 computers in the lobby which guests are able to use for free to print out their boarding passes. Porters are very friendly and one of them even gave my son a beach ball!

He brought the 3 bags to him while I was at the Concierge and it looked as if the bags were just dropped down in a reckless manner. Also, the porter didn't offer to help us with our bags to the cab and just went back to 'stand at attention'. The experience only affirms my belief that it's best to always handle your own bags at all times. 2) There were two staff members 'standing at attention' in the lobby, but NOT opening doors or offering to help you with your bags in a gracious way.

We chose this hotel based upon location for shopping and trip advisor reviews for a luxury weekend without the kids. Last time to Seattle, we stayed at The Waterfront Marriott for 2 nights before an Alaskan cruise, and I must say we both liked the Marriott overall much better than the Hyatt. We had a corner suite at The Hyatt and the layout was really weird. There is a small entryway leading into the living room. The living room had the most uncomfortable sofa, a matching chair,(both scratched and worn) mini bar and a desk and chair. One wall was floor to ceiling windows and one small panel the size of a large mailbox at floor level was the only opening window in the whole suite! And this was a smoking suite!!!! There was a very narrow hallway with closets on the left where the windows would be and the bathroom off to the right. The problem with the clostes is that if you have one of the closet doors open, the other person in the room cannot pass to go back and forth between the living room, bathroom or bedroom without closing all the closet doors. This is a very bad design flaw and we would never book a corner suite here for this reason again.The bathroom was large, clean and very nice. Separate shower, tub and lots of marble. It was the only part of the suite which lived up to The Grand Hyatt reputation. The bedroom was small (comfortable king bed, 2 nightstands, 1 chair and a dresser with a tv on top) and had 2 walls of floor to ceiling windows. Unfortunately you had to close the curtains completely if you wanted privacy as there was a new building going up across the street and the crews could and would look right in. On a postive note, the corner bedroom was incredibly quiet. Ruth Cris is their hotel restaurant and even though you can charge it to your room, you do NOT accrue Gold Passport points for dining there. Unfortunately my husband and I lost each other in Nordstrom and upon returning to the Hyatt, the front desk would not give me a key to our suite. Apparently our reservation was under his name and even though it was for a party of 2 and I had my ID AND the credit card which was the same one that they had taken an imprint of from me at check in, they still would not let me in until he arrived. I was a bit miffed to say the least. If you stay here, make sure the front desk has each persons name on the reservation in case you get locked out.

I asked for an early check in and we arrived at 3 only to find out our room wasn't ready. So....we used the valet and decided to walk around town.

And they were very happy to oblige and we ended up in a great room with a king bed. The view from the room was great - although there was a lot of construction going on. The bathroom was immaculate and I loved the turn down service every night (including a bucket of ice AND chocolates on the pillow!!) We loved the location of The Hyatt - we parked the car and walked everywhere. It was so close to anything you'd want to see - Pike's Market, shopping, The Underground, the waterfront and ferry's, etc. It was also close to a lot of great restaurants. The concierge recommended Wild Ginger to us (a Pan-Asian restaurant). It was FABULOUS! We absolutely loved it - but get reservations ahead of time or you may be waiting for awhile. There is also a cheesecake factory around the block, which we liked because it was something familiar for that first day. Ruth's Steakhouse is attached to the hotel and we ordered from their our last night and brougt to our room. We weren't very hungry but didn't want to be starving at midnight, so we ordered their lobster bisque and some BBQ shrimp. I'm sorry to say I was severely disappointed. How hard is it to make those things? I didn't enjoy them at all! I wish we had just dragged ourselves out of our room to go to a restaurant, but we were exhausted from our day of walking around. The biggest complaint I had was the cost of parking. It was absolutely ridiculous. Although, I'm assuming most downtown hotels would be about the same. We pre-paid for the hotel before we left, so we weren't expecting much of a bill. We did get Wild Hogs on demand in the room ($14.99 for a movie?!?), but other than that the only thing on our bill was parking and the cost came out over $100 for 3 nights! We were shocked. I believe it was $31 plus several taxes per night to park. The parking is really the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5.

As such, I was looking so very forward to attending the Humane Education Workshop in Vancouver, BC on October 19-20. Although I intended to attend the workshop to enhance my proficiency as a university professor, I have no shame in admitting that I relished the idea of a few precious days all to myself. My day started on a bad note when I was bumped from my flight in Podunk, Washington. Without any other feasible flight option, I found myself facing a 7 to 8 hour drive to Vancouver. I did not know it at the time, but my journey would include an emergency tire purchase in Ellensburg and a trip over Snoqualmie Pass during a Severe Storm Warning. I stopped in North Bend to rest after conquering the pass, and decided to make hotel reservations in Seattle for the night to rest my weary bones. I had stayed at the Grand Hyatt once before and LOVED it, so I decided to indulge myself and made reservations. I arrived at the Seattle Grand Hyatt shortly after 8pm, checked in without incident, settled myself into my room and then happily made my way to the nearby Cheesecake Factory for Avocado Eggrolls and decadent cheesecake. I had not eaten anything that day so to simply state that I enjoyed my dinner would be an enormous misrepresentation of my experience! (In fact, even with what was to come, having eaten that one extraordinary meal...made it all worthwhile!!) I practically skipped back to my room, looking forward to a relaxing bath and a good night's sleep. Alas, my key didn't work, so I made my way to the lobby to get another. When I arrived at the front desk at approximately 11pm, I was asked if I had another form of payment, as my card was not accepting the room charge. I did not have another form of payment. I do not use credit cards (I use only my Visa debit card), I don't use checks (who takes out-of-town checks anymore??) and never carry cash, except for the occasional $20. I immediately knew what was wrong. I use a small credit union and, for whatever reason, (I can only assume it is an anti-theft/safety measure) when my card is used outside my home area, a \"safety hold\" kicks in and the card declines further debits. I can only resolve the issue by calling my credit union (which operates 8-5pm on weekdays). They immediately remove the hold and make note in their system that I have traveled outside my home area. (I only know this because I traveled to Nelson, BC and Chicago, Illinois over the summer and both times had to call my credit union because of the afore mentioned \"safety hold.\" Fortunately, The W in Chicago was much more understanding of my circumstances than the Grand Hyatt ended up being.) I offered to call my husband to give them his credit card number to act as a guarantor until morning, but was required to have him fax his permission. We don't have a fax machine at our house and I absolutely could not ask my husband to wake my three sleeping children at 11pm to go hunting for a fax machine. I offered collateral (I have a very lovely MacBook that I can't live without and would have served as a SUBSTANTIAL motivator for me to pay my hotel bill!! I also have a shiny little Pontiac Vibe, which was already in their possession!!) I even went so far as to pull up my banking account online, showing the manager my account balance (which was approximately $1739). After all of my pleading, I was escorted by security at 11:30pm to collect my things from the room and was tossed out on my ear. Faced with no other option, I got in my car and drove back home, through the same weather conditions I had faced earlier. (I have BLISTERS on three of my fingers from gripping the steering wheel so firmly while battling the severe gusts of wind...it was THAT bad.) Having endured my gripping tale, you might be wondering about the purpose of my email, aside from my seemingly obvious penchant for whining. My purpose is to ask a simple question. Is there no room for decency or compassion within the Hyatt corporate structure? Seriously. EVERY SINGLE SIGN suggested that I was a trustworthy person. I had really good evidence to support my claims. Yet, given the opportunity to be a shining example of customer service, your hotel staff chose instead to toss me out on my ear at 11:30pm. Shame on you, Hyatt. Any corporation that would require their employees to stand belligerent, unsympathetic and utterly opposed to one simple and ordinary act of human kindness, does not deserve my patronage. This, my unbelievably discourteous treatment at the hands of your little corporate minions, I shall shout from the rooftops.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have been better\u201d", "Author": "AustinWorldTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR10435154", "Content": "Stayed first week of Oct. in an Emerald Suite.

Just to let you know, we had a choice this year for vacation spots between Chicago and Seattle. This year we chose Chicago since we were coming here for the wedding. While Chicago was fun, our stay at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle made Seattle a much more pleasant stay and us envying that we didn't vacation here. Getting to the Hyatt is easy, just by a ticket on the Grey line bus. Bus ticket and terminal is at the end of the airport dear door 00. It was a long walk for use but the trip bus ride was easy and convienent. The Grand Hyatt's location is great. Its 4-5 blocks to Pike's Market, 3 blocks to the Monorail. Our room did not have a direct view of the water but you could still see the water if you looked out the window and to the left a bit. We were only there for a couple of nights, but shopping was close at hand and the SciFi museum was fun. The Experience Music Project was a bit of a let down but came free with the SciFi museum ticket. We didn't go in the space needle. $16 per person to ride an elevator? No thanks. The monorail was cheap at $2 each way ($4 round trip). Pike's market was lively and colorful with the food and flower venders. Wished we stayed another night or two to visit Pioneer square and some other attractions. If you forget anything, the hotel's lobby store is well equiped but then again great shopping venues are only a block or two away. For food, I'd suggest going to Ruth's for breakfast. It was fairly hearty and tasted good. You should also try Cafe Campagne down the road near Pike's market. the food is country french and excellent. The road is also good for picture taking (big public market sign easily viewable) and is a straight shot from the hotel (exit left from the hotel's main entrance). The rooms were fairly spacious. My only sore point is the drawer space for clothes. There were four small drawers available. While usable they were still a bit small. This however was not as bad a situation as could be given that the closet was fairly large with plenty of hangers and a cubical style shelf for storing clothing. Basically, you have enough space for two people to store clothing for about a week. The bathroom was large and well accomodated. Marble flooring and nice counter top space allowed for me and my fiance to spread our toilettries out. The room came with both shower and bath and the bath filled quickly and easily. A standard coffee maker was avaiable but why would anyone bother with hotel in room coffee is beside me since Starbucks is downstairs and thier restaurant is fairly upscale. The television is a stand 29\" and kind of low end for a hotel but then again, no one really comes to a hotel just to watch TV. Standard minifridge and bar avaiable but not used. I kind of wonder why hotels keep providing these things since I haven't known anyone who would use them. Net connection runs from $7-$10 a day depending on connectivity and options. Wireless is through T-Mobile but they do have wired connections. Decor was kind of Modern Italian and the picts of the room should give you a good idea.

Should have kept my reservations at the Westin or probably should have booked at the Marriott. We took the shuttle which we learned about via of the Hyatt website. We were put out at the 6th Street entrance. There was no one there at that entrance to help with baggage. We had 4 suitcases & first had to lug up stairs to the lobby. Once in the lobby, which was not impressive, we were not greeted by anyone. We lugged our bags to a cart that was at the check in deck. No problem with the check in. When the lady asked if we needed help with our luggage, we said that we had lugged it this far & had put it on the cart & thus we could get it to the room. She replied by saying that we could not use the cart & that the bell boy would have to push it. We were up high & had a good view of the Sound & the Lake but the AT&T building was in the way. When I looked in our bathroom, I noticed that it did not have a separte shower. I called the front desk to ask what happened. I told her that my main reason for changing was due to the bath area reviews. At first she did not know what I was talking about & then she said that they did have a couple of rooms that did not have a separate shower. I asked for another room & she said that they were booked up unless I wanted to upgrade. I told her no & that we would just keep the room. We proceeded to unpack. Shortly later, some lady knocked at the door & inquired as to our check in. I told her what had happened & she said that she would see what she could do. Just before we left our room, she called back to see if we wanted to move & we said no because we had already unpacked. Probably should have based on future problems. Went downstairs to the concierge, Eric. He was on the phone, not business purpose. He apparently did not appreciate us bothering him & thus he was very short with us & was no help. In fact, one of the waiters in the bar was more helpful. The bath area was very, very disappointing. The first night, we could not get but luke warm water. Only one time during our stay, did we even have to turn the cold water on. The tub was nice & big but it had some space at the back & front. This was a problem for the shower. The shower curtain did not cover the whole tub & thus water would run out on the floor. The only way for the shower not to make a mess was to take it off the holder & hold it close to the tub. Have you ever had to take a shower that the water went from would go back & forth from kind of hot to luke warm & the pressure would go back & forth? If not, stay at the Hyatt. If this is the #1 rated hotel in Seattle, then I hate to see the others. Maybe, trip advisor needs to revisit as to how they rate the hotels.

Great views and polite service. Slightly worn around the edges and in need of a few upgrades (flat screen TVs in room). Amazing work out facilities. The place to go on business but too big for special occasions requiring a \"personal touch.\" Just spent my 30th birthday in my hometown, Seattle, but decided to make it special with a stay in the Grand Hyatt. I checked in around 4 pm and was immediately greeted by a bellhop asking if he could check my bag. Not sure why he was asking the question, I replied, \"no thanks, I'm checking in.\" Not a good start. After checking in, I went up to my room. We had booked an Emerald Suite (832 square feet, floors 26 - 30) and requested a quiet suite on a high floor and on a corner. I walked into the room on the 28th floor, closed the door and was about to settle into a chair and enjoy the views when I heard the thud of an ice maker, foot traffic, and a lot of thoat clearing. Stepping outside I found the ice machine across from the room and a \"hospitality suite\" hosting a Veterans Association. I went downstairs and Lara was able to move me up a floor...wonderfully quiet! The room itself (2922) is on a corner and offers spectacular views of Seattle: Queen Anne, EMP, Space Needle, core downtown, Pike Place, and the water! The furnishing were tasteful and the bed fairly comfortable (not as nice as a Westin \"Heavenly Bed\" but still wonderful). The bathroom was spectacular with a soaking tub, \"waterfall\" faucet, and seperate shower. The only distraction to the room was the visible wear and tear such as the dinged up and scratched furniture and the scuffs and dents in the walls. Additionally, the small old fashioned TVs seemed out of place though I have heard they will soon upgrade to flatscreens. The gym is incredible with a set of LifeFitness weight equipment that rivals most full sized gyms. Additionally, they have many pieces of Life Fitness cardio equipment such as bikes, treadmills, and ellipticals....all with personal TVs.

Plenty of great restaurants (try ICONS - outstanding comfort food). - Excellent view (NW corner of the hotel) - directly down Pike Street past the shopping district to the Public Market, and Elliot Bay beyond. Also great view to the N. of the Space Needle. - Large room - size was perfect and comfortable. - Blackout shades - if you want to sleep in and not be awakened by the light, you'll have no problem here. - Helpful, courteous staff - we found everyone to be helpful and attentive, especially in the Regency Club. - Tastefully decorated - very warm, sumptuous appointments throughout. Great sheets and pillows. Great lighting. Great bathtub and shower. NW theme with understated asian influence. - Regency Club - tasty breakfast (if you enjoy granola and fresh fruit, and pastries), yummy snacks, plenty of papers and interesting books, great place to relax. There's complimentary internet access here also. Here's the \"could have been better\" (I'm reaching here, as we loved it and will definitely come back again!): - Hot water was lukewarm the first evening - no problem throughout the rest of our stay. - Drop off area is tight.

We arrived at the hotel much later than expected (and called from baggage claim to alert them to that fact). It was 1:30 AM local time - 4:30 AM for us - needless to say, we were exhausted. Front desk pleasantly confirmed we had booked a king, non-smoking room and proceded to send us up to a smoking room on the 23rd floor. The odor was overwhelming. Return to the front desk revealed there were only 4 unoccupied rooms in the hotel (it was a Saturday night). They offered to put us in a non-smoking double room and change us Sunday morning. No problem! That offer should have been made before the hassle of going to the smoking room...but problem solved. As promised, the front desk called at 10 AM Sunday morning with a room change available. New room, on the 17th floor, was just fine. The hotel is very conveniently located downtown - you can walk to most sites of interest. There is a Starbucks that opens to the street but is literally in the hotel. For more discerning coffee drinkers, there is a top rated local coffee shop across the street from the hotel. Other details that made our stay (June 30 - July 6, 2007) most pleasant: spacious bathroom w/dimmer switch for those night trips - separate bathtub and large shower with great shower head and very good water pressure. Bathroom is dark - they have a magnifying mirror, but it's not lit. Difficult for make-up application. Small corner of the room window opens so there's ample fresh air in the room. Blackout shades lower on an electric switch (really handy). Bed - very comfortable - no disgusting bedspread. The workout facility is well equipped with free weights and lots of cardio machines, each with its own TV monitor. Headphones provided if you don't supply your own.

First, the good: The hotel is in a great location, near all the shopping action of downtown and within walking distance of all major attractions. We stayed at the hotel a full week and never once needed or wished for a car. Most importantly, our room was spectacular. I can be a tough hotel critic but there's simply no way one could complain about this room: high-end finishes, a beautiful foyer area, large sitting area, two tvs, automatic shades, plush king bed, etc. etc. The views were glorious: We had a sweeping view of downtown and the bay to the south, and an unobstructed view of the Space Needle to the west. I should mention that we booked a so-called Emerald Suite and stayed on the 27th floor. For those who can splurge a little, I would highly recommend this; the room size and views on the higher floors are worth the price. We paid $470 a night, which is a lot, but I kept thinking a comparable room with comparable views in NYC would probably cost nearly a thousand. I suspect the lower floors don't have quite the views but enjoy the same impressive finishes, furnishings, and bedding. Now the bad: Our check-in process was so inefficient it was actually comical. We arrived after a cruise at 9:30am, which was understandably way too early. The desk staff said to come back for our room around noon, so we headed out , took our time to be respectful, and returned around 2:30pm. Still no room, but we were told the cleaning service was in the room and it would be ready shortly; the staff asked for our cell phone number and said they would call soon. We went out for lunch, and over an hour later still no room, and no phone call. We stopped back again, and were told \"ten more minutes\". So, we waited within view of the front desk, and 25 minutes later no one had approached us and the staff member who had been dealing with us was now gone. Anyway, in the grand scheme of things it was not the end of the world, and based on other postings on TripAdvisor this was clearly an abberation. So, we're staying with the \"Excellent\" rating, but will be curious to see if future reviewers have similar experiences.

Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect. From our initial interaction with the front desk (we arrived at 11 p.m. PST - 2 a.m. EST - our time) they were gracious and accommodating and quickly got us settled. We booked an executive suite (suites are on the top four floors) and were blown away upon entering the suite. We were on the top floor - 30 - and had a view of the space needle and Lake Washington. The living space portion of the suite was very spacious and serene. There is a decent bar area and a very nice 1/2 bath and a refrigerator. The bedroom was also spacious and nicely appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and my one minor complaint was that the pillows (of which there were many) were a little soft. There is a nice size desk and a comfortable ergonomic chair. On top of all the other wonderful aspects - the bathroom was the nicest of all hotels that I have stayed in. It is very classy - all marble - and so much space. There is a separate area for the toilet (with a door) and a free standing shower and a large tub. I can not say enough about the luxury of this. Room service, valet and concierge at the hotel were extremely professional and courteous. The lobby and public areas were very pleasantly appointed. There is a Starbucks in the hotel. The hotel location was ideal, within walking distance to great shopping, dining and Pike Place Market. We experienced very little noise both internally and externally. The weekend was very quiet. It appears that there was a conference group meeting at the hotel but we never felt their presence. The one downside, but is typical to luxury hotels - the parking and breakfast costs were outlandish $17 for a continental breakfast and $31 per day for valet parking.

They serve a nice continental breakfast complete with fresh fruit, juices and cereals. In the evening, there's always a cheese selection, veggies and a hot appetizer. For a small charge ($4 I think), you can enjoy good Washington state wines and beers. Plus, free Internet access. We saved so much money by paying a little extra per night. Holly, the Regency Club conceige, heard that we were celebrating our daughter's third birthday during our visit. Holly wrote a special Birthday note along with a special cookie with a candle and presents (rubber duck and a beach ball). It was a true act of kindness on her part.

We ran into a couple snags - otherwise I would have rated this hotel a 5. First, the concierge's at this hotel were not helpful at all. Maybe we would have been treated differently if we walked up to the desk in business suits. Scott, the night time concierge told us that all of their pamphlets were moved around but he would provide us with information on Victoria, we gave him our room number and nothing. Not even a telephone call. There was one woman that was helpful and we wish that she was there during the other times we needed help. We actually received better assistance at the Westin and we weren't even staying there! Second, upon leaving I tried to use the elevators only to find out that there was some kind of fire alarms going off. I thought this was odd since the fire alarm lights near the elevators were not flashing. I called down to the front desk and was told that the fire department needed to turn off the alarms and should take place by 6:00 a.m.. When I tried to go down again around 6:05, the elevators still would not work. I told her that I needed to leave in order to catch my flight and asked her to send up someone to bring down my luggage. She said OK but after 5 minutes, I had a strange feeling that I wasn't going to get any help. So, I lugged my suitcase down 10 flights. I guess I was kind of lucky, some guests had to come down as far as 26 flights of stairs. When I got to the last set of stairs, someone from Hyatt asked if I needed help. Yeah, OK. It's a little late for that! Later, I was told that the bellboys didn't even start their shift until 8:00 a.m.. I would have waited an aweful long time by the elevators if I hadn't decided to walk down the stairs! Bottom line.

They are both very comfortable and convenient. Our room at the Sheraton was big and bright but the bathroom was pretty small and a little dated. The Grand Hyatt room was much smaller and very dark but the bath was gorgeous. It was huge and new but the light was so dim it was really difficult to apply makeup. The amenities at the Sheraton are worthless - the Grand Hyatt was much better (but not as nice as Sofitel). Bed at the Sheraton was very comfortable but the Hyatt was incredible. Plus, they had a neat electronic room-darkening shade that really helped in the morning. They also had an electronic privacy button rather than the little tag you put outside the door. It was very quiet at both locations. They both charge $10 for in-room Internet, which I think is nickel & dime stuff considering the price of the room. The Hyatt (I think - and maybe the Sheraton, too) also tacks on a charge for the morning newspaper. You can choose not to get it, but you have to do so at registration, I believe. The only bar at the Hyatt is the Ruth Chris' bar - when we tried to take a glass of wine upstairs to our room, we were told that was not usually allowed, but if we were discreet, it was okay. We were successful, but I didn't appreciate feeling like a crook to take my drink upstairs! Did not attempt this at the Sheraton bar, so can't say about that.

Upon check-in our one night there, the front desk was so apologetic about the inconvenience that they gave us a corner suite. It was gorgeous. The hotel is contemporary, but has almost a mission-shaker influence to it (see pics). All the guest rooms had door bells and \"do not disturb\" buttons instead of door knob hangers. Our room also had electronic retractable drapery shades. Very cool! The hotel management left a letter of apology in our room, as well as a large bowl of fruit with a small bottle of wine.

I paid $300 for a Regency Club room, actually a Corner Suite. I'm not sure if all Regency Club guests get these rooms or what. The hotel is conveniently located, although all of downtown Seattle seems to be under construction, and the street in front of the hotel is totally dug up. This means noise. The interior of the hotel is teaky wood, modern and uncluttered. I found the staff to be young and a little inexperienced, but generally fine. There were two things I wish could be better about the property. First, my corner suite was cramped, dark and stuffy. There is only one little tiny window that opens, and with the construction noise, I didn't open it. There is a funky cooling system in place, such that you can only turn the temp down so far, then you can not set it to run and cool constantly. Often it was on auto and thus the stuffiness. The lighting in the room was poor, except for the bathroom, which had great lighting. The carpet was worn and stained in places. A couple of other points - you will pay for internet access; you will be charged if you move anything in the minibar (you can get a fridge for $5 a day), and you will be disappointed with the old fashioned TVs, if you like to watch the tube. On the plus side, the bed, the linens, and the bath with separate tub and shower were fantastic. The other issue I had was with dining options - or the lack thereof. There is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, but their menu is pretty limited (especially for breakfast) and very pricey. I wish they had a restaurant that was less clubby with more choices. if you don't eat meat, you will not have much to choose from. I guess I would stay at this hotel again, but not for the price I paid. I researched my options very carefully, and I beieve that I got the best of what was available. Others at the conference stayed at the Sheraton, which is under a major renovation, and the Westin. Neither excited my colleagues.

Also, they have robes (one in bathroom, one in closet) in the room. The beds in the room are very soft. They give you SIX !!!! pillows on the bed. The \"Grand Bed\" also uses down comforters, etc). The room also has a TV, minibar, lots of storage, big safe, work desk, three chairs, power blackout blinds (they go down and are not see through unlike the other blinds in the room), and a photo of something.

They have surveys to make sure customer service is good, request forms in room (for room cleaning), and a wonderful concierge (Chuck was there when we were at the Grand Hyatt).

The free continental breakfast, included with the business plan rooms, are not continental breakfast.

The purpose of the trip was for business. Upon arriving at the hotel, I asked for a nice room and was told that it would cost $30 extra per day for such a room. Considering that I did not want a room on the lower floors where I would be staring at a concrete wall of another hotel, I agreed to pay the extra money. I was told the room would be ready in 15 minutes so we went to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory that was on the next corner. Two hours later, we returned only to fnd the room the was still not ready. We went up to my coworkers room and the front desk called to state that the room was still not ready but I would be upgraded to an executive suite. The hotel quickly recognized that an issue existed and immediately fixed it by providing an update. If you ever have the chance to stay in the executive suite, please do it. The view from the 27th floor was breath-taking as you are high enough to see out over the water and you can see the Space Needle. The execute suite is actually two rooms with two bathrooms. One room consists of a sitting room with TV, wet bar with refrigerator (note that in other rooms, you have to pay to use the refrigerator), closet and bathroom. The other room was the bedroom with TV, desk, walk in closet, bathtub, separate glass enclosed shower, and bathroom. Note that there are doors separating the rooms which means less noise from the hallway when you are sleeping. Plus, the hotel has curtains that operate from a switch on the wall. For those that like sleeping in total darkness, these curtains will do the trick. Once you press the switch, the curtains come down from the ceiling and cover the windows. The suite was exceptionally clean and well maintained. And considering that the suites are bigger than the rooms, there are less people on the floor. This meant that it was quieter than what my coworkers had on their floors below. The hotel is within walking distance to a variety of attractions. The Space Needle, the Market, Convention Center (where we had to attend a conference), Pike Place Market and lots of clothes shopping are easy to get to.

What I mean is that the hotel itself is first class; beautifully appointed in an excellent location. But unlike most properties of this level, the Grand Hyatt has a truly down to earth, friendly staff that puts guests of all stripes at ease. The hotel is located in a major commerical district, on the same block as a Cheesecake Factory and within a few blocks of major department stores and restaurants. Pike's Place is about a 10 minute walk and visible at the end of the street. You could not pick a more perfect location for Seattle. The hotel lobby is fairly intimate, but done in a very chic style. Its a hushed sort of atmosphere, with a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on the left and a full-service Starbucks (not just a kiosk) to the right. Per my request, my room was a corner suite overlooking the harbor and the Space Needle. The view was absolutely stunning on both ends. The room itself was roomy enough, split into two parts--a sitting area and a bedroom area. The bathroom was very large, with a separate glass shower. The set up was good because it allowed you to keep the bedroom area uncluttered. The shades do indeed close electronically. The bed itself was comfortable, on the plush side. The hotel was quiet, save for some street noise even on a high floor. It was not disruptive. Interior insulation appeared to be good--we never heard our neighbors. If I have a complaint about the room decor, its only that a few pieces of furniture looked a little worn--out of place in that setting. Also, I was a bit surprised that the televisions were the old fashioned kind rather than flat screen. That's hardly a complaint, just an observation that similiar properities have upgraded. Overall, the room was stylish and inviting. I am not a fan of valet parking, and I typically feel a bit out of place dealing with hotel staff at better hotels. The Grand Hyatt was an atypical experience for me. Everyone right down to the valet staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. This is the kind of place that within a day or staying there, every staff member you encounter greets you by name. The valet car service was prompt and efficient, and nobody was trolling for tips (though in this case I didn't mind giving them, they were earned). The advice was good and unpretentious. Be advised that this hotel sometimes is the home for major sports teams. During my stay, the Boston Red Sox were there, which was a major attraction for me and my wife. That meant there were some autograph seekers and the like outside the hotel, but the hotel had security to make sure that only registered guests were inside the lobby and interacting with the players. Overall, the Grand Hyatt Seattle is an excellent hotel that I highly recommend.

The concierge gave us great dinner recommendations and provided maps and directions to tourist locations. There is a Ruth Chris Steakhouse attached to the hotel lobby. We went there for breakfast every day. They met all our menu requests for smaller portions and charged commensurately lower prices. We left the hotel for a few days of traveling and had no problem leaving some luggage in the hotel storeroom until our return The couple of glitches we had (maid forgot the towels one day, etc.) were immediately resolved to our satisfaction.

We were warmly greet and escorted to the check-in. Check-in was simple and quick. We were then escorted to our room, which was a corner suite with a decent view, if you like ugly rooftops. The gentleman who took us to our room was pleasant and very informative of the area. He showed us all the features of our room. Thirty minutes after being in the room we received a letter under the door explaining that the water to the hotel would be cut off at midnight and back on at 4 am. We did not consider this a problem as they stated they were flushing the system. At 10 pm we received another letter under the door that was a duplicate of the second letter. We woke up at 6:30 am as we were heading to LA on Amtrak that left at 10 am. We found that we did not have any water. We called downstairs and was informed that we would have water in 30 minutes. At 7:15 we still had no water but they offered to send bottled water to our room, which we declined. Ten minutes later the doorbell rang and we found 2 bottles of water sitting at the door. We were not sure what they expected us to do with 2 - 16 oz. bottles of water. At 7:30 we called the desk again about the water and was told they had water in the gym and we could take showers there. We asked if they had hot water and was told yes. Imagine our surprise when we got there and found they only had cold (ice cold) water. I then went down to the desk and was told that we would have water to our room by 8:30 that it was a long process to get the water throughout the hotel. I explained that we had to leave by then to which they did not reply. By the time I got back to my room, there was 2 more bottles of water sitting at the door. We immediately packed out belongings, we down to checkout and asked that they call a taxi for us. They told us they would get us a taxi outside to just go on out. They also offered us bottled water to take with us. Once outside we were informed they should have called for a taxi inside, so the gentleman outside was standing in the road trying to flag down a taxi instead of someone going inside to call. There was a gentleman who drives his a personal Town Car that was there waiting to pickup passengers for airport flights (no reservations required with this gentleman and he charges the same as a taxi) he volunteered to take us to the Amtrak station. We wanted to get away before they offered us more bottled water so we took him up on it. As we drove away the gentleman was still in the road trying to flag down a taxi while his co-workers watched. The wonderful gentleman with the Town Car charged us $5.00. We gave him $20.00 because we would have paid that or more for taxi.

We had a very nice one bedroom suite on the club level with incredible panaromic views of the sound, the peninsula and but for an unfortunately located building next door, Mt. Ranier. The clunky tv in the armoire was a bit of a surprise in this context; the room cries out for a plasma on the wall--not that we would have turned it on with the views! However, the restaurant and lounge situation keeps this hotel from the 5 star level. First, if you think Ritz Carlton when you hear club level, forget it. You pay for what you might order from the extremely limited and basic drink menu, even for a diet coke, and the hor d'oeurve service is,well, unimpressive. There is only one restaurant and lounge in the hotel, the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse located next door (with an entrance from the hotel lobby). If you want a quiet drink, it is noisy and crowded and filled with people who perhaps have been there too long. If you want breakfast, you get a limp one page xerox of your egg choices.

My company was doing a show at the convention center, half a block away. I chose the Grand Hyatt out of all the convention hotels because I had stayed there once in 2004 and loved it. This visit was even better, because I was there for a full week. Customer service in all areas of the hotel is excellent. When I'm on a business trip, I want to know the hotel staff will help me fix anything that goes wrong. I wanted a place with meeting space, in case I needed it at the last minute. I had a corner suite on the 23rd floor, with a view of the water from one of the smaller windows. I am now certain I don't want to live in Seattle, because it rained or was darkly overcast almost the whole time, in May! Luckily we were up high enough to have lots of (gray) light. The housing prices in California are depressing, but not as depressing as Seattle weather. I love the interior design, which uses natural materials in a modern, somewhat masculine way. The bathroom has a deep tub and separate shower. The light over the tub is on a dimmer. It would be better if all the lights were dimmable. I love the lavender and citrus-scented toiletries, but I know some people can't stand the fragrance. I was disappointed that the towels are kind of rough. I didn't remember that from my previous visit. I can't seem to find soft hotel towels anywhere but at Four Seasons. I had dinner with a friend at Ruth's Chris Steak House in the hotel. Yummy! Gigantic onion rings, flavorful sirloin steak, grilled asparagus...I had no room for dessert. I also had drinks with a client in the bar at Ruth's. They close at midnight on weekdays, which surprised me. They didn't rush us out, though. There are two movie theaters within a block of the hotel. There are three shopping malls within four blocks, but they're nothing too exciting if you live in the Bay Area. The corner suite comprised a sitting area, a narrow hallway, and the bedroom. The sitting area and bedroom are not separated by a door. On one side of the hallway are two sets of double doors, for the closet. The other side has the door to the bathroom. Like the bathroom door in a standard room, it's wood with glass inserts that are translucent but not transparent. There's none of that nonsense you see in W hotels, with their see-through windows between the bedroom and bathroom. I decided against a Regency Club room, because there are lots of fabulous places to eat in Seattle (Flying Fish, Etta's, Salumi). I did use the gym a couple times. For a windowless room, it is very attractive, in the same style as the rest of the hotel. I used the elliptical, treadmill, and free weights. They also have stairsteppers and weight machines. The cardio machines have tv screens. I especially liked the small fridge with chilled, moist towels. There's a watercooler and a tiny gym lounge with magazines. Some of my colleagues couldn't understand why I'd want to stay four extra nights in Seattle after my three-day business trip, but the Hyatt's customer service and luxurious beauty made it worth the money and time. There are many things to like about this place, but the staff is their strength.

I was impressed with this hotel which clearly was well cared for but they had a few weird policies that people should be aware of. On the plus side, I was greeted by a very helpful friendly bellman when I arrived in my taxi. He took the time to note my name from my luggage tags so by the time he got me to the Front Desk, he announced me by name. I travel a lot but have never experienced that kind of attenttion to detail. My room was spacious and the bathroom was huge. On the negative side: 1. The toiletries were by Portico but rather than usual Verbena scent, these were in some new scent - something with Ginger. They were cloying and sickly sweet. I am a hotel toiletries junky and even I did not care about taking them with me! 2. When I checked in, the Front Desk Man told me that that if I took anything out of the minibar (which had motion detectors for crying out loud) for \"more than 30 seconds\" then I would be charged a \"sanitization fee\" of, I think he said, $7! The fee would be applied whether I put the item back or not! What gives with that?? Not customer-friendly at all, in my view, given that I am paying over $300 to rent their room for the night. If I want to park my store-bought diet coke in there or peruse the ingredients on a package of potato chips for more than 30 seconds, I should be allowed to. 3. The room service bill stated that a mandatory service charge of 19% had been added to my bill, a \"portion of which would be put in the waitstaff's tip pool\" - ie. clearly not all of it. I asked my waiter about it and he shrugged and said that I should mention it when I checked out. I hate it when hotels try and make money in sneaky ways like this. The hotel charged me plenty for that plate of eggs and I don't know why they felt that they needed to take part of the poor waiter's tips too.

The standard double queen room is about the size of any standard hotel room anywhere else, but the furnishings are beautiful and classy. The hotel and rooms have gorgeous lighting.

The tub is just right for soaking and the water covers your whole body. The shower is huge, enclosed in glass and the shower head has multiple spray settings and is high enough for someone over six feet to enjoy. Bathrobes, lots of soft towels and lovely bath soaps, gel, shampoo and conditioner. Good complimentary coffee and teas. The beds are comfortable with down toppers, pillows and comforters. Don't let the mini bar scare you. If you touch anything, but don't use it, you can let the front desk know that you did not use the item. Just avoid it if you don't plan on using anything and ask for a complimentary mini frige to be hooked up in the bathroom for you for your own beverages you can get at any drugstore or mini mart in town. I recommend you get the Regency Club upgrade. With this option, you get a key to enter the club on the 27th floor 24 hours a day to get coffee, tea, cocoa and soft drinks.

I found the staff from valet to housekeeping to be quite friendly, quick and attentive. We were there when the hotel was not busy. This hotel is right in the middle of downtown and once you valet your car, you don't need it to have a great vacation (yes, the valet service is expensive, so be prepared to pay $29-35.00 per day to park your car). This hotel does not nickle and dime, they are up front about their charges and do not charge any more than any other big city hotel. This is not Motel 6 folks! One concierge, Mr. Rice, has lots of advice on where to eat or play in town.

The staff was exceptional - the bell hop gave us some interesting facts - the marble used in the entry way and bathroom is fossilized so \"if you look really close you might be able to see something.\" In the morning when I called the front desk to find out when check-out was, the guy answered the phone and said, \"Good Morning, Mrs. Callahan, how can I help you?\" The room was exquisite - feather topped mattress and down comforter, marble entryway and bathroom, and a waterfall faucet in the tub. Even a Starbucks in the lobby- score! Also a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse (best steaks in the world) in the hotel. We called down to the valet about five minutes before we checked out, and our vehicle was waiting outside for us. But it's true about the mini-bar, don't touch it unless you want to eat it or drink it, because it is computerized and you'll get charged for it! We didn't find this out the hard way - our bell hop gave us the low down. A great shopping distict is a block away or take a short walk or free bus ride to the Pikes Place Market about seven blocks away.

Worst experience ever!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3727686", "Content": "We made reservations for an Emerald Suite at the Grand Hyatt for the night prior to and the night of our July 1 wedding. Several times prior to the date of check-in, my husband called to confirm various details (we wanted a bottle of champagne on ice for our July 1 wedding night, etc.). I checked in to the hotel on the day prior to our wedding. I requested the specific suite we looked at, which had a view of the Space Needle and the water. We were told we could not request a specific room until check-in, and when I did request it at check-in, I was told that was the room we had. It was not. We had a water and a city view. Still a nice view, but not at all what we had expected or were promised (the Space Needle and water view was requested). When we asked the bellboys (there were 2 standing around and no other guests in the lobby at the time) to help us with our bags, which were in our car in the garage, they argued as to who had to help us. Finally, one lost the argument and escorted us with a cart to our car. Upon arriving at our car, without saying a word the whole way, the bellboy threw our luggage onto the cart and haphazardly threw my wedding dress on top of it all. He then proceeded to bang the cart into the wall twice on the way back down to the lobby with no apology. When we got to the lobby, my mother asked him to step away from the cart and not touch our stuff. He started to argue with her. We got a different bellboy to take our items up to my room. When I got to the room I discovered that not only were we not given the room we had asked for (and been told we received), but the champagne for the wedding night was waiting on ice on the coffee table. I took it off the ice, called the appropriate number and asked them to please re-place it on ice on Friday, the night of our wedding. The night prior to the wedding, I ordered room service. A very simple order. After waiting for almost an hour for the food to arrive, it was incorrect. On our wedding night, my husband and I returned to the room to find the champagne where I had left it the day prior, on the end table next to the couch...no ice. At 8:53AM on the morning after our wedding, housekeeping rang the doorbell to the suite. Check out was not until noon. This was the part that upset me the most. 8:53 am the morning after our wedding! Not only did housekeeping ring the doorbell (the door to the suite is on the opposite end and in another room than the bedroom), they proceeded to enter. Repeat, this is the morning after our wedding. Ah! Needless to say, at this point we were ready to vacate this room that we paid way, way too much money for. The bellboy arrived to help with our baggage and it was the one from the day before that I had had such a bad experience with. He took our luggage and rolled it outside to the valet area. He left it and did not tell the valet which car it was to be loaded into (meanwhile, we were inside checking out). Upon check-out, I shared these experiences with the employee at the desk, he apologized and credited the room service back. After all of the various mess-ups that occurred, I will never stay at that hotel again. Not only that, but whenever I drive by it (I am from the Seattle area), I will be reminded of what a horrible experience I had there in the days surrounding my wedding. Thankfully, my husband and I were too happy with each other to let it ruin our wedding night. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.

We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride.

The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others.

I turned down the wine and requested a different room, which they accomodated. In the new room, I asked for a duvet cover as my daughter keeps pulling the sheets off the blanket but the housekeeping could not find a single duvet cover!!

Also any movement by one partner will result in jello like quivering of the bed which my wife certainly did not enjoy. Had room service which was really tasty and hot. Chili is great! Only restaurant in the hotel is Ruths Chris which is awesome to satisfy any carnivore but probably vegans will have to just get steamed broccoli. Kids were welcome and the staff was very nice. Weird that the hotel really doesn't have a lounge unless you count the Ruth's, and Ruths is not a place I usually go for a drink. Luckily the hotel across the street has a nice bar. Close to all the shops. If you want to shop this is the place to use as your base of ops. If you are a groupie the Cleveland Indians stayed here our weekend.

After reading reviews here and finding a AAA rate (with breakfast) for a corner suite of $198.00 per night, my wife and I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt. I called to confirm before our trip and requested a high floor with views of the waterfront. The Hyatt national reservation desk, where I was routed, was helpful and checked with the hotel directly for availability. After a little wait, the Hyatt reservation agent advised that we could get a high floor with the view we requested but they couldn't confirm until later. The agent promised to call my cell phone, even if she had to stay a bit late (we didn't arrive until near midnight). I was surprised to get a call back as promised with a confirmation of the room and room number. Check in was smooth as we had confirmed via telephone. Our room was exactly as promised - great view of both downtown Seattle (Needle and all) and a view towards Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Comfortable king bed with down pillow top bedding on the mattress. Remote controlled shades on the windows. Very luxurious bathroom with large shower and tub. All amenities including professional hair dryer, iron and board, in room safe, 2 TVs, complimentary umbrella, coffee maker, and plush robes (for use in room - or to purchase for taking home - $50 per robe). Did I mention the views? Wow! Hotel location was fine - corner of 7th and Pine so the walk to the waterfront was about 8 blocks. Very near excellent shopping and the Westlake Shopping Center. We had breakfast in the fine restaurant (727 Pine) each morning. The only knock I have against this hotel is the prices for the meals - although we didn't have to pay for breakfast as it was part of the package. Examples - $13 omelettes, $12 for salmon appetizers, $12 for waffles. We didn't check the dinner menu as we assumed the prices were much more for that meal and we had already planned to eat at the waterfront (which was actually reasonable and great views) and on Bainbridge Island. All in all, nice hotel - great amenities, decent location, taxis in front almost constantly if you chose that method of transportation, and again, the views from the hotel were incredible.
