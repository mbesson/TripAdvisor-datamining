Venice was our first city-stop in Italy. After almost 24 hours of traveling (2 planes, 1 train and 1 vaporetto), it was wonderful to just dump our bags, take a quick shower and head on out to explore Venezia. Venice is a city to \"get lost in\" and I mean that both literally and figuratively. Having a hotel just right beside the vaporetto stop (Sant' Angelo) made it so convenient for us- especially during those times when we actually couldn't find our way back. It was so easy to just hop on a vaporetto and head back to Sant' Angelo. It was also wonderful not having to drag our heavy suitcases thru cobble stone steps because the hotel is right across where you get off from the boat. Very convenient indeed! For the price, NH Manin offers a really good breakfast buffet complete with prosecco. It felt like such a treat waking up in the morning and heading to the breakfast room, knowing that you can have a glass of bubbly with bread, cheese and fruit. I would gladly recommend NH Manin to travelers visiting Venice for the first time. Hotel rooms are clean and well-maintained. We also got a room that was looking out to the grand canal. The bathroom was a decent size and had all the amenities that we needed. Looking forward to visiting Venice again soon and staying at the same hotel.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cAverage, but good value for money\u201d", "Author": "187147Rob", "ReviewID": "UR121561138", "Content": "If you keep your expectations low, then you will like this.

The hotel is right next to the #2 Vaporetto, and it is also one of the line stops for the shared water taxis to the airport for 16 euros payable on board or 15 euros in advance. You are two stops to the Rialto Bride and you can see that bridge from outside the hotel. I was thrilled to get room 001 on the ground floor upfront. I had a Grand, Grand Canal view. I threw open the double window and was able to stand in the window. There was a short balustrade at the bottom of the window which made standing seem like I was on a french balcony. I could throw a coin and hit the valporetto from there, you are that close! Plus the canal is bending like a boomerang, so you have a sweeping panoramic view of the canal. The hotel has a beautiful inner court yard with table, chairs and umbrellas for outdoor dining with your included breakfast. Breakfast was very nice with cappuccino made to order, check out the ceiling in that breakfast room/bar. They also had a beautiful reading room with all the newspapers on poles, etc. I loved the staff and Luca at the front desk was calm under pressure.

The staff are so very helpful and friendly with good knowledge of their city. They are attentive, professional and are happy in their work. It is very well managed. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and all facilities acceptable and with good housekeeping. It is clean, quiet and peaceful. The range of breakfast foods on offer is large and very acceptable. The two lifts are small but quite adequate and are at right-angles to each other and a most welcome facility. The San Angelo waterbus landing stage is very close to the front door and is a good service. The Manin is very convenient for getting about Venice. The garden would be a nice amenity to enjoy if one can put up with the pigeons that infest the place. They cannot be killed by some querky legal rules - no surprise when St Marks is so grossly infested by the birds - fed by the tourists who buy the bird food from a squad of sellers there.This is a shameful state as there are laws that prohibit feeding pigeons there. The city is suffering from the guano and one can see the stone work being eaten away by this. Since we were here in Venice four years ago, the waterbus vaparetti have improved with better displays of destinations and recorded messages. The introduction of the OYSTER type prepaid travel cards make moving about Venice a real adventure and is good value for money. The Manin Hotel is such a pleasure to stay in for a holiday that we would recommend it to everyone that we know. The plans to save Venice from any further sinking or flooding by the government we hope and trust will work as it seems to be the answer to such a vast problem that has been the trouble for so long. The combined efforts of THOMSON + CITALIA + BRITISH AIRWAYS made a great holiday for us. We will be back to Venice next year - and to the Manin Hotel for another pleasant holiday.

At the same time, those same rooms are probably more noisy, since you can hear distincly the boats manoeuvering at the Sant'angelo stop. The second floor of the hotel is thus to be preferred, if possible. The hotel location is great, only a few minutes walk from Rialto bridge, San Marco, Ponte dell'Accademia. Campo San Maurizio e Campo Santo Stefano are also close by, there you can find food shops, bars, restaurants. A nice and quiet neighbourhood. The personnel of the Hotel is very kind and helpful. The room was cold on the first night, we had to increase the room temperature and thus have the heating run, for a while, at night, a nuisance, since the air conditioning/heating system is noisy.

When we came for breakfast the male staff member gave out to us in front of the other guests which was not right. I paid 1300 euro to stay at this hotel for 5 nights and i dont like to treated in that way. Another thing was the bar at the hotel which closes at 2330 hours.

There is a little noise from the vaporetti but these do not run during the night and we found them an added interest rather than an intrusion. A good breakfast is available in the sunny / shady parasoled small garden and there are a few tables inside. I am conscious that previous commentators mentioned seating problems but we found no problems whatsoever. I would advise a good map , which the manager helpfully supplied, since it is remarkably easy to get lost particularly when coming back in the dark after a meal with more wine than is sensible ! Lastly, if funds allow do try a gondola. We did it on a quiet sunday afternoon and it was wonderful. However, avoid at all costs sitting down for a coffee / drink in St Marks Square when the orchestras are playing in the evening, its obscenely expensive and simply not worth it. I would not hesitate to stay at the Manin again and would recommend it to anyone.

What a terrible experience!!! It was on the crowded number 1 vaporetto right before our Hotel stop at St. Angelo, so please be aware!!! He had his wallet in his front pocket, and had his hand in his pocket most of the time, but for a few seconds he took it out to hang onto the side rail of the vaporetto just to keep his balance. The thief was apparently stalking him and watching him every minute! We were completely and totally shocked and felt very taken advantage of. As we got off the vaporetto and headed a few feet to the hotel, he noticed it was missing. The boat was just leaving the stop, and the thief probably was watching him feel his pants pockets for his missing wallet!!! We just felt so violated. At that point we weren't sure what to do, as this had never happened to us, so we were just so shook up. Luckily I still had my credit cards in my purse with me, so the phone numbers of who to call were on the back of the cards. But we were in a foreign country, and we didn't even know if the 1-800 numbers would work in Italy. At the Hotel Manin, we immediately spoke with Mr. Pierluca Cecchini, the Reception Manager. He helped us so much, he was so calming and so nice. He was extremely professional, and he made us feel so thankful that he was standing there behind that counter. He calmed us down, and told us that he would help us take care of everything and not to worry. Then he actually made several international phone calls to the credit card companies from his desk, and handed the phone to my husband each time so that he could report the cards stolen. We offered to pay for the cost of the phone calls, but he declined. Although we lost quite a bit of money that night in his wallet, it could have been so much worse if the thief would have been able to use our credit cards also. Thanks to Mr. Cecchini that did not happen. I can't say enough about how helpful he was to us, and how much we appreciate all that he did. All the wonderful things that people have written about this hotel are true, and in addition to all of those was the extraordinary service that we received that night when we felt at our most nervous and most stressed. When we visit Venice again, you can be assured that we will stay at the Framon Hotel Manin. We know from experience that they go out of their way to take EXCEPTIONAL care of their hotel guests!!!", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hove", "Title": "\u201cwomderful suite\u201d", "Author": "egroegdrof", "ReviewID": "UR5719332", "Content": "We stayed here as the first part of our two week honeymoon.

Worth noting is that the hotel does not offer any type of internet connection (wireless or wired) and there were no movies available in-room (Venice is not a nightlife city). I would probably try a different place our next stay in Venice.

A few days before our trip, I rang to arrange for a bottle of Prosseco and a bouquet of flowers to be left in the room for her arrival. The staff were more than helpful on the phone and as soon as we arrived at the hotel they discretly pointed out (without my mother hearing) that all had been arranged as requested. Sure enough when she checked into her room, a beautiful vase containing a stunning bouquet of flowers and a bottle of chilled fizz were there to welcome her (and it didn't cost an arm and a leg either). We took a water taxi from the airport (90 EUROS) although if you are traveling alone or are a bit strapped for cash it is simple to use the Water Buses and there is a stop right outside the hotel, so no walking involved. You catch both from the same place, which is a short walk (5-10 mins tops) from the airport terminal...if you are capable of a small stroll, just turn left when you get out of the airport doors and follow the signs to water buses and taxis. The gentleman on reception, Paulo was more than helpful and as our room was not ready having arrived early morning, had our bags taken to a storage room and furnished us with maps and directions so be could begin our sightseeing. He also was most obliging when asked any questions and more than helpful to recommend restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets. We booked 2 rooms one delux double and one regular and although the regular was fine, it was well worth paying the extra for the delux, which although only had a view of the gardens was very spacious, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. There is a separate sitting area where you can have drinks and relax too. The ordinary room was in a ventilation shaft in the centre of the hotel and was very dark, fairly wee and very warm, with no view at all but having said that, if that's all your budget can manage it's fine as you only sleep in it or spend an hour or 2 there before going out etc. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was more than adequate with bacon, eggs, pastries, cold meats, cheese, fresh fruit etc and the staff were delightful. If I had to find one negative point with the hotel it was the barman, who was most reluctant to provide a dish of ice for the room (I went to the bar to ask for one.... didn't expect room service or anything) There are no ice machines, so unless they expect you to drink warm drinks from the mini bar there is no alternative. We would have had a drink in the bar, but never saw a soul in it so decided to drink in the comfort of our own room. The location is perfect, slap bang between the Rialto Bridge and Saint Mark's Square. One thing I would strongly recommend is a trip out to the Islands of Murrano to see the glass shops, then from there go to Burrano which is the more beautiful of the islands. The houses are brightly coloured and it looks stunning on a sunny day. It is alot quieter than Venice itself and makes a welcome break from the hustle and bustle. Have lunch at De Romano, the food is excellent. On the mainland, you must have dinner at Aqua Pazza which is in the square right behind the hotel. Ask for the special desert, which is ice cream and sorbets served in the skins of the fruit they have been made from...doesn't sound very special but trust me...it's amazing. Venice is a beautiful, unique and special city and this is a great hotel to use as a base. I'd definately go back and be more than happy to stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevenoaks, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and friendly service\u201d", "Author": "ambermaine", "ReviewID": "UR4736239", "Content": "Have just returned from a three night stay in Venice.

Every evening we were welcomed to chocolate and cute stationary notes by our bedside table, adding more romance to our experience. The breakfast was grand: Coffee, juices, fruits, pastries, sweets were a very nice touch around the holidays. Venice is just beautiful and this hotel really helped us enjoy this trip very much. The location is perfect and very close to St. Mark's Square, Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale). We saw a great though twisted Salvador Dali exhibit at the The Palazzo Grassi for any art fans. The architecture of this city is something to see. From seeing skyscrapers in Chicago to seeing exquisite Cathedrals, Churches and Palaces is just surreal. Truly one of the most romantic cities in the world. Some might say its overpriced but you can get away with buying dinner at small cafes with a panini.
