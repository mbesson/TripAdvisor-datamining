Looks very vintage. The sheets, floors and sharing bathroom were also very clean. For a very good price on a weekday during the Carnival in February, breakfast and Internet were included. Venice has introduced a tourist tax so depending on the length of the stay you will pay a bit extra to the room charge. In the booking confirmation e-mail from hotel Alex the amount was 0,50E per person per day, but eventually we paid 1,00E with the explanation it is the charge in high season.

We were not expecting a lot but its the added negatives that made our stay unpleasant. While it is clean, the rooms are large and the position of the hotel is central, there are a number of things which we weren't aware of with the hotel prior to staying there. The price is low for Venice but still considerably more than other european city's for what you get. Beware of the reasonably good review on Lonely Planet!! (that was what made us book this Hotel). Our first floor room was extremely noisy - noise in the street until 3am and then from 7am again, impossible to sleep. Paper thin inside walls. The ceramic floor tiles in our room weren't even glued down and moved about as you walked on them. Very dodgy bedside lamps which looked like they were an electrical fault waiting to happen and which caused a severe burn to my wifes arm. Mosquito ridden room with squashed mosquito's all over the walls and did not seem to ever be cleaned off. You can't open the bedroom windows for the mossie problem and you can't open the bedroom door to let fresh air in as the foyer has an extremely strong smell of cigarette smoke (despite being a non smoking hotel!!!). The furniture in the room is quite old but ok except for the beds. My children slept on single fold out beds which had mattresses which were banana shaped and not very good for sleeping on. I stress again that it is clean and large rooms plus the grandma on the front desk is particulalry helpful, although her son? Mario not so much. You are promised free wifi but for the life of us couldn't get it to work anywhere in the hotel despite the owners insisting they gave us the password. Overall, particulalry disappointed that reviews in Lonely Planet don't mention the noise and bedroom/issues.

The morning continental breakfast was less than adequate...though there is a nice, little general store right across the sidewalk that we used to supplement our breakfasts each morning. Our room, though quite large, lacked hot water, soap, and clean soft towels. The towels were \"hard\" and gave my daughter a facial rash. The toilet area, and the single, shower room were shared between 4 guestrooms. I found it inconvenient.

This place was more like a backpacker lodge without the cheaper price tag. I actually had mentally prepared for the shared bathrooms, but they turned out to be so tiny you could hardly change clothes and there was only one shower per two floors. I have had better shared bathrooms in far cheaper youth hostels. Our room did have a very nice terrace that we enjoyed immensely. However, Lonely Planet mistakenly said the terraces on 3 sides of the building had canal views, this is wrong, there is no way any side of this building would have a canal view.

Marco is more expensive as expected - accomodation, food, drink, bird seed. Not only was Hotel Alex more cost effective than most parts of Venice, the traditional rooms were clean and comfortable. Plus we had a lovely view leading straight down the front path and onto the canal. Plus the bars and restaurants around S. Polo were much cheaper than in S. Marco, and it also gave us the perfect opportunity to explore (and get lost) around this part of the city - which we would have otherwise ignored if we had stayed in S. Marco. No major issues, as myself and my partner have a pretty good attitude when it comes to travelling abroad. I think that the hot water ran out once but a cold shower after 6 hours of walking in the heat was welcomed! Quite a bit of noise from the late nighters walking by - but we were in one of the busiest cities in the world so it had to be expected. No aircon available, but nothing a cold shower couldnt sort out - the buildings in Venice are old and S. Polo is a more traditional part of the city than the tourist saturated S.
