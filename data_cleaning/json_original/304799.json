However, after two congresses this year (several months apart) in that city I cannot but warn other people. The city and its hotels must improve significantly if they wish to comply with the congressing standards of other major destinations. The Nippon hotel, in focus for this discussion, is similar to my earlier reviewed Point hotel, but even less inspiring and with technical room problems accompanied by poor service. My room airconditionining was trying to create a sauna in there, with the cooling not working at all. I informed the reception but nothing was adjusted and no alternative room was offered. Also, for such a large hotel the breakfast buffet was remarkably poor on the meats side. No pure meats or other high protein foods; only spongy sausages with unidentifiable content. Last but not least, Avoid staying here in connection to a congress at the Istanbul International Congress Centre (ICC) which is some 10 min walk away along a heavily trafficked main road. At the time of writing this review I have stayed at two medium class business hotels in Taksim, Istanbul, and the Nippon Hotel is the poorer one of them. For both hotels, intenrational guests should be aware that there are rouge 'shoepolishers' on way to the walk to the ICC. They look like tramps and try attract the attention of tourists by seemingly accidentally dropping one of their shoe polish tools on the street. Whatever you do - do NOT attempt to help. If you do that they will want to polish your shoes 'as a thankful gesture' only to then aggressively demand ridiculous amounts of money for the provided 'service'. This leaves a bitter aftertaste - you feel robbed - and the fact that these tramps (another gorilla tramp; same trick) were still outside the hotel 8 months after my first visit to Taksim just shows that the Istanbul congress hotels do not care too much about their tourists. If I ever have to go back to the ICC I will insist to stay at the Hilton next door to ICC.

The we stayed in a Superior Corner room and got upgraded to a Suite (we stayed two times) both were great. The main difference is that the suite had a sitting area and a big bathroom with a Jacuzzi. The corner room was a good size minus was the very small bathroom. We had complimentary fruit baskets in both stays, and a call once we were in the room confirming that all was ok in the room. 2 bottles of water were provided daily and tea and coffee facility. Rooms were cleaned daily. During our stay the weather was around 9 degrees and the central heating was not working at the time, they provided us with extra blankets, that was the only thing i would complain about, but it seemed they didnt expect that cold weather in early october, i do not know, so maybe confirm if they have fixed the heating issue if planning to stay in colder months. the AC was working fine and we had no issues with cooling. Breakfast was OK. There was a variety of cheese, vegetables, fruits, breads, cereal and hot dishes such as sausages, pancakes, eggs however it does not change, so its nearly the same food every day, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok if you are staying for a couple of days you can make your own mix and match. We also ate in the coffeeshop on the ground floor, it was good (omlete and club sandwich). We took one tour, the Dolmabahce Palace, through the hotel and we had an issue as we thought we would be able to see the Harem however when we were on the way the guide mentions it is not included and there is no option but to miss our trip back if you do want to pay extra to see it. The guide book does not mention any extra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that we may chose. Anyways if anyone is planning to take this tour confirm that you will see the room if you are interested. Taking taxis from the hotel was easy and the tell you the approximate price that you will need to pay to make sure that the taxi driver does not rip you off. They also provide you with information for the metro if you want to use it. It location is great, it has a lot of souvenir shops around it, coffee shops and restaurants.

The hotel is located in Taksim's \"hotel street\" - only taxis seem to get access. The taxis and shops here rely on their reputation, so they are a lot less likely to be tourist traps. Tourist half-day and day tours can be booked directly from the hotel, and I think I would recommend this; I decided to walk around the old town by myself on my day off and found it very difficult to ward off merchants and scammers. So much for my original review - I was really happy with the hotel when I left - now, sadly, the update: Back home, I noticed that my hotel receipt was incomplete (anyone who travels for business knows how much of a pain that can be) so I emailed the Nippon staff, asking for an updated receipt. It took several emails until someone replied - they asked me to post the original receipt back via regular mail, and I would get an updated version back. I did this - and waited, and waited, and emailed, and emailed... nearly two months later and after more than a handful emails which they ignored, I got an updated receipt - via email, to print myself.

We were welcomed with a fruit platter and also a list of complimentary services, which included 2 free bottles of water, pillow menu, ironing service, and daily newspaper. We literally handed a gentleman a pair of my husbands jeans and wrinkled shirt and he ironed them for us perfectly at no charge!

Tyfoon the breakfast manager was very friendly and helpful explaining to us where to go in Istanbul. Location was very good.
