There's a HUGE choice of hotels in Madrid (many of them very new) so wasting your cash here is madness. ROOMS: I stayed on the top floor in a small room that looked like the furnishings and doors hadn't been changed since the late 70's or early 80's. Everything looked old and very worn out. There was dust on the floor in the room and in the bathroom, which was never swept away for the nights we were there. -No mini bar -No tea or coffee making facilities, or ironing board -Television had only 1 non-Spanish channel -The telephone had an enormous amount of static when I used it to speak to reception. I could hardly hear what the person was saying to me. -You needed to pay 1 euro to use the in-room safe ! So, what that meant was that every time you needed to open the safe (to get your mobile phone or digital camera or passport) you would have to pay again (and again, and again) to close it !!! The only good thing about the room was that it did have a balcony which was nice...watch out for the low railing if you suffer from vertigo or have hyperactive children !! Perhaps the rooms below the top floor were in a better state but from the brochure photos it doesn't look like it's much improvement. COMMON AREAS: -Reception consists of a small desk with no more than ONE member of staff on duty at most times. (Be aware that almost ALL hotels in Spain always will ask you (and often, but not always, anyone else staying in the room with you) for your passport, identity card or driving license.) -Room keys are still the old metallic type, which need to be left with reception whenever you go out of the hotel during your stay. -The common area carpets looked quite dirty -The lift (elevator) is small and has buttons and decor from the 1970's -Hotel brochures and website says the hotel has a bar - but this is very misleading as it is part of the basement breakfast area and is NOT open in the evening. -I sent the lady on reception into meltdown one evening when I asked for a glass and some ice . She needed to call the security man to go downstairs into the bar and get me one and gave me the ice in a plastic bag which you usually find in hotels for dirty laundry. The plastic laundry bag was new and clean but is that any way to hand a paying guest some ice over the reception counter ???!!! BREAKFAST: Breakfast is served in the basement in the \"bar area\". The inclusive breakfast service and food on offer was as cheap as you can get. -Only ONE member of staff runs the whole operation from behind the bar. -The cutlery was just thrown in the centre of each of table (on the cheap paper placemat - the kind you get on a MacDonald's plastic tray) without putting the cutlery straight in any form. -Each person gets only ONE coffee and ONE orange juice IF you ask for one from the barman running the show. -Much of the \"buffet\" consists of cheap supermarket plastic wrapped cakes -The rest of the \"buffet\" is bread, croissants, cheese and salami - that's it ! -The breakfast area has a SECOND entrance up a flight of stairs onto the street for the general public !!! This means that while you are eating breakfast, people who are not staying at the hotel come down the stairs and sit at the bar to order coffee and sometimes start smoking too ! I have never heard of a 3 star hotel doubling its guest breakfast area as a bar to the public ! This shows you how desperate they must be for cash ! LOCATION: Hotel is located on a street corner away from the tourist areas of Madrid in a residential quarter of the city. It's more or less midway between 2 metro stations - one is \"Quevedo\" on the Red coloured metro line number 2, and the other station is \"Iglesia\" on the turquoise coloured metro line number 1 which will take you directly to the city centre station of \"Sol\". You'll have to take the metro or walk for 10-20 minutes before you find any restaurants in the evening. The quiet, safe location has to be about the only good aspect of this place. As you will have probably noticed (if you've been to Madrid before or have been reading the Tripadvisor reviews for most hotels in the city) Madrid is a very noisy city 24 hours a day. You will get a quieter room here (as far as outside noise is concerned) than most other hotels in the city BUT you still have some traffic to deal with, and the very annoying artificial bird chirping noise the traffic light makes when it goes green for pedestrians (which it does every 2 minutes or so) ! ON THE 3 STAR RATING OF THIS HOTEL If you needed any more proof that the star rating system for worldwide hotels is utterly worthless (as a general guide for travellers of what standards to expect) then look no further than the Best Western hotels of Madrid. The Best Western Trafalgar claims on its website and brochures that it is a 3 star hotel. It's not... by any standard. Giving it 2 stars, or even one and a half, is way more accurate... ...and yet ! In contrast, one (of many) of the Trafalgar's best western sister hotels (also in Madrid) the Best Western Atlantico on Gran Via (which we also stayed at - see my other review for a full comparison) is ALSO classified as a 3 star property ! But the 3 star Atlantico is of a 4 to 5 star standard in an early 20th century high rise building with larger and diversely decorated rooms, more staff, better services, and an excellent ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT-AND-DRINK breakfast buffet which is amazingly cheap. (Without limiting you to one orange juice, one coffee and plastic wrapped cakes like the Trafalgar) How can these two properties be in the same hotel chain and be both classified as having 3 stars when they as different as night and day ?!?! To top it all off...I cannot believe that even the \"Lonely Planet\" Madrid City 2006 guidebook recommends this place. With so much choice in Madrid for hotels of all classes how could they recommend this small run-down throwback to the 1970-80's??!! (As a side note I found the 2006 Madrid guidebook full of errors. I usually trust Lonely Planet guidebooks but this time it was full of outdated information and blatant errors.) During my stay in Madrid we also were in the Best Western Atlantico and The Holiday Inn. Both hotels which we have also reviewed on Tripadvisor under this username and can recommend without any hesitation. Save your money and do yourself a favour and stay away from the Best Western Trafalgar. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GENRAL TIP ABOUT PAYING FOR THINGS IN SPAIN Be aware that many retailers in Spain will ask you for your passport, identity card or driving license if you pay for something with a debit or credit card. However, I managed just with a photocopy of my passport so keep this mind if you don't want to risk losing your ID by having it with you all the time. ...", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, NY", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Al-Burj", "ReviewID": "UR5942960", "Content": "This hotel is in a safe, clean, neighborhood in Madrid.
