Going into this resort we were privileged guests. lets start off with the first day. overall it wasn't to bad nice beach good food ok rooms... and as the days progressed everything started getting worse. everyday there was the exact same food, the beach started getting filled with algae. the overall look of it wasn't to bad as far as a resort goes. Now if your going on vacation to relax and get some sleep like most people would, it is almost very impossible. every night i was there i got maximum 3-4hrs of sleep. the first couple of days i was there, there was a car parked outside that's alarm wouldn't stop going off at night. this was ironic because our room was near the beach as most privalaged guests rooms were.then all the other nights someones alarm would go off in the other rooms. Another thing about the rooms was for privileged guests you would get internet in your room but it was to slow that it was just like having no internet at all.secondly the maid didn't come and clean the rooms for the first couple of days. Another thing i hated about this resort is that you would LITERALLY have to get up at 4:00AM to go reserve a spot on the beach otherwise you would have to stand up, all the spots were takin by 5:00am. this is mainly a euapean resort meaning the vast majority of people who went there spoke either French or Italian. NO GUESTS spoke English and very few workers did. The service was ok depending on the day. in terms of activity's, outside on a buliten board it said archery, soccer... and the times and days it could be played, i went to the place where they held these activitys at the correct times and nobody was there which means the activitys people were not serious at all.the worst part of this vacation was that my father and I both got sick at this resort and no other resort in Mexico which tells you a lot about the cleanliness of the resort. and finally when we left to go back home we had to walk and carry our luggage from our rooms to the front desk which wouldn't be so bad if the trip from the 2 places wasn't 1.5km. if you have any further question about the resort email me at walrusozzy@hotmail.com", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuperb beach, average to poor everything else\u201d", "Author": "Peter M", "ReviewID": "UR126581597", "Content": "We've just returned from our trip to the Mayan Riviera after spending 7 days at this hotel. This was our fifth visit to the peninsula and expected no big surprise at arrival. As compared to other hotels we stayed before, I've found Catalonia Playa Maroma as a Retro stylish one, with furniture from the '80s, luggage carried by hand and even the architectural style telling the story of this 'maybe' pioneer hotel in the area The average age of tourists is 60, a French or Spanish speaking senior citizen. The few younger families that venture have two, or three young children up to 6 years. We were the exception. Our teenager son had nobody to play with, nor to chat as you find very few English speaking people even among the tourists Food is good, but don't expect variety. For beverage, the cocktails are average, the \"house wine\" is good (both white and red Spanish dry are excellent), but the beer is poor quality. They serve that poor quality beer even when you ask for a Corona My impression was that the resort is understaffed as they barely kept up with duties such as room cleaning, Bar and Restaurant services. All open late and close early. We used the Spa once for a massage session, a mistake that my wife remembered for a few days as a back pain. I don't think they employ professional massage therapists though they charge you similar prices to Toronto for that service Although we payed for a privileged package I did not feel getting any special treatment compared to other tourists except for the room located in a building near to the beach. At least I could still find some decent spots on the beach at 6:30 AM The Maroma beach naturally superb. It is one of the main attractions of this hotel. Activities on the beach are quite limited. If you're skilled in one of Spanish, French, or Italian you may also enjoy some team play organized on the beach.

I hesitate to comment on the food, since this is such a subjective issue. We thought it was fine, not outstanding. We previously had stayed at the El Dorado Maroma, and like the beach area better at CPM. The seaweed and garbage that washes on the shore detracts from the beach area, but the sight of the water is heavenly. The weather never seems to be as good on the Caribbean side as the Pacific side. The resort itself is quaint and beautiful, and other than poor lighting, our privileged room was beautiful.

We've been to Riviera Maya 6 times, and also 5 other areas in Mexico for a total of 15 beach vacations, so we've stayed in all types of resorts ranging from rustic to luxury (we love all kinds), so I can be objective in my review. I cannot stress this enough - this hotel is for families with lots of small children - I've never seen so many at any resort - couples will wish they had gone to an adults only. Resort is 75% Italian, 20% French Canadian, with the last 5% English speaking Canadians and Americans. I actually liked that I couldn't understand what people were saying, because when it was so noisy with all the talking, I could zone it out. We, along with other guests we spoke to, agreed, this hotel belongs to the Italians - I felt like I was intruding on their territory, because everything is geared towards them, which is great for them, not so much for anyone else. Although, I have to say the coffee and pasta were the best we've had at a resort, so I've got to say that their influence was positive in that way. Rooms: We were upgraded for free to Privilege in Bldg. 6. Beds were very comfortable for Mexico, so we slept well. Bathrooms were ok. Tiling in shower and floor were dirty and black with mold - needs to be regrouted, otherwise, I like that it felt like old Mexico. Closets were nice. No nice view on balcony in any room, so don't expect it, but that's not important to me. Pool: Awful, awful, awful. Way too small for the amount of people. It was more of a kiddy pool and the water was always cloudy unless you got in it at 8 a.m. Some Italians and French don't believe in pool diapers and some go in naked. It was hard to find a spot for yourself without being splashed or knocked in the head with a ball. Plus the noise level was so annoying with all the kids and loud parents. Then the loud music starts with the animation team doing their thing - there was no place to escape the constant noise - unless it was lunchtime and the pool was quiet. We also had to save a chair by 6 a.m. if we wanted shade. Beach: It had the prettiest color water in Mexico. During our 2 wk. stay it was too wavey to go in - saw a child being rescued from the current by another guest - don't know where the parents were. I walked the beach every day which was nice, but there was a constant large amount of seaweed(?) washed ashore, which made it difficult to walk. The other two flanking resorts were very diligent in raking, but Catalonia lacked the staff or just didn't care - looked trashy. The clumps of seaweed attracted some kind of sand flees and flies, which could explain all the bites I got. We also had to save a chair in the shade by 6 a.m. If you don't like to see topless older women and naked children, don't go here. Also, we witnessed naked children using the sand as their bathroom and the mothers who encouraged them to do so out in the open for everyone to see, didn't even cover up the sand after they were done - disgusting and disturbing. Restaurants: As most have said, nothing special, which is expected in Mexico. We didn't go hungry, but we've had better. Tables were nicely covered with cloths, but the chairs were always sticky and dirty - again, need more staff. My husband had tummy troubles after the 4th day, and I had the same 3 days before we left (bring Pepto). We never get sick at Mexican resorts, but we did at this one. My husband saw kids grab french fries, drop them on the floor and then put them back in the pan. We saw people licking their fingers, then using the utensils to serve themselves at the buffet - sanitary it was not. I always serve with my right hand, eat with my left if using my fingers, which is why I never get sick at buffets - didn't help this time. Also, food was never hot. I do have to say some of the pastries were very good and my husband enjoyed the crepes. Baked chicken was always good, too, at the buffet. Breakfast was almost a comedy with the bacon. As soon as the pan was put out, in 5 min. it was empty. I never saw anything like it. People would pile it on their plates and leave it empty for anyone else. Most of the time it was barely cooked, but when it was done right, it was good. All my husband wanted were 2 pieces to go with his eggs and he mostly had to do without it. One time, we sat at a table where I could see when they replaced the empty pan and I told him \"Quick, he just put some out - go now!\" We called it the \"Bacon Watch.\" Grounds: Not as pretty as other resorts - not many flowers. The courtyards where the rooms are had the best landscaping. The walkway to the buffet was very nice and enjoyable. I thought it was a nice stroll, unlike some who complained it was too long - it took maybe 5 min. to walk from your room. The coatis were so cute along the path in the a.m. - who couldn't love those cute faces as you walked by, especially the babies. Service: Was fine and they all were so nice. They need more staff in the buffet, because they work so hard and are on the go constantly, but can't keep up with the crowds. This resort has too many guests for the property. We can see where they added rooms in the past, which tells us this resort was never meant for this many people. It was nice to get away and enjoy the warm weather. We made the best of what we could, but I would never go back (getting sick is bad, which is why I gave it the rating I did), nor would I recommend it to anyone....unless you are Italian and French with lots of very small children. animation team who", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reisterstown, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFood poisoned at Terrace restaurant\u201d", "Author": "Luiba G", "ReviewID": "UR125518265", "Content": "For the second time we\u2019ve enjoyed staying in your resort.

We have stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso, Iberostar Tucan, Barcelo, Palladium, Paradisus, Bahia Principe - some of these hotels several times. We chose the Catalonia based on the beach and we did not want a mega resort this year. Beach: beautiful, sandy bottom, no rocks , could walk for miles. Flat for walking. warm water in the ocean. Pool: quite ordinary based on other resorts. Gardens: very pleasant to see green bushes, some bougainvillea, and hibiscus. Not as landscapped as other properties , a little more natural. Rooms: we asked for connecting rooms and we received them. The beds are the most comfortable we slept on in Mexico. Bathroom is dated but spotlessly clean. Lovely white, clean towels and lots of hot water. Mini fridge with two beers and some soft drinks. Three bottles of water a day. We stayed in the privilege secton. Privilege: I don't know the difference between the privilege rooms and regular rooms. Some told us there is no ironing board and iron in the regular rooms. We did not need an ironing board and iron. As part of privilege we could eat at the Tapas restaurant for free , one time for dinner and for lunch every day. The lunch was ok - the view from this restaurant is beautiful. We had a ground floor room building 4 close to the beach with a beautiful, large terrace. We put all 4 chairs on the terrace and could sit there in the morning or evening. No bugs, not an ant or any bug at all. Staff: this hotel has lovely ,polite staff. All of them. Balthazar at the beach bar, with Juan, another lovely fellow whose name I cannot remember. Cesare at the lobby bar, a lovely little waitress whose name I cannot recall. Our room was cleaned promptly every day. We had turn down service one night only but this is not an issue for us. Food: this is the biggest challenge! The main buffet is fine for breakfast. There are eggs, pancakes, french toast, omlettes, sweet rolls, fruit. However the quality of the food is not amazing. Some of the food was just plain tasteless. French toast that had no flavour, not properly cooked, pastries that were often not worth the calories. However some days the items were good and some days not. The waiters have a hard time coping, the tables do not get cleaned quickly, coffee is not hot or tasty. Even the capacinos and espresso was sometimes very ordinary. Some days no bananas, no watermelon, instead they had tinned fruit in syrup. Fruit salad obviously made from the left over fruits. Bacon not always cooked but fatty and greasy. We did not eat lunch at the main buffet. The beach buffet is just gross. Old dried up hamburgers and not cooked hot dogs. Inferior quality cold cuts at both the beach and main buffet. Only sliced cheddar or mexican cheese. No hard cheeses, blue cheese or brie. A la cartes: Italian : nice choice and not bad food but all served cold - not tepid but cold. You did not need to reserve but just give you name in the line up and wait to be called. The manager Fabio would take some guests first even if they put their name in after you...... this was irritating and we told him so. Tapas: we were 4 and everything we choose was not good - some actually inedible. We even paid $80.US for the lobster which was inedible. Rough and tough and cold. Could not be removed from the shell. Mexican: not bad food but not hot. Steakhouse: cold baked potatoe, I requested a filet well done and it was blue and cold. The others had steak that had flavour but cold. Drinks: they do have brands i.e. Finlandia vodka, Sauza tequilla, Bacardi rum. You need to to ask for the brand or you will get the hooch. Drinks are not strong but you could always ask for more alchool. This did not bother us. No olives for a vodka martini, no cosmopolitan, no scotch, if you like a sophisticated drink you will not get one here. Some evenings no Baileys. My mother does not drink but likes a Baileys in the evening. Sometimes the restaurants had it sometimes not. This was the least pleasant dining experience of all our travels. We pride ourselves on being able to choose something from every menu and like to keep it simple . We were challenged. In all this is a beautiful resort with a divine beach. We had a lovely holiday with beautiful sunshine. The hotel is spotlessly clean. Guests: they are mostly from Europe. A very casual crowd. No one dresses for dinner - older mean wearing shorts and cropped pants. There is no dress code in any of the restaurants. The Europeans keep to themselves. The ones we spoke to were very polite and pleasant. We are fluent in French and English and I understand some Italian and speak some Spanish. We found the animators very pleasant , especially Johnny a very nice man who talked to everyone.

Taken to our room by a very friendly Bellman who made sure our room was set up properly. Rooms, we were in a privilege room and could not have asked for anything better much appreciation to Judi for this special room. King bed, large dressing area and seperate toilet shower area. You do not have to live out of your suitcase since the room has two large drawers as well as one in the night stand. In the dressing area large closet with shelves, safe and bonus two large drawers by the sink, much easier than digging in a toiletry bag.Great large balcony with wicker chairs and small table.

My hat off to the maintenance crew for keeping these areas beautiful. Food, yes the buffet is where you will be eating breakfast, thanks Noemi for your smile as you greeted us, maybe a few lunches and a few dinners, Privilege gives you three al-a-cartes and 1 Tapas per week. Never had a problem with any of the food, as they have theme nights so good variety. Al-a-cartes this is where they excell good all around but the Italian was our favourite,Fabio (mgr) Alejandro & Roberto you guys are awesome you always were prof, courteous, and above all Excellent you will always be remembered. Tapas what a location above the beach/pool bar overlooking the beach with very good food. The Mexican & Steak house were good as well. Lunch can be had at main buffet,steakhouse (limited selection) Creperie by pool/beach bar, and Tapas terrace (Privilege only) Bars, Excellent service.

All the wait staff were good but these guys were the stand outs. Baltazar was always quick with a drink or a smile. Animation Crew, well we did not do any shows as we were up at dawn and on the beach all day, but there were always some type of games going on during the day where they would get you to join in. Jhonny(thats the way he spells it) he was always quick with a smile or joke and good at listening to these loco gringos and helped make our holiday special. they have a couple come in to sing a couple of times a week, pretty good, but the band on Wednesday these guys are awesome musicians, wish you would be ther more often ( dance by the pool) THE BEACH what can I say we have been to this area quite a few times in the last few years and I have often said the Corona commercial had to have been shot in Cuba or D.R. but I have finally found it MAROMA BEACH, no rocks for miles, swimming with Angel Fish around you and that warm Carribean Water.

The maids did a great job cleaning and organizing our things everyday, along with towel art everyday as well. The only thing was that they came to our room at 10pm for towel service. I guess that was our fault for forgetting to put the do not disturb sign on our door though.\u00a0 We spent most of our time on the beach, which was amazing. There is a separate side for privilege guests with some palapas, although there we non privilege people on our side. Oh and the towel game...i had to be down at the beach by 6am to get a palapa, I don't agree with it and I felt bad doing it, but if you want a palapa at all that day.. It's the only way. The first time I played the game a European couple stole our palapa.. I wasn't impressed, but what can you do. \u00a0The beach was very clean, there was a bit of seaweed but the staff did a great job at trying to keep it cleaned up.\u00a0 The pool was... Well a pool.. There we separate areas which was nice, kinda kept the kids in one area. It was always clean. Yes there aren't very many beds at the pool though.\u00a0 We met an amazing bartender at the pool/beach bar. Juan! He was amazing to us our whole stay, always friendly and very attentive. There was only one other guy a the pool bar who was great, but didn't get his name,, Juan took care of us mostly. The other ones were not friendly, didn't smile and definitely didn't know how to make a drink, unless they were pouring beer. Yes they are weak if you don't ask for them stronger. We would ask for an apple martini or a cosmo or anything else and you would get something totally different. Oh and we did have a problem with one of the bartenders coming on the beach taking drink orders and not returning a couple of times, even if we tipped him. \u00a0One night we wanted some beer to bring back to our rooms... Well even as priviledge guests we were not allowed to do that... So the boys just ordered 5 beer each sat at the pool for a couple minutes then walked to our rooms.. The lobby bar was okay, we didn't go there much for drinks if we did we would just get a beer. It's called the tequila bar, well it shouldn't be called that. They have only 3 types of tequila(same as pool bar) sauza special, hornitos and eljimador, which was the best kind you can get... Pretty sad. My boyfriend is a huge tequila connaseur and wasn't impressed.\u00a0 We would go there every morning for an espresso with baileys which was awesome! The girls there were friendly and always trying to make jokes. They were very good trying to explain in English with us :) ... We didn't go to the lobby after supper because it was always packed full of people. \u00a0Oh... The wine at the lobby bar is watered down big time... Not impressed.\u00a0 Alright now onto the restaurants... Buffet, was usually great with great service. There was always tons to choose from. Breakfast half the time didn't have any meat, except chicken thighs(not really breakfast meat for me) when there was ham or sausage. Of course the scrambled eggs were never cooked, but usual in plAces like this. We got an omlette every morning, which were amazing! \u00a0Lunch and supper there was always pizzas( tasted kinda funny), pastas, a couple meat choices, rice, salads, nachos, \u00a0potatos( which were rarely cooked through) \u00a0etc... Anyone can find something there to have a decent meal :)... The staff were usually great bringing water and drinks.. Once I had to go up and get my own water from their stand... I was half done my meal and still never got acknowledged. \u00a0A few times it did take quite a while to get drinks. One breakfast the guy finally came and I asked for coffee... I guess he was waiting for some being made... But then when he did get it I saw him filling upeveryone else's cups that JUST sat down and then finally filling mine last once I was done my meal... I used to waitress and that's just not right... Oh the wine was also very watered down here as well... The only place the wine wasn't was at the a la carte restaurants.. Tapas terrace was awesome!! \u00a0I've never ate tapas style before.. I tried things I never would normally and was so impressed. Service was wonderful there. \u00a0We ate there for lunch a few times, I loved the calamari, Caesar salad, nachos and wings were great. No complaints.\u00a0 Italian restaurant. Was so impressed. Our waiter didn't speak English really at all, but did a great job! \u00a0I had Alfredo and chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese,,, yummy! Pastas are also homemade here!! Oh a funny thing was they brought us a mini appetizer between meals, we didn't quite know what it was... Well it was a little chunk of hot dog! Lol \u00a0good hot dog mind you :) Steakhouse... NOT impressed. Our waiter never smiled. But did a great job serving us. Everything was fine until I got my \"new York steak\" I asked for it medium. Well it came and it was barely half an inch thick, 1/3 of it was a huge hunk of fat. Oh and it was very well done. I wanted to return it but the people I \u00a0Was with wouldn't allow me to, so my freind switched me for hers which was the same but a bit rarer. It looked like a minute steak.. Don't call it a steakhouse if that's what your going to serve for your steak. \u00a0My boyfreind got the ribs which were amazing!! Mexican restaurant. It was okay. I agree someone else's comment that it was lacking flavor for Mexican food. But no real complaints. Our waiter was very friendly and bubbly!! The walkway isn't nearly as long as people complain about, they must be overweight or lazy. Would not recommend for elderly that aren't very mobile. It was about 2-5 minutes MAX!! It was actually a nice walk! \u00a0Yes there were ALOT of Europeans, we didnt really have a problem with them, they are no different from anyone else except their language. Anyone can be rude or ignorant. I actually had more of a problem with the Americans making rude comments, or making fun of the mexicans right in front of them. Or just being obnoxiously loud in the restaurants. \u00a0Also people don't tip, remember minimum wage here is only about $4 a day! Some of these people work very very hard to serve and please you.. Acknowledge it! \u00a0One american couple made a comment \u00a0to us ' we are at an all-inclusive, we don't carry money with us!!!\" then laughed. We tipped 100 pesos which is about $10 for the 4 of us at each a la carte, which they greatly appreciated and deserved.\u00a0 Oh also night entertainment wasn't very good \u00a0although only watched about 20mins one night. It was held a the theater which is separate from the bar, which I didn't like. \u00a0Entertainment was usually in different languages but if you were English and were partaking they would translate to all languages... \u00a0 Anyways, I hope this review was helpful! :)", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Trip!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Alex L", "ReviewID": "UR124544757", "Content": "One of the best, most accommodating places we've ever been, and we travel a lot.

This is extremely important to know: You are given vouchers to eat at the restaurants. We were booked to stay there for seven nights, and the amount of vouchers we received were 3!!! Which meant for the other 4 nights we were forced to eat at the buffet. We felt this was a total scam and NOT okay. This alone was enough to make us not want to return. 2. The resort needs to be updated. This might be a little picky, complaining that the resort did not seem \"fresh\" enough, but after staying at Ocean Coral and Turquesa in November, we just assumed that this resort would have the same clean, new look. Unfortunately it was disappointing. The pool is a HUGE disappointment. It is just ugly. Concrete and unappealing water. That is not how a resort pool should be. The restaurants (except for Buffet) are close to the pool and beach, and all in this round circle thing. Ugly. But it does offer outside seating which is nice. This is a minor con, but if you are really looking for something super new feeling do not go here. If that does not matter, then go - it was dirty, the grounds were well kept. 3. Ants. There were ants in our bathroom and right beside our bed. Very small ones, but still - you are on vacation, this is not something you should have to be thinking about. We were told that ants are just a part of their lives, but even so - I am paying to stay at a resort, and I certainly do not expect bugs to be in my room no matter how small. However - they were very good about coming in and spraying which they did very thoroughly. 4. They need new beach chairs. The first three I sat in were broken or extremely saggy. Just a minor annoyance, but worth mentioning. 5. The buffet is by the lobby, which is fine. However, it is \"outside\" meaning it is simply humid and moist. If the restaurant is going to be no where near the water or anything attractive, just put it inside with some air conditioning so the food does not look soggy and the cheese isn't sweating. It made eating very unappealing. Pros: 1. The beach is unbelievable. The water is crystal clear - everything you dream the Caribbean to be like. 2. The staff is always ready to help, very friendly. 3. The steak house and the Italian are very good. Just stick with those two as long as you can. For those of you who are \"privileged guests,\" the Tapas was not great. Overall the resort needs a refreshing. If it was updated everything would be fine - since they have a prime location. The resort is not as big as everyone makes it sound. If one is elderly it might not be ideal because the buffet is next to the lobby, which is the farthest from the beach. I would not go back here at all, mostly because it is so unfair to be paying that money and then have such limited food choices. Maybe this is mentioned and I did not see this before booking, but finding out upon arrival was not pleasing. Also, being booked as a privilege guest did not mean you got a better room. The only difference it meant was that you could got one more voucher for dinner (to the Tapas restaurant) and access to that same restaurant for lunch. Honestly, this was the only thing that made the experience a little better because that restaurant was on the water, the closet to the beach and outside!! It was a gorgeous view. However, at dinner, you are forced to eat inside unless you are paying for a lobster dinner in which case you get to eat outside. You also have access to a privilege lobby, which is just a tiny room where you can get the same sort of buffet snacks and some computers to work on. We ended up being upgraded to their sister resort in Tulum because they overbooked. Thank goodness!! It was significantly better. If we had stayed seven nights at Catalonia Playa Maroma we would have been fine, because hey - its vacation, and its nice to be somewhere warm with beautiful water!

This hotel, while living up to expectations as far as rooms, cleanliness, beach etc. has issues with accommodating either single women or groups. To begin with, I had to pay for 2 persons in order to get a room. I understand that I have to pay for a room even though only one is using it. My issue is that only 1 was using the all inclusive, yet I had to pay for 2 people. There was no single price. Upon arrival, my room was on another floor and the other side of the building from the other 4 rooms in our group. The \"Privileged\" check in promised me another room the next day. So at noon, I left my room understanding I had to wait until 3 for my new room. At 3:30 I had to insist that they give me a better located room. Finally my vacation could begin! My next issue is with the specialty restaurants. At the Terrace they were able to seat all 9 of us, but it was down hill from there. The Italian restaurant could only seat us at a table for 4 and a table for 5, and they were at opposite sides of the restaurant. The Steakhouse said they MAY be able to seat us together at 9:30, when it was 6:30 at the time. We gave up on the restaurants and ate all our meals at the Buffet, where Miguel the waiter had no problem handling all 9 of us in one seating.

We could not believe how hard they work to make sure guests are having fun, offering everything from yoga classes, Spanish lessons, salsa dancing, to volleyball competitions, relay races, to pilates. They did this all day then had a one hour break to eat- would run to the theatre and put on a Cirque du soleil quality spectacular each night complete with contortionism, dances and hilarious clown acts! Amazing. And of course I am NOT the kind of person who would think that this would be high on my list of priorities for what makes a vacation great- but it REALLY made it GREAT. The kids club people were fantastic. We are not the kind of people who drop off our kids, but were happy to hang out at the kids club to get out of the high noon sun. They had a nice shaded playground and fun activities to keep the kids busy for those 2 hours of harsh sun. And when my daughter got a little sun burn- one of the gardeners hand delivered us a huge aloe vera branch within minutes, for us to help cool her skin down!! Everyone from concierge to the maids to the beach staff was always smiling and always friendly- REALLY incredible!!! The Beach- breathtaking, fantastic! Pools- incredible! Food: creperie and cappacinos- yum!!, Buffet- was good, not great, but good. the 3 restaurants on site- don't bother - was poor- only thing we complained about. Another note on food. All we REALLY look for in Mexico when we travel- is the really great tasting flame broiled meats- which we got here, GREAT guacamole- thick and chuncky- which we DID not find here. Great salsa- which we did find here. And GREAT ceviche chuck full of shrimp etc- which we did not find here. so over all food is the only thing I considered deducting a star for, but since everything else was so crazy incredible- we let it slide. If you are a hard core foodie- you may not be thrilled. The Rooms- AMAZING! The Cost- we booked travelocity and got a GREAt package- so for us it was EXTREMELY affordable. As far as the reviews that this place is very international and not for Americans?? First of all I LIKe that Americans are the minority there- hello that is why one travels internationally to go somewhere new with different people and experiences! Everyone spoke English- we never had a problem, and scraped by with the minimum Spanish and Italian that we collectively knew, in the rare instances when someone like the maid didn't understand us. So pretentious for people to expect everyone in a foreign country to speak English! Ease with kids: SO easy so incredible. Everyone UBER helpful. We took a direct flight from boston and were there. We didn't want to ever leave. Which is strange for us, since before kids my husband and I were the total backpacker types- traveling in Japan, India, etc. One thing I will say is that they do the usual thing since you are somewhat stuck there- where they try to rip you off on taxi fare. It's a good idea- to do what we did, find a good taxi driver in Playa Del Carmen and negotiate a cheap fare back to your hotel, then ask him if he'd be willing to be your can driver for the trip and call him when you need him. The hotel wasn't thrilled that we did this, but we did save a ton of cash. Anyway we Highly reccomned it!!

This year we traveled with nine people and chose the Catalonia because of other reviews. The hotel knew ahead of time how many were in our group. As we entered the dirt road filled with many pot holes leading into the hotel, not a good first impression, but once there it was beautiful. We proceeded to check in and was told only 2 rooms were ready. Our luggage was put into the two rooms and we went for a bite to eat and wonder around the facilities. Beach was beautiful and so was the pool. Finally, the rest of our rooms were ready. My husband and I proceeded to our room only to find other people in the room wanting to change their room to ours, what if our bags were already in it? Not happy about that. Anyway, the room was nice overlooking the court yard. We had 4 special restaurants to go to plus the buffet. First time we were all accomadated and able to eat together. Next time at the Italian one, we sat 4 & 5 far away from one another, they could not get us together or close but the head person had no problem seating 15 together since they were his friends. The Steak house wanted us to come back at 9:15 and then they could possibly seat us near one another, yet there was parties of 7 or more seated together. We ate at the buffet and never had a problem since the waiters got to know us, as we tipped, and always went out of there way for us. We only met a handful of English speaking people and they were always happen to hear someone they could speak with, mostly rude French people were there and yes, they were rude. We made the best of everything though. Get seats early in the morning at beach and pool as they filled up quickly. The beach and pool bartenders were very nice, all the male staff was excellent, the females always had an attitude or seem annoyed if you even spoke or aked them anything. We did 2 excursions to Tulum and Xel Cha which were great. Too bad the other people on the buses back had comments as to the road back to our hotel, they thought we were staying in a low budget area. If you want to keep the road natural, at least fix the pot holes! Nightly entertainment was good but the long walk from our rooms to the lobby was tiring as we had to walk there twice a day just to get to the buffet or lobby bar, disco and theatre. This hotel does not take any American dollars anywhere on the property, they told us it had to do with some Mexican law. Our bus driver told us that was not true as other hotels all took American dollars. None of the bars had any bar stools except the disco with 5 stools. All in all we did manage a good time as we were on vacation together but none of us will be back.

Note that this is our 5th vacation in various parts of Mexico... Service: this was the high point of the resort for my wife and I. We received truly outstanding service everywhere we went at this resort. It\u2019s almost hard to believe how consistently good it was for us during our stay. It was so good we started taking names in an attempt to recognize everybody (which we did with a separate email to the resort). We\u2019ll mention a few here only to encourage you to be generous with your tips :) Juan (baggage at the front entrance) \u2013 he tracked down our camera after we left it in a cab, how good is that!! Each of our encounters with him was great. Deborah at the front desk \u2013 great. Johnny as part of the Animation team \u2013 basically acted as our tour guide for our stay \u2013 great. Ricardo the DJ \u2013 he\u2019ll play anything you want and always with a big smile on his face - great. The animation team works very hard to make sure there is something for everyone to participate in. We were constantly impressed with their energy as after a day at the pool/beach motivating everyone they put on a show in the evening like none I have seen at other resorts! The dancing, acting, costumes and set design was professional! Great! Great! Great! Rooms: we stayed in building 5 and our room was as expected (from the pictures, etc\u2026). No musty smell like we have encountered at other resorts which is a bonus. There was a coffee machine in the room (although we weren\u2019t expecting one from the room descriptions). Gilberto offered us a liter of milk from the buffet when we weren\u2019t able to buy any at the resort which we kept in the fridge in our room. Air conditioning worked well. There was always lots of hot water for a shower. Note that we looked at the Privileged rooms and declined the offer to upgrade. There are renovated \u201cPrivileged\u201d rooms in each of the buildings; however the renovation is mostly cosmetic, i.e. new furniture. The bathrooms/shower area in the room we saw was no different from the non-renovated room we were staying in. Note that some people will get these rooms at no extra charge if the building is at capacity (which it was when we were there). The cost of the Privileged room is an extra $20US per person per night (i.e. $280 US for the week). I will point out that the Privileged room does get you some extra services like the rooftop patio, and some other additional services etc\u2026 which we can\u2019t comment on because we were not able to use them. We simply chose not to upgrade but overall I think the extra $280 per week appeared to be a reasonable value for what you would get. Food: this is better than I would have expected in a resort at this price point. Nice variety in the buffets. We tried each of the restaurants and the food here is slightly better than the buffets. The Italian restaurant overall has the best atmosphere and is generally the most difficult to get into (we did observe some wait times). Each of the people we were with had different opinions about the food in each of the restaurants so we\u2019ll recommend you simply try them all. Resort: a lovely jungle setting quite different than any other resort we have stayed at \u2013 which are typically concrete from reception to beach. There are 400 guest rooms but you wouldn\u2019t know there are that many people because we were spread out with jungle in between. The Beach: an outstanding beach as others here have mentioned. The Pool: small but will not detract from your vacation. As others have mentioned the rule at this resort is first come first serve at the pool / beach chairs. It is not unusual for people to be out and about at 6:30AM \u2013 7AM securing their spots. There are however lots of spots, so if you are not too concerned about your location on the beach you should be fine at any time. Security: our vacation began just as the Mazatlan news hit \u2013 so we were a little anxious. However, we found that the security at the hotel was very good. There are gates that you must pass in order to leave or enter the resort. Number of guests and room numbers were given upon leaving and entering. As well, the hotel employees who call cabs for us write down that same information. The Guests: when we were at the resort it was about 50% North American, 50% European. There were no problems at all communicating with the staff. All of the front desk people speak English as do most of the Animation team. We simply did not see this as an issue. Communication: the resort is Wi-Fi enabled; there are also 3 computers that can be used for a charge ($6 for a half hour). When communicating back home we simply emailed our room # from the resort computers and had people back home call us at the resort at a specific time \u2013 the call always got through. Tipping: the Europeans do not generally tip apparently \u2013 I heard this from a few people. I want to stress that we did not receive great service because we tipped; I believe that great service at the resort is trained into the staff. I observed that the staff treated everyone equally. Anyway, we generally tipped in pesos, 20 pesos about every 2nd or 3rd trip to the bar for drinks, 20 pesos daily to the person who cleaned our room, 20 pesos on the table when we visited the buffet, 50 pesos to the wait staff when we visited restaurants, 20 pesos to baggage handlers, etc\u2026 We also tipped a few others who generally don\u2019t make tips, i.e. the Animation people on occasion, the DJ after a night of him playing whatever we requested. This was our preference and we went through maybe $100CDN total during our week stay. Well worth it if you recognize that some of the staff make as little as 50 pesos per day. Small bills can be difficult to find once at the resort, best to try and secure 20 peso denominations at a currency exchange prior to leaving (however there is a currency exchange on site at the resort \u2013 the rates did not seem bad at all \u2013 they just didn\u2019t carry a lot of small denominations). You can tip in US bills as well as we did on occasion. The new rule in Mexico makes it hard (mostly for businesses) to deposit large US denominations at the bank so there is generally a push away from US bills \u2013 but smaller denominations will still be readily accepted.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful beach and very clean resort, but felt a bit left out.\u201d", "Author": "PolishTraveller25", "ReviewID": "UR124020655", "Content": "I just got back from a week at the Catalonia Playa Maroma with my wife and our two friends. To make things easier I will present this review in short sections. Check-in - Was a breeze, we had upgraded to the privileged section and had our own separate check in area. Our room were not ready so we went and had some lunch. The privileged lounge (check in area) had two small laptops for our use. These came in handy to check in on our flight home at the end of the week. Room - We stayed in room 6213, a very nice, but standard resort room. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the selection of pillows in the closet was nice. Our balcony was pretty big, over looking the pool, but the pool was blocked from view by a large mangrove type hedge. The bathroom was small, a single sink and a separate toilet / shower stall. There was a LCD tv in the room with some good channels to watch. The most important part was that the room was always very very clean, even under the bed. Pool - The pool was pretty nice, with some very shallow areas and some pretty deep areas. Only used it twice in the evening when most of the people were gone. Beach - Well, the beach was beautiful. The sand like white flour, and not a rock or piece of coral to step on. Because the waves and wind were pretty strong all week, there was lots of seaweed on the shore. The staff tried to keep it clean, but just could not keep up. The water was super, a nice shade of blue and super warm. The waves were very fun to play in. If you wanted a shaded area to sit in then, sadly, you have to be at the beach pretty early in the morning. But there were plenty of non covered seats everywhere. Bars - The lobby bar was open 24 hours and had all sorts of drinks to choose from. Just ask for doubles, other wise you are drinking mostly mix. The espressos are very good and always made fresh for you. The \"pool\" area bar was also very good. The guy on the beach was also pretty well stocked. Cold beer everywhere. Entertainment - This was a rather sore spot with me. The animation teams are imported from Italy and France, with the third one being Mexican. English was very difficult to come buy, and unless you spoke Italian, French or Spanish you were pretty much ignored. Believe me, they tried to keep everyone entertained but without much success. The shows in the evening were rather lame. Usually, we ended up back at the lobby bar or in our room. The hotel does seem to cater more to the European crowd. Mind you, Catalonia is a Spanish resort chain. Not a big deal, bring some cards along. Food - Breakfast was always good, other then the fact that the bacon ran out on Tuesday morning and then no sausages the following morning. The fresh omelet and egg station was always a popular choice. Lunch - We ate lunch once in the main buffet, eh. Then the rest of the week we ate by the beach at the snack bar. Good soup and the usual hot dogs, burgers, fries and what not. One day we ate at the privileged snack bar, which is a la carte. It was fine, but the portions were not worth the wait. Dinner - We ate at all 3 a la cartes and were, for the most part happy with all of them. The Italian having the best service. Just show up before 18:30 if you want to eat at the steakhouse. They do not take reservations, first come, first served. The tapas restaurant was part of our privileged upgrade and definitely worth a visit, ask to try all of the tapas. Overall - The resort was under staffed. Had to wait to get served coffee and drinks during breakfast. And the poor bartenders were swamped. Credit to the workers, they did do there best.

The beach was absolutely beautiful and for that reason alone you should really take a visit to this hotel.

The rooms were fine, clean and comfortable. We were in building 6 as we paid extra for the Privileged room. This allows one night to experience Tappa's restaurant at no extra cost and you are also able to enjoy your lunch their each day in case you don't like the buffet option (overlooking the beautiful beach, only a Privilege Option ), you will be placed in the building closest to the beach, you have full free access to the computer lounge from 9-5 which is wonderful when trying to pre-book flight seats and converse with family back home. The staff are very accommodating to your requests and make every effort to keep you happy. The entertainment team were very nice...I loved Johny be Bad! Will miss you the most my friend! My only complaint might be the bar drinks and the wait at the buffet restaurant for coffee service.

We arrived at the resort at 9:00AM and went to check in. We were asked it we would like to upgrade for a cost. We thought a minute and decided to treat ourselves. We were told that our room would be ready at 1:30 seeing as how we just up graded to \"priviledged\". We changed and headed to the beach to lay down and relax. We went for lunch and returned to the front desk at 1:30, we were told to come back at 2:30, so off we went again to return at 2:30. at that time we were told to come back at 3:00 as our room was still not ready. Magically at 3:00 our room was ready. So we hauled our luggage to our up graded room which was beside our assigned room, (I peeked at our papers and saw the room we were suppose to have). We couldn't really see a difference between a regular room and this room, so I went to the Priviledge lounge and asked them if there was a list of what we were suppose to have. I had a laugh when I read the list. Honestly this is what they had on there for upgrades. A phone, a ceiling fan, air conditioning, TV, mini bar with 2 beer, hair dryer, mirror, iron and ironing board. slippers & robe and beach towels. There were other things on the list but these I thought were standard, as all the other all inclusives that we have gone to in Mexico had the basics. The beach is beautiful, but there was the on going, save a chair with your towel game going on, we headed to the beach at 10:00 a.m. and could hardly find a decent spot to spend the day, all the towel saved chairs were not used. One day I'm going to go to all the towel saved chairs, fold the towels and return them to the towel shack. One day we came back from the beach at 4:00 and our room had not been cleaned yet, about a hour later she came by to clean. Then at 10:00 pm there was a knock at our door, they wanted to know if we wanted some water. Good thing I wear PJ's. Food was okay, but we didn't think it was anything special. We did the a la carte's, they try hard and that's whats important.. In the buffet they have a \"special\" area for the priviledged, I guess that meant you have to fend for yourself, we tried that area twice and twice I had to get our own silverware, nakpins and drinks. No one came around to give us anything. The balance of the time we went to the \"regular\" part of the buffet and got great service. We went to one show and gave up, the whole thing was in Spanish and French. I understand that it would be in Spanish but we both felt that speaking English we were left out of a lot of things. A special note: If you go onto your patio, make sure the door is not closed tight as it locks, hubby went out to have coffee in the morning and got locked out. They DO NOT accept US dollars in their little shopping area, you can exchange your US at the front desk for a fee and then go to the shopping centre. Go figure.

Was in line at the main lobby check-in for 20 minutes when the bell boy checked our hotel voucher and then took us and other \"privileged\" guests to the privileged check-in. Waited again for about 20 minutes and told to come back at 3pm as rooms not ready. We kinda expected this so went to the pool/beach bar a had a couple drinks. Room: stayed in building 6 in a corner room. Huge balcony and room very spacious. Yes the bathroom is a little dated as others say, but it was very clean, and maid service was very good. Always clean towels/towel art, and fridge always refilled. Bed was very comfortable and A/C worked fine. Food: Main buffet was very good for all meals. If you can't find something to eat, you must be too picky. Kinda took a while to get a coffee in the morning, but when they brought it, staff always pleasant. Went to all the a la carts. The Tapas was the best, the Mexican and Italian good, and the Steakhouse was good but the service was very slow. At lunch time we used the Tapas snack bar to eat. This is for privileged guests only. Never had to wait for a table, and food very good. The general snack bar was ok, but we preferred the Tapas at lunch. It is a long walk to main buffet for lunch if you are at the pool or beach. Pool: very nice pool and shallow and deep sections. It is very clean and it has a gradual slope for getting in and out. No steps so nice. Beach: Very beautiful beach. There is a lot of seaweed that washes up on the beach every day, but staff rake it up early every morning. It was windy a lot while we were there, so more than normal seaweed washing up. The resort was full while we were there, so if you wanted a spot with shade at the pool or the beach, you had to play the towel game. Shows: typical for Caribbean resorts, but the Madonna show was very good. Staff; very friendly and always smiling, whether you left a tip or not. We did not see a lot of tipping going on, but they were grateful when you left them one. There are very few English speaking guests at this resort. Mostly Europeans. The main lobby bar/buffet is a good 5 minute walk down the center of the resort. It was like walking through the jungle. Lots of Coatis crossing the path. The Coatis are willing to share the path, but a lot of guests are rude and almost force you into the woods!!

The beach bar durring the day war a joke from all the other resorts including 3 stars, they were not interested in serving you and acted like they were not happy with having to, with exception to the beach bar at night, they had a young guy in there that was so friendly and happy and the service from him was so good we left the majority of our tips with him because of the friendliness. We are not fussy people but every time we went into the buffet they would come up to us and ask us if we would like something to drink and when I would say a beer please in their language they never brought it in the 7 days we were there, I would have to get it myself, which was fine with me but they seemed upset that I did that. The entertainment staff is a waste all I seen them do was upset people on the beach, for example on 2 occasions I saw an older man laying in the sun and relaxing and they would come up and rub a stick on his face and he thought it was a bug and would get upset and leave, not sure why they do this.The alacarts were impossible to get into and you could not reserve so we never got into one. The resort is a very long road in to the resort so if you want to take a celectivo it will take an hour at least to get to the main road which leaves taxi at 22 us the only option into Play del carmen. We have gone done to this area for years and in my opinion this was the worst trip I have been on. They triedto keep the beach clean but outside the resort the beach was so littered with garbage it looked like a garbage truck left a thick trail approximatly 2m wide for miles. I was so amazed and disgusted I took pictures of what looked tike mostly plastics that would constantly wash up on the shores that were not maintained.The resort was mostly europeons :( I believe I have taken my last trip here.Sorry if I sound so negative but I just want you to Know how we felt and we are not fussy people", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointed\u201d", "Author": "OntarioViking", "ReviewID": "UR123561939", "Content": "This was our second trip to Catalonia Playa Maroma (Jan. 11-18, 2012) our first trip was last January.

For a really relaxing time and to be on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, this is the place. The hotel has a nice layout, very lush and not too big. Beautifully coloured buildings. Very clean facilities, from the hotel down to our room. They really try their darn best to keep the area clean and tidy. Check in and out was a breeze. Was very lucky to be upgraded to A Honeymoon suite - totally unexpected but very much appreciated. Mostly European guests, but for me, it was a welcome treat. Felt like I was somewhere in Europe. Yes, English was hardly spoken because a lot of them speak mostly French and Italian but I didn\u2019t have a problem at all.

The shuttle service had been discontinued. It\u2019s dirt road from the hotel to the highway and just remember to follow the power lines when walking to hotel at night. Bring a flashlight.

The first note is that this hotel is no where near where it maps out to on google. It is in the jungle! You are at least a 20 mins taxi ride to Playa del Carmen and at least 45 minutes from many of the attractions (snorkeling, ruins). I think I had an idea about this but didn't mind since it forced us to sit on the beach and relax, but my husband was a bit shocked. The entranceway is modest but welcoming compared to some other resorts we saw down here. The lobby is beautiful and the people mostly speak english and we knew enough spanish for the two of us to get by. The service, btw, was above and beyond fantastic. The staff are helpful and happy to work and do whatever they can to make your stay enjoyable. There were constantly staff in the gardens, and woods, as well as cleaning the grounds. The guests are mostly european, and we saw a few things that surprised us a bit (girls as old as 10 or 12 without tops on, an older woman topless, a little boy directed by his mother to pee into the garden, right off the walkway, men in speedos)- not good or bad, just different. I do not feel that we were treated any different because we were american, we were just a minority and really didn't find anyone to talk to. The playa or beach is beautiful, crystal clear water with little white fishes swimming around, and we were able to walk and run at least a mile and a half in both directions, which was great, although some of the empty beaches are not as well kept up and could use a school or something to come in and clean up all the garbage. The sunrises are gorgeous, too, by the way, so make sure to catch at least one. The room was clean and very nicely done. The bathroom was clean, although the shower was kinda small and not well ventilated. I slept great, but my husband did not sleep so good. The final morning we woke up and he had a dozen or more bug bites all over his body. I hope they were not bed bugs (nothing bit me), we got home and washed everything, but three days later, and he is still horribly affected. Might've been just one angry mosquito, or chiggers? We slept through dinner one night, so we only got to the italian, mexican and tapas restaurants, as well as the buffet (la pajarito) for breakfast and lunch and the grill for lunch (buffet). I thought the buffet breakfast was FANTASTIC, a wide array of yummy food, freshly baked goods and fruit juices. The lunch was pretty good and I was surprised to see grouper and leg of lamb among hamburgers and cheeseburgers. However, one day, at the Pajarito for lunch, they decided to empty the cesspool or something during lunch hour. The smell wafted over and grew unbearable, we had to leave. Isn't there any other time to do that? For dinner, I thought the mexican restaurant was Pretty Darn Good and the service was excellent. I think it was our favorite, but my husbands grouper won out over my fajitas I think. The Italian restaurant was standard and Good. Nothing off the charts but I did enjoy my lasagna. For our last night (after the night when a day of snorkeling wiped us out and we slept clear through dinner!), we went to the tapas restaurant, which i think was included with the privileged upgrade, otherwise its $15 usd pp. I thought it was great, although most of the time, I forgot what I was eating by the time it came out. My husband was a little less sure of the tapas thing (multiple mini plates - three bite sized appetizers each, an entree and three bite sized desserts), but I think he enjoyed it also. The property, like i said, is beautiful and very well maintained. It is a long property with 7 or 8 sections (we stayed in Tikal, facing the woods, very private, first floor w/ a jacuzzi). There is quite a bit of wildlife and plantlife here (coatis, various birds, just please don't feed the darned coatis!). Because the property is so long, there are many people for a relatively narrow spot of beach, so the chairs are six rows deep and people get out there pretty early for the prime spots. Most of the day, however, you could find some chairs here and there if you are a late riser. It is sortof like a cruise in that there are scheduled activities and things to do all day. Which is great, esp for teenagers, but, like someone else pointed out, I actually didn't hear any of these in english, so we didn't really get into it. On Thursday, our last day for relaxation on the beach, was interrupted by an hour and a half of the \"Olympidades\" which was fun for the teens and young adults, basically silly games and obstacles or something. But it was LOUD BLASTING MUSIC, frequently interrupted by the MC yelling out (spanish? italian?) Not even my ipod could drown them out, and we were pretty far from the action. I could barely focus on my book (although my husband napped through it all, lol) We also visited the spa. It is pretty small and we went early for the \"hydrotherapy\" and found two small rooms (steam and sauna) and a medium sized jacuzzi (please enter by the stairs! There are no signs but there are no seat around the edge, like you'd expect from any other jacuzzi you have ever been in in the whole world, and some of the lights under the water were out, we watched a guy totally fall into the jacuzzi trying to step onto a not existent step. There really should be signs up or something!) We sat in the jacuzzi and watched a couple get massages, thinking, man I hope they don't give us that room! The couples massage room was in full view of the jacuzzi and everyone just sits there and watches (because, well, what else is there to look at?) Including when the girl sat up and had to put her top back on, while the guy in the jacuzzi just stared. I cringed when they led us in there. I saw that there was another curtain on the inside that would've made it more private but they did not pull it down. It doesn't matter anyway, because I realize that you are in full view of the nearby walkway anyway. True, they probably don't notice you but I just thought it was weird. Maybe its just an american thing, to be that modest or prude, but it irritated me. I managed to get my top off once I was under the covers, but the whole time, all I could think was that people were watching me from the jacuzzi and it made me very uncomfortable. Plus you could occasionally hear their voices. No music or anything. The massage itself was pretty good. When it was over, I saw my bikini top was left at my feet and awkwardly reached for it to try to get it on in the most unrevealing and unembarrassing way possible, and suddenly a man walked through the curtain at a very awkward moment. He was american or canadian and probably drunk, but a brief conversation ensued where he made a few suggestive and rude comments and said he was looking for towels and just stared at me, despite me asking him to leave several times, he didn't quite get it for a minute or two. I was mortified. He finally left. I got my top on and left as quick as I could. My husband had actually fell asleep at the end of the massage and of course, didn't realize what was happening. He went back after I got back to the room, to tell them what happened and complained. They had no signs up anywhere saying not to enter or that it was a private area. He also complained to the manager of the hotel, who had already been made aware and was already planning to make arrangements for signs to be placed. When we got back from dinner, they had sent champagne and fruit, which was nice as a gesture but we did not have any use for it. So, in short, ask for a private room. Unless you don't mind taking your top off in front of people. Finally, I'll take a moment to talk about the bars. They aren't really what we were used to. Probably because there was only two of them and many more people, you can't really hang out at the bar or sit at the bar, and there are no swim up bars or tvs or anything like that. The bar by the beach was weak although convenient. I felt that there probably was not enough beach service. The one poor guy was loading up constantly and it seemed to take awhile, it was easier to just get it yourself. The bar in the lobby isn't bad, but as for most all inclusives, the liquor was cheap. We sat there before dinner one night listening to some live music. We didn't get to the theater or the disco. So, overall, I probably would not go back, there are a plethora of hotels in the area I would try instead, but if you were getting a good deal and don't mind being away from reality for a while, this really was a lovely resort.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEuropean only\u201d", "Author": "Tina L", "ReviewID": "UR122895129", "Content": "If you are European you will enjoy this resort!!

Plenty of chairs with shaded canopies or without. We enjoyed playing beach volleyball, ping pong and participating in activities hosted by the animation team like spanish lessons, step class, salsa class, dodge ball, beach soccer, and more. -If you don't speak any other language besides English you may feel a bit left out. This hotel has 3 different Animation/Entertainment teams which were made up of employees from France, Italy and Mexico. Since we weren't from either of these countries and spoke very little of each language there were times we felt left out of the loop or simply ignored. This could be because of a language barrier, but I still thought it was weird that they didn't have a team who would mainly interact with the English speaking guests. -In the evenings, after the sun has gone down there isn't too much to do besides hang out in the lobby bar, have a few drinks, play a round of billiards (they have 1 table) and play cards. If would be ideal if the hotel provided some board games or brought some ping pong tables inside to get the guests to mingle. -Nightly shows started at 9:30 and were for the most part very entertaining and creative. Favourites were the Moulin Rouge show, History of Hollywood, and the Mexican States showcase where they brought in professional mexican dancers and a mariachi band. -The food is very good. I enjoyed yogurt and fruit with an omelette in the morning, salad and chicken for lunch, and fish, roast beef and delicious tacos and quesadillas for dinner! -Rooms were very clean and beds were pretty decent. If you want to have a fancy shmancy room you can upgrade to something called \"priviledged\" but I don't really see the value for about $300 more. -They don't accept USD at this hotel. There is a new law that bans them from accepting it in Playa because of the money laundering issues happening in and around Mexico. They will exchange your US money up to a limit at the hotel but it's best to take Canadian dollars or Pesos. -The resort is located in the jungle. So it's a 2km walk on a gravel road to the highway to catch a 'collectivo' (mexican cab bus) it costs about 30 pesos. Be careful and do not walk the gravel road at night because there are no lights and some scary critters will be out and about. So if you are leaving or coming at night its best to take a cab which isn't cheap at about 25 or 30 dollars or 300 pesos. It works to split a cab and always confirm the price with the driver before leaving. Hope this helps. I would recommend this hotel to friends. Best for couples and families.

Juan Jose who works on the beach and the rooftop restaurant is a wicked bartender and he is a fantastic fellow with a warm, welcoming style ...his mixed drinks are magical concoctions. Enrique also kept us happy on the beach with cold beers and the occasional glass of champagne and tequila! Everyone was great Beach - I've saved the best for last ... if you like to relax and recover and people watch this is the place for you. The water is great, you can walk in. On windy days there are waves and the current is pretty strong but I didn't feel like I would be sucked away as all you had to do was stand up as the drop off was gradual. The water is crystal blue most of the time, especially on sunny days and the sand is soft and you don't need water shoes. The resort is a 20 dollar trip to Playa del Carmen if you want to shop or catch a ferry to Cozumel. If you are comfortable to travel outside an excursion hop on a collective to tulum you'll save yourself a lot of $$$.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cA True Mayan Experience\u201d", "Author": "BeantownSole", "ReviewID": "UR122598727", "Content": "We just cambe back from Catalonia Privileged Beach on Saturday and it was an Excellent Experience for someone that has visited over 20 Resorts in the area. LET THE TRUTH BE TOLD - This resort does not discriminate against any group of people! Probably because majority of the guests are from Italy, France and Spain. I was not treated any different, my wife made lots of friends during our stay . This is a good family resort, all the kids we came across were respectful and had their own pool section, and Kiddie club next to the gift shop. The Check in process was brief and welcoming. During our stay at CPB, we stayed at Bld 6 in a Privileged room and were satisfied with all we got, bathroom is a bit outdated and poorly ventilated (BUT ALWAYS SPARKLING CLEAN), but who on their vacation spends time in the bathroom??? I consier the food at El Pajarito a HIT or MISS. But, the courteous service of the staffs makes it worthwhile (Marie Jose, Mariela, Roberto and Dorian will go to the ends of the world to make you smile and Laugh Out Loud while dining...be warned!!! ) .Dined at all other a la carte restaurants, and I was quite impressed with the food and staff ( Manager Fabio and janet are very accomodating to the needs of their handicapped guests). The cr\u00eape at the beach is always crowd puller...(Try the cr\u00eape with soft cheese and fruit mix inside..very Tasty). My first encounter with the Employees unwavering dedication was aboout an hour after we checked in, my son was looking for his biber\u00f3n (feeding bottle); Gabriella at the Privilged lobby quickly placed the entire staff on the ground on a Biberon alert, which to me was not a big deal, but i find it very funny. My son was given 1 big fresh pack of whole milk everyday whenever the minibar was being restocked, we had to stop them since it was getting too much. Also, we requested to have our room changed from the ground floor to a room on the 2nd floor, and once again I was accommodated. In summary, everything I ask for they accommodated me. I believe it is important as travelers to do thorough research on every resort before booking. For instance, The word \"Catalonia\" is actually is one of the seventeen autonomous communities of the Kingdom of Spain. The very moment i came across the hotel, i knew it was going to have European Influence, i was not surprised at the heavily use of Italian, French and Spanish by the guests..Most of whom are very friendly, and are eager to ask questions about North America (United States and Canada). The Animation crew are VERY FRIENDLY, NEVER PUSHY, and always looking to get people to participate in their daily multiple activities (Salsa dancing, darts, soccer, volleyball, bocce ball, spanish lessoons, cooking classes, water aerobics etc). We got to meet some of the Animation Crew members and most of them are from Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands and 1 person from UK), thus have limited use of the English Language...BIG SHOUT OUT to the Following Animation Crew Members -Johnny, Melissa, Laura, JC, Hassan, Andrea, Annine. CPB heavily invests in its staff and their night time shows are worth going for. Compared to other resorts we have visited, this tops it all...Never a Dull Moment at night. I had read all the \u201chorror stories\u201d about the long walkway from the lobby to the pool area, my son did the entire walking and it took us about 5-7 mins each way..with awesome tropical birds views and soothing music along to walkway. Please try not to feed the coatis, a lady, decided to feed to coatis (despite the visible warning signs saying no feeding of the animals), and before you know it she was surrounded by almost 15 coatis and she screamed for help (that was a very funny incident worth seeing). The beach is beautiful and it has cool, white sand and clear water. A LOT of chairs available and a lot of shade available no matter what time you get to the beach. Colorful angel fish can be seen in the water swimming around you...very fast and beautiful. A Big Thank you to Sr. Eduardo Cadena Ocampo, and Gabriella at the privileged lounge for making us have a splendid vacation. ~~We will definitely be back in the coming months~~ Advice : When visiting try to be open minded, friendly and polite to everyone as this Jungle experience at the CPB is of True Mayan Culture. Relax! This is not a Ritz Carlton or a Trump Tower property....

The holiday was for R and R after illness , we weren`t planning on any long trips, just relaxing and taking things easy. Ive read through some of the other reviews, agree with some and disagree with others. Please note this hotel caters mainly for families and a lot of people here were from Canada,France and Italy. Im going to review this as a school report. Eco enviroment of complex 9/10 Sympathetically designed to fit in with local flora and fauna.Lots of birds and butterflies and furry animals! Gardens/Surrounds 9/10 Well kept and tended . Pool 9/10 Huge,very clean,maintained and lifeguard on duty. Beach towels issued by staff in a kiosk beside . Lack of poolside sunbeds!75 not enough for clients as the hotel was full. However there were plenty of beds beachside. Beach 8/10 Lovely beach,however whilst we were there ,very rough with rubbish in the sea,people were ignoring red flag and twice the lifeguard had to go in. Very strong undercurrent. Lots of sand flies too. Other facilities 8/10 Tennis Courts,kids club, scuba diving ,jet ski , theatre,disco and the usual animacion team who spoke in spanish,french,italian and english. there were also facilities for spa,gym,shops,restaurants bars and concierge.Wi Fi available. Accomodation 9/10 Our room was huge and very well furnished. The bed was so comfortable. I loved the sink , great shower set up, with rain head and hand held. Plenty of sockets, loads of wardrobe space. Had a problem with WC. but it was soon fixed. Food 7/10 All inclusive hotels never excel at gourmet cuisine However I was pleasantly surprised by some of the meals. The one disappointment was the lobster meal for my birthday.At the tapas terrace restaurant,it was overcooked, rubbery, small and not worth the 55 USD. Twice a week whilst we were there a duo sang Entertainment. 7/10 in reception till 9.30 then packed up and went! They want you in the theatre to see all the animation team put on different themed shows in the theatre most nights. ...but I dont want that every night. I think a guitar player or a piano player or some jazz would have been great The reception area seemed a bit souless at times Cleanliness 9/10 All the toilets, and public areas were immaculate. The rooms were cleaned every day, empty cups collected from beach and pool areas . Waiting staff wore hair nets and there were nets over the sides and entrances of the restaurants to prevent birds entering. Staff 10/10 The most obliging ,helpful,friendly people we have ever met. Everyone from the gardener to manager had a smile and greeting. The stars were the animation team. They always made an effort to talk to young and old alike. The waiting staff in the all the restaurants also deserve a lot of praise. So all in all a fine complex. Just one or two small things. The evening entertainment was a bit sparse , could improve that. There is no shuttle bus out of the complex only taxi. I recommend this place for young families.

In addition, the lobby bar might have the best coffee on the Mayan Riviera--considering the large Italian contingent that stays there, I have no doubt they really strive to impress with every espresso or cappuccino they serve.

The buffet is delicious with lot's of choice even for semi vegetarians like myself. I couldn't get enough of the pico de gallo made fresh daily. Our room was clean and spacious, the grounds were well kept, and service was spectacular. I ordered something in the Mexican a la carte that wasn't to my liking and they took it back and exchanged it for something new without issue. The liquor is top shelf and like any AI it's recommended that you bring your own cup. Like other viewers mentioned it was nice to see clean public washrooms by the beach. Excellent coffee, beautiful beaches and the list goes on and on. My only complaint would be that there was a lot of French focus with the entertainment/activity team not that I really care since I don't usually participate in those activities....just something to keep in mind if you're into that. Most of the other employees at the hotel speak multiple languages including English, Italian and French so there is no real language barrier to worry about. I also did not watch the nightly entertainment shows or go to the disco, so I'm not sure how those are either. I prefer to sit on the beach at night and look at the ocean, or even sitting in the hotel lobby here at night was very relaxing. If you're looking for a vacation to enjoy the warm sun, beautiful beaches and lot's of history then I would definitely recommend staying here. As a non hotel FYI: I did a snorkeling excursion and it was fantastic. We saw eels, plenty of tropical fish and a sting ray. They were also very safety conscious which was great to see! The lunch after the snorkel and a self tour through Puerto Morelos really made the trip fabulous. We also went to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 which is a must-see. It's a full day adventure since it's a couple hour bus ride from the hotel. We went for a swim in a cenote along the way, had an okay lunch, then were wowed by Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 ... hard to believe something like this could be built back then and use the sun and shadows to instill fear. Truly amazing. We took a cab into Playa Del Carmen one night and it was nice. If you want to get a little shopping done and enjoy a night away from the hotel this is the place to go. We enjoyed giant burritos for dinner and did some people watching since we ate outside. It is pretty Americanized here with your typical Starbuck's, McD's etc, but a good place to get some souvenirs.

I must say it was a pleasant experience. From the painlessly swift check in to the equally painless check out I'll give this my rarest 5. Even though the hotel caters mainly to the Europeans i.e French and Italian tourists, Canadians are given equal standing here. I found it no problem interacting with any nationality here, due to the encouragement by all staff members to integrate. Rooms were adequate and situated in beautifully kept surroundings in a jungle setting, complete with birds, animals and vegetation. I object only to the discrimination, as is becoming more popular, towards a dual class system, whereas you can upgrade to \"privileged\" class. What am I? Underprivileged! We didn't take the bait and didn't suffer one little bit. The same sunshine, the same ocean and beach, tough to take ain't it? Food at the trough was better than most, lots of variety and top quality. A la Carte restaurants were definitely gourmet, Italian, Mexican and the Steak house. Gotta recommend the filet steak medium rare, or the Lasagnia. We celebrated our 52nd anniversary here and were treated to the Tapas restaurant for that. Mon Dieu! What a meal, we got through 2 bottles of champers and a nice wedding cake, desserts seemed to come thick and fast too, must have put on 5 Lb just there. Beach was fabulous, always seemed to get a hammock every day and supplied generously with \"Chelas\" from Enrique. We did try the snack bar once, but decided to skip that for the \"trough\" for lunch instead. The pool was ok, but not really good for serious swimmers. The Lobby bar was open 24 hours, but not for me. Jessica looked after us with top shelf liquor whenever we used it. Never made the show once. They always start shows too late for me.

So we traveled to the Catalonia Playa Maroma the week of November 21st for a pre-winter getaway. We upgraded our reservation to the Privileged Room and it was well worth it. We got an extra a la Cart meal, free Tapas Dinner, use of the Privilege snack bar for lunch, upgraded room and lot of other niceties. Our room was on the third floor overlooking the ocean and was had been recently renovated, very nice. We spent the entire week on the beach and only set foot in the pool for literally 30 seconds, the beach was that fantastic! The breakfast at the Buffet was pretty much the same as other resorts with eggs, sausage and bacon so you will not go hungry. We never ate dinner at the buffet but from what I\u2019ve heard it was pretty good. There are three a la Cart choices, Mexican, Grill and Italian with the Italian being the best in my opinion. The food was tasty and the presentation was excellent. Just like dining in a fancy restaurant back home. The nightly shows were your standard choices and since there were so many Europeans at the resort they had a couple of night in different languages. Most people take in the show then move over to the lobby for a drink and then into the disco to dance the night away, lots of fun! We took a taxi into Playa Del Carmen and I recommend going there after 4:30pm when the town really comes to life. It\u2019s a safe Mardi Gras type atmosphere with plenty of high-end store for the shoppers and some really great places to eat. YES, there is even a Wal-Mart there! We went on one excursion that had us snorkeling with the sea turtles, swimming in a Cenote, zip lining across the top of a forest and repelling down the side of a tower. Highly recommended!! So rather than go over all of the great things that others have said about this resort I\u2019d like to end my review with some tips that I hope will come in handy during your holiday! - Bring a travel mug for your beverage. Keeps the sand out, the drink cold and saves wasting those tiny plastic cups. - The best exchange rate for Pesos was in town. About 13 Pesos for a buck, 11 per dollar at the Hotel. - Share a taxi into town with another couple that going that way. You pay for the taxi not the amount of passengers; I think it was about $23.00 one way. - If you want to see some fish in the ocean bring some cereal from the buffet and sprinkle it in the water around you. Hundreds of beautiful white with black fish will surround you. Amazing! - Get to the pool or beach by 8:00am to grab shade and a lounger. We bring some Pringles chips with us and use the container filled with sand and our towels to hold our place. PS: The Pringles container can hold the cereal for the fish! - Bring bug spray as there are some mosquitoes around. - When you order your mixed drink ask for \u201cDouble Tequila\u201d or \u201cDouble Rum\u201d or whatever your favorite poison is. I found that you really can\u2019t taste or feel it otherwise. - If you like to tip bring some American one dollar bills with you. Getting 10 Peso coins, which are about a dollar, is pretty difficult at the Hotel. I hope you have a great time in Mexico and I\u2019m sure that the excellent staff and management at the Catalonia Playa Maroma will make it a trip to remember! Any Qs?

Sometimes, you find coatis hanging around (small animals similar to ant-eaters). Cute, only they bite if you feed them. Staff is friendly enough, much more so if you're american. Drinks are better and less watered down at the lobby bar, compared to the beach bar, The animation team is really cheerful, but mostly stick to italian and french speaking guests.

Playa maroma for 4 nights. We had stayed at the other two Catalonia resorts over the years, so we wanted to try this one. we are glad we did! First day we got there, check in was a breeze. We found out we were actually in the privladged section of the hotel. At first we didnt know what all that men because we didnt book that, but we sure did find out! It was great! We were in building 6, third floor. Our balcony had a view of the ocean. We have never had that before! The beds were the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on in mexico. Being in the privladged section you have your own pathway to the beach and pool, your own separate lounge area with laptops and free wifi, and where you can go to find out anything you ever need to know, and any question you need answered. That beats having to all the way to the lobby. We had turn down service, fruit delivered to our room, and top notch service! We also got one hour free in the spa! You can choose between the jacuzzie, steam room, or sauna. That was nice and relaxing. I'll start with the lobby. HUGE! and Really really pretty. PLENTY of tables, lounging beds, and seats. You cannot fit this all into one picture, and the pictures really dont do it justice. It just might be better then any other lobby we have seen in mexico. The pathways are a walk inside the jungle which was sooo nice! You hear birds all day, and the coatis walking around EVERYWHERE!!! Now for the rooms. Decor was nice and authentic, the beds with extremely comfortable, and it had everything you will ever need such as robes, slippers(which you can take home), coffee maker and coffee, mini fridge, and safe. The only thing I have to comment on were the bathrooms. They did need some serious updating, and it was small, no door or curtain in the shower, and it did smell bad at times. The beach..... beautiful!! Never seemed overcrowed, and PLENTY of chairs no matter what time in the morning you went down. We always seemed to get our same chairs in the same spot every day. Water was warm, no rocks. And you can walk in either direction and see what is next to you. The pool we never used, because it was really just too cold, and the weather for the first couple of days were windy and chilly. But it was nice a big and seemed very clean. The food was really good. Breakfast and lunch I think were our favorite meals. Its pretty much the same kind of food you would get in any resort at the buffets, but still good. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets were in the lobby. they also have the snack bar open at the pool until later for lunch. We went there alot as well. We did go to one specialty restaurant, the Mexican. I have to be honest, we did not like it at all. However they knew it was our birthday that week (both mine and my moms) and they brought us a cake, champagne, and sang happy birthday. So that was nice. The banana splits at the creperie were yummy! The entertainment staff is outside every day doing activities around the pool, and beach. The same staff put on shows at night time at the theater. We only made it to one show because it was late and we were really just exhausted from the day. They have a disco/lounge next to it, but we didnt make it to that either. The wait staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and polite. Always there to get you anything you need. defintely bring ones to tip the maids and wait staff. It goes along way and they appreciate it. The gift shops will not take american money, but they have an exchange office in the lobby open until I think 5. Im sure I left a few things out. I will post pictures soon... Feel free to message me with any questions or tips you might need!!!

No rocks, coral, or shells, just comfortable white sand. The water is shallow, safe, and lovely shades of clear aqua. I like to walk south of the Catalonia past Secrets and swim anywhere. I have very much enjoyed my stay at the Catalonia Playa Maroma 3 times this year, April, June, and November. The level of service is excellent, the employees always very friendly and helpful. I'm fluent in Spanish but most of the guests are from Europe as are some of the employees, mostly France and Italy. The employees do their best to communicate with guests who speak a wide variety of languages even tho these are low paying jobs. Tips are greatly appreciated, and certainly earned. I had a very nice privileged room in bldg 6. The concierge is extremely helpful and always helped me with a phone call to confirm my airport ride pickup time. She told me that they had just started a special lunch/snack for privileged guests in the Tapas restaurant/bar which overlooks the beach. I was happy to enjoy this a few times. I especially liked the ceviche, wings, and mango sorbet. I've enjoyed all the specialty restaurants, Spanish tapas, Italian, Mexican, and Grill, as well as the buffet by the lobby and the lunch/snacks by the beach/pool. There are no reservations, first come, first served. If you have a large group, it is best to arrive when the restaurants open. I thought the food was slightly improved in November. There's a lot of choice, just check it all out. I like having guacamole every meal and I look for it. There is always a selection of beef, pork, chicken and fish, a pasta station, pizza. I prefer the grilled or baked fish. Plenty of fruit and tempting desserts. The lobby bar is open 24 hours, the beach bar is open till midnight. I always ask for the better grade tequila. For breakfast, there is a do-it-yourself station for mimosas and bloody marys. You can order whatever drink at lunch and dinner in the buffet and specialty restaurants. The ambience is relaxing, not a party hotel. However the animation team keeps up a lively pace for fun activities, lots of games, even yoga and dance lessons. The shows are fun, Moulin Rouge production is very good, as well as the Cirque du Soleil and the Folkloric Dancers. My favorite time for vacation is early November. 70% capacity, plenty of choice of lounges and shady areas. In April I was moved to another Catalonia hotel for 2 nights because of large groups overbooking. I was given a document for 2 free nights for a future vacation. I was treated very well, given a changing room so I could enjoy Maroma beach as much as possible. Their other hotel had the same amenities, but not the beautiful beach. I want to thank Filiberto and Judith and William at reception for all their kind and efficient help in making my transfers and rebooking go as smoothly as possible. The luggage handlers are so polite and patient. My rooms were always quite clean, plenty of towels and wash cloths. I enjoyed the robes. Flat screen TV. A bigger enclosed shower and privacy curtain separating the sink and bedroom areas are suggestions if ever possible. All service was super. Thank you Elsa for your sweet friendly smile and for remembering me as you worked as hostess at the various restaurants.

We have stayed in bigger resorts in Mexico where we had to walk a lot longer than this was! I prefer a smaller property. We dined at all the restaurants and enjoyed the Tapas the best. Ate at the Steakhouse 2 times, filet was wonderful! Bartenders were great, quick service on the beach. At the beach bar there was always a crowd, but the bartenders were always smiling and working as fast as they could. Didn't take them long to remember what your drinks were and have them ready when they saw you. Room was very nice. Housekeeping was good and turndown service was nice, especially the extra pillows! We were the minority, being from the USA, but it was not a worry. Lots of Italians and French, German couple married on the beach Friday (beautiful bride!). For the money we spent (or should I say saved!) we had a great trip! Never hungry or thirsty! Had so much fun and great weather we never left at all! Used USA Tours to transfer to and from airport. Have used the Apple Vacation included transfer and stopped at every resort in the past, can take a long time to get to your resort. USA Tours was $95 USD for 4 of us non stop both ways, great deal!

Way too many people for this size beach- it felt like human soup in the water too, so we had to go 10 minutes to wild part of the beach without crowd. Rooms are designed very well, but bathrooms are done very cheaply. Plumbing is really bad- 75% of the public restrooms were broken-didn\u2019t flush properly \u2013 nasty!

This is not a bad or a good thing just understand that most of the guests are not Americans. We stayed May 9, 2011 - May 15, 2011 in the privileged all-inclusive. Our room was amazing and clean. The fridge was stocked daily with beer, soda, and bottled water, we were also given additional bottled water in the room. The maid came by twice a day to clean and organize the room and restock the fridge and toiletries. The towels and bedding were clean and the A/C worked wonderfully in our room. The staff was very helpful from the time we arrived until the moment we left. Take some extra cash and tip the bar and wait staff, you would be amazed what it can do. It is not required but tipping a total of no more than $20 while we were here guaranteed us VIP service at the bar and we never had to wait or ask for a drink. The alcohol is of course all Mexican brands but it tasted great, and did what it was supposed to do. The food was good at the buffets, nothing amazing but very good. My only complaint if we had one was that we were given 2 dinner vouchers upon arrival. We had to use these vouchers to eat dinner at the restaurants instead of the buffet. We ate at the steak house and the Mexican restaurant and they were amazing, top notch service and amazing food. Sadly once you used the vouchers you had to eat at the buffet for dinner. I spoke with the concierge who did provide me with one additional pass but that was all she stated she could give me. The buffet was good but the restaurants were amazing. The pools were nice and big and had varying depths from 1 foot all the way to 9 feet deep. The resort provided chairs but if you slept in they all were taken very early. Not a problem for us as we are early risers but it should be noted. Pack extra sunscreen, we ran out and had to buy it from the gift shop, a small bottle was $18. We did several excursions while we were here and booked them all from the providers at the hotel. I don't know if it is cheaper to book them prior to arriving via the internet but I can say this about booking at the hotel. If you book at the hotel they set up everything for you and even call your room to remind you if you oversleep. They arrange pickup from the hotel and return you to the hotel. Also because you booked there, they know where you are and when you should be returning. This peace of mind is a small price to pay. For excursions we went to Chichen Itza first. The trip was an entire day even that left at 8am and did not return until 6pm. The bus ride there included free drinks (Soda, Water, Beer) and we stopped for an included lunch. The lunch was average at best but we thought ahead and brought snacks to eat. Prior to arriving at Chichen Itza we stopped at a large sink hole that we swam in, a much needed relief on a hot day. It is very warm at Chichen Itza since there is no ocean breeze so prepare for this. If you have never been honestly you should take the time to see Chichen Itza and learn about its history, just bring money for souvenirs and ice cream or water. Our second excursion was a half day snorkeling trip. We were taken to 3 different spots in the ocean to snorkel and it was amazing. Of course at the conclusion of Snorkeling drinks and lunch were provided, the food was good here and had a nice Mexican flair to it. Our final excursion was to Xplor! The park has zip lining, ATV's, and underground rivers. We went mainly for the zip lines and had a great time. If you have water shoes make sure to wear them. Our only complaint was that while we had a great time it only took 3 hours max to do all the rides, however the bus back did not leave for 4 more hours. We paid for a cab ride home as we were wore out and ready to just relax at our resort. All in all it was an amazing vacation, and we are planning a return trip for our anniversary. While we loved the resort we are going to try a different one this time just to see if there is anything better, but I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSimply Amazing - Mom & Son Bond!\u201d", "Author": "Mommasonbonding", "ReviewID": "UR120619337", "Content": "Ola! Just home from Cancun - Mayan yesterday with my 18 year old son. We took advantage of the Remembrance Day holidays.. weather was amazing in Cancun-Playa De Carmen- Maroma 86F... at home (Vancouver): 5C! Wow... what an amazing trip. Carlson Wagon-Lit organized it all. I completed 3 surveys in Mexico & at home in order to tell them how much we enjoyed the trip (this takes time... so you can see it's had an impact). Best $1500 Cnd pp I've EVER spent (grand total.. EVERYTHING included... taxes, tips, spending money on 5th Ave, airport eatting) The size of the Transat plane was my only complaint: too tight! \"Sardines\" says it all. As for EVERYTHING else ~ flawless-amazing... including Transat's orientation at the resort, follow-up, shuttle service and representatives (excluding a few (3) grumpy, passive-aggressive flight attendants... no surprise... they too were probably clostraphobic & reaping the rewards of the complaining passengers when they dropped a fork, wine or rubbed the wrong elbow :). The 0700 Sunday depart from YVR and the 2030 arrival in YVR allowed us to enjoy the resort & beach until 1200 hrs on our come-home day. That was a great, relaxing way to exit the peace of the Mayan (weather was great.... 86F with only rain as we were driving away from the resort enroute home). Catelonia Playa Meroma gets 2 thumbs up! Food... huge variety & very very plentiful & accessible from 0700-0000 hrs ~ restaurants, buffet, beach, poolside. Drinks - any kind, any time always a smile from the server. Servers served at the bar, beach & poolside. Not intrusive or interrupting. Professional, kind & fast service (sometimes even refused tips ($2 usually) as they \"weren't on duty right now\" and just wanted to do it for us. Wow. Room - We upgraded to \"Privledged\" which cost $280 for the week. It gave us a prettier room, slightly closer to the beach, an extra dinner & snacks beachside, and probably a \"whoo-haa\" from any passer-bys as they saw the silver rather than green braclet (kidding :). Overall, nice to be closer to beach. Buildings 4 or 5 would have been just as good (we got upgraded to Building 6). Long walk back to the registration desk/buffet. But, because there was so much choice beach & poolside, we only walked back there for evening activities & to enjoy the serenely lit & gentle music \"jungle\" walk and \"Oso\"s frolicking along the way (they look like a cross between an ant-eatter & a racoon :). Massage - Two days of the week havd 25% off (Mon & Thurs.... we arrived Sunday). So, we booked this Monday morning for Thursday afternoon: 3 & 4 PM. Total cost for 2 - 1 hr full body massages was $148 USD. They said it was to be 50 min. It turned out to be 64 min each. Descrete. Professional. Tip $5-10. Entertainment/Activities - The most energetic young adults - dressed perfect for their job & the environment - that I've ever seen. They remembered our names. They approached us to advise us of upcoming activities & encourage us to join in ~ as we chose/felt like it. All activities & each evening show were translated in Italian, French, Spanish ... and English (if anyone needed it ~ not many did!). My son & I bonded through these activities: beach olympics, soccer, volleyball, games, challenges, water areobics, Spanish lessons, pool competitions, yoga, stretching, abdominal work outs, gym.... on and on. We didn't Kayak, play tennis or ping pong ~ just by choice. It was available & encouraged. Resort - was immaculate. The demographics were ages 35-70 mostly couples, some newly weds/families and a few toddlers. Not a \"singles\" destination unless they want peace & solitude :). Collectivo - Public transit van into Playa De Carmen for shopping: $2-3 (20-30 pesos) each way (20 min). Cozumel - per ferry (watch the sea-sickness... very rough seas & many vomitting passengers... bags handed to everyone as they boarded) - $13.50 each way pp. Knowing Italian, French or Spanish is VERY VERY valuable. My french-immersion son was amazed that he could finally use the language (he thought it only existed in the classroom, I guess). He did alot of interpretting for me. We are home.

It was my first time in Mexico but my husband's second. We were looking for a week of pure relaxation, nice beach, good food and and total switch off. This is exactly what we got!!! Having researched the hotels in the area trying to find the right one I chose the maroma because it was smaller and less like the big resorts that are all interlinked as this was not what we were looking for. I was slightly nervous after booking as some of the comments on here seemed a little negative. However I had no reason to worry. We stayed in the privledged section of the hotel which is a short walk from reception and the buffet but hardly a trek!! It was nice to be able to walk off our dinner! The room was cleaned daily, spacious and had everything you needed( soap, shampoo, hairdryer etc) The pool was one big pool but with different areas and was great. The pool bar was a lovely area to sit and enjoy a coffee, beer or nice crepe. The poolside restaurant is where we chose to have lunch most days as we liked to stay down by the beach and it was delicious. The beach...only one word to describe it Spectacular and i have been to the maldives but this really was beautiful. The waiter on the beach was so friendly and really looked after us. The buffet in the evening had a different theme every evening and the food was good there was something for everyone always pasta pizza meat fish and mexican so you had a choice. It was a little repetitve but then any buffet over a week is. The other themed restaurants were nice and gave you a break from the buffet although from my experience the mexican wasn't the best. Enjoyed the steak though. All in all we had the perfect relaxing holiday which is exactly what we wanted. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Have to say that the free for all to check-in at reception I felt could be arranged better. Also the hotel DOES NOT accept dollars even though or travel agent told us it did. Also they DO NOT have a shuttle bus to playa del carmen anymore but it\u00b4s well worth taking a taki in for the day. The road in and out of the hotel is a bit of a bumpy ride but certainly wouldn't put me off booking to stay in the hotel like it seems to bother others. Also take mosquito repellant as it is in a jungle and you probably will get bitten. However after I put the cream on I was not bothered again and so it didn't affect my holiday. All in all we had a fantastic holiday in the Maroma and I would defo recommend the hotel to anyone who wanted to be in a nice hotel next to a fantastic beach surrounded by jungle away from the rest of the world!

Very satisfied with our Jetblue experience. We decided on Catalonia Playa Maroma because of the beach and the size of the hotel -- and we were very happy with our choice. You will not be subjected to pounding music at the pool all the time, just during an exercise class for example. No staff members will be in your face with a bullhorn trying to get you to participate in a contest. (They come around and ask you. If you have your nose in a book, no one bothers you.) There is no bar in the pool. So if that is your cup-of-tea, I'd consider another resort. Room: 4000 building, Privilege. The second-floor room was perfect with a separate sink/dressing room area that was very convenient. There was a very long covered balcony that provided ample shade in the afternoon. The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff. I have to add that the beds were so comfortable...pillows, also. Not what we've experienced before in Mexico or the Dominican Rep. Layout/Grounds: This is a medium-size resort. Some we've stayed at are so large they require a train to link the various areas. We found this more enjoyable. There is a lovely, central walkway that runs from the lobby/main buffet/theatre to the beach/pool. It is bordered by dense mature foliage-- relaxing music is played 24/7. There are paths spaced along the walkway that connect to each block of rooms. It is truly a beautiful setting. Beach: Fantastic ! Breakfast: The main buffet near the lobby is the only restaurant open for breakfast. We decided one morning to wait until 10am when the crepe bar at the beach opened. The ham and cheese crepes were great and provided a change from the buffet. Lunch: We ate lunch every day at beach buffet -- seating is outdoors on a covered porch. There is a good variety with hot dogs, hamburgers, pasta, pizza, soup, cheeses, salad, and cold meat. The roast chicken was delicious. There are soda/water dispensers; two beer taps, and three wine taps (red, white and rose). Dinner: The Italian restaurant was our favorite--ate there twice. The service was wonderful. Seriously good food. Steakhouse appetizers are very good - didn't care for our steak or fish entrees. The Mexican buffet was fantastic, believe that's on Tuesday night. Enjoyed our dinner at the Tapas restaurant also. The wine served in the restaurants is from Spain and very good, especially the red Navarra. Wine at the main buffet, not so much. I should mention that most nights before dinner some sort of appetizers and specialty drinks are served in the lobby. Very nice. Bars: Service and drinks, very good. Finlandia and Tangueray always available, which made us very happy. Excellent selection of rums and tequila. The waiter on the beach was amazing. He kept track of everybody. And, the beach bar stays open until 11pm, which is terrific. We loved sitting outside with a drink after dinner listening to the ocean. One very, very very small negative -- no one knew how to make a real martini. Complicated drinks with five different ingredients you could get, no problem. But, that was ok. The gin and tonics were great ! Level of Service: Staff at the front desk were the friendliest we've ever encountered. Check-in at the Privilege Office was an efficient, pleasant experience. Members of management seemed to be everywhere. Housekeeping was wonderful. Waitstaff at the buffets and restaurants were excellent. Summary: Everyone has their own set of criteria for a memorable vacation experience. For us, Catalonia Playa Maroma was a better fit than the Barcelo, Iberostar and Gran Bahia resorts we've visited. Simply put, it was relaxing, had good food and drinks, an unbelievable beach, and we felt well taken care of.

The room has been updated; folks complained about the bathrooms not being redone, but they actually are quite charming with Mexican tiles and painted sink. Our only complaint was water getting onto the floor if the showerhead was not pointed directly down. Housekeeping was wonderful and every night a different towel animal with flower petals. Only problem was when the maid walked in on us one night while we were getting ready for dinner and we had not put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. So be sure to put that sign up any and all times that you want privacy. Air conditioning is not \"ice cold\" but that isn't our preference so we were pleased that the humidity was out and the temp was pleasant in the room. Others have commented about few English speaking guests; this is true. Other reviews noted a significant European clientele, but we actually experienced more Latin and South American folks - especially Brazilian. A lot of Spanish and Portugese being spoken. But everyone was friendly.....very few children and they were all well behaved. The beach and pool area were wonderful. The beach is absolutely gorgeous - powder white sand and sparking turquoise water. We walked every day - sometimes twice a day for over a mile either direction. We really enjoyed the pool - it has many different depths and ways to enter. It was nice to be able to swim laps in the 9+ feet ; also the ability to sit in very shallow water when one just wants to lounge and sunbath. There was plenty of covered areas both at the beach and at the pool - we did not have to get up early or reserve any seats. We had all our lunches at the Tortuga restaurant by the pool. We did tire some of the same kinds of food each lunch, but there was enough variety. We had 5 ala carte dinners; enjoyed the Italian and the Tapas the most. Would skip the Ti Pedro altogether. The food wasn't anything great and the service was lacking compared to the Italian, Tapas and Tortuga. As others have mentioned, only two of the restaurants are air conditioned. Alcohol served in the restaurants was always better than what was served at the pool bar; even though we had privileged status, it depened on the bartender as to whether \"better\" liquor was used. We had after dinner drinks and coffee with liqueur in the restaurants which was also a nice touch. The Creperie was nice by the pool - fun to have an afternoon snack or shake. Breakfast - had mimosas every day. Our only complaint is that the shows did not start until 10 p.m. After being up at 7 a.m. and out in the sun all day, it was too late for us middle-aged folks to stay up for. We were also early eaters at 7 p.m. in the restaurants.....Also, the walk to breakfast buffet is quite a walk - we enjoy walking so wasn't an issue and it was fun each time to see if the coatis were out - quite interesting little characters..... All in all, we would not hestitate to recommend Catalonia.....", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Melissa A", "ReviewID": "UR119235244", "Content": "We visited Catalonia Playa Maroma in October 2010 My family can't wait to go back.

Last year in Oct. 24-31 and this year Sept. 17-24-11. I should write a bad review to keep people from coming but then I'd be taking away from the great service and the fantastic folks that keep the place going. You've all heard about the beach and all is true the best in the whole region. You've read the bad review about the service, well they were wrong last year and they are still wrong this hotel has some of the best people working for it and you're going to get the best service whether you're in the privileged area or in the standard area all is great. Forget everything you read A+ resort. From Enrique and Juan at the beach bar, Juan at the Buffet to the animation group. Jhonny, Laura, J.C., Anna well all of them you will always feel like a rock star. Yes it is true that the walk is about 7 min. from the buffet to the beach but you need that walk to settle the grub you just ate. Also the jungle you are walking thru is fantastic for photo taking and just plain beautiful. My wife and I have been to Cancun and down the Rivera Maya 15 times for 8 day trips on all and we found home last year had to make sure it was as great as we remembered and yes it was. Home away from home. Will plan all of our other trips to this place. Next thing to mention is the language, Yes it is Spanish, Italian and French mainly, a pinch full of Canadians and Americans but the only ones you need to get information from do speak enough english to get you around. Forget all the bad reviews you've read about these folks must be used to 5 star and Diamond rating hotels or just plain snobs. This is the best deal for your money and it's really a better deal than what you are paying for. When you order your drinks, change it up a bit and see what works best for you they have a drink menu check one out every half hour or so. When you find your drink just tell the bartender you want them a little stronger and they will do it with a smile. remember all you can eat and drink so enjoy yourselves. take plenty of pictures and we did not have to worry about that so called chair wars. Didn't have to get up early to drop off my towel to get a spot plenty of shade, now you might have trouble finding a spot afternoon but it all depends on the season you go to visit. My wife and I are in our early fifties and did had a blast playing beach games with the animation crew. If you need someone to talk to in english because miss hearing it, ask for Jhonny or Laura they will make you forget about home. Also don't let the weather information you get freak you out. It almost always calls for rain you might get 5min. on day but most of the rain comes at night or early in the morning. So, make the phone call and have the best time ever! pictures, pictures, pictures. Buy a small tripod from walmart most overseas folks not as frendly as Americans or Canadians and will not offer to take your picture. My wife and I will just walk up and ask when people are doing single shots and they always welcome it so that's when you ask will you take one of us, or motion it and you will get them. have fun, we did and will do so for many years to come.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, comfort & amazing beach!\u201d", "Author": "Ettevi", "ReviewID": "UR118696140", "Content": "We visited Catalonia Playa Maroma for the third time in the last 3 years; however this is the first time I prepare a review. Well, basically this hotel is in the middle of an evolution, because they are renovating their suites, so from the hall to the left, now are called Catalonia Privileged Beach, and the middle to the right remain Catalonia Playa Maroma. The difference is that the rooms at the Privileged are renewed with LCD, modern decoration, and some other details versus the other suites remain in a tropical talavera decoration, simpler but functional, both cases have great size and with convenient A/C, shower, restroom, facilities, balcony with jungle view. The rest of the hotel remain at the concept of caring about the natural vegetation jungle type, so you will see a lot of trees, palms, and animals like coatis in the middle of the gardens\u2026 Something it is very important to consider before picking this hotel is that you will walk a lot, because they have this stone way in the middle of the jungle that connects, the lobby and restaurants, with the rooms and ends towards the beautiful beach, which measures a quarter of mile so if you go to breakfast, beach or rooms, you will walk on it at least 3 times. We love this walking because it is such an experience especially during the night, listening environmental new age music with indirect light spotted to some trees or palms, and able to look to the sky and admire the moon or the stars.. Other very important matter, if you consider staying at the Catalonia is take tons of mosquito repellent with you, with now is very normal to carry in every vacations, along with sunscreen lotion. A lot of \u201cZancudos\u201d are following you, and waiting for a good spot to pinch. So utilize every couple of hours and the stay will remain happy. The food: the breakfast buffet has a great taste and it is very complete, also the dinner buffet which has different country-cuisine-theme every night, accompanied with the everyday basics for the vegetarians, pastas, meat, etc. Also the specialties restaurants are great, we love to eat at Tio Pedro, where they have A/C and charming Mexican Hacienda decoration. Also, try the crepes or ice cream at the terraza in front of the beach! They are great. The only observation I could make is regarding the snack Tortuga, because options are limited. Entertainment and night show: this hotel has a full team of people that are dedicated to bring activities for guests, they are form Mexico, Italy, France, and other countries. You will find this team preparing games every day, yoga sessions, aqua aerobics, dancing contests, etc. They are very nice and friendly, also they participate on the night show. Night show is not as other hotels that bring very professional dancers or musicians show, here it is presented by the entertainment team and it goes more for the comedy, some performances and having the guests happy. Also the pool/beach parties at night with live music and grill are great!!! The most enjoyable part of this hotel definitively is the beach, clean, enough chairs, and a lot of angelfishes that receives you when you start walking inside the water, you don\u2019t need snorkel to see them. Lovely walks can be taken to the Maroma lighthouse or to Paraiso beach.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Location": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara area", "Title": "\u201cDiving with ProDiveMex...GREAT!\u201d", "Author": "EndlessSummerDaySpa", "ReviewID": "UR118662706", "Content": "Did not stay at the hotel, but visited for a day on Sept.14th to enjoy 2 dives with ProDiveMEX.

But, what sets this apart from the rest is that they really cater to European guests with the staff trained in Italian and French. Although we are North Americans, we felt that the European atmosphere really added to our vacation experience and made it feel like we were far from our humdrum hometown. We stayed 6 nights/7days and for our last night ww were moved out to the oceanside suite as a thank you for using the spa services and leaving feedback on the comment cards. Food:We visited all of the A la carte restaurants and each one had amazing service and amazing food. The Terrace tapas restaurant was our favorite, it overlooks the ocean and is dimly lit, so romantic!! Beach:Gorgeous white powder sand, turquoise water, shaded and non shaded areas. We were served fresh coconut water out of the actual nut, so neat! Lots of games and relaxing downtime on the beach. We kayaked out to the main reef area to clear green water, but not much wildlife to be seen..might have been due to time of day? Staff: Friendly waitstaff remembered us each morning for breakfast and knew English very well. They were happy to teach us some Spanish as well! Atmosphere: Very relaxed European vibe, not many children (prob due to school being in session) Lobby is open and loungey with cafe tables, definitely not a fancy luxury hotel lobby, but more like a garden cafe. The grounds are primarily jungle, we used OFF insect repellent everyday- all day! The beach breeze keeps the mosquitoes away, but there are lots of them on the jungle pathway back to the lobby and breakfast buffet. +'s: Amazing beach, great a la carte restaurants, friendly staff, lobby bar cappuccinos were great!, relaxed European vibe, ocean side suite was amazing, nightly shows are not perfect but still fun! Smoking wasn't allowed in the restaurants. -'s: Drink service on beach was inconsistent, spa services are not very private, couples massage took place in jungle and we were unable to relax because of the mosquitoes biting are bare skin! Most guests smoked, but we were only bothered by it on the pathway back and forth to beach/lobby which was relatively a short distance. Ants around guestroom sink, but noticed staff spraying rooms for insects.

We rented a Honeymoon Suite (more expensive than the privileged room) and the extra cost was worth it. We got a perfectly working jacuzzi in the outside of the room, daily replenished free minibar, and some extra treats. The room was beatiful as well (see picture). The only issue we seemed to find in the room was that the air conditioning was always too cold, even at the higher temperature (which is far better than being too hot, of course). Service: people were really nice and always eager to help you. This was one of the best sides of the hotel. No one was ever rude to you (the people at the front desk was not always as helpful as you would hope, but well...). Waiters were always offering you help, or picking up your dishers, or refilling your water glass. Hotel itself: it is in the middle of the \"jungle\". So, from the route, you have a 3-4 minute drive up to the hotel entrance. This is normal for all the hotels in the area. One point that stands out is that the hotel is long, so wherever your rooms are, you will always have to walk. Whether it is up to the beach or the restaurant, a walk is a must. The front desk, theatre, 24hr bar and buffet restaurant (where you will get mos of your meals) are at the front. Then there is the main road, sorrounded by trees (with coatis and the eventual squirrels and bird) that connects the rest of the hotel. The different room's buildings are built on both sides of the main road (i think there are 4 or 5, one story high buildings). At the end there is the commercial area, the gym, the pool, and then the beach. The thing is that walking will not bother you, since the ambient music and flora are outstanding. Food: I read some reviews here before leaving, and I cannot understand the people who were compiaining about it. Ok, we are all different, but the selection in the buffet was huge, so there must be something you like there. Of course, some dishes are repeated throughout the week, but everydays i was tasting something new; really!! Besides the buffet (for lunch and some dinners) you can have dinner at 4 more restaurants: the italian (the worst of them), the mexican and the steak restaurant (both great!!) and one that covers spanish \"tapas\" (so so). Breakfasts were great. As a matter of fact, I still miss them.... Beach: the beach is beautiful, awesome, really. We went to Playa del Carmen, and we were so pleased that our beach was much more private, and truthfully, much prettier. Although the hotel was full, the beach (and the rest of the hotel) never seemed to be crowded. I was afraid that the whole honeymoon would be ruined by a ton of people everywhere, but fortunately that was not the case. In the beach you can use some kayaks (included in the hotel rate) or a jetski (not included). Attractions: every day we did something. Snorkelling, trekking in some subterranean rivers, exploring some ruins (Tullum, Chichen Itza) and swimming with dolphins were the activities we picked up. But there was a lot more, like scuba, the parks (Xcaret, Xel-Ha, Xplore), go dancing to Cancun, etc. Really, this is a place to go for 2 weeks to get your share of adventure and rest. Otherwise, you will get no rest, like we did!! =) The overall experience was more than positive. The Mayan Riviera is a great place to go, and this hotel was great in our oppinion.

Always fresh and lots of choice. Our waiters were quick to learn who we were and had our drink orders before we even asked at the buffet!

You just show up and if it was busy you relax have a drink and enjoy the evening. Some people complain about the \"long walk\" to the lobby and main buffet but after sitting around eating/drinking all day it felt good to walk 5-7min to the lobby, seriously people relax you're on holidays. Drink service was great on the beach and at the lobby. The beach waiter would ask us how long till we wanted him back and like clockwork he came with refills... above the call of duty We get massages a few times a year and the spa at this resort tops most.

You won't find a better value in the Mayan... beachfront, private beach, private pool just for your room. No saving chairs or scrambling to find shade it's all there just for you.

We used sit n stroll as a car seat and a stroller (didn't bring another stroller) and worked great for us. We were concerned with car safety even though the law says that it's ok to have a kid on laps. If you bring a car seat, either pay for additional seat for the kid or stress that there should be space available. The hotel was nice, nothing too fancy. The lobby was nice and soft and relaxing, no flamingos or swans :). The hotel staff was amazing. From the moment we arrived, they were extremely helpful all the time. I wanted to give my son whole pasteurized milk and the buffet manager brought me the entire pack to make sure that I checked if that it what I needed and then let me keep that carton in our mini fridge. So helpful, the kid loves his milk. Otherwise the food in the buffet is good. Enough variety to pick out something that everyone will like. Again, I was more concerned that my son had something that he likes and he had plenty to choose from and ate well. Every night the buffet has a theme, though they still repeat a lot of the same dishes. The restaurants were good. We only tried the Mexican (that was just ok) and the Terrace where the food was actually very interesting and more or less gourmet. my husband and I love to eat at great restaurants but we were not coming here for food and we think that this hotel provides good quality and great variety. Rooms ... We booked the Privileged. The best part of it is that it was next to the beach. The room did not smell musky or stuffy like some hotels by the beach which was important to me. The room was updated with nice modern furniture and white linen (I hate '80s style quilts and bedding). But otherwise everything was old, the tile, the bathroom, the sinks. It would have been nice if they updated that too. But didn't ruin my vacation. And the most important part to us ... The beach...Gorgeous, clear water, you can see fish swimming around your feet. Not a lot of people on the beach so there is room to just be. Except for the areas with lounge chairs which you have to reserve at 6am! But I think that's any hotel. We spent most of the time at the beach and really just relaxed. The pool was great too, it was the kind that you can walk into and it gradually gets deeper, our son was able to get in on his own and sit on the edge and play with his toys. Awesome. Alcohol ... good stuff, not watered down and you can buy a nice bottle of wine if you want.

First, let me tell you that I am in my mid forties,originally from Europe, have traveled extensively, speak 6 different languages and am open to varied cultures. I am NOT a difficult person and neither is my husband. We are avid campers and can usually easily adjust to any type of vacationing environment. This review is not a close minded complain of a bitter American couple but a realistic commentary on what you get (or do not get) for your money at this place, if you expect a relaxing and comfortable vacation. Prior to arrival, I had requested a first floor room close to all amenities as I have limited mobility, and quickly found out that at Catalonia Privileged Beach Resort, also knows as Catalonia Maroma Beach Hotel, nothing is close...but you need to hike long distances to reach the lobby, the rooms, the restaurant...and no golf cart or little train is available, like in most resorts, if you are not fit for the hot and humid hike! This resulted in making our stay painful and miserable for me..and almost made us go home early ( our privileged room attendant could not relocate us in another hotel of their chain in the area but told us it was the responsibility of our travel agent). But let's be objective and look at the pros and cons of this mega resort: pros: - rather inexpensive deal for an all inclusive 4(?) star resort - beautiful privileged room suite ( # 4116) located in a pretty natural garden setting with exotic fauna and flora( many lemurs walk around the place!), with stunning dark furniture, tiled floor, peach and terra cotta colored walls and updated decor, step- in shower with rain shower top and hand held shower, two queen size beds with wonderfully comfortable mattresses with pillow tops, a nice semi private walk out patio with two chairs, lots of storage space, a TV with many international channels...Our room quickly became our haven( which is a shame on a vacation!) - air conditioned privileged small check- in area with courteous escort to the room ( while the main lobby is NOT air conditioned but extremely humid) - convenient car rental and tour booking facility in the main lobby with multilingual attendant - souvenir shops where purchases can be charged to your room - upscale restaurants serving European and Mexican cuisine ( two with air conditioning) - a pool-side cr\u00eaperie offering cr\u00eapes snacks all afternoon by the pool - a self-service small lunch buffet located by the pool - efficient and caring bell hop, very effective in calling taxis etc.(Although I had to speak Spanish with him). Very polite buffet staff. cons: - although rooms are air conditioned, it is set to never really get cool to American standards of comfort - pool: the pool water was an uncomfortable 90+ degree, no lounger/chair could ever be found as people set their towels first thing in the morning to reserve a spot and leave it there, even when leaving for part of the day - there is no shaded area inside the pool at all to get respite from the sun - no swim up bar, but an area bar with long lines and priority given to cute 20 some year old girls with mini bikinis ( I was one of the only guest wearing a one piece bathing suit and stared at strangely). Alcohol served for mixed drinks is not top shelve brands. - most of the tourists are rather young and from Spain, Italy and France, with very few Americans, and the animation team caters to them(language, culture, humor, activities).Very little English is spoken by staff, which made it hard for my husband who does not speak Spanish. - smoking is allowed everywhere and is a big nuisance at the beach, the restaurant, the lobby area and the pool as a majority of the European guests smoke - most guests spend their day sunbathing and staring at/assessing one another ( we felt very uncomfortable! When we tried to smile or talk to people, they did not return our smiles.) - many young families with small children vacation here, and their running around unsupervised and screaming at the beach and the pool make it everything but relaxing for other guests - the twenty some crowd did get out of control, throwing some guests in the pool, even threatening to throw in some of the staff etc, making us feel like in the middle of a US spring break beach nightmare! - food served at the individual restaurants ( Italian, Mediterranean and Mexican) is upscale but \"Nouvelle Cuisine\" style. Expect a fancy presentation, but very tiny portions. Very seldom did my husband and I feel satiated after eating dinner. It would have been fine if the quality had compensated for the quantity, but it was not the case. Most meat (pork, beef) was very hard, and many dishes served without any carb side ( potato, rice etc.). In additions, you could not make reservations for these places and often had to wait in line for a table. In brief, we found these locales more pretentious than satisfactory and resorted to go back to the general buffet. After reading other reviews, it appears that the restaurant situation might be worse during the summer vacation months. - Although the buffet offered a variety of dishes, it lacked air conditioning and was infested with mosquitoes that feasted on us and forced us to eat quickly and uncomfortably! It was also located next to the main lobby, which was quite a hike away from our room! - American dollars are not accepted in the hotel boutiques ( although they accept Canadian dollars, pesetas from Spain etc.) - the evening shows are rather juvenile, and do not feature local dance or music groups as other resorts do - we encountered very few American tourists, maybe because it is a Spanish chain and summer vacation for Europeans. I found out quickly that if I spoke Spanish or French, I would receive a better and more polite service than if I spoke American English! - although the hotel brags about having the nicest beach around( Maroma Beach), we wondered what standards they use to rate it ( its size????). Once more, it was over crowded and loud. There, as well, we had trouble finding a lounger in the shade. The sand is pristine but the swimming area infested with large sea weeds that hinder the swimming. We resorted to taking a cab and visiting a smaller hotel with a more private beach, which was in our eyes, a much more relaxing and enjoyable experience. So...if you are American and are looking for a romantic vacation or just a relaxing couples experience...Catalonia Maroma is NOT the place to go! We will never to go to one of the Catalonia resorts again!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olney, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Vacation\u201d", "Author": "dee_cline_556", "ReviewID": "UR116523000", "Content": "We had a wonderful time at this resort.

Room: We stayed in a honeymoon privilege room in building 4. We had a corner room (#4211) which was really nice and offered tons of privacy while using the jacuzzi on the balcony. The room has been remodeled but the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover. We had no issues with the in room safe. The amenities include robes (no slippers), shampoo, bath gel, body lotion and hairdryer. Stocked mini-fridge with Sol beer, orange soda, pepsi regular and diet, 7up and water bottles. An iron and ironing board are provided, however it is a small tabletop ironing board which makes ironing dresses and pants difficult. The lighting (as in all AI's) is not that great for applying makeup. Grounds: The grounds are well maintained. We always saw someone watering or pruning the shrubs, sweeping the walkways and washing the windows. We have read comments were people say it is such a long walk from the main lobby/buffet area back to the beach. We did not find that to be true compared to all the walking we did when we stayed at the Iberostar and the VIM. This resort is very easy to navigate. It is basically one straight pathway from the beach/pool area right to the lobby. Pool: While not that large it was a fairly good size pool. The water was HOT and not refreshing at all. Guess thats what happens when you go in July!! No swim up bar but i knew that before i booked. Beach: Beautiful!! Staff members would rake up all the seaweed in the morning and bury it. Water was warm with some very small waves. You can walk (barefoot) for miles in either direction. We walked to the iberostar complex and it took us about 35 minutes one way. Towel game was in FULL force. I hate the game but as they say, if you can't beat them join them. Hubby would go out at 6:30 every morning to 'reserve' a spot in the shade. There is a privilege and a non-privilege side beach. I am not one for seperating people based on a 'status' and i was thankful that this was not enforced. People sat where ever they could find a spot. We actually saw a few couples sit on the beach beds that are reserved for the \"suites only\" and they were never asked to move. Drinks are served on the beach by a nice hard working guy named Enrique. Food: First of all this is very subjective. Overall, we liked the food. We would walk up to the main buffet for breakfast and lunch. Ask to sit in Gabriels section he is very good. For dinner we went to the Italian twice. We had Fabio for our waiter ~ excellent. The steak restaurant is outside. Food was okay. Be sure to ask for your steak well done. It will not be overcooked at all. I ordered mine medium and it was not good!! Make sure to order the lime sorbert it was yummy! We didn't care much for the food at the Mexican restaurant. We went to the tapas twice. It would be much more enjoyable if all the dining areas had a/c. Men do NOT need to wear pants to any of the restaurants. Photos: We had photos taken on the beach. They do not charge to take the pictures they only charge for the pictures you purchase. 5x7 are $15.00 and 8x10 are $20.00 not sure how much they charge for larger size prints. Spa: We had a 30 minute couples massage and had full use of the sauna, steam room and hot tub. That was a free perk because of the room category we booked. Mosquitoes: Phew.....they are out morning, noon and night. Horrible!! You need to use bug spray or the cutter bug wipes. While we were there we were approached by Roberto and asked if we would be interested in going to their other resort in Tulum. We declined. I asked him why they were doing this and he said the resort was over booked. The guests at this resort are mainly europeans. Americans were the minority. Thats not a bad thing and i knew that prior to booking. Any and all of the announcements are done in 3 languages. Spanish, French and English. I did hear a few of the American guests complaining about that. Overall we had a very nice time.

The garden view rooms are the best. The walkways to the eating areas, the beach and pools are surrounded by very tall tropical foliage, so these various creations have a sufficient area to live in. We recommend the deluxe rooms as they are modern and worth the extra. You should note that the resort is 3 floors and there are limited elevators (if any, we didn't see any). The beach is spectacular. We had just recently gone to another Catalonia resort, which was great, but this beach is so much better. We thought the other Catalonia (Riveria Maya) was rated a top ten beach and we were wrong, Playa Maroma beach is the top ten beach (We got our Catalonias mixed up). We had a ground floor room with a patio and the room was great. According to our staff the rooms were updated a year or two again. Very nice bathroom and good space in the main room. The pools are average for a resort this size. No problems, just nothing out of the ordinary. Beach was easily accessable, plenty of chairs but we were there offseason so the crowd was smaller. The food was good and several of the reservation restaurants had very good food. You do need to ask about getting a lobster dinner as they seem to be limited and need to be reserved ahead of time. You can make reservations your first day but be sure to get all the information. PS- the number of times you can use a reseration resturant is based on the number of days you stay, the bufffet is always available and is better than average as they have some food stations. We did not know about the lobster dinners until it was too late, we assumed it was on the menu but you do have to reserve it ahead of time. There are several excusions from this hotel which is a few miles from Playa del Carmen. We went to X-Caret for a day trip which is a eco park resort that is very interesting if you are into that type of stuff, cenotes, floating bridges, a ocean/fresh water area, nice beach, lots of jungle, some jungle type animals, etc. Playa del Carmen is a good trip, 5th avenue is a cobblestone street the runs the lenght of the city one block from the beach. Lots of street performers for your free enjoyment. Also you can take the ferry from Playa del Carmen to the island of Cozmul (were you can rent a mini-car for the day), A very good day. The resort does have free transportation to Playa del Carmen or you can get a cab (check average prices with the resort, before booking a cab). We liked this resort much better than the other Catalonia resort because this was a nice mix and fit for us. Many Europeans and Canadians at this resort, Americans were few a far between. We liked that, whats the sense of going to another country full of Americans. Sometimes because of the many languages being spoke the resort staff may have some limitations in understanding your requests. You should note that if you have not gone to the Riveria Maya all of the resorts are about a mile off the main highway, they are all gated (some extra security) and many times have other resorts next to you, but it is hard to determine that unless you walk down the beach. Because of this you usually have to wear a braclet to identify your hotel. The bars have a good variety of drinks, you need to ask for upper shelf. The shows at night, well to be polite, they try but if you miss them, the bars are good! They do have a few nights with local merchants selling their goods, be sure to negotiate. PS, though tipping is not require, we found if you tip ahead, just a few dollars (US) you get a little more attention. We spoke to one of the staff who stated that staff earn about between $5-10 a day (US) sometimes working 12 hour day.

I have to say the staff and the animation team are some of the best we've experienced. We have travelled to many resorts in the Yucatan, Pacific and Cozumel and have not witnessed a more breathtaking beach than that of HCM. We've done the Iberostars, Rius and Barcelos and this hotel trully had the flavor of Mexico in it. It has a good slow down pace and at first you think it's a bit dated when you drive up on that long dirt road and see the open air lobby and you think, \"OMG, what have I gotten myself into?\" But after you enter and check in and you finally get to your room, you've encountered through the process some of the most wonderful and courteous people you've met in your life. {FYI, the reason the road is not in better conditions, is due to the fact that it is designated as a Natural Reserve.} You'll see this as you experience your stay. The resort is built within its natural jungle and habitat. We stayed in the Priveledged Section and Gabriel, our concierge was so kind and helpful. Like I said before the beach was very nice and the water for the most part was pretty clear. Remarkably, as hot as it was the sand was cool to the feet. My husband walked barefoot to the Iberostar to the left of the resort one day and the next day walked to the right of the resort up to the point, past Secrets. He said the water past Secrets was like Turks and Cacaois and Antigua. Most of our evening meals were in the Toscana,the italian restaurant, where we were greeted by name by Sylvia, the hostess and Fabio, the restaurant manager. They made sure our evening meals were unforgettable, providing excellent service and ensuring us it was their pleasure to serve us. The food in this restaurant was fantastic! We couldn't have been more pleased with our entire trip had we been at a luxury resort, as this team of staff went our of their way to make our stay one in which we would want to return. We spent most of our time on the beach, soaking up the rays are just standing in the ocean. Like I said, the Maroma beach area is one of the best we've experienced. We did participate in Archery every morning and laughed and carried on with the other attendees. It's true this resort is primarily visited by the Europeans,, we found them to be wonderfully friendly and courteous.

BEACH: The main reason we chose this resort over others was the beach. This resort has an excellent beach! Nice, soft, white sand with a gradual slope into the water that makes for easy swimming. Plenty of chairs in the sun but if you prefer shade, yes, you will have to get up early and play the chair game. You know, when people put a towel or book on a chair at 6 am only to return from a day off the resort at 4 in the afternoon looking for their reserved spot\u2026there is no use arguing the unfairness of this practice-just be aware that it happens. We were there with our toddler, so we were down at the beach early enough that this was not a problem for us, but for those who prefer to sleep in, it could be an issue. The only real downside of the beach area that I can think of is no real drink service-I think this is due to the size of the beach because it is quite large. RESORT: The resort is quite large and runs mainly vertical to the beach, with the buffet and lobby furthest away. We booked on Expedia and booked a Privileged room. While it has a fancy name, the room is really no different than any other room; however, there is a small office with Wi-Fi and drinks for guests of these rooms. By small office, I mean seating for 3-4 people at a time. I would definitely recommend these rooms for one reason-the close proximity to the beach. The privileged rooms are two of the closest buildings to the beach-just a 2 minute walk. On the other hand, they are the furthest from the lobby and buffet-about a 5-7 minute walk. We did not mind the walk, it is up a straight paved pathway and most evenings they had small vendors near the lobby selling various items. The room itself was nice and had updated furnishings and a television with the typical channels\u2026the bathroom, however, could use some updating. It has a shower, but no bathtub and the tile and fixtures are dated-they are clean, just dated compared to the rest of the room. Also, I will say that this resort does seem to cater to Europeans more than Americans. I had heard of some prejudice towards American\u2019s by staff members, but we did not experience any of that. FOOD: We thought the food was very good. It is an all-inclusive that serves many people from all around the world, so do not go expecting fine cuisine. That being said, I am a picky eater and always found food that was to my liking. The breakfast buffet was always plentiful with lots to choose from, and the same with lunch. At lunch the La Tortuga was open with hot dogs, and hamburgers, and other quick bites. It was very convenient since it is located closer to the beach and pool. The dinner buffet had different theme nights and we ate there most nights. We did eat at one a la carte, the Tio Pedro, and it was great. I would definitely recommend that your try it. You receive a \u201cpunch card\u201d at check in that will a lot you a la carte visits depending on how many nights you stay. The only downside to the food (and for us, the whole resort) is that do not have room service. I knew this when we booked and didn\u2019t mind; however, after a full day of swimming with a toddler, dinner for us would have been a lot easier if we could have ordered it in-just something to remember if traveling with small children.

And here are my opinions based on all the research I did before we went on our Honeymoon. And I researched everything! Let me start by saying if you're a beach person, this is the most beautiful beach ever! Good stuff: Beautiful jungle grounds, loved all the different foliage. The suites w/oceanfront view are AMAZING! Esteban & Enrique are amazing beach service staff!!! Loved, loved the coffee bar. Mexican & Italian dinners were amazing. Willingness of most staff to go above and beyond to please their guests is top notch. Massage in the spa was lovely. Not good stuff: The only air-conditioning during the day is in the shops and privilege office and your room. Lunch was a struggle because it was so hot everywhere. Check in process very disorganized regardless of whether you have communication with staff before you arrive it was 4 hours before we were in our room and I'd been up for 36 hours, the room wasn't the room we had asked for and decided to pay for the upgrade. Tapas is overrated with slow service & average food. European smokers (gross & for such a beautiful area very disrespectful). Here's the kicker, we enjoy letting loose a bit when we vacation....they serve drinks on the beach in plastic restaurant tumblers, the small ones. If and when its delivered, it is hot. There are ways to get around this such as bringing your own thermal container; however, we didn't know that and improvised after we did some thinking. Also you only get 2 cans of beer per day in your room along with 2 water bottles and 2 flavors of pop. All other resorts I've been to were a little more flexible here. It was necessary to get to know your servers, housekeeping staff and tip a bit to get things to go the right direction. We were supposed to do wedding photos on the beach, it seemed to make any arrangements, I always had to go to the office at very specific times. It seems that they expect you to be mindful of their time, but I didn't feel we got the same respect. I also think people should know from the beach to the lobby it is quite a walk, not that we minded it's about a 1/2 mile. All in all this turned out to be a great trip. We didn't do wedding photos, we did celebrate birthday and honeymoon. They made that special for us. Knowing what I know now I would go back to this hotel, because I know what to expect and how to work around some things and the value is immense. I don't think I'd take my kids because of all the smoking that goes on. These are all little things, but this is the truth given from a pretty low-maintenance American.

No AC in any of the restaurants, and in spite of what others have said, it's not comfortable. You don't \"get used\" to sweating while eating. Huge bugs all over the buffet area, while staff steps over or to the side of them. Our first AM there, we were eating in the bug-ridden buffet when it started pouring rain. We asked the concierge for an umbrella to get back to our room and he said \"No. Only one umbrella per room; sorry you didn't bring yours.\" No reservations allowed at the restaurants; you are just expected to hang outside of them until your name is called, while dripping with sweat. No where to sit, no drinks offered. And you can't take your unfinished wine glasses back to the room. Didn't even have plastic cups to use instead. The drinks are all alcohol-free regardless of the liquor bottles you see in the bars. They must be filled with colored water as I guarantee you can't taste (or feel the affects) of alcohol. The spa coupons are a joke. You cannot combine the coupons for one use, although it doesn't state that anywhere on the coupons, brochure or website. The female employees at this resort are unfriendly. The men are much nicer. The Europeans smoke a LOT and have no concept of personal space (or modesty for that matter.)

With so many to choose from, it was a hard decision but the reviews I read on this resort were pretty much what we expected. We went as a family - 2 adults + 10 & 12 year old boys. Here's the PROS: Great beach! Need I say more, great beach!! We visited Playa del Carmen and while they had a beautiful resort right on the beach downtown, the beach was no comparison to Playa Maroma. This was my #1 choice for this resort and they met it. The pool is big enough to spread out too and always had stuff to do! Fantastic service and always with a smile. Jacobo & Rolando were awesome bartenders at the pool bar. Those guys work their buns off & always with the smile! The buffet had plenty of selections everyday for breakfast and lunch. Jose was fantastic! He always made me cappuccino to perfection! If you chose to go to the restaurants, the Italian was excellent & the best service of all. We never ate at the steak place but we heard good things about it. The tapas has a beautiful view of the sea but is more for couples than a family with kids. The food was okay, not great. The animation team was phenomenal! They had yoga, water aerobics, salsa lessons, etc. in the pool area and tons of crazy games to keep you buys if you want to be busy. If not, you have the beach to relax since it's pretty big to spread out. If you wanted stuff to do, they had beach volleyball, beach soccer, etc. so you are always on the go. At night, the team has shows (Hollywood movies, Disney, Moulin Rouge, Mr. Catalonia in which people they choose 4 guys from the guests to compete & I've never laughed so much in my life. Johnny, Hassan and NIcko were hilarious and always made it a point to say hello by our name (I don't know how they memorize everyone's name but it was amazing). My favorite n ight was the beer contest at the disco & the dancing after that with people & their families dancing to Waka Waka & Danza Kuduro - what a blast! I have it all on video! Oh, and how can I forget Manuel and Gloria - always going around with their cameras taking pictures of the guests and so very nice! NOW, remember that this resort is mostly European (Italians, Spanish, French, Portuguese). I love Europeans & speak Spanish, Italian and a little French so I was in my element. If you are not that sort of person, then this place might not be for you. Everything is repeated in 3 languages so everyone understands. My kids learned a bit of French with some French Canadian visitors - so that was awesome. There were a lot more Americans there than I expected so it was a good surprise! The resort is getting popular with them now too probably based on reviews. CONS: The biggest complaint we had was that the pool closes at 8:00 p.m. What?? I've never been to a resort where the beach closes that early. What do you do when you have kids - hit the pool after dinner! Not an option here which was very disappointing. I would undestand closing at 10:00 p.m. but not at 8. I understand some people get a little tipsy and they don't want them in the pool but if a family is there supervising their kids, they should not penalize them because other people ruin it for everyone. The resort is very nice but it does need a little updating to be able to compete with all the others. This is not a luxury resort but it sure is very comfortable and gorgeous. it looks like a modern Mexican rancho style hotel which really makes you feel that you are in Mexico. You do need to get the road that goes into the resort paved (for goodness sake, get together with Maroma Resort & Secrets and pave that road). It's doesn't give one a good impression on entry but once at the resort, it was great. The priviledge rooms were comfortable and clean. The cleaning service was phenomenal. I would recommend that you upgrade to a priviledge room category and make sure to request building 6 which is the closest to the beach & pool but far enough that it is quiet. Other reviews said that the beds were hard, I loved ours. I slept like a baby everyday and I never sleep like that at home. The biggest complaint I had was at the front desk receiption area when we first came in - they were very disorganized but they did try to accomodate us as best as they could. Oh, and we all got Montezuma's revenge even though we ate very healthy but that's expected with a change in food. Not bad for our stay! I would recommend this resort to all my non-picky friends that love to have fun in the sun!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cOk.

The beach is AMAZING, you can walk for miles on either side, employees were spectacular, and our room (priviliged) was very nice. We had a great time, BUT there are some things you should be aware of before booking this resort if you're an American as we probably will not stay at this resort again... My boyfriend and I are two, late 20's young professionals. We are well traveled, and have stayed at other all-inclusives (Sandals, Couples) as well have cruised numerous times, but we dont stay at the Ritz. We liked nice places and such, but we arent the type to fly first class or expect to be waited on hand and foot....Here are my advisories if you're thinking fo staying here...It's long, but I'm trying to give you a clear picture of what to be aware of: 1. There are almost no Americans at this resort....I'm talking like 98% of the people staying here were Europeans. While I'm all for culture and such, we felt very isolated our entire trip. My guy never had anyone to watch and talk baseball with and I never found a woman to chat up the latest Hollywood gossip. We didn't go to socialize, but we are a pretty social duo and it would've been nice to find some friends while we were there. There was noone to chat up while at the pool, beach, anything, because no one spoke English... We paid to go into Playa twice and Cancun once, just because we kept getting bored. However, if you're one to stay to yourself and are fine with it, this will be no problem. 2. Since this resort is almost all Europeans, it totally caters to them. No, we never felt 2nd class or had anyone be rude to us, but at night, for example, there was never anything to do because the Europeans enjoy sitting around playing cards and we wanted live music, dancing, etc. After dinner we sort of laughed because we would sit on our patio in our room, listening to the live music from the Secrets resort next door, trying to find a way to sneak in and join in on their fun! Along with the no night life (they did a show every night, but it was super lame) , there was topless sunbathing, including pre-teens. This didnt bother me or him, in fact, I've been to a nude beach before, but I have a problem with a 12 year old going around topless. No one needs to see that and I most definitely wouldnt bring children or teens here because of that. 3. The food. Once again, caters towards Europeans, LOTS of breads (I'm insulin resistant and am supposed to limit my intake) and Lots of pastas and starches. I'm a big grilled chicken, fresh fruit, salad type of girl and found very little to eat. They didnt even have normal salad dressings for pete's sake, and I'm NOT a pickey eater, by any means. We went and grabbed Subway and kept it in our room to eat for lunch because we just didnt like the food. I'd read it was comparable to cruise food, but I think cruise food is much better!! Now, you do get passes to eat at the restaurants, but you can only go to each restaurant once, plus the Tapas once, if you're priviliged. So, that only gives you 4 nights of better quality food and we avoided the tapas b/c their menu just looked gross. The steak house and Italian was the best, but I'm sorry, food here is just a million times better. We didnt go to eat like pigs so it wasnt a huge issue for us, but I know people who LOVE to eat so if that's you, you will be disappointed. 4. You must always be totally dressed to grab food. I wore a nice, long J Crew tunic over my dry swimsuit to breakfast one morning and was told I had to have bottoms on to eat. It came to almost my knees but because it was a \"shirt\" it was inappropriate. Then another day while at the POOL grill, I was told I couldn't have on a swimsuit to run in and grab some food. I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous! It's a beach resort!!!! That really angered me.. 5. The resort doesnt take American money so if you're against getting Paseo's (not sure why you would be) it could annoy you. 6. We were there during a tropical storm and had 48 hours of hard wind and rain. The resort didnt offer anything to guests to compensate. No free shuttles to the casinos, no movie night, nothing. After being stuck in your room with a TV that has only 2 channels in English, having something fun provided would've been nice as we were about to go crazy!! 7. The rooms are NOT oceanfront. We knew this going in and didnt care, but if you love sitting on our patio starring at the beach, this could annoy you! Our first room, 6304 had a small oceanview but the air conditioned was awful (room never got below 78) so we were moved to room 5327. 5327 had no view but had AMAZING air and a super updated bathroom. The bathroom in 6304 was older and smelled of sulfer, but it wasn't a huge deal and we would've stayed had the air been working ok..There is a long walk to the lobby through a jungle so if you're not very mobile or into walking a lot, this would drive you nuts. We loved it though....we thought the jungle setting was neat along with enjoying the exercise! 8. NO air conditioning anywhere except your room. I'm not going to lie, sometimes it was super hot while trying to eat or while sitting in the lobby, but it was never unbearable. We enjoyed the bali style buildings with the thatched roofing, but some air would've been nice. It was near 100 every day and after walking 5 min to eat, you just want some air! 9. Pool bar service wasnt great. We arent big drinkers, but ordered drinks a few times while on the beach and they were never delivered. If you drink a lot and enjoy the great beach service on cruise ships and such, you will be disappointed. We truly did have a great vacay and for the steal of a price we got our vacation, we felt we got a good deal. I just feel there are resorts that offer better food, air conditioning, and entertainment for the same price we paid to stay here. I would come back here with a big group of my friends and our own rental car so that we could leave each night for some fun and normal food !! If you can afford it, pay to stay at the Secrets Maroma Beach.

Have your map ready when talking to the taxi driver or they will quote you a price for the wrong hotel and charge you way too much. And know the old name of the hotel as well. The Bad: This resort caters to Europeans. I found some of the European guests to be extremely rude. They walked 3 or 4 wide on the main path and wouldn't yeild a fair share of the walkway when passing. I'm confrontational and didn't put up with it. During meals at the buffet, they would literally step in front of me to get something when I was waiting for my turn. The bugs were terrible even with spray. The only place to get relief from the heat is your room because nearly all of the common areas are open to the elements. The entertainment was sort of cruise ship-like and it all catered to the Europeans. Going off the resort is substantially more expensive because the hotel is 20 miles north of Playa del Carmen. Although I listed a lot of bad things, I didn't find any of them all that aggrivating because the overall experience was great! The Good: The resort itself is beautiful and well manicured. We had 1st floor standard rooms and they were all clean and comfortable. Ants are a little bit of a problem, but it's a jungle. It's a good value for the money. The staff were all very nice as well. The beach was incredible. The pool doesn't have a swim up bar, but the pool is big and has lots of different places to swim. The pool may have been more crowded if the hotel was completely full. There is a waverunner rental nearby also...a must if you've never been on one. There are lots of attractions near Playa del Carment. I recommend Xcaret! There is an ATM, but you'll never find it unless you ask. Breakfast and lunch is all buffet and sometimes it was good and other times it was not so good. The hotel provides tickets to use at the non-buffet dinner restaurants and the food is excellent. The dinner buffet was pretty good, but not nearly as good at the non-buffet restaurants. And One FYI: Because there are Europeans, a few women went topless on the beach, but not at the pool.

I did TONS of research before I booked this place. I saw it on sale at cheapcarribean.com, looked it up on Trip Advisor, and that was good enough for me. I actually ended up saving a bit of money booking directly with the hotel. This hotel is definitely off the beaten bath, you literally drive on a dirt road to get there, but this is great since you have no neighbors and a lot of peace and quiet. We were greeted at the front desk with drinks and cool towels, and promptly checked into our room (4th building). The hotel layout is definitely unique, a long path cuts from the main lobby to the beach, with the room buildings on either side. The cool thing is that from your building, you can't see other buildings...so it's very private, completely surrounded by jungle, and it especially looks cool at night with all the little accent lights and yanni-esque music constantly playing in the background. The pools are great, plenty of shallow and deep places. They surround the crepe bar, which is a nice touch. The beach - AMAZING. Softest sand I've stepped in, and the water is cool blue and the perfect temperature. FYI - this is not so much a snorkeling beach, so don't expect to see lots of fish. This beach is for catching sun and relaxing, and the resort provides plenty of shaded (and non-shaded) chairs. SIDE NOTE: take a 10 min walk on the beach headed south, and you'll run into an abandoned mansion. It's open but all the walls are still up and it overlooks the water. It's a great place to explore and take pictures. Rooms weren't super fancy, and the bed was a bit hard, but people, this is a relatively cheap all-inclusive resort. They're clean and provide everything you'd want. Food - the buffet is decent, sometimes really good. You also get to eat once at 3 of the 4 restaurants (mexican, steakhouse, seafood, and itilian). These restaurants were great, not excellent, but great and the staff is nice to get you more of whatever you want. You can get as many drinks as you want, we preferred the mango daiquiri. My wife and I don't drink, and we had to return the first few drinks we got even though we said \"virgin\". We quickly learned that it's better to say \"no alcohol\", then the waiters will understand. ONE MORE THING...there's a lot of reviews about how Americans are minorities here and are treated differently. Yes, it seemed like most people weren't speaking english, so you do feel like a minority (which we thought was kind of cool). Treated differently? NO WAY. We were treated great, and many of the staff went out of their way to get us what we wanted or to try their English on us. No problems at all.

Overall we were very disappointed and would not stay here again. Before we booked our trip we read EVERY review - so I plan on telling you what all the other reviews had left out. Let's start with the rooms: There are 7 \"room\" buildings; Buildings 1, 3, 5 are on the South side of the property with #5 being the closest of those to the beach, #1 next to the main buffet and lobby. Buildings 2, 4, 6 are on the North side - #6 is closest to the beach and next to the pool. Building #4 (away from beach and pool) contain all the Honeymoon rooms. The only difference to the Honeymoon rooms (which we had booked) was that there is a large two person jacuzzi tub on the balcony. Really not worth the extra price just for that. None of these buildings have a view of the ocean or beach - just the jungle. We had booked the honeymoon room (upgrade) specifically because we were told it was on the beach with an ocean view. WRONG! Why anyone would want to go down to Playa and stay in a room where you can't see the beach or sea is beyond me - but \"to each his own\". The 7th building contains the Suites. There are a total of four suites - 2 on the ground level with a SMALL \"private\" pool and 2 with a sizeable balcony on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor suites have a very large, custom made whirlpool tub with a \"waterfall\" type spigot mounted high enough on the wall that we actually used it as a shower. We were upgraded to this room for the last half of our trip after having a meeting with the general manager about our \"disappointments\". These suites sit RIGHT ON THE BEACH and FACE THE SEA. The views are simply gorgeous! If you must stay here (as I do not recommend this resort) these are the only rooms to stay in!!! That being said, we enjoy our privacy; The first floor suites with the small pool offer NO PRIVACY whatsoever. So, if you are like us and had envisioned a romantic \"skinny dip\" in your private pool, BEWARE! Your terrace is combined with the suite next door and the paths around the building take all who walk on them within 2 feet of your pool/terrace. The 2nd floor suites were private enough to enjoy the tub/shower/each other in nothing more than your \"birthday suit\". Okay, so now you're down to only 2 rooms out of 300-400 that are acceptible by most peoples standards. Whoever designed this resort was a complete idiot! You have one of the most beautiful beaches on the Riviera Maya but only 4 rooms face the sea/beach. Just a waste of prime vacation real estate. You will have a LONG walk to the beach staying in any room other than the suites. The food - except for the ice cream the food was BAD to edible. The buffet is a joke. Very small, very few selections. They find a way to put ham in just about everything. So, if you don't eat ham (as I don't) you need to get very creative to find a meal. The Tapas restaurant that many here raved about must have spent WAY too much time at the bar before eating there. Even there the food was, at best, just edible. Service is poor. Expect to get up and get your own drinks. We actually had a \"waiter\" take a drink order from us on the beach (pleasantly suprised at first) BUT THEN HE NEVER RETURNED WITH OUR DRINKS!!! I mean, REALLY!! Why even take the order? To be clear - we did not wait 5, or 10, or even 20 minutes. We waited OVER AN HOUR to see if he would bring the drinks. Never happened. The grounds are beautiful but, at the same time, boring. It is mostly jungle with a straight LONG path from the lobby to the beach. All you see is the same plants and trees on either side of the walkway. Gets really old really fast. Again, as with the layout of the buildings - this was not thought out well at all. My 10 year old daughter would have done a better job designing this place. You are 15-20 miles from Playa (5th Ave). About a $25 cab ride each way as the resort no longer offers a free shuttle. We were diving a lot on this trip so we rented a car. I would recommend this. I've read all the horror stories about renting a car down here but we had NO problems. We used ZIPP rent-a-car. Car was crappy but it ran well, had good A/C and got us where we wanted to go without a problem. Total cost was $290 for the entire 10 nights and that included ALL INSURANCE with ZERO deductible. GREAT DEAL. They even pick you up at the airport and bring you back to the airport after you return the car. We used it on day to go all the way down to Tulum. Just drive as if you were taking your drivers test with the guy from the DMV next to you and you will not have any issues. For the same (or less) money you have many better options for a vacation on the Riviera Maya.

I just returned from my vacation, it was the 2nd year in a row I have gone to Catalonia Playa Maroma, last year I went on my Honeymoon, this year I took my Family. This year I was on the bottom floor room 6117, our sliding door was facing the pool, right at the end of the building by the walkway. I complained about my sliding door the first night we got there, NO RESPONSE, I went to the desl to ask for a different room, NO RESPONSE, our safe in our room quit working the 3rd day we were there, we called the front desk NO RESPONSE, the last night we were there our room was broken into through the sliding glass door while we were eating the lobster dinner upstairs. We had 2 wallets, 3 cell phones, 1 Nikon camera, plus other small items STOLEN from us. Our sliding door was in plain sight of the pool area, there was no question it was a inside job! When we discovered the missing items the next morning, I started asking around, I quickly found 2 other couples who had called the front desk to tell them their room safe was not working, NO RESPONSE!!! We did not so much as get an apology from anyone at the resort, we just happen to be flying home that day we realized we had been broken into. My daughter had to call 5 times to get her TV in her room working, her toilet quit working twice in the 5 days we were there. I cannot stress enough to find somewhere else to stay, all they would need to do to all of the bottom floor rooms is install a simple bar on the sliding glass doors so no one could break the latch like they did to us. The fact this was done in the daylight right by the pool area makes it very clear it was a inside job!!!!!!! Twice we found the maid in our room for no reason, even though we had the sign on our front door that said keep out!

No complaints the first trip. This is a rustic resort that caters to Italians and French travelers. You will have to find english speaking travelers, they are few and far between. We spent 6 days here and did not receive good customer service. Upon arrival one of our two rooms (6114) toilet didn't flush for two days. The TV did not work for two days. The safe in the other room (6117) quit working and we called the front desk to request new batteries for our safe. We are certain this put the theives in motion. The patio door in room 6117 did not close properly and we believe the thieves broke in through the patio door. I would definitely not stay on the 1st floor at any resort again. No one ever responded to the request for batteries and unfortunately being in vacation mode our guard was down and we forgot to follow up on this. Our bad. So on the last night of our trip we left room 6117 at 6:15 pm and returned at 9:15 pm. The next morning we discovered 3 cell phones, 2 wallets and a $750.00 Nikon camera gone. We called the front desk to report the theft and security responded - he did not speak english. An interpreter showed up to translate but no action was taken as they were well aware of the fact we were leaving at 1:00pm for the airport. The theif did not take our passports. I'm sure they didn't need them and wanted us to go on and leave the country. There was no police report written and the hotel did not offer comp our $200 meal from the night before. Very poor customer service. The concierge Roberto just stood there and let us know we did not have to leave the room at the normal check out time. Gee Thanks! We will not return to this hotel.

First of all I cannot think of one negative thing to say. This was our 12th time to the area and we generally stay at different resorts and this was our favorite. From my observation it looks like they have done a facelift. Fresh paint, rooms look updated. (except for some bathrooms). We got the honeymoon suite(not on our honeymoon) and the jacuzzi bathtub on the patio was the highlight of my afternoon. Big enough for at least two people. I read that they cater to Europian's which I did not find that to be true. Everyone was treated the same which was fantastic. The staff was great. Ali and Bruno at the front desk were wonderful along with Fabio at the Italian restaurant, Mercedes at poolside and Hector and Melanie with the animation team. So many others, but can't recall everyone's names. The beach was very clean. Food was amazing and the best presentation I have ever seen. The ocean water was beaufiful. We are seasoned Caribbean travelers and this is one of the best beaches we have ever seen. We found plenty of Americans to chat with. About 25 palapas on the beach and each will accomadate 4 people. Also plenty of canvas covered areas to get out of the sun. Getting a chair either in the sun or shade was never a problem. No bugs in the room and very clean. They sprayed everyday outside for mosquites so that was never a problem. Tipping is nice, but if you don't you will still get great service. Limitations on ala carte restaurants. We tried them all and don't have a favorite. Buffet was delicious. If you don't have enough water or beer in your mini fridge, just ask for more. But come, we all get enough at the bar. You're in your room to shower and sleep. Also our remote control for the TV may have got scooped up in the sheets by housekeeping and Bruno from the front desk quickly had another one delivered. Thanks, Bruno. So in closing anyone that complains about this resort, shame on you for being so spoiled that you were not happy there. Check in and check out were a breeze.

Last year, we stayed at the Catalonia Yucatan and it was amazing. We were so satisfied with the service we received that we really wanted to stay with the Catalonia brand. I researched the Cat Playa Maroma months in advance and we were not disappointed with this resort. We vacationed the week of April 29th, 2011. We arrived about 10pm. Check in was a breeze. We were welcomed with champagne and a cool towel. We were offered a room upgrade but declined. We are only in the room to sleep and shower. We have bells and whistles at home, we don't need them on vacation. We were not disappointed with the basic room. We were in Building 1, Tulum. Very close to the buffet and lobby. Our room was located on the 2nd floor and was spacious and most importantly, clean. The king sized bed was comfortable. More comfortable than our vacation last year! Very pleased with the room! The AC wasn't really pushing the air out, but the ceiling fan above the bed kept the room cool. From our room to the beach is about a 3 or 4 minute walk at a comfortable pace. From our room, you walk the 'red mile' to reach the pool area. We called it the red mile because the pathway to the pool is made of red brick. The Pathway is beautiful. It is set within the rain forest. Soothing music plays as you make your way. Over the course of your stay, you will be sure to meet some Coatis as well. The cutest lil family of animals I have ever seen. It takes all you have not to pick them up and squeeze them ;) The coatis seem to be a cross between a raccoon and ant eater. The pool is beautiful. One gigantic pool with shallow and deep areas. We aren't really pool people, but we did splash around for a bit. Pool was cool and clean. The animation staff usually had games or aerobics going in the pool too! Loungers surrounded the pool, with shade covering them. Beside the pool you will find the beach bar, Creperie and snack bar. As you walk past the pool, you will come to the most beautiful beach you have ever layed your eyes on. All of our days were spent here. Soaking in every second of this beach. Palm trees and plenty of loungers we placed through out the beach. Maroma Beach has cool white sand and the most amazing crystal clear blue green colored water. As many have said, there are more loungers than people. You def don't need to be up at 6am playing the towel game....unless you want shade.Then you might want to get up and save yourself a seat. The first few days of our stay, the water was really wavy. So much fun playing in the waves. There is always a welcomed cool breeze on the beach, it was HOT our week! Remember your sunscreen and reapply often! We always bring 15, 45 and 60. You'll still come home with an amazing tan! As our week passed, the waves calmed and the skidoos and catamarans were out. You can walk Maroma beach in either direction forever....This beach is surrounded by 5 star resorts, so to experience this resort for a price that wasn't 5 star, is amazing! Although the resort isn't 5 star, I felt it was a solid 4 stars. All workers are friendly. I will confirm what many others have said, this resort is mainly European. But think about it, the Catalonia is owned by people from Spain, so of course they are pushing it to the Euros. We are Canadian and did not feel uncomfortable at all. We did not feel like a minority because we spoke english either. Many of the employees spoke a bit of english, and those who did not, always found a way to understand you. Remember, a smile and an Hola go a long way :) I need to point out a 'security issue' we had. One day we came back to our room after an amazing day at the beach. We found a note stating that our safe was left open when the maid came to clean the room. The note also said we needed to call the front desk to have someone come to open it for us. Our jaws hit the floor. We had our passports, all of our cash, wallets and a Canon DSLR camera in there. We frantically called the front desk. A member of the security team came promptly and opened the safe. Security stayed while we combed thru the contents of the safe to be sure everything was there. I am so very pleased to say, every dollar was still there! Amazing! This is how things should be, but aren't always. We were so so so pleased. Our maid could have made off quite well - so glad to hear she was honest. This says alot about the Catalonia, their staff and their morals. The food at the resort was good. We always found lots to eat and enjoyed our meals. The buffet did get repetitive, but what buffet doesn't after 7 days. We were here during Easter and the spread they put on for Easter dinner was nothing short of amazing! There was food and decor everywhere. They had everything, including roast turkey and it was good!! We only made it to one A La Carte and that was the Italian. The restaurant is beautiful with modern decor. Service was outstanding and food was great! We loved the creperie. Made for a lovely afternoon snack. The snack bar was ok. We preferred to head to the buffet for lunch. If you have kids, the snack bar would be great...typical food - burgers, dogs, fries, nuggets, salad. Some points to remember: *No towel cards. Need a new towel or two, just go grab one. The towel exchange is located by the pool. *Sunrise. AMAZING! The sun comes up directly over the water. Be sure to get up extra early at least one time during your stay and bring your camera. You won't be disappointed. *The resort only accepts Peso, Canadian dollars and Euros - NO US DOLLARS. There is a money exchange located beside the reception desk. You can still tip in USD though. *If it happens to rain, there are umbrellas in the closet of your room. *Not a whole lot of nightlife going on....we came for relaxation and weren't on vacation to party. if this is what you are looking for, this is the place to be! *The resort is safe. It is well off the main road. We never felt worry or unsafe. *You get two bottles of water in your minifridge each day. Remember to take the bottles with you for refills. There is safe water to drink at all of the bars and restaurants. *Do your homework. I often see people complaining about a certain point that was posted in many reviews and wonder how these people choose a resort or how they did not know something.....I research any resort heavily before travelling. I don't want any surprises. If you know what you've booked, there won't be any room for disappointment! Overall, we had a wonderful vacation. We came home relaxed and had amazing tans. The resort is beautiful, the beach is amazing and the staff were accommodating. It was a week in paradise. We will return, with a beach like Maroma, how could you not!

Overall, it is definitely a really nice 3.5 star hotel, with some details scoring 4+ stars and others just barely 3. We stayed for 4 nights and our expectations were to walk on the beach, swim in the ocean, lay out at the pool, eat and drink in beautiful surroundings, and just relax with each other. We are in our late 20's/early 30's. PROS -REALLY nice employees. All of the workers would consistently greet us with an, \"Hola!\" and smile, even when we were just walking past them, and they were all very eager to help us. -The beach is beautiful and it has cool, white sand and clear water. A LOT of chairs available and a lot of shade available. There was a lot of seaweed in the ocean the first 2 days we were there, so a worker was constantly raking the beach clear those days. -Everything, from the grounds to the rooms to the pool, was clean. -Entertainment was great and more interactive than most hotels! All day the animation team members were leading multiple activities around the pool and beach (volleyball, salsa dancing, Spanish lessons, water aerobics etc). The entertainment varied each night; it included great live music (mostly American hits!) and dancing in the lobby, a stage show, a pool party with live music and dancing, as well as a \"Mexican fair\" one night with free games (which was corny at first but then really fun!). Entertainment is not on our priority list and we normally do not participate in it nor care about it, but this hotel did an excellent job and this is one of the reasons I really enjoyed our short stay. -Excellent coffee/ espresso drinks at every bar. -The pool always had an available chair when we arrived at 10am- sometimes we had to move them from the sun to the shade, but that's no big deal. Loved that the pool was gradually sloping like a beach. and there was always music playing. -The Tapas bar, and the Italian restaurant, and The Privileged cocktail hour on the terrace. CONS -The buffet food selection. And basically everything at the Steak house. - The only air conditioning on the resort is in your room, the Mexican and the Italian restaurants. We got used to it after the 2nd day, but it is an adjustment, especially when you are eating. Our room A/C was barely working in our room the first day, so we called the front desk. 30 min later someone was there and fixed it so it was very comfortable for the rest of the trip. -No elevator. Don't make the mistake of bringing your own luggage to your room on the third floor! -Check in was a little annoying and felt unorganized. We were there about 2pm. Our room wouldn't be ready for another hour so we ate and walked around a little. At 3pm our room was still not ready and they said 10 more minutes, so we chose to keep waiting in the lobby and then in ten minutes, they said 5 more minutes and so on. You can see how aggravating this can become when you just want to get cleaned up and start your vacation. -Although most of the resort was really nice, some visual details around the resort were overlooked that stopped it from feeling like a 4 star hotel, like the fountain not working in our courtyard (it just looked dry and sad) and the old, small cups at the pool and some chips on the glassware through out the resort. -The Privileged bed was pretty hard. The pillow service helped a lot, but the sheets were very scratchy. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the CPM. This hotel has a lot of great qualities and met our desires pretty well. As a side note, we really enjoyed the European influence, and while on vacation, our focus is on each other, as opposed to meeting and hanging out with the other guests. If you want to meet and hang out with new people, or if language barriers between other guests may irritate you, then you may not enjoy this resort as much as we did.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip! Great Service!\u201d", "Author": "MCDomzal", "ReviewID": "UR110392094", "Content": "We stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma from Sunday May 15 through Thursday May 19. We had a great time!. We previously read on Trip Advisor about the long and bumpy dirt road from the highway to the resort, so we were prepared. Our van from the airport had 3 couples \u2013 the first was dropped off at the Valetin Imperial Maya. The road from the highway to VIM was beautifully landscaped with trees and flowers and elaborate decorations. But when we pulled off the road to head to the CPM, it was quite a different story! If you were not prepared for this, I think it would have been quite scary (and I could tell the other couple was thinking, wow, I am glad we aren\u2019t staying at this place!) When you pull up to the resort, it isn\u2019t much to look at. There was no elaborate lobby full of marble and lights and flowers. Just very simple d\u00e9cor. We were greeted at the lobby and our bags were gathered by a bellman, who directed us to the bar to get our first drink, and then meet him at the other end of the lobby. We were then taken from the lobby building down the long walkway to the privileged lounge to check in. Our room was ready (it was about 1:30 PM) and we got a room on the second floor in building 6 - near the pool and the beach. I had sent an email to the hotel requesting Building 6 earlier in the week. So not sure if that is why we got a room in this building or not \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t hurt! The bellman waited while we checked in and then took us to our room. He was great!! While we walked to our room he told us all about the resort. Once in the room, he showed us all the amenities and gave us the most important tip of all \u2013 don\u2019t close the door all the way when you are on the balcony or you will be locked out!! As everyone has already attested to, the beach is absolutely beautiful! CPM has added about 15-20 palapas on the \u201cprivileged\u201d side of the beach (privilege beach section is not enforced). Because I am an early bird and liked to watch the sun rise about 6:00 each morning, I was able to reserve our palapa each of our 4 mornings there. We loved it, as it was a bit more \u201cprivate\u201d. Sitting in the long row of chairs under the gazebo, chair-to-chair, would not have been as good \u2013 especially if you got stuck next to someone smoking on the beach. But our experience under the palapa was outstanding. There was a wonderful gentleman who took drink orders and brought drinks out to the beach area. He was outstanding, and was definitely one of the hardest workers around! I wish I could remember his name. Before we went, we had read all the \u201chorror stories\u201d about the long walkway from the lobby to the pool area. We had read people\u2019s stories saying it took 15 minutes to walk, while others said it took 3 minutes. So I timed it a few times \u2013 and I would say it was about a 5 minute walk at a leisurely pace. No big deal at all. And you often got to watch the coatis walking around and listen to the soothing piped in music as you wandered down the pathway. The food overall was good. Lots of selections at breakfast and lunch. My wife loved the celery, cactus and pineapple juice. Also, all of their grilled fish was outstanding at the buffet! The buffet did get hot at lunch time though, so be prepared. We ate lunch at the snack bar one afternoon \u2013 did not like it too much, and so we made the treck up to the buffet for the rest of our lunches. It was a good break from the sun! Our favorite dinner was at the Italian restaurant. Service was outstanding, and we thought the house white wine there was pretty good (and our glasses were constantly refilled.) Our least favorite restaurant was the Tapas. Although the food was extremely well presented, we were not overall impressed with it. (of course, our feelings may have been impacted by the wait time that night \u2013 which was about 75 minutes \u2013 when we got upstairs, we saw a wedding party which was likely the cause for the wait.) We also tried the Mexican restaurant, which was pretty good. We did not eat at the Steak House (note that the seating at the Steak House is all outside from what we could tell.) The room was updated and exactly as shown in the pictures. The bathroom, however, had not been remodeled \u2013 so it was the old white tiles you have probably also seen in the pictures. But it was very clean \u2013 so no big deal. My wife said that the lighting is really poor in the sink area \u2013 so it was difficult to put on makeup. And bring your own hairdryer if you want to do any hair-styling as the one provided had 2 settings \u2013 incredibly low and blasting. As stated by many posters, the A/C left a little to be desired. From what we could tell, it was motion sensor activated. So it got pretty warm in the room during the night. We were ok during the day, but it could have stood to be a little cooler. We left the ceiling fan running full blast all day. We didn\u2019t call for service because we didn\u2019t believe that it was broken, just a system they have in place to conserve electricity. For the record, the hotels at Disney World have the same system. We were most impressed by the service levels \u2013 and the attitudes of the employees. Everyone seemed to love their jobs, and this was very evident from the way we were treated. By the way, we speak only English \u2013 and did not feel discriminated against in any way. Unfortunately, the most obnoxious people we encountered were speaking (well actually generally yelling) in English \u2013 so a bit embarrassing to us\u2026 If you have any questions, feel free to send me a private message.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAmericans dont't stay in Catalonia Maroma you will be discriminated!!!!\u201d", "Author": "LosAngelesSummer", "ReviewID": "UR110296139", "Content": "I read every single comment about this hotel before I booked it.

This is the place if you like the beach-amazing water, no surf, no shells, powder sand. Great for little kids to play or a dip in the water to cool off. If you like to snorkel, this is not the place. There isn't much. The property has plenty of palapas and shade - which is important given how hot it can get. We upgraded to \"privilege\" status/booking and it was worth it! Our room was closer to the beach, the food and amenities were better and the privilege beach was nicer. Here is an overview to help: The beach/water: This is our most important factor. This is by far one of the most beautiful beaches! Great for walks and lounging. Beautiful water. Privilege palapas are nice. You do have to play the \"towel game\" to get a good spot. We like to watch the sunrise (at 6:00 am) so it wasn't a problem for us. If you get there late though, you will be in the back. The beach service for drinks though is unreliable. But that's not a priority for us. Bring sunscreen (at least 50). We saw too many people not used to the sun get painfully burned. Don't buy it there...it's $$$$. The rooms: We liked our room. We were in the 4000 block. Don't pay for ocean view. The tree line would prevent it. Our room was clean and comfortable. Maid service was great. Tip the maid and we got more water than we knew what to do with! Tip: write them a nice note letting them know what you need. Yes, they clean late in the afternoon but they can't help it. It's a large property with a lot of rooms to flip. They do a great job. One night our ceiling fan went out. We told the front desk and it was fixed by the evening. The bed didn't bother us. After a day on the beach, we were too tired to notice the quality of a mattress. The bathrooms are nice and plenty of closet space, etc. Tip: bring a scented candle with you to caribbean properties. If you aren't used to the smell of humidity/moisture then it may bother you. We always grab a candle from The Body Shop at the airport. The food: OK...this is where they need work. Why Catalonia properties won't address this, I don't know. This is the second Mexican Catalonia property we went to. This is the second time we notices this. We are NOT \"foodies\" so we aren't picky. We come to play and relax, not to eat. But the quality of the food if warranted our attention. Parajito Buffet: All meals were OK. Their selection gets reduondant. They need ice cream at every meal! The building has no A/C. You get used to it. Pick a spot under the fan. They need more Mexican food! That's what we are there for. I don't know anyone who wants roast beef and gravy in 80 degree weather. We never had a problem with the service or the cleanliness here. This was our \"go to\" place. The Tortuga day service: Don't do it! This MUST be fixed by the property. The food was cold and we got there when it first opened. I got an intestinal \"event\" from eating their hamburgers. Just stay away. The Italian and Steakhouse: They were OK. The Italian has A/C which is nice. Good wine selection. Great service. Try the grouper! We never ate at the Mexican place. The Tapas Place (Privilege only): Wonderful! Great food and service. Beautiful deck to enjoy the ocean. Worth it! The drinks/bar: The front lobby was great. The beach bar is not good. We aren't \"drinkers\" but even noticed the slow service. The drinks are not good quality, etc. Keep it simple and you'll be OK (rum/coke, etc). Also, bring a large plastic cup of your own. If not, they have small little cups. They will pour into a larger cup if you have one. The grounds/the walk: We liked this! Some complain about the walking. We thought it was great. If you have limited mobility this would be an issue. Otherwise, it is nice to get a walk. The promenade from the front lobby to the beach/rooms gives you a taste of \"the tropics.\" They even pipe in New Age music for an ambient effect. There are no elevators in the buildings. But we needed the exercise to the third floor after all we ate! The spa: Not worth it. Sorry. We did a massage and \"aqua therapy\". We have had much better. And it is located where guests walk by, make noise, etc. Excursions: We snorkeled in Puerto Morelos this time. Not worth it. Do the Mayan Adventure tour where you snorkel Akumal. Xel-hal was not worth it to us either. But would be great for families or those nervous about snorkeling, etc. Go to Tulum! In all, we really enjoyed our trip. For the $$$, this was worth it. We traveled without kids, but we have 3. I think they would've been bored here. Not enough to do. As Americans, we were in the minority and that wasn't a problem. You can get by without Spanish here, but really....try to use the language. Yes, there are a lot of Europeans and that was just fine. **Sorry, I don't get Americans complaining about others. If anything, we were embarrassed by the conduct of some of the other American adults at the property. They were loud, obnoxious and would wear the baseball caps to dinner, etc. So it's all relative. ***", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "RoseinNY", "ReviewID": "UR109882967", "Content": "I just returned from a nice relaxing 4 days at the Catalonia Playa Maroma. This trip was booked very last minute and I got a great deal. Something to consider-this resort is a decent size but it is by no means a mega resort. We stayed at barcelo maya last year and this was a baby compared to that. Still there is a lot of walking...we counted and it is at least a 1/2 mile to 3/4 of a mile from the lobby to the pool. ROOM: We stayed in a \"priveledged room\". It was lovely. Updated furniture, very clean, flat screen tv, comfy beds and a pillow menu! Also we were put in a nice quiet area of the building so we didn't hear doors slamming all night, I am a light sleeper and can't stand that!! The room was very clean. No musty smell!!! Ac worked beautifully and there were no bugs!! PRIVELEDGED: ok so as you read above we upgraded to a priveledged room which was lovely, however, there is not much difference in the \"privedged\" experience then just your basic room. If it weren't for the nicer room I wouldn't have upgraded. POOL: Pool was very pretty and warm! I couldn't believe how warm it was compared to other hotels I have stayed at in which the pools are freezing! Pool is open late as well, not sure what time they actually close it but we would be walking to dinner around 8pm and there were still people swimming. BEACH: AMAZING! Seriously, playa maroma is the best beach in mexico. Unbelievable clear turquoise water, the sofest white sand, nice and wide and plenty of lounge chairs all day long. You can walk down the beach for miles. Really is absolutley amazing. Make sure you walk to the right when you get down to the beach. You will love it. Not rocky at all like some beaches in mexico and the water is very calm. Some seaweed but hey, its the ocean after all! FOOD: not a fan. I read all the reviews on here so I was not expecting the food to be that good, and my expectations were met. I always say when you go to an all inclusive you don't go for the food, but nonetheless its still dissapointing when the food is just not up to par. There were of course things to eat but if you are looking for some amazing cuisine, you will not find it a catalonia. The a la carte restaurants are decent. Only a choice of 3 and one that you have to pay extra for. We had to wait awhile for our food and random things like butter or sour cream. DRINKS: eeek- not good. They serve them in these little plastic cups and they are very watered down and just not very tastey. I was looking forward to a nice slushy pina colada and that is not what I got. Oh well. GYM: shabby, small and needs a serious upgrade!! SERVICE: the staff at catalonia are some of the friendliest I have encountered. Everyone says \"hola\" with big fat smiles and are always willing to help, especially the buffet guys. They were wonderful. FREE WIFI: this made my day!!! Loved having access to internet for FREE all over the resort, even the beach!! (At times) Granted there were a lot of areas that the signal is very weak or just non existant but I found the strong areas and just went there when I needed to use internet. Our room had great signal as well. This was a very nice feature. KIDS: I don't have children but I would say this resort is not very kid friendly. There doesn't seem like there are any kids areas or any activities for them. I know there are many other resorts that have kids pools and play areas and even little camps. WEATHER: late may-abundant sunshine and hot everyday!!! PERFECT! OVERALL: overall our experience was very nice and relaxing. There were many things I thoroughly enjoyed about this resorts, however I probably would not return just given the fact that I like to try new places and I will most likely shoot to stay in a larger resort next time. But if you are looking for a smaller scale resort with a laid back feel and gorgeous beach, then this is for you! :) Feel free to contact me with any questions!

We try to take three to four trips a year. We have stayed at many different resorts. (Palladium, Riu, Princess, Bahia, and Oasis) We would rate the Catalonia Playa Maroma at the top. Our favorite remains the Catalonia Royal Tulum, but the Catalonia Playa Maroma is a close second. If you are going for the beach experience. CPM is exceptional. Plenty of lawn chairs, No nasty towel cards necessary, plenty of shade, beautiful long stretch of beach. *****stars. If you are concerned about the rooms. I wouldn't be. We stayed in Bldg. 2. It was just fine. Bed was soft and comfortable. (we always worry about beds as we have had some really hard ones) The rooms were a little dated tile wise in the Bath, but TV was a flat screen, Internet reception was good. The walk to the beach wasn't too far, actually it was nice. I feel like any building would be great. Plenty of water and refreshments in fridge. (Sol Beer in fridge) We leave the maid a few dollars, daily. We put a couple of ones in the fridge and ask for the amount of beers and waters. It works. We always have plenty. The Buffet was excellent. We enjoyed the a la cart dinners. I read reviews about staff being distant, or unfriendly to Americans, Not so for us. They were very friendly and helpful. The Beach Bar was a little crowded, and they do not offer top shelf liquor. We were ok with what they had. We usually stop at duty free on our way into the country and buy our Vodka. We have happy hour in our room. So if you are big drinkers, (hard liquor) you may be disappointed in the bar. We are big drinkers and have learned to take care of ourselves:) My husband and I traveled with 5 other people. They placed us in adjoining rooms. 3 of the people had limited to no Mexico Experience. They all had a great time and said they would return. My husband didn't have to wear pants to the dinners. He wore shorts, sandals, button down shirt. Snorkeling wasn't that great. Water was calm, but there just wasn't much to see. We walked down the beach to the light house and found some good snorkeling. But you had to go out a ways, and there were boats in the area. So if you go down to the Lighthouse bring a friend to detour the boats. Lots of kids, all pretty well behaved, Not much nightlife. A quiet resort. Had a great Message in spa:) We had a very nice time and we will return to the Catalonia Playa Maroma. We Rate it #2 on our list. Remember folks, You are in Mexico. Not America. Things are different there. Our American standards are pretty high. The bed you sleep in may not be as comfortable as home. The food you eat may be a little different, They don't have peanut butter, They may move a little slower, but that's Mexico. That's why we go.

This place was amazing and far exceeded our expectations. This is truly the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. The sand is so powdery and soft, no rocks or shells. Also, never hot to walk on. The water is turquoise and you can see to the bottom no matter how far out you go. Also, the resort is rather secluded so you arent constantly being bombarded with vendors walking around. The priviliged rooms were beautiful, very modern. The bathrooms looked like they hadnt been updated in a while, but served the purpose. We never had any probs with the AC as I have read about in past reviews. Mini bar stocked every day. The food was great. We ate in all of the restaraunts and loved them all. The buffet is even pretty good. The grounds were spotless and beautiful. We only took one excursion in 6 days and stayed on the resort grounds every other day bc we were having so much fun and didnt feel the need to go elsewhere. The only negatives I can say for this place are: 1. There is no food after 10pm. 2. It is a LONG walk between the lobby/buffet/disco to the beach/pool/priviliged buildings. We didnt mind it at all, it was a beautiful path to walk on and good to get the exercise, but I can see if you have small children or elderly with you, this could become a challenge. 3. There is only national brand liquors. Other all inclusives have name brands (absolut, etc) if you ask for them, but not here. Bottom line is that you will love this place.

My husband and another couple we traveled with just came back Sunday the 15th and we were all so sad to leave. I am going to start out with the very few and minor negatives- Sometimes short on a bath towel or mat,may have trouble setting the safe or a/c problems- all quickly remedied by a phone call. They do not take US dollars anymore (except for the Photo Shop) in the gift stores on property- Last year they did and it was great- but you are able to charge it to your room or pay by credit card. Some sloppy painting on the buildings and paint drips in the rooms- but nothing so horrible (not in the rooms much anyway). Like another post, I also wish this was an adults only property (there were no children when we went last year and it is not pleasant listening to a screaming child when you are trying to enjoy dinner or relax on the beach- keep in mind though the parents should be responsible for an unhappy child and they too are paying customers. While I agree that Americans are a minority at this resort, we never experienced any type of exclusion or discrimination and what follows are the pros of why you should visit this resort. Beautiful grounds, crystal clear pool, clean soft white sand, blue waters, hot sun and the happiest employees I have seen anywhere. Everyday as you pass the workers you are welcomed with an \"hola\", \"buenos dias, etc. and the biggest heartfelt smiles from EVERY employee- no matter how menial you may believe their job to be. My husband commented that it we Americans had 10% of their pleasantness and work ethic, we'd live in a far better world. Day one I could not wait to get to the beach to see Enrique, the beach cocktail waiter- he was so great the last trip and this year he did not let me down. The resort offers many activities for everyone- water aerobics, Spanish lessons, kayaking, soccer, tennis, ping pong, volleyball, cooking lessons, party games, step aerobics and even their cute cheesy shows at night. The staff works constantly decorating for Mexican Night, Caribbean Night and keeping the resort beautiful for all it's guests to enjoy. The animation crew is amazing! They are the \"Goodwill Ambassadors\" of the hotel. They are group of about 31 young adults who work 12 hours a day with only a day and a half off each week. They run the activities on the resort, perform in the shows, watch and entertain the kids and you can even catch up with them some nights in the Disco and they do it with a smile. A special shout out to the animation staff we got to spend time with and got during our stay my \"special cheers\" to: J.C., Luchio, Hector, Johnny Be Good, Paco, Victor (great with the kids), Laura and Lucretia who was so very patient (as well as other employees throughout the resort) teaching my husband some basic Spanish. Only one of the animation staff member made no effort with us and he made it perfectly clear he prefers his Italian guests- one questionable employee of the whole lot still equals exceptional service. All the restaurants on the property- Tuscano, Tio Pedro, El Tortuga, La Terazza, and the buffet have plenty of great food to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters (me). I would like to thank all of the wait staffs at all of these places for making our dining experiences happy and memorable- In particular Rodrigo, Jose, Cruz (a/k/a Tom Cruz) who taught us the difference between Chela, Chelada,and Michelada (types of beer), Ramon who introduced me to the chef that made the most delicious chicken beef and pork soup, and Roberto who greeted me every morning with a playful game with my coffee spoon. One last thing about the food- if you go- at breakfast please try their juices- the celery cactus and pineapple juice is the best! The bars- granted the drinks may not contain as much alcohol as you like- but if you want more all you have to do is ask- they all are really at your service and with a smile. Mariela who works/waits the lobby bar at night is awesome. The lobby bar is open 24/7 so if you emptied your fridge of the 2 beers a day they provide just head over there and although I never needed to, I am sure you can call room service and have a bottle of champagne or wine delivered to your room if you want to pay for it. The hotel has a spa with many spa packages available at any price including a couples massage and you can even have a massage under a palalpa by the beach. For an all inclusive resort, this place has it all at a very reasonable price and I feel that the people who have complaints are looking for the Ritz without paying for the Ritz.

There was also a promotion going on when we booked this room and we received a free photo shoot on the beach, a free couples massage, a free romantic dinner at the Terrace tappas Restaurant and a free continental breakfast in bed one morning! This is our second time staying at Catalonia, and both times we just can't stop talking about the beautiful beach and turquoise water! The sand is still the whitest sand we have ever found and we collect it in jars from every beach that we have ever visited!! We got the same palapa and chairs out on the beach our entire stay and there were always plenty of chairs to be found. The staff always works so hard to please you and there is always someone working on the the grounds so that they remain as beautiful as always. The bartenders could learn to understand English a little better - we asked for the same drink several times, but got something different every time, depending on who the bartender was and if he understood what we asked for or not! Also, since our last visit, the quality of their alcohol has gone downhill - maybe they are trying to cut back on costs, but we are vodka folks and they had stopped serving absolute vodka and their house brand (oso negro), which is brweed in Mexico is not that great! They could also use more bartenders out on the beach. Sometimes we would just order 2 drinks a piece because we knew it would be a while before they came around again! The little coatis were more aggressive this time and would come right up to you as you walked back to your room from breakfast, and if you were carrying anything (such as a banana), they would stand up near your legs and try to get it from you!! We took a ton of pictures of them! We enjoyed the duo performing in the lobby a few nights while we were there - Sylvia and Lupo - very good! The activity guys and girls were always coming around on the beach making you aware of what was going on each day, the times and places, in case you wanted to do something besides lay on the beach all day! We actually took a Spanish lesson and that helped!! But, there was always volleyball on the beach, bocce ball, salsa dancing lessons, abdominal exercises in the pool, water games in the pool and step classes. I am hoping to talk to my husband and convince him that we should go back a third time!! I love this place - very romantic and laid back and just wonderful! If you are an American, you will be in the minority, but we did meet some nice Canadians, French, and Italian couples and families. We do wish that it was adults only - nothing like having a screaming child ruin your romantic dinner at the Italian Restaurant!! A shout out to Carino - we love you man!! Thanks for all the great service - hope you get to come to the states again soon and visit the wine country in California like you are hoping to do one day!

The beach is breath taking and this is not the first time I have been to the Mayan Riviera yes the rooms may need an update but when I go on vacation I am barely in my room. We loved the food and my kids are picky eaters but they always found something to eat. The buffet is not huge but it was nice because it was never over crowded when we went. The service was great always happy to serve you, we tipped almost everytime we went and 1 dollar for them is so helpful. Just remember that the salary they make is nothing compared to what we make. We ate at the Tortugas twice and it was delicious we also tried the Mexican and was also very good. The A La Cartes have a kids menu which is great. The snack bar was also good at lunch time as was the creperie which my kids enjoyed. There is service on the beach as well as the pool area as for us we just brought our bubba mugs and got them filled up and were good to go. The wifi is okay and there are hot spots around the resort we got good reception from our balcony and in the lobby and buffet. We were in the 5000 building which was close to the beach and pool area but far from the buffet and lobby .We did not mind the walk it felt good especially after eating a ton of food lol.

On average all the resorts in the area are situated on expansive properties therefore expecting to be close to everything is literally impossible.

We're approaching our 30's and \"slowing down\" a bit. (Not as much into drinking as we used to be.) Yes, there were families... but surprisingly, we were not annoyed by the children. People were drinking, but it wasn't as rowdy as other places we have been in the past. Also- I'd say about 30-40% of the guests were speaking English, the staff was fluent, and the shows were in English, so we were happy. Privileged rooms were nice. Nothing too special... but clean, hot water, TV, drinks... beds were fine. There is a special privileged reception once a week at 5pm at the terrace- go!! go!! go!! take advantage Food- above average. Not culinary cuisine, but good enough.

You're not walking forever... and besides, its good to get a little exercise :-) Spa- good services and AFFORDABLE! (It was like $100 for an 80 min service, while here in NY its usually $100 for a 50 min service.)

All in all, we priced the trip with CPM as well as the sandals next door... for a week, sandals would have been $1200 more for the two of us, and after walking though sandals, we couldn't justify the extra money for the food/service.

I recommend Cancun Shuttle service for a private van because they provided a baby seat so we didn't have to travel with one and they are very professional and it only took 30-35 min to get to hotel via cancun highway. The main entrance is the lobby, 24hr bar/coffee, discotheque, theatre, and buffet. There is 1 very long straight pathway(15 min walk) through lush jungle that leads to the shops/spa/pool /beach/restaurants. This is a narrow property, so the 6 room buildings are aligned in rows: 3 buildings on each side of the pathway heading towards the beach. So if you stay in the buildings closest to the lobby/buffet/disco/theatre, you are very far from the pool/beach/restaurants and vice versa. If you stay in the middle buildings you're far from everything lol. I booked through Expedia and they only allow Privileged room booking which I recommend because the 2 buildings used are Palenque (closest to beach/pool) and Tikal (building just before it). I was appreciative they gave us room 6121 in Palenque that had a patio opening to the beach/pool side which made seat towel placing easy for either area. This building has a private path through the trees right to the Privilege beach that has hammocks. Access to this beach by other guests was not enforced. The room was decent: old bathroom, flat screen tv, mini fridge stock with pepsi, 2 bottle water, 2 beer. AC worked good, always hot water, didn't spend much time in here. Privileged gave us 3 dinner vouchers(per rm) for our 4 night stay and x4 $10 off spa coupons. There are 4 dinner restaurants all located around the pool area: italian, mexican, steakhouse, and tapas(best). Dress code is 'casual elegant', i wore shorts, collar shirt and flip flops- you dont need to pack pants(good). You can also eat dinner at buffet but the long walk wasn't worth it. During the daytime you eat breakfast/lunch at the buffet and snacks at snack bar(same location as steakhouse) and there is a crepery by the pool open at 10am. I enjoyed the food at the restaurants, breakfast buffet, snack bar and crepery. There are only 2 bars: the lobby and the pool complex. From the beach, you have to walk up the stairs and it's right there. There is pool & beach waiter service but it was undermanned. There is no premium liquor, even for privileged guests and I tipped almost every drink. They will make you a strong drink if you ask. They do use Dos Equis from the draft(good). The pool is shaped circular areas on both sides of the pool complex building and is very good for kids because it gradually slopes to about 4ft. There were plenty of kids when we went reinforcing the other reviews that indicate this is a better place for families rather than single active types. There is also a rectangle deeper pool for water aerobics and scuba training. One thing I noticed different and nicer than other resorts was that they used a solid awning type shade rather than individual umbrellas for the lounge chairs which provided better overall shade. You have to reserve these early: 7am to be safe. Chairs without shade are readily available. The beach is as described: one of the best, clean white sand, plenty of awning type shade and several palapas. Easier to find shaded area on beach, but I would still reserve just in case. Unshaded chairs- no problems, always available. Daytime activities limited, nightly theater show was good Disney theme, disco was dead but good music and environment, mostly people just chilling in lobby at night. Should also note there is a daily kids club that provides supervised activities. Overall, we enjoyed the peaceful laid back setting and our baby did too, especially the pool. All the restaurants have high chairs since there is a lot of kids. Only problem I have is long walk to and from one end of resort to the other. I'm athletic, but this walk just made things a hassle to deal with.

In the end we would agree that if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing beach vacation and not much partying this is a great place to go, especially for the price. First some background, we have taken winter vacations to the Caribbean or Mexico at least 12-15 times, typically staying in All Inclusive resorts. We almost always pick \"budget-oriented\" resorts, but always 4 stars/Apple at a minimum. And usually they are large, 1,000+ room places like a RIU or Barcelo. We picked this resort last minute, booking only 4 days in advance, just for a short get-a-way due to the long, still ongoing winter). Overall we would say the Catalonia Playa Maroma is very similar to the many other. larger AIs we have visited, except smaller, and therefore with somewhat fewer options for buffet food, pools (only one). We knew going in due to research that there was no swim-up bar (disappointing), but a gorgeous beach (fabulous). So, we expected it to be quieter than most places. (Although most AI resorts we have been to are pretty quiet after 10pm.) Overall we give the following a thumbs up: - Beach - best reason to go here; you can walk for miles in either direction with soft, fine sand. And, there are almost no beach venders around to bother you. And, the sand extends well over your head out into the surf, no coral, weds or anything. - Rooms - most comfortable of almost any; they recently update many of them and we were \"upgraded\" to these \"Privileged\" rooms. Comfortable beds (for Mexico), great pillows. The only negative we would say is the CFL bulbs are too dark (at lease for makeup according to my wife). - Food - Buffet was nothing special, but adequate. We ate at 3 of the 4 sit-down restaurants; the Italian was fantastic, seafood pretty good and higher-end Tapas was \"interesting\" (not all that great). Everything was fresh and healthy. - Decent WIFI, at least in the lobby. There was supposed to be in the rooms as well, but I could never get it to work. (A before dinner drink at the lobby bar made a good opportunity to check e-mail anyway.) There were a few so-so item to comment on: - Nightly shows - while I'm rarely impresses with resort shows and the staff was as enthusiastic as ever, I would rate them just a bit above high school quality. (This may be partially because the shows were targeted at European-style humor - more on that next). - Lots (& I mean lots) of Europeans - I seemed 90% of the guests were either Italian, French or Spanish. This is not a cut on Europeans (I speak Spanish and Italian), but there were few other Americans or Canadians to have a drink and chat with. Most guests were families with young children (well behaved) who just relaxed by the pool or beach all day long. And one evening the announcers of the show only introduced the acts in Italian, Spanish and French . . . no English. So, it was a bit disconcerting for my wife at least who could only watch and be lightly entertained. In the end we would recommend this resort if you know what you are looking for, mainly peace and quiet , and long walks on the beach. and, of course, the price was right.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbiana, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cI think this resort is underrated\u201d", "Author": "kgeren", "ReviewID": "UR106024787", "Content": "I read a lot of reviews regarding this resort prior to booking our vacation. I was sceptical but hopeful. I was rewarded. If you are doing homework as I was, then I am not going to discuss the positives that have previously been reported. The positives are all true. I want to concentrate on the negatives that could have prevented me from booking this resort. First of all, I have no knowledge of the less expensive rooms, we booked a privileged room from the start. On arrival we received (4) passes to the specialty restaurants - steak, Italian, Mexican. We also received one pass to the tapas restaurant - this is the ultimate restaurant at the resort. We visited the Italian restaurant twice. We did not like the steakhouse as compared to what we think of as a steakhouse in the US. The Italian was excellent. The Mexican specialty restaurant was ok (on Tuesday, the buffet specialty is Mexican and we really enjoyed the variety of dishes). I have read much that the buffet never changes and I disagree. The buffet ( in the evening) always has chicken, pork, beef and fish. But the preparations of these entrees changes each evening. We always found something different to eat. And all of it was good. The breakfast buffet is as advertised. Lots of choices and all very good. Omelets to order and a variety of other dishes including a Bloody Mary table and a Mimosa table. The variety of pork sausages changed each day and all were interesting. Tips go a long way at this resort. We did not tip nearly as heavily as recommended on TA but we received great service. Leave tips for housekeeping and minifridge service,. Damn, these people work hard. I left most of my tips at the pool bar where drinks were delivered to my table without asking and only a few pesos brought large rewards. The Mexican people know how to satisfy the tourist trade. One negative that I need to report is that all the Maroma Beach hotels have a $22 USD plus tip trip to Playa one way. So with tip, about $25 USD each way.

Well, to say the least, the hotel is indeed very, very quiet and relaxing. Too much for my taste, in fact, but that depends on the purpose of your trip. If you are between the ages of 19-40, and you don't have any kids, and you expect to let loose and party, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you have a family, if you're going as a couple, or if you are the type that goes to bed early, you will love the resort. The food is Ok, but not great, as in most resorts. Unless you catch a dish right out of the oven, the food is warm. Not a great variety of fruit. Mostly just melons and bananas. Almost no guacamole and pico de gallo (weird, for mexico?). The italian \"\u00e0 la carte\" is excellent. Forget about the discotheque, not 1 person in it the 7 nights we were there, and they shut the lights in the lobby at 11 pm. No late night snacks. No pool bar. No party pool. Almost no entertainment or loud music at the pool. The ambiance they are looking for is relaxing, and they obviously don't want to catter to young spring breakers (a positive point for some guests, I personnaly found the resort dull.) If you start having fun after midnight, the fun police (security) comes running with a hand on their radio! (Come on! the closest rooms are like 3/4 mile away!!!!!) Ceasar. Excellent bartender, my favorite ever! He deserves a raise. The rest of the staff is also very good, very friendly, the service is excellent. The rooms are very, very ordinary, but they are reasonnably clean, and the beds are comfortable. The AC worked well. No alcohol in the rooms, by the way, and finding a bottle of water outside your room fridge is impossible. You can't get one at the bar. I recommend this resort for you if: - You are a beach person (it's by far the nicest beach I've ever seen) - Like \"jungle\" like resorts (it's green and thick all around you) - Go to bed early - Don't like resort with young people or spring breakers - Like international crowds (people spoke french, italian, german, english, all around) - Are travelling with kids - Like small, cozy resorts. - Like a quiet resort, where you can play cards with your friends in the lobby - Are not a luxury fanatic that can only enjoy themselves if there is marble in the bathroom I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS RESORT IF: - You are afraid of snakes!!!! My friends saw 2 while we were there!!! (Not agressive, and more of the garden variety, but still!!!) One was right in the path way to the rooms!!!! I am very afraid of snakes, and I have to say, it bordered me a little bit... - You like to Partyyyyyyyyyy! It's a good thing we were a group of 12, (of which, 6-7 are party animals), so we would have fun anywhere (and don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my trip, but only because my friends are a lot of fun) I think I would've changed resort if we would've been only two, trying to meet new people). They close the lights in the lobby in your face, even if you are sitting there having fun. You either have to stay in the dark, or go sit around the the bar to get some light. We felt a little bit out of place, and everybody looked at us funny. I felt like I was disrupting naptime at the nursing home!!! - Pool bars!!! I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE them! Having to get out of the pool and back in is NOT the same!! - Late night snacks! There aren't ANY!!!!!! (which is dull, if you only go to bed at 4 in the morning! :) - You are single and like to mingle! (They only single people there were there with their parents! haha) And with no discotheca, it's hard to get your groove on! ;) - Like the shade (this is a resort where the towel game is played at it's best. The hotel doesn't keep track of towels, so all the chairs under the shade are taken, but no one ever sits on them. Same thing at the beach). -Like luxury. This resort is all about the beach. The focus is not put on the food, on the ambiance, or on the rooms. -Like to go to Playa del Carmen a lot (it's further, and a 20$ taxi ride) Over all, it's a nice little, cozy resort. The food is ok, the rooms are ok, the service is excellent, the beach is breathtaking. It's just for a different type of people. I like a lively resort with people up very late!

Any requests (safe in room didn't work upon arrival, additional towels, bell boy) were attended to within minutes. Beach: Playa Maroma is frequently voted one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Need I say more? A la care restaurants: Excellent. We ate at the Italian, Mexican and tapas restaurants. Food and presentation was world class. We live in Chicago and I'd say any of these restaurants would do well even with the competition in this city. The other guests: Very international crowd: lots of Italians, French speaking (not sure if most were French or Canadian), a fair amount of Americans. Everybody was respectful and nice - maybe the fact that there's no swim-up bar (but there is a bar by the pool) and the fact that there were so many families with children kept the adult alcohol consumption and related sound volume down. If you're a traveler that feels more comfortable with a predominantly American crowd, you most likely will not like this hotel. No mosquitos: maybe it was the time of year, but we had no bugs what so ever. Distance from airport: Only 25 minutes by taxi. We pre-ordered a taxi with Cancun Transfer. The bad: The buffet restaurants: First of all - it's not the quality of food that is a problem. It's the selection, especially at the lunch restaurant by the pool/beach. Apart from hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza, the options were limited. The grouper, however, was fantastic, and we ended up eating that for lunch every day. The reason we wouldn't go back is partially the buffet restaurants and partially that the resort feels small and we felt we did all there was to do, just about every day.

Our travel agent (cheapcaribbean.com) booked us for a Privileged room and it was good value. The beach was outstanding, among the best beaches I have seen. Defiantly the best beach I have seen on the Atlantic Ocean. The resort is a long narrow strip of land that has lush \"jungle\" habitat filled with birds, lizards, and native Coati (raccoons). Although the beach is not too wide (across) there is open access to walk the beach past the few other resorts that adjoin the resort. Just north is a very expensive resort - but they get to use the same water and sand we did as a reasonable price. Around the pool and beach are many activities and nearly 30 staff to organize activities for adults, teens and children. The staff will walk around and gently encourage you to join in volleyball, a jungle tour, dance lessons, or a water polo etc. The list of activities was endless and the enthusiastic staff were great. At night you would see the same staff as dancers in the nightly shows which were quite colorful and entertaining. Bar service was quick and there were abundant juices and a coffee bar. The food was very well presented. For lunch we preferred to go to the restaurant near the lobby rather than eat at the beach restaurant (Tortuga). There was a wide variety of selection at the main restaurant. Tortuga was convenient for families with burgers, hot dogs, pasta etc. The morning breakfast selections were great as well as the evening buffet that had some theme nights. As \"privileged\" guests we got four tickets to the themed restaurants. Many have commented on these restaurants so I will not elaborate. We did enjoy the al-acart menus and service was excellent. All in all, the staff were very eager to make you meal a pleasant experience. The house wines were included and so-so. Bottled wines are available at a reasonable extra cost. There is wifi service (free) in the main hotel lobby and the pool area. It was not the fastest connection in the world but we were able to keep up on email and news. The spacious lobby was a great place to begin the day with fresh coffee a roll and email - the bar there is open 24 hours a day and a great setting. The room was spacious. There were about 20-30 cable channels on a smaller size flat screen TV. The bathroom was clean, but the grout was put on a little sloppily in our particular bathroom so it had more rushed appearance. This only applied to the shower and sink. It was not a big deal. The \"privilege\" room balcony was large and comfortable looking over the colorful courtyard. Other rooms had plastic balcony furniture. Not sure what other differences were. We all ate the same food and had the same beach. Many have written reviews commenting on the large number of those speaking French, Spanish and Italian. This is true, but it gave a more international feel to the atmosphere which we liked.

Our room was in the 1000 unit and although it was fine and had a lovely outdoor porch, the mattress was hard. Upon request, we moved to the 5000 unit, which had been refitted with new, downier mattresses. We were told that they are progressively changing the mattresses in all the units. The buffet food was fine, with lots of choices and a theme for every night. Breakfast had many choices as well, with some Mexican specialties, which was fun ! The snack-bar, however, often ran out of favourites, such as hotdogs and hamburgers. The ice cream though was great. We enjoyed all the \u00e0 la carte restaurants. The food presentation on the plate was first rate, and everything was tasty. If you chose the 'chilis relenos' in the Mexican, beware, this is a huge portion! You do not need to reserve at these restaurants but sometimes the wait to be seated can be long. Service throughout the hotel is excellent; from the buffet to the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was smiling, friendly and good-humoured. Thank you Quirino, Paula, Claudio, Felipe and Victor.

This stay ended our 12 night vacation in the Playa area. We were looking for a budget all-inclusive and opted for the privileged room through The Vacation Store of Miami , and that is what we found with the Catalonia. So, all in all we were satisfied with the resort but found the following: The Good: Greeted by a very nice and informative bell boy who escorted us to the \"privileged check-in\" Nicely appointed rooms, with updated furnishings. Beautiful beach with plenty of lounge chairs(in the full sun) Large pool with lounge chairs, table and chairs Crepe station by the pool is fabulous with a very nice chef who made our teenage boys crepes 4-5 times per day. Nice lobby area. Small animals(Coati's) running around the property are cute and like to be fed(the signs say not too, but we saw lots of people feeding them) The waiters and bartenders are all very friendly and professional. The Bad: Upon check-in, I asked about a possible upgrade. I was told there were no ocean view rooms available, and to check back the next day. Speaking to another guest later that same day, he stated he gave the desk agent $100.00 cash and was promptly upgraded to a ocean view room. We were given one dinner ticket for the ala carte restaurants even though we were told by out travel agent we would be given one for each night of our stay. Not all restaurants are open each night, only one or two, and they fill up quick! Get there early. No reservations are accepted. The food at the buffets is bland and tasteless, esp. at the pool buffet. Hot dogs, hamburgers, cheese in a can, and other choices day after day. The chair game at it's worst! To get a chair in the shade, people send out someone to \"stake out\" chairs early, early, early. We got up and out to the pool by 8:00 AM only to find towels, books, flip flops, etc. on every shaded chair on both the beach and by the pool. We hesitated moving towels, but did so anyway after reading a previous forum on TripAdvisor. Hey, we paid the same amount for the resort, a deserve a chair too!! The Ugly: When we first entered our room(on the ground floor) I noticed ants in our room...I figured, it's Mexico.....Well, the first and second night I woke up with my legs itching and red bumps on them. Well, come to find out there were ants in the bed! The wrap-up: This is a nice budget all-inclusive, basically it's true when they say, \" you get what you pay for\". We have stayed in 3 other all-inclusives and this one so far is our least favorite, but also the least expensive. We would not stay here again, but opt to save up for a higher class of all-inclusive.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAnts in the Bed!\u201d", "Author": "takemetothesun", "ReviewID": "UR103435349", "Content": "The Good: We were looking for a good value, and found this all-inclusive to be budget friendly. The lobby is very nice with beautiful plants, clean, and the lobby bar seemed well staffed. Lovely grounds with Coatis(a cross between a raccoon and an ant eater), jungle like atmosphere, and well kept flowers and shrubery. Small fountains in the courtyard of each block of rooms. Friendly waiters, bartenders, and entertainment staff. Beautiful beach with lots of lounge chairs Nice selection of shops and a spa. The Bad: The food at the buffets especially the one near the pool was boring and flavorless. The same items were served day after day. Chicken wings, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza and cheese out of a can were the main choices at the pool buffet. We were only given one coupon for the ala carte restaurants and one for the Tapas restaurant for a three night stay, even though we were told we would be able to eat ala carte for each night of our reservation. (Once I questioned this, I was reluctantly given an extra coupon) Upon check-in(at the priveleged desk) I asked about a possible ocean view room or possibly upgrading to a suite. I was told that there were no rooms available and to check back the next day. Upon speaking to another guest, he indicated he was told the same thing until he gave the desk clerk $100.00 cash. He was then promptly given a ocean view room. The towel game at it's worst! The hotel does not keep track of the number of towels you are given. So, we found that people put towels out on chairs both at the pool and at the beach in the covered area. Two mornings we were out to the beach by 8:00 only to find towels, shoes, book, etc. taking up all of the shaded areas. We ended up moving towels to obtain a shaded area by the pool. There were chairs available in the sun, but it was too much to be in all day. No american money was accepted, even though items in the stores were marked with US prices. Only Canadian and Euros were accepted. The only other method of payment was with credit card. The Ugly: Upon entering our room, I saw ants all over the bathroom counters and around the desk area. I figured, oh well, it's Mexico...there are bound to be bugs.....Well, my husband informed me(after we checked out) that he had discovered ants in our bed.

We were met at the lobby entrance by a super friendly and helpful greeter who took our bags to the check in and then waited to take us on to our room. There he showed us where everything was and how it worked and even taught us a few Spanish phrases. I can't say how important it is to have your first encounter be with someone so good at his job. Our rooms were nicely appointed and in a great location close to the beach and pool. Beds and pillows were comfortable, shower was hot and strong with a nice hand-held option. The air conditioner works great but if you turn it too cold - the condenser freezes up and you have defeated your purpose. We were cool and comfortable a medium temp setting. Frig was cold and stocked w/ pop, beer and water but somehow we didn't get water the first day. DON'T drink the tap water. Free safe in room is easy to use. One day our family in the next room left their safe open (accidentally) and when they came back it was locked up with a note explaining that security had been called to lock it up when the maid found it open. Maid service is excellent. One night we even got a phone call inquiring as to our satisfaction and letting us know which restaurant was closed for the night and what the entertainment was that evening. The buildings, grounds, and pool are clean and well cared for. CPM has the most beautiful beach. The sand is fine and soft with no rocks or shells even in the water. The ocean is every color of blue and the perfect temperature. Plenty of lounges but if you want a spot under the palms, you should get to the beach early. Water and non alcoholic drinks are available self-serve at the beach bar and other drinks made for you at the bar. Though the bartenders are very fast and friendly, there is sometimes a line. They should figure out a way to get more tenders there during the really busy times. Food is good but not great. Would liked to have seen more guacamole and pico. Fish was consistently good as was fresh fruit. Omelets good at breakfast. Good coffee and cappuccino. Go to ala cartes early for no wait. Husband would like better work-out facility.

We were married there last year and it was like a dream! You can get so called '5 star' resorts for the same or less, but the beaches are rocky, weedy, or damaged and the food is typical all inclusive. Catalonia is understated luxury, exemplified by a one of the world's best beaches, and world class cuisine. Pros: -The beach has no rocks, weeds, and has not been damaged by hurricanes like many of the other Cancun, Mayan and Playa del Carmen resorts. If you are there for the beach, this is IT. The softest white sand, and the most beautiful tuquoise caribbean water. There are plenty of comfy beach beds and palapas for shade. The pool is also incredible and huge! Even at maximum capacity, this 400 room resort has plenty of beds by the pool and beach for everyone. -The food is incredible at the buffet and restaurants (except we are not in love with the Mexican restaurant) -The Privelaged rooms are renovated to a beautiful finish. Worth the upgrade! -We saw many of the same staff that were there from our last trip there 15 months ago. These people, such as Enrique the beach waiter, Baltazar and Edgar, the beach bartenders, and Filipe the waiter in the buffet restaurant provide friendly customer service and make your stay memorable. Our maid was wonderful too and she remembered us! Many of them speak a little bit of 4 languages: English, french, spanish, Italian, even some german. A truly global resort with a diverse group of visitors! Cons: -The wireless internet needs fixing, it hardly worked the whole time we were there. Unreliable. -Perhaps there is a bit of a language barrier, but when calling Reception, certain staff come across rude or snobby, unlike the frontline staff, and your request is never fulfilled. Perhaps a better tracking system and some more customer service training would ensure everyone has their requests met in a friendly manner:) -While many of the front desk staff are very friendly, if there is a problem it can be very slow to get it resolved. I think a little more training is needed here? -Sometimes the fridges are not properly stocked and this year there is a new rule about a 2 beer and 2 water limit per day. This is very disappointing for an all inclusive, especially when you are paying more than double for the oceanfront suite! Seems cheap. - The reservations manager - Judit Mis, has no business working with customers. She was so rude to us during booking we almost cancelled the whole trip. I asked to speak with the hotel manager but was sent to the concierge instead. It was shocking how many mistakes she made and how rude she was, she should not have contact with clients. I do not recommend booking rooms through the hotel if she is there, very disorganized, unknowledgable, and unprofessional. - We were staying in the hotel's most expensive suite, and asked for a private SUV to pick us up from the airport. For $100USD one way I expected the luxury that matches our tastes, and typically you can get a new Escalade for this price. We were sent an old beat up SUV with a cracked windshield, a dirty child seat and the driver was very late! Very disappointed, I would not recommend booking anything through the hotel concierge based on this experience. They should know better and have a higher level of excellence. -The older hostess at the Italian restaurant does not know how to smile! Even the kids in our group noticed how mean she was. Greet every patron with a smile! -The daytime lunch restaurant by the pool did not serve fish or guacamole at all as they did last year. The food quality here has really declined here since last year. -We could hardly find guacomole at the buffet for the whole week and had to ask for it. Very strange for a mexican resort, is there an avocado shortage? lol I hope the hotel management recognizes that the efforts of so many front line employees can be overshadowed by the incompetance of just one or 2 employees that do not have good customer service skills. A 4star resort should not have the word \"NO\" in their vocabulary. Overall, after 8 trips to this part of the world, this hotel is wonderful and the beach must be seen.

The place seemed pretty quiet after 9pm, and found that most people were up fairly early. The beach was far from crowded -- we went for lunch and when we came back our lounge chairs close to the water were still vacant. It was our first time vacationing at an all-inclusive so we went in with an open mind despite some concerns about some of the reviews I'd read (and here they are)... Smokers -- I dislike smoke but really didn't have any issues anywhere. The beach seems to have an unofficial smoking area at the back and with the strong breeze from the water it stays away:) Languages -- Yes it was mostly french Canadians and Italians and found that many of them were able to get by w/ some of the spanish they had. As a result, the majority of the staff only spoke spanish to us which I enjoyed. I liked the diversity though my travelling partner who speaks only english found the resort a bit alienating. Through our entire stay I may have heard 3 or 4 different people speaking english. Front desk service -- This was the only problem we encountered. We arrived at 10am and we were told we would have to wait an hour and a half (didn't consider check in times, our rookie mistake), though the gentleman had already said the hotel was only 80% full. He asked us if we wanted to upgrade, and since we were undecided, he said we could choose when we came back. The desk agent looked a little embarassed as we left the counter, but it wasn't until later that I realized it wasn't because he was embarrassed of the service, but because he was a bad liar and that it would be a much longer wait than he said. When we came back at the right time, we were helped by what appeared to be a manager. He said our room wasn't ready and that it would be another hour. When I enquired about the privilege rooms and if one of them was ready should we choose to upgrade, he rudely told us we booked a regular room (I figured he thought we were asking for a free upgrade, but I was annoyed that there was no communication w/ his employee who originally helped us). We stayed optomistic though we were trying to think if we would put up w/ this kind of service if were weren't stuck in the middle of nowhere w/ a trip we'd already paid for. We waited in the lobby and saw bus loads of people checking in (they all looked like they were told to wait but they all still had that naive optomism:), and when we went back to the desk after an hour they said it would be another 30-35mins. Morale was low at that point and we would have definately left had we had more options. We finally got into our rooms just after 1pm. Too bad the point of entry was so disheartening, as the rest of the trip went well. Later in the week while on the beach I overhead a man telling his family that the room wouldn't be ready till 3pm (it was 1pm at that point). My annoyance w/ the vacation was that no times given to us were ever correct. I understand that our north american culture is a bit more fixated on schedule, but nothing was accurate. Our on-going joke on the trip was repeating \"how long?\" --- \"hmmm.. One hour, hmm maybe two, exactly\", as this was often what we heard. I would recommend this resort as this seems to be the only 4 star in the area (seemed to be surrounded by 5-star adult-only's), and though I enjoyed it, we're unlikely to go back.

The hotel is good value for the money. It is smaller and less crowded than most of the all inclusives on this coast. The lobby and main (buffet) restaurant are at the front of a long fairly narrow lot. Its a bit of a walk two or three times a day. there are 5 three story blocks of rooms. The other restaurants are near the beach and pool, as is the snack bar and small pool bar. It's a five minute walk from the lobby down to the pool etc., The rooms are fairly basic, clean and useable. OK but hard mattresses. They have safes, a small frig which they restock for you every day, and the usual layout. Tv channels are limited. On-site free wifi, works OK, not great, but good enough. Water pressure in the shower is barely average, but plenty of hot water. You cant drink the tap water but they give you lots of bottled water. the rooms have useable patios or balconies. Each of the five blocks is organized around a nicely planted courtyard. The grounds are pretty and well maintained, and well lit at night. we felt the property was very safe and secure and didn't feel we needed to keep a close eye on the kids. lots of security, entrance is gated at two places on the way in. The pool has several sections, and a fair amount of chairs although you needed to get down pretty early to secure a spot for the day especially if you wanted shade, as the hotel was 90% full while we we here. The same was true of the beach. There are lots of shallow areas in the pool for small kids. It wasnt generally too crowded in the pool or at the restaurants even though the hotel as mentioned was full. They do play a lot of bad popular music at the pool at times so it can be pretty noisy. Also, the clientelle is heavily European (mostly French and italian) so the chances are you may be next to people who smoke, a lot of the time. Lots of Canadians visit too, mostly Quebequois, so you get to use your french as well as your spanish, if you have any. The staff mostly speaks at least some english. No hassle about getting as many clean beach towels as you want, unlike many hotels. They do a bunch of daily activities at the pool, step workouts, spanish lessons etc. There is a show every night in the small theatre off the lobby, high spirited if not broadway quality, the kids liked them but they start late. The buffet is Ok, lots of fresh juices at breakfast, an omelette station etc. Not great, but Ok and lots of it. Ditto for lunch and dinner. The specialty restaurants are OK too, average, the Italian seemed to be the best of the lot. The snack bar at the beach was below par, self serve greasy hamburgers and hot dogs, pretty good fries. Open bar at the beach and in the lobby or course, and coffee at the beach. Free house wines were drinkable. None of the restaurants make use of the ocean view except the tapas place above the beach bar. The beach is wide and clean with some sports, volley ball etc. and it has a lifeguard. water sports next door, OK scuba (PADI) shop on site. They clean the beach every day, which it needs, if you walk down the beach there's plenty of basura (garbage), especially plastic. Several half built hotels up and down the beach nearby, abandoned in the crash. The pool and beach staff are great, especially Johnny, and very good with the kids, and they make an effort. Overall the staff is friendly and competent and eager to please. Note that the hotel no longer has a shuttle to Playa, but you can rent a car at the hotel by the day if you want to get off site and see a cenote or go to the ruins at Tulum or something. We always rent a car at the airport (easy and cheap) when we go to yucatan as we like to snorkle cenotes and go to Hidden Worlds and stuff like that, but you don't need a car unless you want to get off the site. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel is fine. If you drive, the hotel is a little hard to find, the entrance isn't that well marked, but it is only 20 or 25 minutes from the airport. Lots of wildlife/birdlife on the site, a large omnipresent coati family lives along the path from the lobby, plenty of iguanas, local oriole species, woodpeckers etc. Fun for the kids. Three (mostly unused) tennis courts near the lobby, very hard surface so tough on the knees, could use some maintenance but useable. Overall, this place is value for the money, not luxurious, 3 stars, a good choice if you have kids and a normal budget. If you want upscale, go to St Barts.

They made us comfortable even though the room was not ready (as we arrived early) gave us the usual welcome drink and provided us with cold damp towels which was delightful. The grounds at this hotel are imaculate.

The room was kind of plain, but it was only for sleeping. Water pressure in the shower was good also. The main restaurant had a different theme every nigh and the food was good. Staff at the restaurant and through out the resort were very hospitable and polite. The a la carte Steak and Grill was also good. We did go to Playa Del Carmen and recommend strongly if you have never been to 5th ave. Its about a $20.00cdn or $200.00Mex Pesos each way.

We had friends meet us for one of two weeks. Check in was great and quick reception staff was very friendly. Room: We had booked a standard room but some how ended up in a priviledged room. We did not have the priviledge bracelet which was okay. We had free wifi in the room which made skyping home very good. The room was nicely decorated with a flat screen tv, two double beds which were comfortable. Very lovely and spacious deck with nice furniture, bathroom area spacious. Beach: The beach is one of the nicest beaches I have been to. More loungers than guests which is nice. We never once had a hard time finding shade. Also noticed that if you could not find shade first thing in the morning you could always find it just around lunch time, lots of people seem to leave the beach around then. We had awesome beach drink service from Enrique. At the beach bar Julio was the best bartender and Mercedes kept the tequila coming. Food: Buffet was good for all three meals of the day. The Itialian al carte was my favorite,the mexican was very good, did not have a good meal at the steakhouse so we never went back. I also found the house wine to be very good. Nightly shows: They were okay but some of show were not in english due to the very low number of english speaking guest. Entertainment staff: I found the entertainment staff to be some of the hardest working and most friendly that we have encountered at a resort. They worked very hard all morning at the beach entertaining guests but did not bother you if you did not want to partake in the activities. Lobby bar: It had a great atmosphere and they served tea and cookies in the afternoon and in the evening at happy hour they had great horderevs. Drinks were very good at this resort. The Mojito's and Margarita's were great. Resort grounds: The grounds at this resort are very beautiful. It is nicely cut into the jungle. We really enjoyed our stay at the Catalonia.

Beach bar service was good - after a few $ of tips. Food/Drinks - 3/5 - I think this resort is catered for meat-lovers. The food is average. But it is all very fresh and you wont get sick even drinking the water etc.. You wont go hungry but its not as good as Negril. The creperie is exceptional but they run out of the nutella quickly! The bar service was great! Service - 4/5 - a few $ of tips go a long way. Staff are friendly - mainly speak Spanish but definitely try and cater to you. Rooms - 4/5 - we were in privileged building 6. Nice room, bathroom needs to be updated. Pool area - dont go to this resort if you're a pool person. Its really catered for beach lovers.

It appears that the management have taken steps to resolve these issues and have done a marvellous job in doing so. There's lots of good things to say about this resort that will show you it's a great value. For example, the beach beds are now underneath a canopy of white material covering the slates and gives you a nice protection from the hot sun or you can move your bed underneath the trees if you want shade. Lots of beds available - you do have to get down to the beach by 7 am in order to get a good one in the shade. Staff - excellent, courteous and friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard to ensure they meet your needs. We noticed that the staff immediately clean the tables of dishes as soon as they are vacated so that there are no dirty dishes left for more than a minute or two. They work very hard at this and it is a very good initiative however sometimes it means that the people coming in have to wait a bit longer to get coffee/tea. If you must have your morning coffee right away, go to the lobby bar first. Food - a great selection in the buffet - fab desserts! A la carte restaurants - Italian was best meal I've had in any restaurant for some time! Steak was okay but wasn't the best, however my friends had a good meal - the same thing can (and does) happen at home. Did not go to the other a la cartes as the buffet was sufficient especially after stuffing our faces all day long - but do wish we'd tried the Italian sooner. Desserts were excellent and always fresh. The one thing that I had every day was the guacamole and salsa - couldn't get enough. Try it! Breakfast - various fresh breads (you gotta taste the banana bread!), fresh omellettes, fruit, juices, yogurt, cereal, granola, and they constantly turn over the food so that it doesn't sit out too long so that it's always fresh. And if you want, you can have dessert for breakfast! Lunch - you can selet the main Buffet, or the snack bar which also offered, in addition to standard fare, excellent fresh fish and some vegetables; or you can go the Crepiere - open from 10 am to 6 pm and get fresh crepes with many selections. Fresh fish was the best!! Dinner - Buffet food always changing the menu, good selection and a la cartes are noted above. Resort - lovely walkway to and from Lobby/Beach/Pool area - about a 5 min. stroll with jungle type of foliage on either side which also hides the other buildings and has music piped in so that it can be a restful and enjoyable walk. Staff are continually raking, removing debry of dead leaves etc. and cleaning up grounds. A commendable job to the gardeners! The main lobby area is very clean as are the washrooms. Pool - excellent - different areas linked together some deep, some shallow - lots of room for everyone! Chairs/loungers comfortable and accessible. Pool temperature perfect! Ocean/beach - fantastic! Most days the water was fairly calm but we had a couple of days of changing weather which brought some larger waves and we enjoyed body surfing. Usually the sky clouded up around 3 pm due to the warm air hitting the mountains and by then you were ready for something a bit cooler and then could take your walk on the beach without getting fried! You can swim with the fishes if you like - a few little angel fish come around in the shallower areas. Checkin - there were only 7 of us from Canada checking in it was quick and easy and the staff were very accommodating. Rooms - standard room - needs some paint but acceptable. The air con was ok and the fan wobbled but it kept us cool enough. Kingsize bed offered firm but good support. I would recommend anyone requesting a higher room to ask for a balcony that has a roof (there are some but not all have a roof) so when/if it rains you can sit outside if you wish. The interior courtyard is lovely with fountains and nice gardens although then you can see your neighbours across so not as private. Beach view is difficult to get unless you have a privileged room in the 5000 section and even then it's not full on. Entertainment - did not go to the shows however a couple of nights they offered some nice entertainment in the lobby with a couple of singers --usually between 7-9 pm. Try not to miss this. Other - on a few evenings, you can shop on-site in a mini-market of various items (jewellery, etc) as well they have shops open during the day offering clothing, snack foods, etc. Internet - 3 computers for regular customers and a dedicated computer for the privileged guest - my access card didn't work on a couple of occasions and they immediately gave me free access for that timeframe Fitness facilites/spa - gym offered standard equipment, cycling, treadmill, weights; spa (extra cost) Shuttles - the hotel do not offer free shuttles any longer - taxi is (for 4 people) $20 US to Playa del Carmen or Porto Morales. Doesn't take long to get a taxi. Security - excellent - they log when you go out and when you return. They take your security very seriously. Lobby bar -- open 24 hours - you can get capuccino, espresso as well as a nice selection of tea and snacks late at night (although we never sampled that option!) or first thing in the morning. Nice area to sit in the lobby with comfortable seating around the centre with cushions or at a table. Lots of room for large parties.

Considering the price we paid (around $600 per person for a week, air and taxes included), we were very happy with the vacation. I\u2019d like to emphasise that the hotel is a solid 3 star and I really wouldn\u2019t pay top price for it. However, if you get a good deal, you will not be disappointed. Here is my honest objective review: Catalonia Playa Maroma is a smaller older resort and feels rather quaint and cozy. The resort is very well maintained, and the staff are very friendly and nice. The place is immaculately clean, the patio furniture is clean and well maintained, the pools are clean and so is the beach. Food There was not a whole of abundance of choices; however, the quality of food was very good. Everything on the buffet was tasty, not too greasy, and fresh. There is one main buffet by the lobby, and one snack bar by the beach, which converts into 3 restaurants in the evening (you get 3 sit down dinners per week for which you have to make reservations at the front desk ahead of time). All the dinners were very nice, the service was good, and food was tasty. The beach bar was convenient and nice, and you can have coffee and snacks there too. Beach Maroma beach is absolutely beautiful, especially if you like taking long walks. There is no coral, and the bottom of the ocean is sandy and nice. What you see in the pictures of the hotel beach is what you get \u2013 lots of beach beds stacked next to each other. It is possible to pull a couple of beds out of the line, so that your body is not touching the guy lying next to you, but it was a little crowded to my taste. Thankfully, there was always enough beds. Bus to Playa del Carmen Complimentary bus to Playa del Carmen twice a day is a really nice service that I recommend taking advantage of. The hotel gets boring after a while, you know, as there is nothing really to do there. Rooms Rooms were basic, clean and nice. The bathrooms were older, but I thought that Mexican tiles were charming and very authentic. There was no bathtub, just a shower cabin. There is a safe deposit box in the room. The pools were okay, nothing fancy, but it's an older hotel, you know. Things I didn\u2019t like: What I really hated about this hotel is that the entertainment team on the beach and by the pools was yapping non-stop, in every language possible but English. They would blast the loud speakers at the beach, and if your idea of a perfect vacation is relaxing on the beach to the sound of the waves, you are out of luck. I even asked a couple of times to turn the base sound down, but they were not willing to please. There were no late night snacks (little sandwiches at 11 pm at the lobby bar were gone in 5 minutes) and there were a couple of hours during the day before dinner, when everything was closed. The ceiling fan in the room was making a weird noise and was out of balance. We never used it, because I was afraid that the chopper would fall on my face in the middle of the night. The AC was not cool enough, but okay. You will enjoy your stay at this hotel, if the price is right, and if you stay open minded and don\u2019t expect to be pampered too much. This no-frills hotel provides all the basic necessities and friendly service. We had a wonderful time and got what we paid for, but I wouldn\u2019t pay more than $1000 per person for a week at this hotel.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPLEASE do not waste your money\u201d", "Author": "hamandeggs039", "ReviewID": "UR99047057", "Content": "My wife and two-year old son stayed for six nights at this resort.

I've traveled to all-inclusives multiple times. I've stayed in Cancun, Ixtapa, Cozumel twice and Puerta Plata in the Dominican. Out of those, Cozumel was by far the best place to be. My trip to Playa Maroma/Playa del Carmen this year rivals the last two years in Cozumel. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma from Feb. 4 through the 13th. The weather was fantastic, overall it was an amazing experience. I will break down my review into categories. Beach (most important category! lol): This resort had by far, the most beautiful white sand beach I have ever seen. The water was turquoise blue and nice and warm. There were fun waves some days and the water was perfectly calm on others. It was a nice mix. The sand never got hot, no matter how hot the weather was. It was literally like sugar under your feet. The beach was very expansive and made for wonderful early morning or late night walks. In all of my previous experience, we had to get down to the beach by five in the morning to reserve a lounger, and at this resort, they have more loungers then people. You could arrive to the beach at anytime and be guaranteed a chair. I was also impressed with the large amount of covered areas for those of us that need to get out of the sun once and awhile- more then I have seen anywhere else. There were always plenty of fun activities going on at the beach, although we found out very quickly that we were in the minority because we spoke English. The majority of the time, they didn't even speak English on the beach, it was Spanish, French and Italian. Mostly, we didn't even know what game they were playing because they never explained it in English. This was only a minor bummer because we do enjoy getting involved sometimes. The only other minor negative about the beach was that there were only one or two bartenders walking around to take drink orders and in the 10 days we were there, they only came to us once. This is one thing I love about Mexico is that they bring you drinks on the beach, and this resort really didn't. In their defense though, the beach is so expansive that it would be hard to serve everyone with only one or two staff. The pools were great- a lot of people complain about pools in Mexico being cold, but this one was perfect- who wants super warm water when it's 90 degrees out anyway?? Rooms: We stayed in the Tikal group of buildings in the privileged section. We read reviews prior to going that said the rooms were lacking and that you should try to upgrade to privileged section. We actually brought extra money and planned on doing that, but to our suprise we were escorted to the privileged check in area upon arrival. I guess we were upgraded without knowing it- nice suprise! The room was by far the nicest room that I have ever had in Mexico. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the shower was great with plenty of hot water. The fridge was stocked daily and we always had plenty of bottled water. We gave the maid a tip about every other day and she always left a new towel animal on the bed and plenty of fresh towels and water. There was a safe in the room which is a must. We had a large balcony, flat screen tv, coffee maker, hair dryer, and reading lamps that you could adjust so as not to keep each other awake- pretty cool! There was a ceiling fan in the room, and it always stayed nice and cool. They also had plush robes and slippers in the room- nice touch! Food: Overall, I would give the food at this resort an A+. The buffet was amazing everytime we ate there. For an all inclusive I was actually quite suprised at the selection and quality of food. Anyone that would complain about this buffet is obviously very difficult to please and has probably never traveled to an AI before. The other restaurants were very good as well. My favorite was the Italian, and my boyfriend loved the New York Strip that he got at the Tortuga Grill. The Mexican restaurant was just okay for me. We did not get the chance to eat at the Tapas as my boyfriend is not a big seafood person and we preferred the other restaurants. I heard from others that it was good though. Drinks: As in many all inclusives, we noticed that they did not put much alcohol in mixed drinks here. We were not suprised though. In Cozumel we always asked for doubles and the staff did not hesitate to make them. At the Catalonia, this just didn't happen. I will say that there was a huge language barrier because it seems the staff speak more French and Italian and very little English. Even my pretty good Spanish didn't help me here. I should make it clear that we are not \"huge drinkers,\" but when on vacation a person likes to let loose a little bit and it was difficult to do that here :) We did find one bartender that we tipped well and he catered to us a little more- I wish I could remember his name- very nice guy. As far as tipping goes, we seemed to be in the minority here as well- we hardly ever saw people tip. I know you don't have to, but we just feel like it's the right thing to do. Again with the majority of the tourists being European, maybe it's a culture thing- I'm really not sure. Spa: A quick note about the spa. There was one rainy day when we were there and my boyfriend bought me a massage and facial at the spa. BEST massage and facial I have ever had! I would highly reccomend this if you have the opprotunity! Grounds: There are no words to describe how beautiful this resort is. It is set in the jungle and there are so many beautiful trees and flowers to see. Also, there are adorable little animals called Coati that roam around. They are so friendly and very entertaining to watch. At night, the jungle is lit up with lights here and there and there is soothing music coming from the jungle. It was like being in a dream when we walked down the path to the lobby bar and shows every night! This was one of my favorite parts of the resort. My boyfriend commented almost daily that he couldn't believe how immaculate the grouds were. There were always people trimming trees, pruning bushes or cleaning something. They really do work so hard here. Entertainment: The entertainment staff at this resort were great. We had a hard time at the show again with most of the speaking being in French, Italian and English, but it was fun to watch. They really work hard to entertain you and they do a great job at it! A little side note: there is a couple that comes a few nights per week to perform live music in the lobby. Lupo and Sylvia. They are great! We watched them each time they were there- very entertaining! Excursions: We went to Xel Ha, Xplor and we also spent a day in Playa del Carmen. I had been to Xel Ha about seven years ago and it was even more amazing then last time. I highly recommend this excursion. Xplor was neat, but we priobably wouldn't go again. Playa del Carmen was fun to see and shop around. The taxi costs about 20 dollars each way. The last thing I want to say about this resort is mainly for those traveling there from the US that speak English. As I previously stated, I have traveled frequently over the last several years, and I do love to experience the culture of a new place. I speak Spanish pretty well and I love to utilize it when I go to Mexico. I would never expect them to accomodate me by speaking English, although most Mexican resort staff do. With that said, I was pretty dissapointed with the lack of willingness most of the bartenders and waitstaff had in trying to understand either our English or our Spanish. In Cozumel, the staff always taught me how to say something in Spanish if I forgot the word and they were so friendly and outgoing. At this resort, I felt like more of an annoyance to many of the bartenders or waitstaff when I tried to ask for something either in Spanish or English. Our orders were messed up on many occaisons and many times we got something totally different then what we asked for. I really felt like they catered more to the Europeans. That brings me to the only other thing that was upsetting about this resort. Many of the French Europeans at this resort were extremely rude to the people around them. They would cut you off at the bar and talk right over us when we were ordering. Many of them chain smoked in the common areas- this is not fun for two former smokers. I hate to generalize because I'm such an open minded person, but let's just say that after this trip, we decided that you could never pay us to travel to France! We only met two other couples that spoke English in ten days- and that was on our last day there! I would say that this resort would have been more enjoyable had we traveled there with a group so that we had other people to socialize with. I hope this long winded review helps. I had multiple people on this site ask me to write a good review when I returned, so here ya go!

If you can sit in Roberto's section do, as he looked after us very well.We ate at all four alternate restaurants and found all four to be very good. The presentation and food quality was as good or better then most cruises we have been on. We paid for lobster at Tapas and feel it was well worth the money. The animation staff are a high energy and friendly group both Hector and Jhonny are great. The beach is fabulous a broad expanse of white sand which you can walk along for many km. This resort has an excess of lounges at the beach so you will never go without one.The pool and grounds are very well kept up with constant cleaning . In the priveledged section the \"go to person\" is Gabriella who will do everything she can to accomodate your wishes. This is a fairly small resort with 400 rooms and it suited us perfectly.

We have been to many Carribbean Islands, but never to Mexico. After receiving many suggestions from friends, and reading lots of reviews on TripAdvisor, we opted for Catalonia Playa Maroma, due to it's excellent beach. We enjoyed this resort VERY much. The staff at this resort were by far the hardest working and friendliest people we have ever encountered on vacation. It's obvious that they enjoy what they do, and want the guests to be happy. We stayed in a Privledged Room in the Coba 2000 building. We encountered problems with the Wi-fi Internet in that location, so were moved to the Timakul 4000 building. The rooms were very clean, well stocked with beverages, with beautiful views of the courtyards. The buildings on this resort are set back from the beach in the jungle, so there are very few rooms with an ocean view, as the buildings are only 3 floors high. Due to the small size of this resort, regardless of which building you are in, you are still within a 5 minute walk to anything on the property, so it really doesn't matter where you're located. We found the food at this resort very good. The buffet always had lots of selection and we always came away satisfied. The resort has 4 ala carte restaurants. We ate at the Italian Restaurant twice, the Mediterranean Steakhouse twice, and the Mexican place once. We opted to trade in our Priveledged coupon to the Tapas Lounge, as it was mostly a seafood menu, which we don't enjoy. We had good meals at each of these restaurants. Portion sizes are small, but the presentation is wonderful and you end up eating 4-5 courses, so you never left hungry. The Ala Carte restaurants do not take reservations, you just show up to be seated or have your name put on the waiting list. Many nights we waited an hour to be seated, which put us past 9pm, so you need to plan accordingly. Either arrive right when the restaurant opens, or expect long waits thoughout the evening. We used the gym facilities and the tennis courts. The tennis courts were in very good condition and had lights for night play, so we took advantage of that, as it was cooler playing after dark. The gym was pretty basic and could use some upgrades, as much of the equipment was old and beginning to fall apart. The beach is the BEST feature of this resort. It was the most beautiful powder white sand beach. There wasn't a stone, pebble, or shell on this beach. The water was so crystal clear, you could see lots of angel fishing swimming around you in waist deep water. The water was cool getting in, but was warm enough to swim and body surf in the waves. There were always plenty of beach chairs available. The best beach hours are between 10am-2pm, as the afternoon clouds begin rolling in by 3pm and the temperature begins to drop by this time as well. There is no snorkelling at this beach, so if that's important to you, I suggest selecting a resort that has a coral beach. My spouse enjoys all the water activities available at the all-inclusive resorts and was looking forward to wind-surfing, kayaking and using the Catamarans each day. We were disappointed to discover that they no longer offer windsurfing and you couldn't use the Catamarans without a staff member to drive, even if you had sailing experience. On days where the water was rough, and a red flag was posted on the beach, water activities are closed. This is very unfortunate, as the windy days are when the Catamarans would have been the most enjoyable. Kayaking along the shoreline and riding the waves in the kayaks would have been fun too, but no water sports were allowed, even though the resorts on both sides of us still allowed water activities (Secrets Maroma and Maroma Resort & Spa). We had 3 days of Red Flags. The Scuba Shop offers free \"trial scuba diving\" in the swimming pool each day. You get to do a short 10min dive in the pool to see if you like it. As we are beach people, we didn't spend much time by the pool. The pool was nice, but could have used twice as many chairs. There were never enough chairs/lounges for people to lay on. Some people dragged chairs up from the beach, or just laid on their towels on the cement. The pool doesn't have any hot tubs, which would be a welcome addition. The crowd at this resort was mostly 40's/50's with the majority speaking french, italian, and spanish. English was definintely a minority at this resort. This resort is not well suited for a young crowd looking for nightlife. There were some families at the resort, but not many, mostly couples ranging from 30-60. We rented a car and ventured off the resort to see some sights. The main road, Highway 307, is very easy to navigate and is in good driving condition. We went to Tulum to see some of the Ruins (90min each direction) and to Playa Del Carmen to check out their beach and shops (30min each direction). As the resorts are all along the water, there isn't much to \"see\" along Highway 307 except for vegetation, but they were still worthwhile adventures. We enjoyed this resort very much and would return here without hesitation.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland Falls, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay and Relax\u201d", "Author": "giacoio", "ReviewID": "UR97146339", "Content": "My wife and I recently stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma all inclusive resort outside of Cancun, Mexico.

This hotel was fabulous with the beach, service and food as highlights. We took our 5 year old and thoroughly enjoyed this resort. It is an older more reserved crowd with some young families. I\u2019ve done the drink all you can drink scene in the past \u2013 as evidenced by the lack of a swim up bar, this isn\u2019t that type of resort. We are from the US and it was nice to have a mix of nationalities with the majority of the crowd from France. It is amazing to see the staff adjust between all of the languages coming at them. *Staff \u2013 There was a friendly \u2018hola\u2019 everywhere you turned. Thanks to Laura for the Spanish class! *Layout \u2013 For the directionally challenged such as me, it was easy to find your way around. Being close to the pool/beach was outstanding. The buffet was a good little hike from our room, especially for a young child. It was a good thing for us grownups who were eating all we could eat every day! *Beach \u2013 Gorgeous, fantastic etc, etc. Perfect waves, always chairs available and wonderful strolls that resulted in the discovery of more amazing beach area. *Buffet \u2013 There was a great selection for breakfast, lunch & dinner. They have theme nights \u2013 don\u2019t miss the Mexican night. The deep fried donut/churro and fruit selection for breakfast was a hit. *Restaurants \u2013 We went to the tapas, Italian and Mexican a la carte restaurants. Bring a coloring book or activity for small children as the full experience through each of the courses can span over an hour, but it is time well spent! *Mini disco \u2013 We didn\u2019t use the kids club, but did visit the theater for the 9pm mini disco a few nights which was entertaining for the kiddies and adults. The theater shows done by the activity staff were very good. Kudos to the activity staff \u2013 they keep everyone entertained during the day; speak numerous languages and sing & dance! *Pool \u2013 The water was cool, but that was to be expected with this time of year. The zero depth entry makes it perfect for the kids. There was also a deep water section over 7 feet deep. *Room \u2013 The room was clean and comfortable. The ceiling fan was enough for this time of year to keep the room cooled off. The water bottles stocked daily were a nice touch and appreciated along with a steady supply of Pepsi \u2018light\u2019 in the refrigerator.

We arrived on a flight on Canjet (Nolitours) around 11 p.m. at night. There did not appear to be anyone to take our bags to our room. As we had been there last year, we knew the layout of the resort and borrowed one of the carts to transport our luggage to the room. There are six blocks of rooms located on either side of a tranquil and well-lit pathway. Piped-in relaxation music follows you along the path. Some people may find that it is a long walk from the lobby to most of the rooms and the beach. Rooms: due to mobility issues, I had requested a room close to the beach and the majority of restaurants. The resort provided a room in Block 5, a perfect location for me. The room was clean but somewhat old in its furnishings. We don\u2019t spend much time in the room, so it was not a big concern to us. I was happy to see that the mattress had been replaced with a new softer mattress as the one last year was very hard. The bathroom needs some renovation. There are small cracks in the sink and the shower stall (no tub) is a bit dated. I understand that the resort is in the processing of renovating rooms. We were glad to see that the resort is trying to promote environmental responsibility with its request to guests to reuse towels and linens and to turn off the air conditioner when not in the room. There was a coffee maker and pouches of coffee in the room as well as a few toiletry supplies. The air conditioner was just able to keep up with the heat and the ceiling fan helped - I doubt it would have been adequate if it had been very hot. There were two chairs and a small table on the balcony. The balcony had a pleasant view, was very peaceful and was a great place to have a drink and read. Grounds: the grounds are impeccable. The gardeners are out every day working on the lush gardens. Small animals (coatis), a couple of cats and many lovely birds can be seen. It is like being in the jungle. The hotel offers a narrated nature walk to further enhance the enjoyment of this relaxing atmosphere. Beach and Pool: we initially came to this resort because of the beach. It is one of the most beautiful beaches you can imagine. You can walk half and hour at a quick pace, in either direction from the hotel, and not reach the end. The pool is kept very clean. While some have commented that the pool is not very large, I found it more than adequate with both deep and more shallow areas, to accommodate everyone. There is also a whirlpool but the water was not very hot when we were there. Restaurants: there are 3 a la carte restaurants, (no reservations required), one buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, a beach bar and creperie, and snack bar for lunch, a tapas restaurant and a large lobby bar. The buffet food was reasonably good and theme nights were held throughout the week. The Terraza (Italian) was an excellent restaurant and we had two meals there. The service at this restaurant was top-notch and we tipped accordingly. We were surprised to see that some guests did not tip at all or left what I thought was an insulting tip, considering the service provided. We also ate at the Tortuga (steak house). The food was very flavourful but, unfortunately, our meal was cold when we received it and we did not enjoy it. We did not have an opportunity to try Tio Pedro (Mexican) restaurant. We enjoyed our special dinner at the Tapas restaurant, but the portions were small. Clientele: average age was 50. There was a mixture of Italians, French, Spanish, and English guests. There were very few children, but all were well behaved. There is a disco at the resort each night. It is held near the entrance and the lobby bar, away from the rooms. Overall this is not a party resort, but those who want to participate in the night club scene can take a 20 minute ride into Playa del Carmen or do one of the group Cancun \u201cbar crawls\u201d. Perhaps because smoking is so restricted in Ontario (and therefore not as obvious) there seemed to be a lot of smokers at the resort. While there were smoking restrictions in the specialty restaurants, and a separate smoking area in the buffet, elsewhere there were no restrictions and it was sometimes hard to avoid being downwind from the smoke. Services for people with disabilities: I was very impressed with the facilities available for disabled clients. There are four rooms specifically designed for disabled guests. Two of the four rooms, have an adjoining room for those people that are accompanying disabled guests. A plastic ramp/walkway runs from the pool/bar area to two dedicated palapas on the beach which are reserved for the use of disabled clients. Access to the beach is also facilitated by two beach wheel chairs that can be rolled through the sand and into the water. The pool is slightly graded in one area so that a person can walk in slowly. There are also many tables with umbrellas and ordinary chairs around the pool area for people who cannot sit on the lounge chairs. Tables are reserved and set up for disabled dinners in the Buffet and all the specialty restaurants had ramps. Staff: the staff is some of the nicest we have met. Everyone provided service with a smile and a friendly \u201chola\u201d. Consierge staff, Eduardo and Roberto, are quick to respond to questions and concerns and are always very respectful to guests. It is our belief that everyone, from the kitchen staff, to gardeners, beach cleaners and management staff, contributes to the overall enjoyment of our vacation and everyone deserves the credit. Cleanliness: this has to be one of the cleanest 4 star resorts we have been to. The bathrooms on the grounds are cleaned frequently and were spotless. This is the first time I have seen workers cleaning the rungs of the chairs and the handles on the outside doors of washrooms. Workers are continually sweeping, cleaning up cigarette butts, removing glasses and cleaning the common areas. Miscellaneous: Money: the shops on the resort and the front desk now only accept payment in Mexican pesos, although they still quote prices in US funds. It is still ok to tip in US funds but it is easy to change your money into pesos and use them. There is an ATM and money exchange booth on site. Off Resort: just as a note, we left the resort two times to visit Playa del Carmen, about 20 minutes away by cab. The resort no longer offers the shuttle. A cab will cost $20 US and the cab driver did accept US funds. We had the most wonderful guacamole at Mi Pueblo at the corner of Quinta and 8th. The manager Max was exceptionally courteous to his guests and we would recommend this restaurant if you are in Playa del Carmen. Conclusion: the resort is listed as a 3.5 to 4 star in many brochures, but many of the services and features deserve a 5 star rating. We highly recommend it for those looking for tranquility, friendly staff, great service and the most beautiful beach.

It is a very pleasant resort with immaculate grounds, nicely appointed rooms and good food and beverages. Its main attraction is its beach! It is simply spectacular! Perfect soft sand, no coral chips or rocks, just wonderful. Catering to the beach lovers is their forte, they are the only resort we've visited where the beach lounges outnumber the guests! That means that you don't have to designate a \"pallapa boy\" to rush down early to stake out your chairs, you can just eat a normal breakfast and get to the beach when you are ready, confident that you will find your spot! The rooms are contained in three buildings, 1-6, odd numbers to the south. They are all a good walk from the lobby and the buffet restaurant, but closer to the ala carte restaurants. The rooms are nice, a little bit dated, but have all the usual amenities. The restaurants are all good, the buffet for breakfast is excellent, and the grill, Mexican and Italian are really good. They have a Terrace restaurant that serves Tapas and also serves a lobster dinner for a modest extra charge, The pool is OK, but I should say that we are not pool people, so that is just an observation. The bars are great, all tropical drinks are made from scratch instead of from pre-mixes. The wines are all either Spanish (if from a bottle) or Mexican (if from a tap). The Spanish are pretty good, the Mexican needs some further aging! During our stay, we were the only Americans, there were a few Canadians, but most vacationers were either French, Spanish or Italian, with a few Germans added to the mix. The guests all were cordial and added to the ambiance of the resort. We booked through Cheap Caribbean and our experience was again excellent. We were in a \"Privileged\" room, and that gave us a discount on the lobster dinner and free internet access. Beyond that, I'm not sure what the other benefits were, if any. So far as I know, it didn't cost us any extra. Whoever you are, and especially if you are beach people and have children traveling with you, you will love the Catalonia.

At this resort you never felt pressured to tip anyone at all, we did of course but was not expected. Enrique on the beach was always smiling and willing to bring you drinks whenever needed. There was never a long wait to get a drink at the beach bar and would wave you over if you werent being sereved right away. The entertainament staff were all very nice, personally i dont interact with them as i enjoy relaxing with people we have met or my gf but if you wanted to there is always something to do. BEACH- The beach is beautiful!!!! you can walk at least a kilometer each way with soft white sand and and open beaches. There are lots of fish swimming around your feet when the ocean is calm, i would recomend bring snorkle gear! You ALWAYS could get a beach chair on the beach and there is shade to be had, dont listen to the other people complaining that there is no shade.

Our room was awsome, new furniture, flat screen tv, rainshower glass tile shower and a king bed, fridge was ALWAYS stocked with beer, water and pop and everyday and some sort of towel art made. We left 40 pesos each day. No complaints here at all. I cant comment on the other rooms but from what i heard the privilage is overated. PEOPLE- now this is the only part of the review that is negetive, if you are looking for a non-smoking english speaking resort this isnt for you. This resort is 90% european in which almost all of them smoke and most are very rude They do not move out foy our way and will probally run you over if you didnt move, they have no regard fro blowing smoke in your face and will drop thierr cigarett butts in the sand and they treat the staff poorly. We did meet some very nice Canadians and Americans which was cool but they were few and far between. This resort could really up thier star rating if they made it a non-smoking resort. TRAVEL- travel to playa del carmen is about 15-20min and will cost you $20 US dollars or 200 pesos each way. There is no shuttle wich would have been a nice touch. FOOD- the food was good, it wasnt great and but i had zero complaints i could always find something i liked. The buffet was good with lots of choices. There was 3 ala cart restaurants, italian, steak house and mexican. Itilian was the best in my opinion. We went there 3 times! the steak house is second and mexican 3rd but all are very very good. Again the staff was amazing and attention to detail was the best. I noticed as well a strong managment pressence all over the resort with was nice to see and were friendly as well. All and all this resort was great, the best in my 6 vacations!!! If you choose this resort you wont be dissapointed.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cWhen can I go Back?\u201d", "Author": "OntarioViking", "ReviewID": "UR93862476", "Content": "Just came back from one of our more enjoyable vacations. My wife & I have travelled and cruised the Caribbean for the past 11 years and our stay at Catalonia Playa Maroma will rate as our favorite all-inclusive resort. We were travelling with our daughter & her boyfriend and our son & his girl friend (all in their mid to late 20's). The check-in was a breeze. We decided to upgrade us all to the 'Privileged Rooms' since we wanted to be close to the beach and it also gives you a few added perks at the a-la carte restaurants and spa. well worth the added expense. We all fell in love with the natural beauty of the resort - all the units are set apart from each other by natural Mangroves - you feel like you are in the middle of a rainforest walking to the Lobby or the Buffet. Excellent food and plentiful - even for our vegetarians. The a-la-carte restaurants (4) really surprised me. Each has its own kitchen, so it is not the buffet food re-presented to you. Food quality and presentation would rival most restaurants in Canada. The resort staff go out of their way to please you. They are constantly cleaning the grounds and walkways. This is not a glitzy polished marble, granite and glass resort - it is as natural as it gets. I would not change a thing. I would go back tomorrow if I could.

I can't say enough good things about this place - in fact, we're going back again this year. I've been to a bunch of different tropical resorts in the Carribean (Bahamas, Caymans, Jamaica, Virgin Islands, etc) and for the price, this place can't be beat. If you want the feel of a bustling resort and a crowded beach, this is not the place for you. The CPM is located in a jungle-type setting that opens up onto a pristine, powdery white sand beach. It's nothing short of breathtaking - so relaxing. The water is a brilliant turquoise and the sand seems to defy the laws of physics - no matter how high the air temperature is, the sand is nice and cool. The resort is about a 15 minute cab ride from Playa del Carmen, but the resort has everything you need (including shopping), so most of our group never left the resort grounds at all. The People: We traveled with a fairly large group for our wedding - about 25 of us total - and the hotel staff was beyond accomodating to make sure all our needs and requests were met. Everyone was so nice and helpful and really went out of their way to make our time there special. The resort works for all ages. The youngest person in our group was 15 (the oldest was 58), and while it is also child-friendly, it is by no means overrun with noisy kids (whew). Wedding: Our wedding coordinator, Eduardo, was so organized and professional - this guy was really phenomenal. He really went out of his way to make sure our wedding day was absolutely beautiful and made sure we didn't have to worry about a thing. He paid such great attention to detail and really made sure it was all perfect. I honestly can't think of one thing that went wrong. I can't comment on their photography services, as we flew our own photographers down for the event. We got married on the beach at sunset, followed by a cocktail reception and then dinner at the Italian restaurant. We also hired a mariachi band for some entertainment at the cocktail reception. It was all just amazing. If you're thinking about getting married on the beach, and you're not super Type-A, I highly recommend it. Absolutely no stress and everyone has such a great time! Food: The food is about par for the course for an all-inclusive - it's not the best I've ever eaten, but it was good. We went to another resort in Playa for our honeymoon and, while the food was a bit better, the atmosphere didn't compare to the CPM - we kind of wished we had stayed there longer. Rooms: I highly recommend staying in the privileged rooms. The upgrade doesn't cost that much more and it's well worth it. We had people staying in both types of rooms and the privileged rooms are much, much nicer. Spa: About half of our group got massages at one point or another during the week, us included, and as far as I know, everyone loved them. I also got a mani/pedi the day of our wedding and thought it was very good. Evening Entertainment: We didn't really participate much in the evening entertainment opportunities, although I know some shows were offered. With a such a large group, we kind of entertained ourselves. I really can't say enough good things about this resort and the staff. They made our trip unforgettable. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about this resort or having a destination wedding.

My husband and I spent 2 glorious weeks at Catalonia Playa Maroma and we could have spent another 2. If you want a place where you can completely relax this is where you need to be. We were among a handful of english speaking Canadians but that didn't keep us from getting to know the amazing staff and other Canadians visiting the resort. In fact it brought us Canadians closer together! Unfortunately the language barrier did keep us from really getting to know some of the other guests but they were mostly friendly regardless. Our room was in the privalleged section and though we didn't get the king sized bed we were hoping for we were happy with the room over all and didn't bother trying to change. The room was amazingly clean however the air conditioning didn't work overly well (room 4106 incase the management wants to know) Luckily my husband and I are used to not having a/c so the fan along with the a/c was good enough. :) The resort itself has an extremely relaxed atmosphere. The clientele seems a little more \"high class\" for lack of a better word and eventhough there were people having a good time it never got out of control. Most of the time people were sitting at a table or one of the great couches in the lobby playing cards and having a cappuccino. (which is AMAZING by the way) The animation team is unbelievable, speaking all 4 common languages of the resort; italian, spanish, french, and english. A special thank you to Jhonny for making our stay extra fabulous! My husband and I are fitness competitors so the gym facilities were a concern at first. We couldn't find a picture at the time of booking but we were surprised to find it had everything we needed! Oh except for a matching 5lb and 10lb dumbell for the ones that are there. I had to use 5lb plates most of the time. The air conditioning isn't on most of the time but I think that's because the room isn't air tight. We made the best of it and embraced the extra hard workouts. The shops on site are amazing and not too badly priced though most of the stuff you can find in Playa Del Carmen should you be there. Unfortunately I didn't get around to using the spa so I can't tell you how it is. The food was always amazing. In the buffett & the 3 al la cartes. You MUST go to Tortuga and have the Portobello Maroma and french onion soup. Being in the fitness industry eating somewhere other then home can be hard but I had no problems at all. The long walkway from the main lobby to the rooms/gym/beach was never a problem except for when it rained of course. In fact we liked being farther away from the lobby since that's where the disco and entertainment stage is so should we turn in early we couldn't hear anything from the room. Speaking of the disco and entertainment stage, the disco was so much fun! Most of the staff stick around and dance the night away with you. The dj plays newer music which is great and liked by everyone. We saw the majority of the entertainment on stage through our trip and all of the shows were fantastic. I would like to see some more singers however. :) The beach is of course amazing. Beautifully white and soft. If you can't find a chair, walk over to the far right and there is staff washing some off. They'll grab a chair and bring it out for you. As for topless tanning I can say I was one of a handful of people doing it as I had to avoid the tan lines. Besides it was something to check off the ol' \"bucket list' ;). The water is amazing though always moving. The wind blows all the time so it kicks up the water a little but not too bad at all. The angel fish that hang out in the area are completely harmless but quite curious. Bring a banana and they'll be your best friend all day! I'm not sure what else I can say besides this was the best vacation I've ever had. I was worried about staying in one place for so long but it was amazing. Again the atmosphere is very relaxed so if you're looking to party this resort is not for you. Also there is no free shuttle as mentioned in a previous review by the management but it's $20 each way to get to Playa Del Carmen. I also recommend going to Coco Bongo while you're there.

The creperie was also good and offered a quick fix for hunger, if you lay by the pool or beach.Christmas and New Years offered special dinner buffet with beautiful food decorations.

I hope this review will assure you that you have made an excellent decision in choosing this resort. I travelled with my husband and a five-year-old. Don't be put off by the bumpy, dusty approach from the highway (there are environmental reasons for not paving this road, by the way). The road opens up eventually to reveal a lush, green, manicured oasis. You arrive at an enormous and impressive thatched lobby and are greeted by professional. friendly staff and a refreshing beverage. We had purchased the upgrade (Privileged) and it was well worth the extra $200 or $300 to do so. We were escorted to a beautiful room with an ocean view. No flouncy floral bedspreads here! It was tastefully decorated in a traditional way with heavy dark-wood furniture and earth-tones and tiles. There was a balcony, excellent A/C, a flat-screen TV and comfortable beds. The other plus with Privileged is that it's close to the beach (a scenic, sandy walkway was tucked in behind our villa), the pools, several restaurants and a charming shopping concourse. The meals were superb - lots of choice, very fresh and nicely displayed. Much effort had been made to keep birds away from the food areas. For instance, the buffet building was open-concept, but completely draped in a mesh. I've been to resorts in other countries where birds can be found perched at the food tables! Yuck! The beach was stunning - like walking in a huge bowl of white sugar! The water was wonderful as well, and we spent a lot of time at the beach, jumping the waves and making sand castles. What's great about the location of this resort is that it is 20km from Playa del Carmen. That meant you can walk for kilometers along a rather unpopulated stretch, see lots of natural flora and beachcomb! There were joggers out in the early hours and people happily strolling, enjoying the serenity and natural surroundings. The pool area was more active, with tasteful music (Latin and other genres) playing throughout the day. The staff led stretching classes, yoga, dance lessons and the occasional silly game or two. But as I said, it was easy to escape that scene by heading to the ample beach area. Kids' Club: We were cautiously optimistic about the Kids' Club. I hadn't seen much written about the Club at HCM, so I hope those of you with children will find this review useful. Our five-year-old daughter LOVED the Kids' Club. Although most of the kids in it spoke French and Italian, our little English-speaker got right in there and made friends anyway! The lovely staff made her feel completely welcome and safe. These energetic young counsellors planned engaging activities and games to keep the kids coming back. This was NOT a babysitting service, but a well-run, active experience for the children. The Club operates for three hours in the morning, takes a break for lunch, and then opens again for one and a half hours in the afternoon. So even though our daughter insisted on going to both sessions, we still were able to spend lots of quality time with her before, inbetween and afterwards. The Saturday-night Kids' Show that the Club produces with the children was unforgettable! Costumes, lighting, music - you'll want to bring a video camera for this one! Finally, I can't say enough about the professionalism of the staff, the cleanliness of the grounds and the obvious efforts at upkeep and beautification of the surroundings. Everyone greets you with \"Hola!\" and work extremely hard. We also enjoyed the international flavour of the guests - you'll hear lots of French and Italian. English-speaking Canadians, along with Americans, are in the minority, but we never felt like \"second-class citizens\", as someone mentioned in an earlier review. We will definitely be back next year.

We originally booked all the rooms with a king size bed but when we arrived three couples were given twin beds and only one was given a king size bed. After going to management they stated they could not help us and we could try again tomorrow but no guarantees. I returned the next day and was able to get a king size bed but the other two couples were unable to. 2. Our room was not very clean and the bathroom needed an emergent update. There were cracked tiles on the sink and shower accompanied by poor A/C. One couple had barely any A/C (of which did not get fixed during the stay after many calls were made). In addition we and another couple had little bugs crawling up from the cracks and were all over the sink and again after many calls to maintenance no once sprayed or fixed the problem. 3. Bed Bugs!!! My husband and I woke up every morning with new red bite marks that took nearly a week to go away. 4. Our friend\u2019s power went out and it took maintenance 2 hours to fix the problem. 5. We decided to go out to one of the restaurants for dinner (which was a bad idea), it took 45 minutes to seat us and when they did they stated they did not have a table big enough for a party of 8 so we had to split up. After the separation one group was served food fairly quick while the other group waited another 40 minutes to get their order taken. 6. Mosquitoes were TERRIBLE!! And the staff did not have any bug spray to help reduce the amount. 7. The pool was hotter then it was outside and if you were to order a drink it would take around an hour to get it from the staff and once you got your drink back the cups were cracked and leaking. 8. The pool is not that big and if you want a pool chair you need to get one at 7/8am and hope that no one removes your towel. 9. It stated free internet but it is impossible to use it! The computer is kept in the privilege office which is barely ever open. On several days I attempted to use the internet to communicate with the rest of my family back in Chicago and after trying every 2 hours with the door always locked I gave up. 10.

Their English is very poor as they tailor to Mexican, Spanish, or Italian speaking clientele. They seem to treat their North American guests as second rate and we were very nice to everyone, it is quite strange. The initial standard room we got was straight out of a 3rd world country, clearly not renovated or maintained ever. The 'Priveleged' we paid to upgrade to was ok with nice furniture, but had a tiny shower with broken tiles, and apparently non-smoking means smoking there.

We stayed at Catalonia Playa Maroma on the 1st week of December 2010.. What a wonderful stay at this vacation resort. We stayed last year same time at Catalonia Gran Dominicus in La Romana Dominican and enjoyed it as well.. Firstly upon arrival in Cancun no problems at the airport finding our bus to the hotel. There was a convention going on and we were then advised there could be delays but so what we are on holidays.. everything went well. When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready and was given the room number and asked to go and have some lunch and come back around 3:00pm.. We went to check the room around 2:00pm and it was ready. We met with Ericka and she said she would ask the supervisor if we could enter early. That took about half an hour and finally after travelling all day she gave us the key and off we went.. Thank you Ericka for helping us with this small problem. No big deal.. The room well- was very clean but the bathroom was a little alarming... It really needs a renovation but no mold and very clean.. thats what counts.. the bed was great and our made sylvie was right on the button when she did our room and left us with towel animals.. We didi tip her and left her some gifts as well . when we go again i will stay in a priviledge room as this one was a standard one..we stayed in block 5 which was located perfect location near the beach and a small stroll to the lobby and main buffet area.. The staff incredible!! From Alie and Ericka at the front desk ready to please everyone and they let me ring the huge bell on the desk everyday to Querino and Abraham at the buffet were just terrific - on the ball always there for you never need to wait or want one thing. Thank you.. Can't forget Enrico on the beach who would bring a cold beer at 10:00am and bring 2 because it was always happy hour... great guy.!!! The food was amazing!! We enjoyed everything at the buffet , lunch and supper as well. Everything was fresh and well cooked. Even morning bloody Mary's were there for your enjoyment if you needed them.. The a la cartes were great except the steakhouse.. I had the pork ribs and yuck taste and texture was as tough as shoe leather, but the mexican and the italian were scrumptous!! The beach was beautiful.. lots of shade and they were doing repairs to create more shade no problem to get loungers in the morning and afternoon plenty of them.. we did not go to the pool lots of activities going on and we are beach bums who like to relax and read so we stayed away.. very very relaxing enjoyable time.. 1 boat to pick up the divers once in awhile and no smell of gas or seadoos anywhere. I had to get used to the large angel fish swimming around me but it was fun anyway.. 2 days the waves were rough in the ocean after that you could float around and enjoy the blue clear water and see your feet. I would like to thank everyone at this lovely holiday resort again for the wonderful vacation you made us feel special and very welcome. We will be back and thats a guarantee...

Pros: The food was the best we have ever had at any resort in the Caribbean. The buffet had a lot of variety and they have a great a la carte policy - no lining up daily to make reservations. The beach is beautiful, with clean, cool sand and fish swim right up to you on calm days. We didn't spend much time at the pool, but it was really nice. The rooms are very clean and comfortable; standard rooms are great and you can upgrade to the privileged rooms if you want nicer fixtures or an outdoor jacuzzi. The staff are very friendly and Karina at Guest Services did an excellent job of organizing our wedding. We could not have asked for a better day! The resort itself is beautiful, with a long walkway linking the lobby and buffet to the pool, beach and a la carte restaurants. The rooms are in six buildings set along the walkway. Lots of wildlife to be seen - birds, butterflies, coatis, iguanas, squirrels and what I think was a capybara. They had special wheelchairs for use on the sand, and reserved palapas for those with mobility issues. I have not seen this at any other resort before. Cons: Late in our stay most of the structures providing shade were being dismantled and replaced so shade was hard to come by, but that has probably been fixed by now. There can be a lot of walking, especially if you've forgotten something in your room. Other notes/comments: There is nightly entertainment with a show followed by games in the lobby, and the lobby has live music every other night. The resort has a little market place, with the spa, a tuck shop and a couple of boutiques. Prices are reasonable and you can charge items directly to your room bill. If you go away and want to hear only English from your fellow guests, this may not be the place for you. The resort was full capacity our second week and it was probably 85% European and 15% North American. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would not hesitate to recommend the resort to anyone, as it has a little something for everyone.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "COTravelFriend", "ReviewID": "UR89163918", "Content": "The staff was incredible!

There are plenty of chairs on the beach for everyone and adequate shade. No need to get up early to save a chair. The food was very good and the people were so friendly. We loved the crepe station by the beachfront bar and the Tortuga snack grill for lunchtime. We did not upgrade to \"Privileged\" and did not feel in any way deprived. Our room was not luxurious but who cares? We spent little time in it. Our bed was soft and we slept great. My husband took the 2 hour snorkeling trip from our beach. It was $35 and they take you to the reef that you can see from the beach. He liked the trip. He played beach volleyball every day and enjoyed playing with the many Europeans and Canadians.

Need work big time in bathroom. it's standing shower stall,tile floor in bathroom very sleepery, tiles were cracked and wall tiles had mold on grout. Disgusting bathrooms. Food was very good any where you eat on property and excellent service. House keeping was good. Staff on entire property very helpful. Always greet you and willing to help you. Top class PR, no doubt. Did not get chance to do any activity as we were busy attending wedding. We were walking back and forth to Secretes Resorts Next door for wedding.

The transer to and from the hotel was easy and enjoyable. Only about 20-30 minutes on a very comfortable, air conditioned bus. The only hitch was finding out the time it arrived at the hotel to depart as we didn't partake in the 1 hour briefing the day after we got there with NOLITOURS. Their representative - Vanessa was quite rude and was not very helpful since we didn't attend her briefing. One of the highlights of our trip was the SCUBA diving. Prodive is a company with a 5 Star PADI Centre right on site. Thank you to Muriel, Andre, Jason, Jasmina, Eric and the many others that were very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend getting certified here for your Open Water Certification. The food was absolutely amazing! 12 buffets at the the buffet centre that give amazing choices and diversity of food that caters to even the most finicky eaters. We heard different recommendations on each of the a la carte restaurants but enjoyed the food at all of them. The Italian restaurant was the slowest of service but also was the busiest. The rooms (ours was Standard and closest to the pool on the North side) were nice but very basic. I slept VERY WELL but the recommendations about bringing your own pillow are a good point. The SECRETS hotel next to us had an open air concert several nts while we were there and it was VERY LOUD but always ended by 11 p.m. We were suppose to have a coffee maker in our room and asked several times to get one but never received it. The other couple we travelled with had a coffee maker and extra blanket but we never saw either of these even though we tipped with cash and small items we brought from home every day. We were pleased to get towel art the first couple days but after the second day we never saw another. Our friends never got any towel art. Also there was always lots of towels but not much for facecloths. The shower always had hot water even at the morning rush. The pool is nice but everyone uses the beach as it is AMAZING with Angel fish that will swim right around your feet as you enter the ocean. The sand is very soft and white and never gets hot. Entertainment was plentiful with shows by the Animation team, a couple singing in the lobby each night and a Disco club beside the open air pool table. The only night we saw any real action in the Disco was the Saturday night. The hotel has a SPA that we didn't partake in but noticed that a one hour massage with the coupons you are given is about $80 USD and we noticed the same time was $27-33 in Playa Del Carmen. There are several other shops there if you need anything or want to purchase something that you didn't get in Playa del Carmen or Puerto Morelos. Transportation - Our friends rented a JEEP at the airport which I think is a great way to get around. VERY easy to find things down there and good roads. The cops did pull them over one night (for what reason they were not sure) and wanted them to give up their drivers licence and come get it in Tulum the next day. They asked for the cop to consult with his supervisor and did not give up the licence and after a short chat the officer got the instruction over the radio to let them go on their way with a handshake. Kinda strange but it IS a different country and language barriers are common! Shuttle to Playa del Carmen (5th Ave.) was NOT AVAILABLE while we were there even though it says that on all the websites and Trip Advisor. You had to walk a mile to the road to catch a bus if you wanted to go into town (according to fellow travellors). I am sure a taxi could have been called and been quite cheap.

This was our first trip to Mexico, and our 2nd time in an all-inclusive resort. The service that we received was first rate. I was in touch with Eduardo weeks before we got to Catalonia. I will say that he was very prompt and extremely courteous. The food was good everyday that we were there. The poolside bar did a very good job on our drinks. We loved the ladies that worked in the spa, jewelry store, and the gift shop (the one with the liquor). The animation staff especially JB and JC. (I wish you two the best) were extremely friendly and funny. If you leave the resort try to get Taxi 551 (Pedro) or his brother Taxi (1216). Pedro took us into town and also gave me his # to call when we were ready to return. He is very friendly and extremely hard working. The beach oh my goodness. In a few words.... Beautiful, gorgeous, very soft white floured sand. The waves were a bit rough but the beach itself more than made up for the lack of time in the water. We met a few Americans while we were there. I really think that this resort is a true diamond in the rough. If you want a smaller resort and truly want to relax then forget any negative comments and go!!!! The walkway through the rainforest was absolutely gorgeous. The staff are all very friendly and everyone speaks. Even the dirt road ride from the main highway to Catalonia was fun.

There are only 2 other resorts on this stretch of sand which was nice. The buffet at breakfast was good - large variety of items.

This may look long but well worth reading. I will breakdown this review by Room, Facility, Food and Entertainment Room: we had a standard two bed, one bath on the ground floor of building #5. Our room didn't have a clock(no biggy) but only had three towels for four of us. The mini bar is 4 bottles of water and 4 cans of pop. We didn't have ants but our two neighbours did. The ceiling fan was wobbily but worked and the AC needs a little more, I wouldn't want to be there in warmer months. Facility: The pool was very small to most resort and there was very little water activity, they started water polo at 16:00 it was nearly dark. The pool is nice and deep but sadly no swimup bar. The Beach is FANTASTIC, great sand, nice waves, simply nice overall. The water sport equipment are kayaks and hobbiecats, no wakeboards too bad the waves were perfect. Go next door the Secrets and rent a board for $10 an hour. The beach volley ball was GREAT and you can walk for miles in each direction. The lobby is very nice with nice sitting areas and good wait staff. There are many Coati Mundis running around begging for food. The have entertainment in the lobby in the early evening one couple did remember their name but they were Excellent. The weight room has a treadmill and good spin cycle, there are free weights and a universal system. There are a few shops in the Mercado area open from 08:00 to 20:00 everyday. There is an evening market with vendors selling stuff but not every night. There is three bars, the lobby, the pool and the disco. The disco is a loose term it is more a large lounge that can televise sporting events but not usually. The Tennis area is very nice and there is an outdoor basketball court along with an archery range. Food and Entertainment: There are 3 eating areas. The buffet El Pajarito near the lobby is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is a good selection of food. There is some mexican dishes however that standard fare but a good salad area and many selections of breads. The daytime food consists of the Tortuga which has standard North American wing, dog, burgers etc. The Creperie is near the pool and has great crepes and a lunchtime outdoor events showcasing food like Paella or mexican nacho, tacos. There are 4 a la cartes, Tio Pedro, Tortuga, Terraza The TERRAZA is EXCELLENT. TIO PEDRO very nice mexican dishes. La TORTUGA steakhouse the steak at TERRAZA was much nicer? The theatre is very nice open air area. The Animation team are very strong dancers and do put on good productions that are entertaining. The only show that was a bore was the Mayan dance...Painfully too long. This is nice resort however I probably won't go back for these reasons:Too Far from anything.

The grounds of the hotel are impeccably kept. They are just beautiful. Lots of foliage. Saw coati mundi every day as well as some really interesting birds and a few iguanas. I can't say enough about the beach. The cab driver told us it was rated by Trip Advisor the number two beach in Mexico and one of the top ten in the world by the Travel Channel and man, he wasn't kidding. It is just breathtaking. The sand is powdery white and never got hot. There were no rocks at all. We could see fish all around us when we were swimming. (A fellow guest told us they were angel fish?) We walked both north and south on different days for about an hour in each direction and we definitely had the best beach on the strip. We never had trouble finding chairs. I'd read reviews where people were saying that the shady spots were claimed very early in the morning. We found just the opposite. Most people actually dragged the chairs from beneath the palapas(?) into the sun. But there were more than enough chairs to go around. Maybe we lucked out because we went on a \"shoulder\" season. The pool area was pretty, never crowded and completely spotless. People also complained about waiting a long time at the pool bar. We never experienced more than a couple of minutes' wait. We had a privileged room and it was nice. Dark wood furniture, tiled floors and shower stall (no tub) and flat screen t.v. It was also spotless. We had no issues with the air conditioning, and honestly, for us, the ceiling fan was sufficient for most of our stay. We had a nice, small patio (we were on the first floor) that had a view of the pool. The only negative was that for our first night we had a family with a small child next door and we could hear the child. He/she was pretty loud. I don't know if it was because we had a connecting door that wasn't really sound-proof or if it was the frequency of the child's squeals or what, but thank goodness it was just the first day. I think if they were there longer I may have had to ask to change rooms. We knew we had people above us only because we saw their things on their balcony. Otherwise we'd have had no idea. We couldn't hear them walking or anything. We also couldn't hear the people on our other side. I've also read where people said it was a 15 minute walk to the main restaurant. Our room was about as far as you could get from it (we were less than a minute walk to the beach) and it was a two minute normally-paced walk to the front restaurant. I timed it. Won't comment too much on the food because we're vegetarians, but I can say we didn't starve which is always a concern of ours. I can say there was a good variety on the buffets every day. (I highly recommend the celery-pineapple-cactus juice on the breakfast buffet.) And the veg options at the steakhouse (of all places) were delicious. I really enjoyed my crepe from the creperie while my husband said his was just o.k. They have a shopping promenade where you can pick up everything from t-shirts, sunblock and hats to cigars and jewelry. And all priced really reasonably. The staff was phenomenal. Everyone was extremely friendly. I was kind of embarrassed because I only know a bit of Spanish and tried to use it, but they all seemed to know English and pretty well at that. They were more than accomodating. The hotel seems to have a lot of European and Canadian visitors and they translate every announcement and whatnot from Spanish to English, Italian and French so everyone feels welcome. The \"animation\" team had plenty of activities scheduled should you choose. They had daily \"crazy games\", dance classes, sports, Spanish lessons, cooking demonstrations and more. They weren't pushy. If you didn't want to participate they left you alone. I've also seen where people said the nightly shows were great, too. We went to two, and while I didn't think they were \"great\", I've definitely seen worse. I think for one of them the curtain call lasted as long as the show. So, would I recommend this hotel?

At the last minute, I purchased seperately a vip transfer from the airport even though my trip included 'bulk' transfer. I am SO glad I did this. I will book this way without fail when flying into Cancun. Upon arrival into Cancun airport and passing thru passport entry just fine....there were literally hundreds of people in no kind of line whatsoever...walking around confused about where to go. It was HORRIBLE. I asked several people which line they were in and even heard people say...'is this arrivals or departures....?' We ended up cutting in line so to speak, just because no one was in an organized line and as a result we just found our way to the front 'line' and made it thru security within about 20 minutes. Outside was more taxis than you could see and it took us about 5-10 minutes to find our shuttle, Cancun Shuttle, Paco was our driver. He stopped as requested and we bought tequila. He had limes in the shuttle and a knife and we did a couple shots on our ride to the hotel. I want to say that there was NO Apple Rep anywhere to be seen or found at the airport or out by the taxis. I was really disappointed with this as this is a main reason to use their service...to have them guide you somewhat as you start your trip. There was also no Apple Rep anywhere to be seen at our hotel, not in the front...EVER our whole trip. We had to ask about them two days before we left becaue we needed our depart shuttle set up....we rec'd a phone call the day before we left saying to be up front at 09:50 to depart. There are books for different rep companies near the front telling you when and where to find your apple rep. This 'book' had not been updated since September! Rediculous. Then when I asked at the privelege desk where are we to find the apple rep...she says check the book. I said well, that has not been updated since a month ago! She seemed confused and said well they are usually at the front. Well, we had been to the front no less than 30 times and never found these people. Further more, the people at the check in desk were rude during our entire stay until we were LEAVING. Then the guy was really nice bcuz he is giving us a survey to fill out on how they did?????? Check in at Priveleged/Catalonia Playa Maroma was speedy. I think we were early to check in and we did not have to wait. I was upset with them however, for not telling us they had the shuttle to Playa Del Carmen only til Sunday and that it ended for the year on Sunday. We could have went to town for no charge on Sunday but we assumed the shuttle was there all the time and no one told us other wise. Everything we read was that there was a free shuttle and the times, etc. We ended up paying $40 dollars to go Monday because when we asked about the shuttle they said 'it ended today.' How convenient? You would think they could mention that????? And the front desk was just rude about it. Then we asked over at the tours desk to the side and that man was also very rude and short with me, though I was very mild mannered and polite towards all these people. They never even offered to help schedule a tour or was there anything we needed. They just acted like they did not want to help you. The room was beautiful. Room 6307. The only complaint I have of the room were somewhat slight. I tipped $3 daily, too, by the way...so I am not sure why the maid did not stock our mini bar excpt 2 out of 6 days. and at that....only partially. Also, the in room safe code is your room number. What is the point? If it is your room number you just as well have leave your cash on the bed? So we ended up taking ALL our cash and documents with us everywhere we went even the beach. Rediculous. Now, the bar services were great and they did not hold back. We did tip them often and they gave us plenty of top shelf tequila when asked or a strong drink, etc. We actually had the best service at the bars and the snack bar. The buffet service we slow, inconsistent or non existent. If they asked you do you want a drink? You would not get the drink until you were ready to leave anyway. The beach was gorgeous. The sand and water just beautiful. We had perfect weather. Only one slight rain shower in the evening before we left! Couldn't have asked for a prettier spot or better weather. It was disappointing however that we could not lay on the beach beds, as they did not put the mattresses out after the first day we were there. On top of that they put up a sign that they were only for the guests of the suites but they never put them out anyway. We ended up walking just next to the resort, where we were thrown out of \"Maroma Resort.' We couldn't tell whose resort it was but we were kicked out of there. We ended up going just a bit further down and laying directly on the sand with our towels and finding a private spot. We prefer not to be chair to chair with a bunch of people. We are not anti social, just like a little space. We went to Playa Del Carmen and loved that. Overall a wonderful trip, in spite of the issues I made note of above. Yes, I would consider going back to Catalonia Playa Maroma and we are planning a two week trip to somewhere in Mexico in the spring. Not sure we will stay there, because it is very isolated for that length of time and maybe somewhere else would treat us like they valued our business....but other wise the location of CPM and the room, etc bar and drinks and people in the shops were great. The front desk I would fire them all, seriously. The restaurant service needs to be a little more consistent at the buffet. At the Mexican restaurant and the steakhouse it was wonderful. Loved this part of Mexico and have been to Cozumel maybe 9 times.

This was our first trip to Mexico, we have only been twice in Cuba and once in Jamaica before. Beach: beautiful sandy beach, very warm ocean, we spent lots of time in it jumping in the waves. There is always shade from palm trees and handmade roofs available on the beach, lots of lounge chairs to sit on, lifeguard, music, lots of activities on the beach My mother-in-law and I once did yoga right on the beach, it was very relaxing! Did not get to try the catermaran though because we waited until the last minute and there was too many waves to do that. Food: lots of choice, we had eggs every morning cooked in front of us, lots of fresh juices, i loved the cactus-celery-pineapple one, even someone who is picky will find something to eat I am sure. Supper did not have much selection, but still ok - maybe because there were 3 a-la-carte restaurants available, and we had 3 free tickets to use them. My husband loved the italian restaurant and their risotto, I liked mexican the best. Steak house was good too, rib eye steak very moist and juicy! Rooms - great, lots of space, we could some ocean from our balcony. I did have to kill a huge cocoroach once though. We had water in our frigde replaced every day, you could get soda pop too but we don't drink that. Activities - we only came for some relaxation/swimming/sun, but did decide to go snorkelling on a reef with a group of other people and a guide. It was fun, we saw lots of school of fish and coral reefs, next time we will be bringing a water camera! O yes, we did archery every morning too, and really liked it, even if were were missing the aims a lot. Hotel overall - great loby, they have free wifi internet there, we could talk with our kids that were in Canada over skype (using iphone). We liked the walk from the lobby to the rooms - the path is surrounded by jungle, lots of birds signing and those mexican racoons running around and climbing the trees. People - very friendly, always say hola when they see you. My mother in a law and I were surprised that most of the workers (maids, waiters) were men, and women worked more as hostesses in lobby, restaurant, ect. Entertainment - they did have some shows starting at 9:45 but we were too tired from swimming to stay and watch them, espeically since they were an hour behind in time (9:45 in Mexico is 10:45 in Toronto).", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cUnfortunate glitches in our trip left us not wanting to return\u201d", "Author": "lewis_sue3", "ReviewID": "UR86204296", "Content": "I had requested 2 king rooms, next to each other, on main level.

They could give us double bed rooms, far away from our family members, on the 3rd floor! After getting quite upset, we were told to come back in an hour, only to find the office closed and locked. The next day we were placed next to our family members, but our first day was miserable! Was this a problem with the resort, Cheap Carribean, or both?! (By the way, this property, though beautiful, is not handicap accessible and requires a lot of walking). The rest of our stay we found the staff to be very kind and friendly. The next glitch we ran into involved the excursion we had booked from home, through Cheap Carribean and Olympus Tours. It was an ATV trip. Needless to say the trip was nothing like the description. I thought we were going to end up visiting the hospital. It was extreme ATVing!!! We were also to have a representative from Olympus Tours in the lobby of the hotel between certain hours, to assist us with any needs and any additional excursions . We could never find the guy! We had to call the company several times! We lost several hours of our vacation waiting and looking for him. I would suggest booking through the people in the lobby.

My friend and I went for a relaxing break and we got just that. Getting there - we took the ADO bus (ticket desk is on your left after you leave customs in terminal 3 - just ignore all the timeshare touts who hang around in the foyer) from the airport to Playa (110 pesos or \u00a36 single and about 50 mins) and then a taxi to the hotel which was 200 pesos (\u00a311) and about 25 mins. It took 2 hours door to door. On the way back we got a taxi from the hotel to the airport and that was 350 pesos (\u00a319). There are usually 2 shuttle buses per day from the hotel to Playa, but they finished on 31 Oct. If you ask at reception they will order a taxi for you. It's really easy to get a taxi back from 5 Avenidos. The hotel - the hotel is gorgeous. Very laid back and relaxed. Our room was in block 1 so it was close to the main reception area which was good for getting to the breakfast buffet. The layout of the hotel is very nice - it didn't feel crowded at all. There is a main walkway between the reception area and the beach which is through a 'jungle' - lots of birds, butterflies, coatis etc. And there is piped music played - it feels like you're in a yoga class! Something to bear in mind with this block is that you can hear the entertainment from the neighbouring hotel in the evening. If you're a light sleeper it might be worth asking for a different block. That said, it did not keep either of us awake. We were so relaxed we were asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow! Our room - nice size with a balcony. Bathroom was great with a lovely shower. The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff. The food - fantastic breakfast buffet with excellent variety. You get 3 tickets which you can use at any of the 3 a la carte restaurants (steak, mexican and italian) and they were all lovely and we didn't book for any of them. The longest wait we had was 20 mins. The lunchtime poolside buffet was not as great, but we ate a large breakfast each day and didn't actually each lunch usually so it was no great hardship. The staff - ARE LOVELY!!! Really helpful and friendly. Very chatty and smiley and are a big part of what makes the hotel so great. The beach - oh my goodness. What can I say? Beautiful, beautiful beach. White sand, warm turquoise sea. Amazing!!! Lovely sunbeds with plenty of shade and a fantastic breeze from the ocean. Fabulous cocktail bar within easy reach. What more do you need? The pool and entertainment - didn't use the pool once as the beach was so gorgeous but it looked lovely. A nice touch is that the sides of the pool as sloped so you can just walk in - great for kids (and parents so you're not constantly worrying they will fall in from the edge!) There was plenty of entertainment from the team - volleyball, waterpolo etc etc. Not really our thing so we didn't join in, but the staff weren't pushy at all. I think my friend and I were the only people from the UK in the hotel while we were there - the other holiday makers seemed to be mainly Italian, French, Spanish with a few Canadians & Americans. It definitely had a very European vibe which we really liked. All in this hotel is gorgeous.

Resort is set in the midst of the jungle, surrounded by trees and mangroves. The size is small, so access to all areas (including beach) is a very short walk. Front desk and lobby are very pretty-lots of great cactus, plants, comfortable seating. Our room was decorated very recently-modern bed, textured art-very comfortable. AC worked very well. All the buildings had beautiful paint jobs and each walk-way gave you great photo ops. All areas of resort, including our room, were kept very clean. Staff was very nice-front desk was fine, maids and groundspeople were working so hard (like usual at these resorts). The nightly entertainment was Very Good. We have been to many resorts and these were the best shows for a small place that we have seen. Lots of variety and talent. Activities were so-so. Staff didn't seem too excited here, but we were here just a few days before going to another catalonia, so didn't get to know them as well as one does when they are there for a week. Evening dining was very nice. The Italian dining room has very urban decor and meals were good. Daytime dining was ok-poolside bar was set up kind of weird-usually quite busy. Had some pleasant people watching on their patio that overlooks the beach. Beach and water were very nice-but not much coastline to explore. We had heard there were miles of desolate beach-not true. Towel and chair set-up is different here. Towels are not checked in and out, so people left theirs all day on chairs to save them. We didn't get seats until most people left for the day. They do have great handicapped access to all areas that we noticed-even the beach. there were private wood ramps down to palapas that were saved for ones that needed this. Other guests respected this arrangement and it was nice to see them used. The buffet area by the front desk had coatis that live around there, so that was fun- There was a large mosquito problem while we were there. We always bring bug-spray so were prepared. However, we've never seen so many. Be prepared. The grounds were fogged and helped. Also, there is a strange smell on the walkway between the rooms and the lobby/buffet area. I think this is because the walkway has mangroves, standing water on each side. This smell doesn't permeate the eating area and isn't a 'problem', but just mention it as a heads-up. A traveler should be prepared, just as with the mosquitoes, so they know this is normal and not have a fit because of it. A wonderful touch at the Catalonia. They have some of the best ambiance music that is selected just right for the various areas. Just walking by the spa/massage facility made you want to stop when you heard the music. We were transferred to another resort after a few days as they needed room for bigger parties that were all arriving to Mexico after being held up in Europe from the Volcano eruption. They left us a note asking if we wanted to upgrade to the Catalonia Royal Tulum. We decided to do it, as we had time to enjoy it too (we were on a 9 day trip). So-we'll review that too. All in all, we really liked the grounds, the room and the entertainment. We would definitely go again if we found another reasonable deal.

Pretty much every good thing written here about this place is true - beach, rooms, food, stuff, etc. For me the biggest issue were the European tourists who never hesitate to light a cigarette in front of young kids, pregnant women and the No Smoking sign. Don't get me wrong, I used to smoke and I have no issues with people smoking, but there are rules and the rules should be enforced. Food and drinks were good, but one thing bothered me all the time. We stayed at a similar resort in Cuba earlier this year and most of the reviews of that Cuban place mentioned bad food. Granted, food in Catalonia was better, but only slightly. I'm wondering how this little difference becomes that big when it comes to the reviews. Trips... There is a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen every day 10am and 6pm coming back at 5pm and 11pm respectively. We took it once in the morning and came back at lunch time (taxi costs 200 pesos). Definitely recommended. A short ride (~20-25min) away is Puerto Morelos known for best snorkeling out there. No need to book anything in advance, just take a cab and go there. We also went to Puerto Aventuras to swim with the dolphins. Definitely a good expericence, very expensive though. The tour operators offer many other other excursions, but be careful. This place is hot and humid and there is a huge difference between spending time at the beach and exploring a city or ruins. I didn't risk taking my 5 months pregnant wife anywhere too far from the sea. Besides, tours are overpriced for no apparent reason. This part of Mexico is pretty safe and you'd be better off renting a car and going there on your own. For example, a trip to Coba ruins is offered for $110/person ($55 child). I can't imagine spending more than $150 on this trip including car rental for a day, just read some travel guide to find out ow much things cost. Renting a car at the airport for a week would be even cheaper. Xcaret all-inclusive is $140 while it only costs $100 at the entrance. If you are not travelling alone, there is no way to spend this much on a taxi.

Mission accomplished! Hotel: - There are 6 separate buildings (building 5 & 6 are for the \"Privileged\"). - We stayed in building 6 which was closest to the beach/pool (which we liked) but further away from the main restaurant. - The buildings are 2 or 3 stories (we stayed on the second floor in a 2 story building, which we requested, since we like to sleep with the balcony door open instead of the A/C). I wish there was another window in the room that we could have opened so we could get a draft, but there wasn't. The worst part was that the ceiling fan was very noisy so we decided not to use it. A couple of nights that were hotter, we slept with the A/C on and it was comfortable enough. - The water pressure and temperature was excellent. - The rooms and the whole property were very clean. Restaurants: - There are 5 restaurants. - For breakfast you have one choice: the main buffet. - For lunch you have two choices: the main buffet & the buffet by the beach. - For dinner you have five choices: the main buffet + the other 4 restaurants (a la carte). The trick is that for the other 4 restaurants you need a ticket to get it. When we checked in we were given 4 tickets so what happened is that for 4 nights we ate at one of each of the 4 restaurants and the other 3 nights we ate at the main buffet. The non-\u201cPrivileged\u201d guests only get 3 tickets. (By the way, you don\u2019t need a reservation for any of the restaurants) - The food is OK. We\u2019ve been to other all-inclusive hotels and the food was neither the worst nor the best. There was enough variety in my opinion, and this was a good thing. - The service was great, however during our stay the hotel was only filled about 50%. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like when it\u2019s packed. We tipped a dollar or two at every meal and I know that usually helps as well. - They have a creperie right on the beach which serves a variety of crepes between 10-6PM. They were delicious and just perfect when we felt like a snack between lunch and dinner. Beach: - The sand is amazing. It\u2019s a fine powder that doesn\u2019t get hot, so you can walk on it without any problems. - The water was warm, clear and that magical Caribbean color. - On our first day it was very clear so you can actually see tropical fish swimming all around you. I swam out to where it was at least 10 feet deep and I could see the bottom perfectly. - The other 6 days there were 2 \u2013 3 foot waves. I loved it because I love to body surf. - The slope in the water is not very steep which is also nice. - There are no boulders or rocks in the water. Just a continuation of the soft sand. - You can rent out (for free) one or two-person kayaks, catamarans, depending on the water conditions. They also have jet skis but once they tell you how much they cost you will surely head back to your beach chair with your head down. - There are 3 hotels right next to each other. This one is the middle hotel. To get to the next closest hotel you have to walk at least a mile either way. I think this is very nice because there isn\u2019t that much traffic on the beach or water traffic (like jet ski, parasail, boats, etc\u2026). There was almost none at all which I appreciate very much. - The beach (sand area) is pretty wide and there are hundreds of beach chairs and also pergolas for shade. We never had to wake up early or fight for a chair (but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because the hotel was only 50% filled). - I don\u2019t swim in the pool or use the pool area, so I can\u2019t comment, but they looked very nice. - I would say that about 75% of the tourists during our stay were European.

The staff is absolutely exceptional and made us feel so welcome. We stayed in a more highly ranked (and more expensive) resort the last time we came to Playa, and really do prefer Catalonia. Here is the honest assessment: The grounds are pretty, rustic and display more traditional Mexican architecture. You will not get the \"knock-your-socks-off\" grandeur of a luxury property. The lobby/bar area is open and very comfortable. The check-in area is nothing special. We stayed in a priveleged room and the small privileged check-in area is a woman at a desk, a mini-fridge and sofa-set. Admittedly, I was a little concerned when I saw that was the area for their upscale section. But the rest of the stay calmed the concerns. The room was great. It was large and recently remodeled. It had Mexican tile and mosaic which was getting a little old around the sink, but still beautiful and what I would expect from Mexico. Bath lovers, beware! We had a large stand-up shower which also featured the mosaic tiles. The maids did an exceptional job cleaning the rooms each day. Be aware, unlike many other hotels, they will move your personal items in the process of cleaning. We hid or put valuables in the safe. Nothing was taken -- that is just common sense for any property anywhere. The main walkway feels like a path in the jungle. One morning, dozens of coatis were milling around. One stood in front of us with a cute look on its face which leads me to belive some guests feed them. We did not and the creature quickly lost interest. The walk across the property is really not that bad and helps you burn off some of the food. The pool area is different than we expected. It is a reasonably large pool, but the photographs in promotions are somewhat deceptive. It is not as large as it looks. While segmented, there is also only one pool for the property. A separate \"quiet pool\" would have been nice. The beach is beautiful. The hotel offers row after row of beach seating. Of note, there are ramps for wheelchairs and specifically designated seating for people with disabilities. That truly impressed me and shows the resorts regard for inclusion. The water is gorgeous and the sand is soft. Be aware, loud music is playing in the pool area and the sound bleeds over to the beach (no matter where you sit). Also, the brochures give you the feeling of being at an isolated resort. The pictures are outdated. There are now properteis on both sides. However, a short walk down the beach, and very little is around you. I will go from bad to good with food. We were not impressed with the crepe restaurant at the pool. Also, the buffet area in the immediate pool area is dark and unappealing, but there are decent offerings. Being vegetarians who dieted before our vacation, we ate nachos and pizza. There was a small salad bar, hot dogs on a convenience store style roller, hamburgers and other meats and sides. The main buffet area is much more impressive. Breakfast was perhaps the best meal there. Thanks to the visitors from France, Italy and other places in Mexico, the baked goods are AMAZING. The breads were very impressive. When ordering an omelette specify that you would like it cooked longer (cocinado por mas tiempo). The first I ordered was not just runny, the eggs were actually raw inside. Lunch and dinner buffets provided wonderful selections of fruit, vegetables, proteins, pasta, soup and other specialties. Sometimes as vegetarians, my partner and I struggle to find something to eat and are disappointed with variety. In this case, we were too full to even begin to try all the amazing options. The dinners were also very good. We loved the Italian restaurant. We had two salads and our entrees were penne arabiatta and risotto. Both were perfect and served al dente. Again, perhaps we can thank the many Italian visitors for a high quality. At the Mexican restaurant, we found our only limitation, the main course, and were given vegetable plates. The tres leches dessert was amazing! We also enjoyed the tequila variety. Dinner at Terrace was included with our room and did not disappoint. The tapas are not served in traditional fashion of the small plates for sharing. They were served in courses with many tastes on a single plate. Everything was amazing. I found the variety and inventive quality pleasantly surprising. Across the meals, you may notice some similarities in ingredients, though. For example, guacamole at lunch and avacado cheese tower appetizer at dinner. Nonetheless, everything is tasty and mixed up a bit. The one negative thing about dinner was the ticket system. You are given one ticket per person per night for the restaurants. You really do not have the opportunity to try the appetizers at all of the places one night or mix up courses amongst the locations. Though, anyone can eat at the buffet. The shows every night were a hoot. The members of the animation team work their tails off and we were entertained. Keep in mind, these are the same staff members who work the towel station, exercise classes, activities and kids club. That brings me to the wonderful staff. Smiles everywhere! Everyone from the maids to servers to animation staff were always on their game. The animation staff eats at the main buffet and we had the absolute joy of sharing two meals with Mariana. We were there for my birthday and Aurelie gave me a big hug, sang happy birthday and ran to the bar to get me a creme de menthe which was lit on fire! On a different sort of note, it is important to mention the resort does NOT have any marble floors. While marble looks pretty, it is about the worst thing a resort property can add. I actually took a serious fall on a marble floor at another resort last year, so not having to worry about that was a relief. Overall, I highly recommend Catalonia Playa Maroma. I leave the review with the advice of my mother-in-law: Be careful in Mexico. When you order a drink, they will try to give you the cheap stuff.

I traveled with my husband and 15 month old son. I spent a lot of time reading reviews on Trip Advisor before our trip so I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews I read before we arrived. I booked our room directly through the Catalonia website and I booked an ocean front swimming pool suite. Based on some of the negative reviews, I was worried that we wouldn\u2019t be given the room we booked, but luckily we had no problems. We flew into the Cancun airport and used USA transfers \u2013 they were great \u2013 prompt and courteous. The drive from the airport was about 25 minutes. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we were asked for our last name by the bellhop, who promptly escorted us to the privileged reception area near the main pool. There is only one staff member in the privileged reception area so we had to wait 15 minutes for her to check in some other guests before it was our turn. She checked us in and told us that our room would be ready in 15 minutes. We ate lunch at the snack bar and returned to the reception area and were taken to our room. A quick tip - I friended Hotel Catalonia on Facebook and was told via email before we arrived that as a Facebook fan, I would received 10% off the room rate. However, when we arrived the woman in reception had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned it. I had to show her my email correspondence and she had to make several phone calls to verify that I should receive 10% off. Eventually, she verified everything and we did receive the discounted rate. But I recommended printing out your email and having it with you if you\u2019re a Facebook fan. For 7 nights, we paid around $2000. We were really happy with our room \u2013 I couldn\u2019t find much information about the suites on TA so I\u2019ll try to include information specific to the suites that hasn\u2019t already been mentioned here before. We booked an oceanfront swimming pool suite \u2013 we had a huge walk in marble shower, double vanities, a large terrace, and our own swimming pool that was approximately 8\u2019x15\u2019. There are only 4 suites in the suite building, two on the bottom, which are the swimming pool suites, and two on the top, which are just called the oceanfront suites, I believe. The two suites on the top have Jacuzzi tubs on the balconies. We also had a minifridge stocked with beer, water, and soda, a safe, and a coffee maker in our room. The best thing about the suite building is the location. It is literally ON the beach \u2013 which was just amazing. Forty-fifty steps and we were in the ocean. It was so nice to be able to swim in the ocean and walk up the little path to our room, rinse off with the hose they provided for your feet and jump in your own private pool. Because we stayed in a suite, we also had access to beach bed loungers with canopies that are separated from the rest of the beach area by a sign stating \u201cReserved.\u201d The beach beds were nice, but we kind of felt like jerks sitting there on the beach separated from everyone else by a sign. It would be nice if they had beach beds for all the guests! Other things that have already been mentioned numerous times on TA but bear repeating as they are the pros of this property: \u2013 The beach and ocean is wonderful. Soft, white sand and turquoise water. Beautiful! -The staff is very friendly and helpful. They all greet you with \u201cHola\u201d as you walk through the property. They were especially friendly to my toddler son and he really enjoyed the attention from the wait staff, bellhops, hostesses, etc. High chairs and children\u2019s menus were available in every restaurant and the staff was very accommodating for families with children. We tipped our waiters, bartenders, and the staff that cleaned our room but never felt it was expected. - The grounds are impeccably maintained. We saw a staff member come by to rake the sand outside of our room at least twice every day. We also noticed that there was constant maintenance of the plants, flowers, and grass. - Almost every staff member we encountered spoke English. I took some Spanish in high school and was able to understand a few phrases here or there but typically they asked \u201cEspanol or Ingles?\u201d and once we told them we spoke English, they continued the conversation in English. Things that have been mentioned as negatives in previous reviews: -Walk from the pool to the main lobby/buffet area. It took about 3 minutes \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the distance that bothered us so much as the heat. In order to walk from the pool area to the lobby, you have to walk through a very dense section of trees and plants \u2013 a jungle basically. It gets very muggy and we were usually dripping with sweat by the time we reached the lobby, especially at lunchtime. But we were in Mexico in July so \u2026what can you expect? It wasn\u2019t something that would keep me from returning to the resort. - Ratio of American guests to European guests. We did notice that there seemed to be more European guests than American guests. We found most everyone to be very friendly and smiled at us if we smiled at them. We encountered one rude person who cut in line in front of us. I\u2019m not sure what country she was from but I just chalked it up to her being rude, not so much that all European are rude, as I\u2019ve seen mentioned in previous reviews. We did see a few (3 or 4) topless sunbathers but didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. -The food. The food was ok\u2026 it wasn\u2019t horrible and it wasn\u2019t great. There were a few dishes that we thought were really good but most of the time we thought it looked really pretty (nice presentation) but tasted just ok. If you\u2019re a foodie, you might be disappointed. Overall, I\u2019d recommend this resort. The beach and the staff are what really makes this place great. The suite was well worth the money \u2013 and a steal if you compare it to the cost of the beachfront rooms at the Maroma resort and spa directly next door. Worth the upgrade if it\u2019s in your budget.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFavorite Resort Ever By FAR\u201d", "Author": "ajc5501", "ReviewID": "UR72424279", "Content": "Im a 19 year old girl who traveled here with my parents and my 16 year old brother.

They made an effort to get to know you and were always friendly and so much fun! This was our third visit to Riviera Maya, and we have also been to many other caribbean countries. However, this was by far my favorite resort I have ever stayed at. Nothing can compare to the white sand, turquoise water beaches here. This beach was ranked one of the world's top 50 beaches by National Geographic for a very good reason! It is absolutely gorgeous. Everything about the resort was just perfect. The service was fast and excellent. I have never felt so sad when leaving a vacation as the day we went home, I actually cried. Catalonia Playa Maroma is a wonderful gem that has everything a good resort should have! Make sure to buy bug spray though, because the mosquitos get really bad in the morning and night! The restaurants are open air too, so the bugs can even attack when at meals. This resort is located in a unique location, in the jungle, and there are animals that are adorable and unique to Mexico.

The hotel is located in a big area and has a main walkway which leads from the lobby to the beach. Its about a 3 min walk at a comfortable pace. Along the way are small paths that go left and right to where your rooms are. They are 5 or 6 smaller buildings making up the hotel. Lots of birds, lizards and other animals living in the various trees that are covering majority of hotels property. This resulted in very little mosquitoes. The rooms were nice, you had all you necessities there and they had a combination of a A/C and fan in the room so you can alternate depending on preference. The sink was separate from the toilet and the shower which was good for me and had a huge mirror in front. The beach was the main reason why I wanted to go to this hotel and it didn't disappoint. There was nothing in the water but white sand. No seaweed or rocks. Early mornings you would get the little fish that come and search for food. There were plenty of beach chairs, shade and sun space so you could do whatever you wanted. Right on the beach they had a crape restaurant which was open from 10am to 6 pm along with a big bar which was open to 11pm. Main bar in the lobby is open 24 hrs. Right near the beach bar was the huge pool which actually had a real deep end (over 7 feet) and the beach restaurant which had food from about 3 pm to 6 pm. Good selection of food (little more then your regular burgers, fries, hot dogs). This restaurant at night then turned into 3 el a carte restaurants. This was the only surprising fact about the hotel. You came as you please, there were no reservations needed to be made. So make sure you go around 7pm especially to the Mediterranean. Mexican you can always get into and the Steakhouse was also fairly full. Main Buffet restaurant that has breakfast, lunch and dinner is right next to the lobby. It can get hot because its an open area so no A/C but lots of fans. Lots of variety of food, really good food. Their fish was really good all the time and well as their mexican dishes, lots of enchiladas, quesadillas and so on. You would be surprised but their pizza was exceptional as well. Last thing, pick you favourite servers, tip them early and you will find that you get really good service. Usually the really nice people who appreciate tips and don't expect them are the way to go. Overall an awesome hotel with really friendly staff. Snorkeling is something you should do here if you have never done it. One of the biggest coral reefs in the world are located here.

Italian Restaurant - Second best, good quality, variety and nice atmosphere The Steakhouse Restaurant - is good, but don't expect the same level than in a North-American or Canadian Steakhouse Mexican Restaurant - I was surprised by the various options offered, very popular ohh and they have by the bar-pool a Creperie, great crepes 11am to 5pm, try the Crepe Suzette yummy! 4) Bars if you like a Corona, Margarita, Amaretto di Saronno, The best Cuban Havana Rum or just Pina-Coladas , you will find plenty of options at the Hotel Bars For Non-Alcohol drinkers, there are lots of options too ! 5) Consierge Service In Hotels with more than 500 guests a week, you may expect a few glitches, remember you are on vacation, relax, and go to see Eduardo if you experience any inconvenience. Eduardo will set up the necessary actions in motion to solve your problem while you go enjoying some Margaritas at the pool or the beach, 6) Staff The most friendly staff of any resort I visited the last 5 years, eager to help and make you enjoy your vacation, and they dont do this for tips 7)Entertainment- Entertainment staff is organizing compertitions, dances, volleyball, waterpolo, Bocchi games, all day and at night very good prepared shows at the theatre, you won't feel bored Playa del Carmen - great for shopping in their 5th Avenue strip, full of boutiques, Bars, Restaurants and Pubs ( The Hotel offers twice a day free shuttle bus to Playa del Carmen, a Taxi can get you there too, for about $ 20 each way ) Overall the hotel has a large staff, the beatiful beach is clean up every day, several times, the grounds as well, There is Boutiques, Photo service, a Spa ,Jewelry store etc etc INTERNET - If yoy bring your laptop wi-fi is free in the Lobby area,(no wi-fi in the rooms) if you need a computer cost is US$ 10 for 50 mins , so be aware !

I wanted a Mexican vacation I was determined for my girls to see clear water and a beautiful beach at an affordable price, so we stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma. Here's what we found: This is not the same Mexico as on the mainland. I know because I lived in Mexico city as a child and vacationed yearly in Acapulco, Veracruz and Cuernavaca ....I found the Maya to be a European playground on Yucatan soil. Americans are in the minority, mostly Italians, French, German and Brazilian and that's OK! I loved the variety of languages spoken and I was impressed with the entertainment/wait staff that were incredibly fluent and fluid in their transition from each language. The main difference is in the quality of the goods sold (POOR) and if you are to go into \"town\", called 5th Ave. the vendors give Mexicans a bad rap as they try to deceive you, worse than I ever remembered, thinking you don't know the difference between \"925 silver\" and the alloid \"alpaca\". For decent jewelry you need to enter a reputable store, and the prices are still ridiculous. I'd rather wait and go to Lord and Taylor or JCPenny on a sale.... The Mexican hats look like they were made in China. A good deal on flavored Tequila (you could taste them, and the almond was pretty good). My childhood favorite liquor is Santa Clara Rompope. Blankets were standard, nothing special, unless you stopped off on the road, sometimes there were some really nice ones hanging...need to know your Spanish.... June through September is the winter/rainy season ....very humid. the only good thing about this time of year is that you can swim with the whale sharks. That's it. I would NEVER go this time of year again. Did I say it was Humid? It also rained 51/2 days out of the 7 we were there. It was not impressive from the outside. Entry road very bumpy ( we hoped it was not a foreshadowing of what was to come!) but the lobby and layout was very nice. The lobby turned out to be great to hangout in as it was very spacious and had large couches you could rest on after dinner. Twice in our week, they had live music in the lobby, and if you ate too much or were too tired to move, those couches were great! The bar waitress came around often for drink requests, cappuccino etc. all through the day/evening. You could also hang out near the open bar where they had tables/chairs, al fresco, TV, pool table open 24/7. Ceiling fans only. We were \"preferred guests\" which meant you stayed in the 6000 building, nearest the pool, beach and specialty dining areas.....a very good thing. We were 4 in this room which was like an upgraded Club Med room. When we arrived they had problems with the a/c, ultimately it was repaired, but the a/c was moderately cool. the beds were very comfortable, firm pillow tops (I recommend you request their feather pillows, free of charge), adequate closet space and nice little balcony with 2 chairs/table. Problems: only 1 sink, few places to hang wet clothes (that's were the balcony came in handy, but the clothes got wet once it rained again). No hooks, except for 1 in the BR. Nice big, thirsty towels, but if you are 4 in a room, you have to remind your server to give you enough towels. There is only one flat surface to put your luggage on. No luggage racks available. There are no extra hooks or places to hang wet clothing...so get a portable clothes line and hanger/clips. Those suction cups against the tile BR wall would work for bathing suits and light items. There is no curtain separating the sink area from the bedroom. This was not a good thing, when your kids are teenagers and will only get dressed behind the only closed area there is, the one and only toilet, If you're an early riser and want to beat the crowd, you wind up waking everyone up while you're getting yourself ready. Bring some Lysol for the shower floor or be sure to wear flipflops. Only 1 umbrella per room, large enough for two people. Whistle dixie for the 2nd umbrella! There seemed to be a major disconnect between the concierge desk and whoever they speak to (I think it was the air). There is an office exclusive for \"preferred guests\", near the 6000 bldg, which is where you would be checking in . In that office is what a/c is meant to be! They are more responsive to your needs. Only once did I have to ask twice. The front lobby concierge is hopeless. When we arrived, our bags were rolled on a cart toward our bldg, but since the room was not ready yet, they were kept in that office. We tipped the bellhop but were left to schlep our bags up a large flight of steps to our room later. No one in that office thought to provide assistance. The best people were the maid, the waiters/waitresses. We tipped for service and because I know they have a very hard life. Even a few dollars really helps them. And....they delivered service with sincerity and a smile. The beach was just wonderful, the sand was like pureed mash potatoes, and water was a pretty clear jade (I think Aruba was clearer), with some seaweed. No rocks! and the first day the sky was a French blue with the fluffiest white clouds. The water was perfectly warm temp and waves were just right , not too strong, until the weather turned. At first it was delicious to swim in the ocean during the rain, but with continued bad weather the tide came up to the chairs and the waves were too rough even for the diehard. The staff has an activity agenda throughout the day, but when it rained so much, they DID NOT go out of their way to help you make the best of it....You were on your own. The pool was great w/life guards, but no swimming after 7p. People quietly complained to each other, as it was still very warm and would have been a great time to take a dip with the kids. The Entertainment didn't start until 945P, so we had a lot of time to kill until then. Disappointing shows, inappropriate movies, trying to be like Club Med, NOT! Some of the staff were talented and funny. the one dancing troop from Playa del Carmen was OK, but if you know the difference, they didn't do the Mexican hat dance\" they way it's supposed to be danced. Did I say the first night, hardly anyone showed up for the show? I wanted to cry.... Food: The main dining room , al fresco, large, airy decent food, esp breakfast. I never had so much papaya and flan in my life! Decent variety, but I will give it a B+. The specialty restaurants gave us nice change, and we liked the Tapas and Italian the best. The mexican rest. made the best Pina Coladas and authentic tortilllas! I don't care for meat, but my husband was not impressed with the steakhouse. The crepe house near the pool was great to eat and hang out and the Tortuga for lunch was convenient and tasty. the pool bar drinks were disappointing until you explained to them in spanish how you wanted it and...you wanted it in a tall glass, not the little plastic water glasses.... You can get a free scuba lesson in the pool, consisting of a quick primer on the gear and a guided underwater tour with the regulator and instructor. I can't comment on the Hotel trips, but I understand that Xcaret and Xel-Ha (water park) are pretty good, esp for kids, but expensive. It's the only lagoon you'll probably, actually see turtles. I took my 12 yr old on a snorkeling excursion with Pro Mexico, an onsite dive shop, which came recommended on this site. We went to swim in clear water holes, cenotes, but the rain affected the clarity of the clear water.....We didn't see much. In fact you see a whole lot more fish at Petsmart. They were very good in terms of safety, but they make you wait along time before you actually get to your destination and even longer returning to your hotel. If there were to be a next time, I would spend the extra $ and try Xel-Ha. There was not a whole lot for teenagers, but in fairness they did have, only on one day, kayaking, and.... the watermobiles $ that looked like great fun. If you are a couple, then I would suggest you look into the Valentin and Blue Bay Esmeralda. We consistently heard positive things about these hotels ( but the same complaints about concierge service). You will need mosquito spray, I recommend OFF family care, smooth and dry version. Spray even in the am. It works great. Spray outside your room so you don't get the fumes up your nose. Bring your own suntan lotion or else you'll pay several $ more. The book (library) Yucatan, Cancun & Cozumel by Bruce &June Conord was an interesting read and good resource, esp if you want to go off on your own. A friend went to Cozumel the same week, but it hardly rained there and she had a great time.. So..... I got what I wanted, clean water, great sand, decent price, but mother nature had other ideas.....My girls took it all in stride, they did not know the difference and still had somewhat of a good time. My husband and I know the difference. Had it not rained, it would have been a very nice vacation, largely due to the lovely beach, with better memories, Once you know how to \"work the system\" in your hotel , you're less frustrated. I thought Playa Maroma was the best beach, compared to Playa del Carmen. If you stay in town, you're closer to shopping, etc. (which I wasn't impressed with). Overall the Catalonia was a nice layout and the service people, as usual, made us feel better about our stay, but that's it. I would not return. I miss the true Mexican experience. The drug cartel wars are a real problem for all....If you just want to \"chilax\", then it's fine. Just don't go in the winter/rain season, or go to Cozumel, hopefully on someone's first hand recommendation.

The hotel was gorgeous, granted it was in the middle of no where, but it only cost $20 bucks to get back from Playa del carmen after taking the free bus in (runs twice a day). Don't get suckered into buying shuttle service, a taxi is about $25 from the cancun airport to the hotel, and same back. Split between multiple people, it's cheaper than the included shuttles and what not. There were a lot of europeans and a lot of topless women, more often than not it was a case of \"what has been seen cannot be unseen... no matter how much you wish it,\" but hey, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The hotel was nice, there was a lot of walking, which got kind of excessive after awhile, but that was expected. Especially with the abundance of food and drink, it's probably for the better. The food wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. The a la cart resturants were all subpar, except for the tapas place. That was the best, it's small so try to get there early or late. I understand why you get only one ticket for the tapas place, but the other 3 of the 4 tickets can be used for the other 3 a la cart restaurants. The weather is very humid which makes waiting for a table uncomfortable. Breakfast was at the buffet was better than the other meals, but all were so-so. I wasn't a fan of the authentic mexican style tacos with the corn tortillas, so tha tmay have had something to do with it, but they have a lot of other types of food, all subpar. The guacamole is good though. The pool is nice, it's warm in the shallow ends, and gets cooler as it gets deeper. THere usually aren't many people in the pool because everyone is at the beach. The beach is the selling point and the main reason why I booked this hotel. Like all the reviews suggest, get there early if you want a beach chair under the shade. The beach service is kind of shotty and you're better off making the trip yourself to the bar. The bartenders are subpar, but if you're going to get drunk, they'll get the job done. It just won't taste particularly good while you're doing it. The sand was amazing, warm, but never hot. Clean and warm, with no rocks. There are no corals, so there aren't many fish at all, but that's not the say that there are none. There are a specific type of flat angel fish looking deals which are good people and if you sneak in food, bread or whatever, they'll swarm you in a feeding frenzy. It's actually somewhat intimidating because they follow you around and swarm you so you can't really swim without leaving the water and the come back. If you feed them from your hands, they'll nip your finger tips as well. The rooms were nice, but it was kind of odd. Sometimes we'd go for dinner around 7 or 8 and we'd come back and there was obviously someone in our room before, not sure if it's common for such a late night visit from house cleaning. The room was made up, pillows returned to the bed, and night light on. This happened twice, but because nothing was missing and everything was neat, I didn't call the front desk to inquire. We did have a slight problem with the a/c but it wasn't worth reporting. It was probably because we left it on most of the day, so it became cool, but not cold no matter how low we set it. Also, the fan stopped working beyond a lazy spin. All in all, it was a nice place with lizard and those weird marsupial monkey looking things.

Maroma Beach \u2013 one of the best beaches in the area \u2013 I would recommend this beach to everybody. The beach is deep and the waters are relatively calm (once Tropical Storm Alex left) and you can walk for miles \u2013 just perfect. Beaches are not overly crowded at all. There were however, a few issues that I thought you might want to be aware of: 1. Check-in Process: When we arrived for check-in we were greeted and immediately asked if we would take an upgrade to their Adults Only property (Royal Catalonia Tulum \u2013 about 45 min further south \u2013 they claim it\u2019s a 5 star resort, but I\u2019ve read the reviews and it is by no means a 5 star.) We didn\u2019t take the upgrade and they gave us a hard time that they didn\u2019t have Superior/Privileged room for us with 2 beds which is what our reservation was for. After being told they could give a king room and bring another bed in I got very frustrated to say the least. I demanded to speak to the manager (William) and said if they couldn\u2019t find us the room that we paid for then they should give is 2 king rooms or a suite with 2 bedrooms \u2013 what do you know they found us the room that we reserved. The room was fine, on the ground floor, even though we requested a higher floor, but it turned out ok. By the way, there are no ocean views at this resort except for the 4 suites. 2. Food at the Resort \u2013 not the best in the food department, but not the worst either. I would have liked more variety and more restaurants to choose from \u2013 we had trouble getting into some of the restaurants as they were full and they don\u2019t take reservations. 3.

We arrived around 9pm-ish and the guy at the front counter looked as tired as we did. He grabbed a packet already packed with our room keys, bands, and goodies. As I stood there fully prepared for the \"we're booked so we're offering you an upgrade\" speech, he sighed and started in. He stopped about 7 words in, looked me in the eyes, and said \"I know you're tired but I have to say this...\" so he sped through the speech and quickly got us on our way when I told him we weren't interested in another hotel. Here's the deal, it's a popular place and it was indeed pretty full. They have plenty of space at the other resorts so they want to try and ease the workload by moving you to other hotels. That's all. As I work in customer service I completely understand that the people at the front desk don't WANT to do this...they are REQUIRED to. GIVE EM A BREAK. They already know that all the Americans are sharing feedback about this situation. It was 92-97degrees in the daytime and still 85-90degrees at night so it was hot and VERY humid all the time. Leave the flat iron at home ladies.There was usually a nice breeze so as long as you weren't deep in the jungle or at the buffet you were ok. I only came across mosquitoes once during the whole trip and it was on the last night we were there. The pathway from the lobby to the beach was gorgeous and ambient and made for a nice stroll. There was music, wildlife, and flowers all along the way and the winding paths that lead to each block of buildings were so cute and made you feel like you were walking through the jungle. We got a honeymoon suite which was very basic but nice. The jacuzzi on the balcony was lovely and you could hear the birds and animals every morning. Waking up in such a beautiful place made you WANT to get up at 6am every day. The bed in our room was very firm but for me this was perfect. I never slept so well. The staff overall was great. Everyone you walked by was smiling and greeting you and while everyone started out speaking spanish to you they quickly adapted to whatever language you spoke. I must say that those are some HARD WORKING people. I've never seen a housekeeper SCRUB the floors in ANY resort I've been in and I've traveled all over the world. These ladies scrubbed every inch of our room every day and only once showed up while we were still in the room. The pool was warm and wasn't your typical shallow hotel pool. If you are sensitive to chlorine I'd stay on the beach. It was rarely crowded except on the weekend when it seemed there were large local families there with their kids. Other than those times, I rarely saw any kids. Make no mistake there were LOTS of families with kids there, it just didn't seem like it. The beach...omg...words cannot describe how beautiful the beach was. I would return to this resort just because of the beach. We only saw 2 topless sunbathers the whole time and while all the men were in speedos...who cares?! It was never crowded, no one bothered you, and while there were other people on the beach you could feel like it was all yours. The sand was SOOOOOOOO soft and lovely and I swear they manicure the cordoned off swim area. No rocks, no coral, no shells. A teeny bit of seagrass was all there was in the water. There was practically no beach service (1 waiter on 1 of the days was it) so if you wanted a drink on the beach you had to go and get it yourself (it wasn't like the bar was far away). The drinks were yummy and the amount of alcohol in your drink depended on what you ordered but was more than sufficient. Also, there is no need to bring your own large cups as was suggested in an earlier review. Most of the time drinks were served in large daquiri cups. The lobby bar served the strongest drinks. I didn't find the reviews prior to my trip to be helpful when it came to food as I didn't really care but I must say...the food was wonderful. We stuck to the buffet and Tortuga most of the time and went to Tio Pedros once. We were unimpressed with Tio Pedros. There was always a good variety every day with main staples as the constant. Salad was the same every day, meat and cheese was the same as well. Everything else was on a rotation and very good. I could have spent all day and night eating the fresh fruit if it weren't so hot. The buffet is an open air area and the overhead fans don't provide nearly enough circulation. If the buffet was air conditioned this would be a perfect resort. We attended the shows in the theatre 3 of the nights and found the animation staff very funny and talented. After spending all day out and about they came in late at night to put on a show. Like I said...hard working. The theatre had stronger fans and good circulation so it wasn't hot in there. Also, the resort did not cater to the Italians...there were just more of them there. Everything there was translated into English, Spanish, French, and Italian. We peeked in to the nightclub but didn't go in. There was enough entertainment in the lobby so we didn't feel like we needed to be in the club. There was always live music in the lobby and there were some VERY talented musicians. We ended up super sunburnt towards the end of the trip so we spent a day roaming the grounds and taking part in other activities. The archery lessons were fun and a nice aversion to just being on the beach. Tips - Bring your own sunscreen or get the lotion type from the gift shop. Don't get the spray sunscreen there. Bring lots of small bills for tips. The staff deserve it, never seemed to expect it, and gave stellar service regardless of tipping. I have been singing this resorts praises to everyone I speak to and most definitely will be returning. It's inexpensive, gorgeous, and has the feel of a 4 star resort. 5 stars if they had room service.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CONNECTICUT", "Title": "\u201cJUST GRAND\u201d", "Author": "DENNIS-PLUM", "ReviewID": "UR69922259", "Content": "beach,food, service, drinks, staff were all grand, only negative: pool bar should be for adults only", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norris City, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Wonderful!!!!\u201d", "Author": "KJP714", "ReviewID": "UR69593522", "Content": "Can't say enough about Catalonia Playa Maroma Resort--not sure why all the negative reviews before, but we had absolutely NO problems.

Yes, it is a bit of a walk from pool/beach area to lobby but it is an enjoyable pretty walk and we didn't mind at all. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Food was good. If you have a problem finding something to your liking then you must be very particular. We enjoyed all the wildlife running around--saw the Coatis, some iguanas and even endangered blue crab. We were there the week Tropical Storm/Hurricane Alex had moved through and the waves were strong, but the water was still very clear and beautiful blue. As a matter of fact, my teenager was disappointed when they finally calmed down later in the week, he enjoyed riding the waves. Pool was very nice as well. The entertainment staff always had activities going or you could just kick back and relax. We had rain the first couple of days off and on, then overcast skies later, which turned out to be a blessing and kept the humidity and heat down a bit. I cannot say enough about the beautiful beach area. Truly gorgeous--very little seaweed anywhere, sand was white and not hot at all, even when the sun was out in full force.

I have been to all inclusives in Mexico and Dominican Republic, so I feel I should be able to provide some decent insight. Check In: The front desk people are not the friendliest, they arent nasty, but they arent as friendly as other resorts I have been to. I had a privelege room reserved and got it, but you need to be on top of them. They did try to move us to Catalonia Royal Tulum, but I didnt want to go, so I kept my original reservation. I checked in right at 3, but waited around an hour or so. The person who I originally spoke to said he would call me over in 15 minutes for my room, a half hour later I go up to the desk to see whats going on, and he is gone for the day, so someone else helped me. That isnt cool if you ask me. But I did get what I reserved, but only because I stayed on top of them. Resort Appearance and Room: My privelege room was nice and seemed updated, no major complaints. The AC could be a little colder, but I think by now Ive come to realize that AC in a tropical place is definitely 5-10 degrees higher than what I get at home. Room cleaning was done nicely. A little more lighting in the bathroom sink area would be nice. The resort itself is clean and the grounds are kept nice. Nothing extremely fancy, but again, I cant complain on that. Food: The Ala Carte restaurants are all good quality but at La Tortuga ( snack bar during day and \"steakhouse\" at night) no matter what steak you order, its the same piece of meat. The italian place was suprisingly good. The main buffet is ok, breakfast wasnt great but it could be worse. Lunch was good enough. I feel other resorts do a little better job with the snacks, fresh fruit throughout the day and smoothies available at breakfast. The main buffet was always too hot, they need more fans or need to enclose it. Staff/Entertainment: The mexican staff was very friendly, but as you have probably read, there is a european presence at this resort, well there is a huge one actually. All of the European staff at the front desk arent helpful, they just try to deflect any questions to someone else, or say they dont understand you. Every other resort I have been to in a Spanish speaking country, they understand spanish and english first and foremost....Here english is not well understood and I sensed a little anti- americanism. I confirmed this with some other ameicans I saw there and they said they felt the same way. You may absolutely have a differing opinion. The activity and entertainment staff was just ok. They are a bunch of young kids from around the world, unlike other hotels that have a local staff that work together for a long time and are pretty much professional at what they do. The entertainment staff was friendly, but basically spoke no english. Each event, they spoke spanish, then translated into italian, then french, and sometimes german and english. To me, the place is catered more towards Europeans, because I just felt like an outsider, as I confirmed with other americans. Beach: Water is beautiful, pretty much anywhere on the riviera maya you shouldnt have any complaints. The water was a little rougher due to some Tropical storm alex remnants. But the sand is nice and the water is colorful. All in all a decent experience, not my top so far. The only thing I would say is that its a good place, but for someone that speaks English only and wants to participate in the activities a lot, the language barrier and hints of American resentment should steer you to another resort.

I am so happy to be able to write a favorable review after reading so many negative ones from May. Our experience was exactly what we were hoping for when we booked this resort. It is a smaller, quieter resort but has everything you could need or want for a relaxing get away. We found the food to be very good everywhere we ate, even better tasting and variety than other larger resorts. We found our room to be excellent. We had a privilidged room in the 1000 block on the third floor. The air conditioning was okay at the beginning of the week and we had one night when it did get hot in the room. The next day we told the front desk about it and when we got back from a day in town the room was cold and stayed that way for the rest of the week. I even had to sleep with a blanket. The bathroom was completely redone with beautiful tiling and our large shower had two shower heads- a large rainwater type and a handheld shower head. As many other reviews have stated, the beach is great, the pool is great, the animation staff is alot of fun and very personable. When we went to Playa del Carmen for the day we ran into some off the staff hanging out in town on their day off. They recognized us and told me next time they would take me in with them and show me the places they like that aren't tourist traps. I read TA to help me decide if I should book certain resorts and use my hard earned dollars on my vacation time. I can honestly say this is a good resort and worth the price and then some. We got a great deal through FunJet and were concerned we were going to end up at a Motel 8 type establishment in a mosquito swarm. Not so at all. IF you are looking for plush tanning beds, stained glass ceiling lobbies, your own personal staff to anticipate your next move, go somewhere else. We went to the Royal's lobby in Playa to see what it looked like and it is at the other end of the spectrum from CPM. We came back to an unairconditioned thatched roof lobby that had all the charm and fun loving warmth we could have wanted. As a matter of fact the second part of our stay was with Tropical Storm Alex and it was delightful to sit in the lobby area bar listening to the band play and the rain coming down. There was a refreshing breeze and cooler temps that made us appreciate the surroundings all that much more. The only negative things I would comment on are that when the temps are up the buffet and lobby do get hot. I wouldn't suggest being there in the hottest part of the summer. The breeze on the beach and the pool is great though and the dinner restaurants are air conditioned so that wasn't a problem. The second thing is alot of people smoke at this resort. Maybe alot of people smoke everywhere but I did notice that people all around, on a lounger, in the pool, on the beach, in the ocean, in the buffet restaurant, the lobby, the bars...always smoke. It wasn't just the predominate European guests either. I don't know if resorts advertise themselves as smoking establishments or not but if smoking really bothers you be advised that it is not discouraged here. All in all CPM is a nice place. I would have no problem recommending it. Read the negative reviews with a grain of salt. Alot of times people write negative reviews because they felt hasselled or lied to or some other personal affront. The resort is solid and the staff was more than accomodating and kind to us and everyone we talked with.

First time to Mexico. Check In: Arrived around 3:00pm after using USA transfers(would use them again). Very helpful front desk people. Check in went very quickly. Room: We booked a standard room and decided not to upgrade. If I went back I would upgrade. The room was ok, just tired looking. Glad we were on the first floor (always cooler on lower floors). Air conditioning was O.K. We ran the ceiling fan as much as we could, but sometimes it would short out and we had to jiggle the knob. The 3000 block does back up to the Secrets resort and at night you could hear the loud music from the disco, but it didn't keep us up. Looked like they were remodeling some of the rooms in 3000 block. Food: Buffet very good. We are not picky eaters. I had read previous reviews stating this but was still pleasantly surprised. Previous AI buffets I had been to were so so. Went to three of the ala carte restaurant they were very nice. Beach: Great beach. Two days we got spots under the trellis, the other times we pulled our chairs under the palm trees in back. The resort was not very crowded, so in the high season finding shade could be a problem. I still took my portabella travel beach umbrella, but we didn't need it. They do have sporadic bar service on the beach, but we were fine with walking to the bar for our drinks. We did tip when remembered to take a few dollars with us. Remember to take travel mugs to keep drinks colder, I forgot ours. To the left of the bar are self serve water and juice machines. Drinks: I didn't think the mixed drinks were very good. They had Dos Equis on tap so I fine with that. House wines were good, in fact the best I has had at an AI. Activities: We didn't participate in any. I just want to sit, read, and relax. Did go see a show one night and it was pretty much what I expected. It was fun, but not anything show stopping. Peolple: Great. On resort and off resort. Remember this is their country. It never fails when we travel abroad that we don't see some people with disgusting, condensing, arrogant behavior and manners. They would rather complain and throw a fit about every little thing that doesn't go their way. What a waste of vacation. Misc: We did take the shuttle into Playa. That was fun. ( Bought a few things, but to tell the truth I thought the selection at the resort shops and the airport shops was just as good.) We went on day Mexico beat France in the World Cup. A lot of good natured partying in the street. Police were there, but nothing got out of control or even felt unsafe. The shuttle pick up spot was blocked by the celebration, so one of the bus drivers came and walked us to where the buses were. They made an effort to collect everyone, but I am sure some people got left behind. Used ATM across from Bus Station on Fifth Avenue. No problems. Got exchange rate of 12 pesos to 1us and the atm charge was only 2.75 us. Tulum only takes pesos. Rented a car from the car rental in the lobby and went to Tulum and Akumal. Driving was very easy, well marked roads. Ordered maps from mapchick before we went. Be sure to read forums for advice on driving in Mexico, don't speed, watch for topes (wicked speed bumps)and pay the extra money to get the zero deductible coverage on the rental car. Bottom line: Would go back if price is right with an upgraded room. I think I would like to stay in Akumal or Playa at a regular hotel or condo. Plenty of eating places and grocery stores.

It was our second visit to this resort and our fourth trip to an area Catalonia resort. Overall, it was our eighth visit to the area. We arrived at the airport at 9:45 AM and were at the resort by 11:15. Navigating the airport was a breeze and USA Transfers was perfect. Upon arrival, we were immediately assigned 2 Privileged rooms. Room availability at check in isn\u2019t until 3:00, so we changed into our swimsuits, had lunch and a few drinks, and went to the beach. Like many others, we were concerned about the recently-reported overbooking problems, and were relieved when we had none. No one else we saw had problems at check in. The resort was at or near 100% capacity during our stay. There were signs that the resort is moving to more of a class system with the Privileged status. Privileged status, with special bracelets, provided us with nicer rooms, dinner at Tapas, access to a hospitality/check in room (with drinks, fruit and free internet access), discounts at the spa, a special place to set in the buffet, and late check out (based on availability). We enjoyed the benefits of Privileged status, but, overall, I\u2019m not a fan of resort class systems. Hopefully, it will remain limited to the above. The guest mix was maybe 2/3 Italian and 1/3 mostly American, French and Canadian. All ages were at the resort, but the majority seemed to be younger married couples. The Italians were very beautiful people that pretty much kept to themselves. There was a fair amount of topless bathing and Speedos, none of which was a problem for us. Compared to other area resorts, there seemed to be less English spoken by guests and resort staff, but we were always able to communicate. We very much enjoyed the European flavor of this resort. Our 2 Privileged rooms in building 4 had new paint, new furniture and fixtures and linens, a flat panel TV and an electronic safe. The air conditioners worked well. The bathrooms were not remodeled, but did have nice rain/spray shower heads. The bathroom water was clear and hot, with good pressure, and everything functioned as intended. I\u2019m sure the bathrooms will be remodeled in good time. There are sensors in the room that turn off the electricity each time you leave. Not a problem, as the rooms cooled down very quickly upon return. Maid service was very good, we always had plenty of towels, and the fridge was always restocked (3 waters, 6 assorted soft drinks, 2 Sol beers). Overall, they were nice, functional rooms. The beach is very long and very wide. The sand is soft and cool, the water is turquoise and there are no rocks anywhere. Just about as good as it gets. There were always plenty of chairs and shade available, no matter what time of day we arrived. We never felt crowded and were approached for drink service every hour, or so. One day, we walked south for 35 minutes to the marina, where there are quite a few water sport activities available. Horseback riding was also available as you approach the marina area. The pool is quite large and has been nicely remodeled since the last time we were there. Plenty of chairs and shade were available. We spent our days at the beach, though. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets are located in the lobby area. The breakfast buffet was great. All of the usual selections, eggs made to order, etc. Since we were at the beach during the day, we only ate at the lunch buffet a couple of times, but found it to be fairly good. There were usually 2 or more choices each of fish, chicken, beef and, sometimes, pork. There were also quite a few choices of pasta, fruit, veggies, etc. We ate at the dinner buffet only once (Mexican night) and, that night, found it to be very good. We checked it out a couple of other nights and it looked basically the same as the lunch buffet. Since the buffet is open air, it got fairy hot there in the evenings and that kept us away. Drink service at the buffet could have been better. The snack bar near the beach was great. There was always burgers, hot dogs, pizza, chicken nuggets, nachos, grilled fish, chicken, pasta, fruit, salads, ice cream, etc. There\u2019s also self serve light and dark beer and three types of wine. We visited the snack bar at least a couple of times every day. The dinner a la carte restaurants were, overall, very good. We received three a la carte dinner coupons, plus a Tapas coupon (with the Privileged status) per room. We usually went to dinner around 7:30 and never waited to be seated. The Tapas restaurant was the best and had a very nice second story view by the ocean. The Mexican and Steak restaurants were very good, and service at both was excellent. The Italian restaurant had very slow service and we did not enjoy the food there. (Tip: One coupon will seat 4 people. Since we had 2 rooms, and all four of us frequently ate dinner together, we had more a la carte coupons than we could use in a week). Bar service and drinks were also good. We never had to wait for more that 5 minutes to be served. As usual, drinks are poured stronger at the lobby bar than at the beach bar. Otherwise the beach would be \u201ccrawling\u201d with drunks by afternoon. (Tip: If you want stronger drinks, request a specific bottled brand or ask for a side shot that you add, yourself. I\u2019m convinced that the liquor coming from the pumps is more diluted that the liquor served from the bottle). The resort activities were plentiful, both day and night. The activities staff made sure our daughters were never bored. Water and beach exercises, volleyball, ping pong, water polo, cooking classes, beach games, and the various water sport activities were all there for the taking. The catamaran was a blast. There were plenty of college age guests, both American and European, for our daughters to hang out with. Our daughters went to Coco Bongo one night and loved it. (Warning: Very late night, they returned to the resort at 4:30 AM). The pool party was lively and there was live music in the lobby most nights. The nightly shows were typical of area AI resorts, basic and not terribly professional, but still entertaining. I\u2019m told the disco was hit or miss, depending on the night. Overall, it was a fairly active and lively resort. There were relatively few young kids, mostly European and mostly well-mannered. The only incident of rude or obnoxious behavior we observed involved a group college age boys (coincidentally from a very large Texas university that one of my daughters attends) who got very drunk on their first night at the resort. They were very loud and made quite a scene yelling for more drinks, and ultimately throwing up on the walking path. After the second or third visit by resort security, we saw one of them, too drunk to walk, dragged away by a parent. Although this was their first night there, we never saw them again. There was talk they had been removed from the resort. Overall, a very enjoyable, stress-free vacation, which confirmed our Catalonia brand loyalty.

The beach is absolutely breath taking! This is our second lisiit to this resort and it has improved greatly since the last time we were there two years ago. The previous positive reviews helped us decide to return. Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately by the front desk and given a cool drink. They were friendly and so accommodating. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and wasted no time heading out to the beach since check in was not until 3:00. We were not there more than 10 minutes and we were greeted by Valerio, the cute Italian staff member! (Well, we did have our 18 & 20-year-old daughters with us and that might have helped!) Our rooms were ready at 3 as promised. We had two priviledged rooms and I would not have it any other way. These rooms are upgraded with fresh paint, flat screen TV's and new furniture. The bathrooms were still quite dated, however. The tile was cracked and it needed some serious re-grouting, but it was spotless. I had no issues with it. You have free internet access in the priviledged lounge and you also do not have to make restaurant reservations. We received 3 tickets to the ala carte restaurants and one to the Tapas restaurant. Service in the restaurants was outstanding and the food was very good! The drinks and food at Tapas match any 4 star restaurant. Try the key lime Martini at Tapas! We ate at the steak house once and at the Mexican restaurant twice. We didn't bother with Italian. You have to try the avacado with shrimp and brandy sauce and the pastels de chocolate at the Mexican restaurant. They are very generous with the liquor here, too! Here's what you need to know before going. 1. The beach is the most amazing beach in all of Mexico! You can walk forever in either direction. The sand is white and the water is torquoise. It doesn't get much better than that. 2. The staff makes a point to know you. By the end of our trip, the lobby bar waitress and bartenders knew what we wanted before we even ordered our drinks. 3. There are very few Americans at this resort. They will find you and you will find them so don't worry about being the only one there. Most of the visitors are Italians who are quite nice to look at, even the men in Speedos. Topless sunbathing is common. The lobby is the place to see and be seen in the evenings. It's fun listening to the Italian lounge singer, Luigi, sing the Beatles and Ray Charles with his accent. 4. Most of the entertainment staff speak at least 4 or 5 languages and are all entertainers in the evening shows. The regular wait staff, bartenders and service staff do not speak much English. Learn a few Spanish phrases to avoid communication issues. 5. It's HOT! The buffet, theater, and snack bars are open air and do not have airconditioning so be prepared to sweat. You will sweat a lot! You need bug spray and lots of sunscreen even in the shade. 6. Take the free shuttle into Playa del Carmen. 7. Ask for wash cloths if you want them. They are not commonly delivered. 8. It's a seven minute walk from the lobby to the beach and there are no ocean front rooms. There are two ocean front suites, however. 9. The rooms could use a little more light. The lamps and the lights in the vanity area do not provide adequate lighting at night. 10. The resort is not a 5-star although it is trying hard to be one. The grounds are beautiful but some areas look a little dated. Here's what I believe the resort truly is... Accommodations - 3 star Food - 4 star for restaurants, 3 star for buffet. (Try one of the crepes at the pool bar!) Staff - 5 star Pool - 3 star ( but I was on the beach!) Beach - 10 star!!! Amazing. It was so relaxing and so much fun!

I will try to group things the best I can. Beach: Travel Channel top 10 Beach in the world. Beautiful. Af first we didn't think the sand was that soft. Went to Playa del Carmen and visited the beach there, Playa's sand felt like gravel. The water is clear and there are angel fish around. Kind of wavy when we went but it was still beautiful . No porblem at ALL finding chairs or getting away from people. You can walke for miles south of the resort and bascially have the beach to yourself/selves. Service: GREAT service. Every single staff member was extra nice. \"Buenos dias,\" \"Buenose Tardes,\" and smiles every where you go. Quick service. Asked for ketchup and ranch, they would go get it for you in no time. Cleanliness: perfect. They cleaned non-stop. Mopping up sand. Cleaning bathrooms. We thought the rooms around us where being renobated or something because they moved furniture around, had all kinds of cleaning supplies, and spent HOURS and HOURS on them. Turns out this is just normal cleanng routine. They actually scrub the long concrete pathway that leads from buffett and main lobby to the beach. Language: Language wasn't a real problem for us. I speak a little spanish so it wasn't that bad. Over 50% of the guests are Italians (Original owner was Italian, now owned by a Spaniard). The Europeans were not rude. Very private. The Americans were the loud ones. However, the French and Italian men where speedos, which is pretty disturbing. Rooms: I knew the reception desk was going to offer an \"upgrage\" to another resort. They did. I immediately refused. They promptly gave us an upgrade from the privileged room to a suite with an ocean view. Nice huge bed. Balcony had a jacuzi and chairs. Shower came from ceiling and was all concrete tile. huge bathroom. Nice big screen with several english channels. Promptly stocked sodas, beer, and water in the fridge. Perfect. Water: The water served is purified. You can actually see them sometimes hauling the bigs jugs around. We drank the water. Didn't get sick. We did NOT drink the tap water. We did brush our teeth with it though. NO problems at all. Food: We liked Tortuga the most. Tio Pedro the least. Tuscana (italian) was nice too. Terrace was nice but it is a gastronomican place with TINY protions of tasty food. Best thing about Terrace is the atmostphere. Ocean view upstairs above the beach bar. Buffett was very good everyday. Fresh fruit. Drinks: Good. Ask for bacardi, or just make sure you look and see if they have good liquor on the shelves or they will serve bad quality. Don't blame them considering drinks are included and people definitely take advantage. Wife liked the riviera mayas and paradises. I liked their mojitos. overall: GREAT honeymoon. Really no complaints. Don't buy souveniers from the shops at the resort. You can purchase them MUCH MUCH cheaper from playa del carmen. Great service, marvelous beach, superb resort.

Very good shows for a resort....pretty entertaining. The only negative thing I can say about this resort is the food didn't meet my expectations. The steakhouse (Tortuga) was VERY good, but we realized late in our stay that it's only open every other night. The mexican rest. was just okay, the Italian I wouldn't go back to and we didn't try the Tapas rest. since we had our small kids. Buffet was typical of any buffet...Great variety, but only mediocre food. The beach here was AMAZING! The beach reviews were the reason we chose Maroma Beach and so glad we did. The water is beautiful and the sand was amazing (soft, fine, white and very cool in temperature).

I was EXTREMELY concerned with the previous reviews about the hotel being over booked. I paid for a privileged room, and received the privileged room and was pleased with it. We were greeted with a drink as soon as we checked in and they offered to take our bags to our room- which was GREAT because it was quite a walk to the 6000 block (where our room was and closest to the beach) so it was nice not lugging our luggage trying to find the room. It is a walk to the lobby- but we didn't mind, however I could see people who have difficulty walking may not like it. Our room had a mini fridge, it did not have any beer- but I read in a previous review that if you asked maid service they will give it to you. Sure enough, my fianc\u00e9 wrote a note and the next day, we had beer in the fridge. awesome. Yes the bathroom could use some remodeling- but it's nothing to complain about. We ate at the buffet the first evening, nothing too exciting- typical buffet but NO complaints about the food. Neither of us got sick, EVER, and I was pretty weary since I had never been to Mexico before. The second day we rented a car (available at the hotel) it was $60 for the day and drove to Tulum. BRING BUG SPRAY- I got attacked by mosquitoes, and even though I read previously to take it on the trip, I didn't think about outside the hotel. The second night we ate at the mexican restaurant- again GREAT service and great food. We even tipped extra at ALL the restaurants because we were so impressed with the service. I had fajitas- very good. Our 3rd day there we were at Chitzen itza which was about two and a half hours away- we got back pretty late so we ate at the buffet. We paid $90 for the delux chitzen itza trip that provided the large air conditioned bus, unlimited drinks and included lunch. There is a desk in the lobby at the hotel to book the trip. I booked a massage, it was $63 discounted 10% because we had a privileged room. The 4th night we ate at the Tapas restaurant, absolutely AMAZING view- located on top of the snack bar. The alcohol selection was EXCELLENT. My boyfriend had Don Julio margaritas all included! (He proposed to me on the beach after the dinner at Tapas restaurant <3) The last and 5th night we were there we ate the Italian restaurant. Every single restaurant asks you if you want a drink while you are waiting for a table- I was not able to count how many glasses of wine I drank because they were CONSTANTLY refilled before they were even close to empty. They switched out our silverware after the appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. The main bar in the lobby is open 24 hours, and the other two bars close at 10. There is live entertainment, that was quite impressive for employees because you see them ALL day doing the daytime activities and then do the shows on top of that. The Disco wasn't bad- not too many people (about 20-30 max), but I enjoyed myself, as long as there is good music, I can dance! The staff ALWAYS tries to include you in activities, on the beach, in the disco, in the shows too. Of course the beach, breathtaking. We brought our own snorkel gear, and I was glad we did because you have to pay for them to take you on a boat to snorkel (which obviously isn't included). We just walked about 10-15 minutes south and snorkeled there because there was no people. I am telling you, I NEVER wanted to go to Mexico- especially with everything I have been reading in the news- and I would go back tomorrow if I could. You are making the right decision, and I NEVER write reviews! But after I read some negative reviews, I was nervous and cautious- I could not have been more wrong and worried for nothing.

We had a comfortable, convenient privilege room in bldg #5, in-room Wi-Fi, fridge with beer/pop/lots of water, new pillow top mattress and the bathroom was just fine - contrary to some reviews on other sites. And no BS at check-in (as some others have complained), but I did mention in e-mails prior to arrival that we were three-time visitors to their other resorts. Hey, maybe it helped!!! Every day was 88-91, sunny, and a slight breeze... And no wind!!! Needless to say, it was a warm week with mostly green flags. The clientele was about 25% American/Canadian & 75% European. It was also the youngest crowd we\"ve seen at a resort \u2013 almost \u201cCancun-ish\u201d. Average age was probably late 20s/early 30s with very few of the 60+ crowd. Still a bunch of us 40s/50s types though!!! The ala cartes had pretty much the same menus as CRT (we were there in January with CB7 & her DH), but the ambience was nicer. All the ala cartes were A/C except the Tapas Lounge. However, being on the 2nd floor and right on the beach, it was very comfortable. Need more ala carte tickets? We just asked nicely for them & were given additional tickets (I did tip generously). We ended up with enough for every night including two Tapas tickets. As for the main buffet, it\"s next to the lobby. Nice breakfast, but we ate our lunches at the snack bar out of convenience. Several days we brought plates of fruit, chips & guac, etc. down to our loungers the beach. Our 1st night we ate dinner in the lobby buffet (tired from traveling) and that was enough. No A/C and no breeze, so it was more than a bit stifling. That we can put up with, but the smoky mosquito \"smudge pots\" they had smoldering on each buffet station were downright nauseating. Never had those at breakfast, thank god... The grounds are immaculate, the beach is breathtaking and the front desk, bar-staff, wait-staff and beach service were probably the best we\"ve experienced in 8 trips to the \"Roo. There are also security personnel walking each building 24/7. The maid service was also very good \u2013 our room was made up before lunch every day. Our glasses were never empty \u2013 anywhere - whether it be pop, water, beer, or the daily specialty drinks they bring to the beach. The Strawberry Mojitos and the Sangria (with lots of fresh fruit) were the most memorable. They also bring trays of water to the beach, which was very refreshing, given the temperatures. All service was with a smile! The \"shade factor\" on the beach is not the best, but it proved adequate. Only about half the loungers under the slatted structures were occupied, so it wasn\"t \"nut to butt\" by any means. A few days we took the large blue resort towels and threw them over the top of the slats for some additional shade. The Animacion Staff tended to be a little over-the-top compared to the other resorts we\"ve visited as there seemed to be someone trying to engage us every 10 or 15 minutes. Note to Staff: If I\"m reading a book, please leave me be. The music was also EXTREMELY loud a few mornings, but if you went the ends of the property it was fine. Hey, something for everybody. One morning, the music consisted of a \"Pink Floyd Retrospective\", and another morning it was \"Queen\"s Greatest Hits\". OK, I\"m an old-school fan of both, but it\"s not exactly what I would pick for my 10:00am to noon beach music. All in all, it was a pleasant and relaxing vacation.

I choose the later. The first room I received was right next to the neighboring resorts nightly entertainment and was loud. This room smelled strongly of black mold, was not cleaned properly (personal items left in the shower & dirty floor), it also had biting insects. The 2nd & 3rd rooms I received were better, but still had bugs that bit. The beach was beautiful, but unfortunately there was litter in the water at times, including plastic bottles and plastic wrappers. The activities they offered where fun with great staff from an outside source. The quality of drinks varied from bar tender to bar tender. It helped to tip well early in the day to received good drinks. The beach bar & restrooms were kept very clean by staff who mopped all day. The a la cart restaurants served great food, with poor service. One waiter actually told me I could only order 2 items from a 5 course menu, which I found later to be false. The standard buffet was less than average with little variety in the menu through out my stay. Upon attempting to enjoy the nightly entertainment, I was met with multiple mosquito bites, even though I used insect repellant. I had to leave after 10 minutes of getting bitten and realizing the show was below average. I never returned to the theater after that. The spa area smelled strongly of mold. I received a 25 minute (had been told it would be 90 minutes at checkin) free massage that was good. My experience at this resort was less than satisfactory. It was difficult to feel settled when I had to change rooms 3 times in a 9 night stay. There were a few other inconveniences.

I drank just a sip of it and got sick a few hours later. But besides that - the food was very fresh and filling. The Italian restaurant is BY FAR the best food they have. Many options and the bruschetta is unbelievable! We also enjoyed the bar service on the beach. I don't remember reading too many reviews that mentioned that. They weren't too consistent but it was still a nice surprise when they'd come by. We were a bit surprised by the lack of English speaking people staying in the resort but it was never an issue with the staff or anyone we communicated with. They are very accomadating to everyone! Also, don't forget bug spray because they come out in full force at night and since everything is very open, you're at risk without it! I would recommend taking the free shuttle into Playa del Carmen to see all the cool shops and good restaurants. It's worth the trip away from the resort :) I would go back in a heart beat and please remember a dollar goes a long way there.

It is a 3 star place, with a warm, Mexican architecture surrounded by jungle/lush gardens. The ride from the Cancun airport is an easy 20-30 minutes. The check in process was not super warm, but efficient: room keys, restaurant coupons and bracelets were all prepared in a waterproof pouch ahead of time. We stayed at building 5 (closest to the beach/pool, in the regular section). I thought that his was great location, specially with young kids, since form the pool/beach/a la carte restaurants, it was just a short walk to the room. Because we are traveling with children (2 and 5), we had asked for a double (queen beds) and a crib. The room is not large, but very comfortable. We were in a regular room and it was quite ok. We had a balcony were we could sit in the morning to read, and at night after the kids were put to bed. I would say that the only modification I would make is to put in an extraction fan in the bathroom since it can get really musty and humid in that small space....and yes, some upgrading of tiles would definately be a plus/incentive for future stays. The beach is spectacular. The pool was just wonderful for the kids, there are 2 sides with beach entry into the pool and even my 2 year old felt confident to step into the water on his own, and spend a couple of hours just walking in and out! Kids club is small, but my 5 year old absolutely LOVED Yasmin ...she made all the difference! it 's open from 10-1 and from 3-5. Yasmin played with the kids, did arts & crafts, took them to pool, offered them snacks....my daughter could not wait to go the the club! The food ranged from just above average to great!. The buffet for breakfast and lunch was very extensive and varied and all the food fresh. We ate at the a la carte restaurants for dinner and it's hard to pick a favorite, possibly the Italian and the Tapas. Tip: if going with kids, take them a DVD player: this plus being in the pool all day, made up for a fairly relaxing dinner! The resort is beautiful, the grounds, landscaping, building, fountains are all very well kept and it's just a pleasure to take a walk around (and helps walking off some off all that great food!). Yes, we took heed of previous reviews and brought OFF...sprayed it on all the family (specially the little ones) in the morning before we left the room for breakfast, and just before leaving for dinner....never got bitten!

Great room.We booked through Expedia for 6 nights at $1540.00 Great deal! Beach was big and fantastic, no rocks in the ocean, very smooth sand. Nothing is worse than a crappy beach on vacation. In comparing this with Catalonia Tulum resort: Room-Maroma was much better. Big comfy bed, big room, quiet, very quiet Food-Tulum. They have a beach side \"lunch buffet\". I hated walking all the way to the front to eat for llunch. The Tortoise snack place had very limited selections. I had guac and fries every day. Staff-Tulum. I think because Tulum is smaller, you get more one on one time with them Grounds-Tie. Equally pretty and maintained. Ala Cartes-Maroma. Same restaurants and menu actually for the Mexican and Tapas at both resorts. Italian at Maroma was super yummy. We ate their twice. Tapas atmosphere better at Maroma too. We got coupons for every night, so we did not have to do the buffet up front The Tapas roof is fantastic. You eat, go lay on the beach bed, see the view and have a martini (or two) with your signaficant other. Things I did not care for: The non airconditioned buffet up front. It was hot and too far to walk IMO from building 6 to eat lunch. The kids-Tulum is adults only. Mosquitos-far worse than we had the Tulum location. We got eaten alive one morning leaving our room to go to the front to eat breakfast. Bring your off. I think I came home with 5 bites, I saw someone else who was covered. No room service-which would have been nice a few times. We also did a Cocobongo trip one night. I say get the upgrade of 110.00 a person, you skip the lines, have personal wait staff. Beware, you will not be able to sit and watch the show, you can sit, but you won't be able to see. It was a great show. You should go. USA transfers did our transfers, private for 40.00 each way.

You're not going to find 5-star food at any all-inclusive. And we're foodies, so are going to be a little snooty about anything we eat. But this is surprisingly good stuff -- a huge variety and something for everyone. The presentation is thoughtful and the fruit carvings that garnish the display in the main restaurant are worth the trip alone. The fruit -- on second thought, forget about the carvings -- just eat the fruit. Unbelievable. In terms of entrees, major in the fish dishes. Almost every one we tried was delish. You have every-meal access to the main restaurant, then limited access to a few specialty restaurants. We were pretty disappointed by the specialty Mexican restaurant (Tio Charlie's was it?), but quite enjoyed the Italian restaurant. (And the house red wine there was a nice change from the marginal boxed red wine they serve in the other restaurants.) Drinks are best at the main bar in the entry building. At the beach bar, you'll get friendly service, but drink quality varies by staff. But it's good value for what you expect from an all-inclusive at any rate. The crepes at the creperie are pretty good, but could use a little extra pinch of salt in the batter. And why they want to add chocolate to their apple crepe is beyond me. But if you're good with pantomime or speak a little spanish, you can clarify that you want \"Crepe de manzana, pero sin chocolate -- con crema Inglesa.\" Good luck. Again, a very well managed resort. Very clean. Grounds immaculately groomed and maintained. Nice design and atmosphere. The huge main building with the high, thatched palm roof is a delightful introduction to your experience. The pool is fantastic and meticulously clean. There's a continuous schedule of activity that you can take advantage of if you wish. Or if you're a pure book-under-the-palapa junkie, like me, you can do that, too. Either way the staff is fun and engaging. If you're a diver, or have ever washed a National Geographic special and wished you were, definitely plan on some diving. We were very impressed with the dive staff there on the resort. I'm certified, but our teens were not. They did the introductory resort course so they could do an open water course and that was fantastic. It's about $100/ person and includes all gear and about 2 hours of training, then a boat dive that did not disappoint, even for this certified, experienced diver. If you've never dived before, I highly recommend it. It's an experience you'll never forget and that will hopefully open the world of diving for you. If you're certified, plan on either a local or a Cozumel or cenotes (cave) dive. (If you get there the right time of year, you can make a trip to the other side of the peninsula to dive with the whale sharks. We didn't do it, but it would be a once in a lifetime adventure if you're there at the right time.) The dive staff is all French or Italian and varied in English skills, but all were extremely helpful, professional, and warm. The evening shows the staff puts on? Okay, you'll have to judge for yourself. We weren't particularly enamored, but if you don't have anything else to do. . . . It's not Broadway or Vegas, but it's quirky and the staff makes it fun. And easy to slip out subtly when you've had enough. Which we had pretty quickly. . . . Guests are from all over the world, so it makes for a delightful international experience Lots of Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, a surprising amount of Russian. And a gringo or two. Or ignore them all and just enjoy who you came with. Is it a Michelin 5-Star experience? Of course not. If you want that, go pay for it. But it's an unbelievable value for the money. There were minor flaws. Our room's air conditioning worked, but didn't keep the temp quite as low as we'd like (though our kids in another room were able to get theirs to refrigerator temps). Then there was Rodrigo the Terrible. Olympus Tours was the subcontractor for our transportation to/from the airport. Their staff at the airport and van were superlative. Their onsite representative was great until I crossed him. They ask you to come meet him within 24 hours of checking in. (ostensibly to confirm your return flight info, but primarily to let you know how they can help you with booking tours, etc. Which is fine, but we didn't want any tours, so I wasn't in a hurry.) When I had the nerve to wait 48 hours to come meet him, he had the cojones to lecture me and play hurt that I obviously didn't care about him. . . . Hello? But look, I'm nit picking now. The conscientious staff, the gorgeous location, lovely rooms, and good food all make for a fantastic vacation opportunity. Do it. You won't regret it. We'll go back.

Our total price, including transfers was $1,440.00 for both of us. Great Price for a week of paradise. I loved the beach, everything that has been written about it is true. Yes, the resort requires that you do a little bit of walking, and not everything is perfect, but the staff works to make your stay as pleasant as possible. I will venture to say that the complainers and winers are the people who get irritated easily and expect to be waited on hand and foot; we noticed that these individuals were the ones the staff got tired of dealing with; but which one of us wouldn't. These are what I normally refer to as the $30,000 a year millionares; they have champagne taste with a Kool Aide salary. You are not millionares, or else you would not be staying at this resort; so quit whinning. I will definitely return to this resort, and I recomment it highly for it's value, location, beauty.

We have stayed in the zona hotel of Cancun before and were interested in being somewhere that is not quite as developed. After much research on many web sites we settled on Catalonia Playa Maroma. We had heard wonderful things recently about how beautiful the Maroma area beaches are, so we were anxious to see them for ourselves. We were amazed that we could stay for four nights at an all-inclusive resort and travel non-stop from Orlando for less than $1100.00 for the two of us! That did not include however transportation to/from the airport, which I guess was a small mistake. It's much easier to arrange that with your airfare and hotel. We arrived on Monday afternoon, and were not completely thrilled with our 'Privilege room' (this is the only type of room that Expedia seems to book). The balcony had no view what so ever, in fact had a cement block wall blocking whatever we would have been looking at. We spoke with Laura in guest services ( who is a multi-lingual marvel--though does not have the sunniest personality) and she assured us that we did indeed have a 'privilege room' but she would see about getting us moved to something more satisfactory, though this would be difficult since they were 'overbooked'. Somehow the next day a different room was available, which had a beautiful large balcony overlooking a garden type of setting. The first room had a more modern updated bathroom area, but I actually preferred the older style which incorporated a lot of Mexican tile. Also we had a king size bed in the first room, and two queens in the replacement. Do not expect an oceanview or oceanfront room in any case. they do not exist at this resort. There are apparently some suites which may have a view but I have no idea how you even book these. The beach is indeed beautiful. We spent hours in the ocean, which has very soft sugary sand on the bottom and a warm gentle surf. The beach itself is wonderful, with beautiful deep sand. The pool area is quite large and well maintained. There is too much of the guests 'reserving' spots at both the pool and the beach. So in self defense you must go early and find the type of spot you would like later in the day and set down towels or belongs at the pool and on the beach so you can return and have a spot. The buffet area serves decent food, but nowhere near what you get at the Mexican, Italian, or Tapas restaurants. When we checked in we were given coupons enough to go to these alternate restaurants three times, but we were staying four nights. So on the last day we went to the front desk and asked for one more coupon that would allow us to go to either the Mexican or Italian restaurant again. They honored our request without much problem but I definitely got the feeling that they would not have given us another coupon for the Tapas restaurant. One negative is that it is quite a walk from the lobby area to most of the hotel room buildings and even further to the beach or pool. You need to plan ahead whenever you are making this trek. There are plenty of shops for anything you may need, and the prices are reasonable, and lower than at the airport if you are buying souvenirs. You always seem to save if you have pesos so i recommend having some on hand. There is not much need to ever leave the resort unless you have a tour to go on, to the Mayan ruins for example. The hotel runs a free shuttle (other than a tip) to Playa del Carmen, and from there you can take a ferry for about $11/pp to Cozumel, which we did. But it was so hot we were miserable and really wish we had not gone. All in all, I would recommend this resort to anyone. It's a very international type of place with guests from all over the world. And there are many activities and shows that we did not choose to participate in,but make sure you check the event schedule on the back side of the Tequila Bar in the lobby so you can see what's available.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cVery different feelings\u201d", "Author": "salmiero", "ReviewID": "UR66247580", "Content": "Wow, very interesting hotel.

If you are looking for a nice resort with friendly staff to celebrate a special occassion such as a Honeymoon or Anniversary, DON'T STAY here. It's not that type of a place. If it wasn't for the awful rooms and ,above all, horrible front desk customer service, this place could be pretty nice. I stayed here with my mother from May 25th to May 30th. My package, which I ordered through Orbitz, was supposed to include a PRIVILEGE room but that is not what we got. This is something that I kept reading about up until we left for our trip but I wanted to give CPM the benefit of the doubt. At the front desk they confirmed I would be in a Privilege room so I thought everything would be ok. From the moment I entered our room, I knew they hadn't given us our room. Now, I'm not a picky person but if I paid for a \"special\" room they I expect to receive that. The room smelled old, the curtains were stained, the only chair in the room was stained, a closet door wouldn't close since one of the drawers was broken, there were dead mosquitoes on the wall (which I would assume housekeeping would clean up after guests leave), and there were basic amenities missing such as an alarm clor (or just a clock) and an ironing board. I immediately called Front Desk and received nothing but lies and attitude. They kept telling me it was a Privilege room as all buildings have them (LIE) and that they would send an iron and clock if that's what I wanted! I insisted I wanted what I paid for and they told me to come back tomorrow and they would set me up in the PRIVILEGE BUILDINGS (buildings 4 & 6). I told them that I would go back tomorrow and I expected them to follow through, which of course they didn't. I went back the next day and they kept insisting I had a privilege and the only difference between my room and the others was the paint job. Once I brought to their attention that I knew this was happening at their hotel through reading reviews online, they told me they didn't care what people were saying in there reviews and that it didn't apply to me! . In addition, one of the nights our lights started flickering on and off in the room which wouldn't let us sleep so I kept calling and calling Front Desk and Concierge and they never picked up. I had to stand on a chair and remove the light bulbs so we could go to sleep! I could have been electrocuted and they wouldn't have cared. Needless to say, I never got my room. I was on vacation and the last thing I wanted to do was spend the whole trip arguing. FRONT DESK CUSTOMER SERVICE is terrible and they don't care what you think. Moving on. The food at the resort is just OK. Nothing to rave about. Buffet food was mediocre. I did enjoy the Mexican a-la-carte restaurant but not the Italian one. I didn't make it to the Tappas restaurant as I ended up getting REALLY SICK the last day. I didn't eat out of the Hotel so it was something I are or drink from CPM that got me sick. It was terrible. As everyone else has mentioned before me, the beach is beautiful. I stayed at SECRETS MAROMA (which is literally right next door) last year which is why I wanted to come back to this beach. It's super clear and you can see fish swimming around you. The grounds of CPM are well kept and clean. I did enjoy the long walkway to and from the lobby as it makes you feel like you're in the jungle. You can see different types of birds and animals roaming around the lush jungle. Which I have to add, if you do stay here PLEASE bring bug repellant with you. There are so many mosquitoes at night and they will attack. I brought repellent but I still have many many bites all over my legs, arms, neck, and feet. The Alegria Spa was probably the thing I enjoyed the most. Although it is very small it is really relaxing. They give you time to enjoy their whirpool, sauna, and steam room before and after your massage. They also have nice cold beverages for you to enjoy afterwards. Mayra was reall good. They say they offer free WI-FI in rooms but it never worked in mine. I kept trying over and over and it never picked up. I noticed quite a few people in the Lobby area using their laptops so I gave it a shot there and it did work. Overall, I would NOT recommend this place to friends or family. Secrets Maroma was waaaaay better and so worth the price. If you do have extra money to spare and are looking for good hospitality, good food, romantic ambience, GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE, I would highly recommend this place instead. Again, if you're just looking for a place to crash then maybe CPM will be ok for you.

I think it is very important to note that our total package was only $1,700 ($1,500 after the $200 off Entertainment Book Coupon) for 2 \u2013 all inclusive, in a Privileged Room. Flights alone to Cancun from Cleveland are around $400 per person, so we basically paid $700 for the resort for 1 week, or around $100 a day for 2 people. As a young married couple (we are 28 & 29), this price was too good to pass up. We read many of the reviews, and saw the beautiful pictures, and knew what we were getting into. We\u2019ll break down the review so hopefully it is helpful to see the different areas of the resort. Check in / Front desk / Lobby: We arrived at the resort around 12:30 and like many of the past reviews, we were offered an \u201cupgrade\u201d to the sister resort Catalonia Riviera Maya. We read the reviews of this location, but were not as impressed so we stated that we would like to stay at Maroma in the Privileged room we reserved. They told us the room would be ready at 3:00, gave us our wristbands, and told us to we could grab food or a drink until then. We stopped back around 2:30, then 3:00, and received keys to our room around 3:45. We were not impressed with the front desk staff \u2013 very hands off, not really looking to help you, just looking to get you away from them. We went up at 2:45, 3:10 and tfinally 3:45, and each time they said they would \"check on our room\", disappear (while we are waiting at the counter) and then never stop back over, actually avoiding eye contact with us. Maybe I don't understand what \"check on our room\" meant, but they could have just let us know it was not ready and check back in 10 minutes, but instead just ignored us. In the end we received our keys and were on our way. A side note on check in - There is a privelaged reception area that we were not told about, and just happened to stumble on later. This room is located by the main pools, right next to the photo shop. The privelaged reception area is a small room, but air conditioned with drinks (bottled water, cofffee, liquor, beer, etc) and snacks. There is a community laptop, magazines, a T.V., etc. Just wish we would have known about this, as it would have been much more comfortable than the front lobby, which gets very hot during the day. Plus, we would have felt comfortable leaving our luggage there as we relaxed by the pool, not to mention the service at this area is much better. We actually ended up stopping down many mornings for cold bottles of water before walks on the beach (it is only open from 10:00am to 5:00pm though). Rooms: We stayed in room 4327 (third floor of 4000 building), which was an upgraded Privileged room. The room was very nice, with an updated Bathroom (dual shower head, with new tiles. New fixtures, although seemed to be pretty cheap fixtures), flat screen T.V. and king size bed. The room also had a mini-fridge, but didn\u2019t do a great job of keeping drinks cold. At least it was a nice place to store bottles of water, and a few other drinks, and was replenished daily. As many reviews have stated, the air conditioning in the rooms is definitely substandard. We had the air on the lowest setting, with the fan running the whole week, and the room never cooled below 72 degrees or so. While this was not a huge deal for us, if you need to stay in cooler temperatures, you may want to get a different room, possibly on a lower floor. Also, while we didn\u2019t see any large bugs in our room, we did notice many small ants around the sink area in the bathroom, which although not pleasant was not a huge issue. The rooms are located in a jungle area, and as mentioned before, are kept very clean for the most part. The room also included an easy to use safe, iron & ironing board and coffee makers. The room could be a 4 to 5 star room, but we ranked it as 3 stars based on poor air conditioning and the random bugs we saw in the room. Beach, Pool, Pool Bars: The beach is absolutely amazing and beautiful. Tons of chairs to get seats (for an \u201coverbooked\u201d resort, we never had an issue getting two chairs next to each other), white sand beaches, great views of ocean, etc. If long walks on the beach are a criteria for a good vacation, this is your place. The main pool is also a decent size, nothing to write home about, but a good place for a quick dip in a cool area. The main pool bar is located between the pool and the beach, and is also the location for the creperie. The staff at the bar are great, and work very hard. While they don\u2019t have the \u201cdrink runners\u201d of a large 5 star resort, they do have a few people walking around taking drink orders. We found it much easier to just walk to the bar (which is never that far of a walk) grab a few drinks and head back to our chairs. Overall this area is the highlight of the trip, and outside of people who need to be waited on constantly, you would be hard pressed to not enjoy this. There are also free \u201cnon-motorized\u201d ocean activities you can take advantage of (kayaking, Hobby Cat, snorkeling), which offer a break from just lying around. Restaurants & Food: The resort offers a decent variety of food, with breakfast and lunch options being pretty sparse. There is a buffet opened for all three meals, located off the main lobby, and is a large open air station style restaurant. This open air concept of the Buffet is its main downfall. There were often birds flying through the concourse, landing on/near the food, as well as occasional bugs in the area. In addition, the area never really gets cool, so you will sweating while eating, which is not very appetizing. There is also a snack bar open for lunch, located right next to the pool, by the a la carte restaurants. The food at both the Buffet and Snack Bar is safe and average. The Buffet always has pizza, fresh fruit, desserts, and a variety of hot options. The snack bar is similar (although much smaller) and offers staple items like hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, french fries, etc. By the end of the week we were very tired of both as breakfast and lunch options. We actually started just going to the crepe station for meals, as we enjoyed the crepes more than the Buffet food and snack bar food. One thing that I did not see in any of the other posts was the \u201ccoupon system\u201d for the various a la carte (sit down) restaurants. Upon check-in, you get 4 tickets, one for each of the 4 a la carte restaurants. We really enjoyed each of the restaurants, and would have loved to go back to any of them. Each restaurant you will get a 3 or 4 course meal, complete with drinks (top shelf liquors). If anything we were only disappointed that they only let you go to the restaurants 4 times as part of an \u201call-inclusive\u201d. We actually ended up going into Playa Del Carmen for two nights for dinner, partially to not have to eat at the Buffet again. If you do go to Playa Del Carmen \u2013 which we would definitely recommend \u2013 go to Fusion on the beach for a great meal on the beach. Literally, you are sitting on chairs and tables on the beach with live music, an atmosphere that you can\u2019t beat. Other resort information: The resort is frequented by a large number of European guests. What this does end up meaning is many women sunbathing topless, in skimpy bathing suits, and guys running around in speedos. If this bothers you, you may want to stay away, but wasn\u2019t a big deal for us. The animation staff seems to put on a decent program, but we were not really into playing a bunch of poolside games / activities. It does seem to cater to the European guests, as they seem to have various staff designated to each language / country, except for English. We didn\u2019t attend any of the shows (stopped in to one for about 10 minutes, were pretty bored and left) so we can\u2019t really speak on those. The shuttle service to Playa Del Carmen is very nice \u2013 just make sure that you make reservations early, as the shuttle fills up fast \u2013 and the front desk neglects to tell you that you need to make reservations. Overall: From our other travels (other Cancun resorts, Puerto Vallarta, Puerto Penasco, Hawaii, etc), this resort would rank lower on our list but with some highlights making it worth visiting. 5 Star features \u2013 Beach, Bar service (both at beach and lobby), Value 4 Star features - A la Carte restaurants, Shuttle Service, Pool 3 Star features \u2013 Room 2 Star features \u2013 Buffet Restaurant, Service at front desk Blend the above together and I would say this resort is somewhere in the 3.5 to 4 star range. For the amount we paid ($100 per day for 2 of us), I don\u2019t think we were going to find any better. If you have the money, and are looking for better service and other features, you can probably find it. However, for the money we were pleased in total with the resort, and the vacation accomplished what we wanted it to \u2013 relaxation on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.

From the moment we arrived we were treated as if we were only a number to them, and their bottom line. Nothing about this resort is personal, if you're looking for a personal touch and for someone to treat you like a guest, DO NOT stay at this resort. When we arrived we were immediately told that our Privilege room we booked was no longer available because they were overbooked, and that if we wanted to stay we would need to go down the beach about 40 minutes to one of their sister resorts.

Not only was Ali not \"sorry\" for the inconvienece, the only thing he could offer us if we wanted to stay at this resort was a standard room, 2 free lobster dinners, and 2 free 25 minute massages. Not that I wanted to be an a-hole, but I wasn't about to travel all this way and have them pull a stunt like this. I told him I wasn't accepting that offer and that he could talk to whoever he wanted to but that I wasn't leaving that desk without a Privilege room. He left the counter and walked into what I am assuming is the managers office, and after returning he magically found a Privilege room for us. What a surprise?!?! What they do is they hold back these rooms for their european guests from France and Italy who travel in huge groups. The only thing I can make out of it is that this placed is owned by european investors because everything about this place is catered to them. Food: The food was god-awful and I wouldn't feed that crap to my dog. There is ZERO protein! If you don't take my advice, when you go to the buffet, make sure you look around and watch the faces of all the american guys. We were all wondering around looking for beef, chicken, pork, fish, something that we could identify as a meat group. The rest of the food at the buffet is vegetables, fruits, and different types of breads. The restaurants weren't too bad, but again the food was very bland and barely had any taste to it. I ordered a NY strip one night and over half the steak was grisly fat. Drinks: The drinks are extremely weak unless you order from the main bar in the lobby. The do not have premium alcohol here. I tipped EVERY SINGLE TIME we ordered a drink and it didn't matter, they were still watered down and never really got the job done. On that note, if you're going to go to an all-inclusive resort, make sure you TIP. The only decent service we received while at this resort was from the waiters, servers, and maids. You know you're at a low class resort when the only person you see tipping anyone is YOU. Make sure you leave money for the maid, and if you go to eat please leave a few dollars for your server. Room: The room was hot and we never could get the air conditioner fixed. I called the front desk and supposedly they sent someone to our room to check it out but it never got any better. Remember that you're on the ocean and that it's extremely humid so if you have poor air circulation you're going to be miserable. Beach: The only thing going for this resort is the beach. It was beautiful! Crystal clear water and soft powdery sand for miles in either direction. As other people have commented there are a lot of topless women sunbathing but we didn't let that bother us. If you do go here make sure you check out the marina, it's about a mile to the south of the resort. They have a great little restaurant there that you can catch a great lunch for a very decent price. We kayaked and snorkeled off the beach, but because of the high winds and strong waves it was difficult to see too much if you're right off the beach. If you end up doing an excursion like the \"Ocean SafarI\" then you'll get a much better snorkeling experience. We have never been so ready to come back home. Don't get me wrong my wife and I still had a good time and enjoyed being on vacation, but if we could do it again we wouldn't have stayed here. Next time, we'll be going to a 4 or 5 star resort because you can really tell the difference in service and food.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Covina, California", "Title": "\u201cREVITALIZING\u201d", "Author": "1Gabby", "ReviewID": "UR65497202", "Content": "Loved this place.

The grounds are well manicured. The beach is very good, but there is no full protection from the sun, the tents are slated and you need to put on a shirt or a towel. I do not understand why the architects or designers put about a hundred of small logs on every tent instead of just putting on top a piece of solid white cloth as it is done in other hotels in Mexico and Dominican Republic. That would eliminate one great problem. The water in the ocean is clear, but if you plan to spend much time swimming, forget about it, there are waves almost all the time and a yellow flag which means that you have to swim with caution. I give the hotel A+ for abundant and delicious food. The maim buffet restaurant is excellent. Once we went by reservation to Mexican restaurant in the evening, but came back to buffet for fruit and desserts. The rooms are good, the matrasses are very comfortable for sleeping. We had privileged room, people say there is no great difference. There is no bathtub, only a shower and this is fine. But, as I believe, it should be a should be a shower curtain, and there is none. It is not pleasant to have water on the floor, though there is no problem with drainage. As for the drinks, they are good, but you can't get shampagne, there is none, only for the newlyweds and special occasions.

As soon as we got there we asked to get an upgrade to a priviledge room but they didn't have anything available. The standard room wasn't as bad as I imagined, the bed was firm but comfortable. My boyfriend and I prefer firm beds so maybe that's why we didn't mind it. The shower and toilet area were the worst part of the room, I kept my flip flops on to shower, the tile needs to be redone. NO ROOM SERVICE was one major downfall!!! The food seemed good at first but my boyfriend ended up getting so sick that he vomitted 12 times, every hour or so, we had to call the doctor to come to our room and give him a shot and prescribed 3 different prescriptions. Since it was the weekend, we had to pay for the doctor to come to the room, the total cost was $338 US for the doctor visit, the shot and the 3 antibiotics, which was a huge inconvenience. We spent one whole day in the room but the next day he felt fine. We're not sure what he got sick from but it was definitely either the food or something he drank. The next day we went to the lobby to see if we could get an upgrade to a honeymoon suite, because the previous day the lady at the desk told us that if we went back the next morning we could get an upgrade for 4 nights to a honeymoon suite, then when we got there she told us that the manager (who is not a nice person at all!!) told her that there was a couple coming in that day that booked the honeymoon suite so they couldn't give it to us now. I would have to say the only positives about the resort at the beach and the pool... which is where we spent most of our time. The maid service was really good and the lady that stocked our fridge even gave us some beer (we tipped her every night) the fridge in the standard rooms are only suppose to have pop and water so we thought that was really nice of her. It also should be said that THIS RESORT CATERS TO EUROPEANS AND ITALIANS, if you don't speak Italian or French don't bother coming here, the management and staff will not treat you equally. To top everything off, the day we were checking out, the manager told us that we had a $42 phone charge, it was from when I had to call the medical insurance when my boyfriend got sick, it said right on my insurance card TOLL FREE FROM MEXICO and that was the number that I had used, I even showed it to the manager and he said \"yeah well the rooms aren't set up to dial toll free numbers\" i explained to him that it was because my boyfriend got sick from the food at the resort and he didn't care, he charged us for the phone call anyway. All in all, we are not disappointed that we went on vacation but we will definitely not be returning to this resort or recommending to anyone. Next year we will be going to the El Dorado Royale for the Maroma beach and superior rooms and service!!! We stayed at the El Dorado Seaside Suites 2 years ago and it was the best experience ever, eveything was great, the only complaint was the beach, a lot fo coral and you have to wear swim shoes, other than that everything is perfect... we will definitely be going back there too.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort\u201d", "Author": "JSpallanzani", "ReviewID": "UR65223934", "Content": "Hi! We are a young couple and we love to travel. The Catalonia Playa Maroma hotel really satisfied us and we would recommend it. Arrived at Cancun airport, we boarded the small shuttle to the airport and it took about 30-45 minutes to get there. We had to go through security gates and along a small road in the jungle before arriving at the resort. There were security guards at the entrance and also at various places in the resort so we believe that safety was taken seriously. The lobby, buffet, bar, theatre and other sites are located at the entrance. Then, there is a small walking path surrounded by trees and plants that goes to the pool, a la carte restaurants and of course, the beach. The rooms are located in small buildings along the walking path. Check-in process was fast enough and easy. We received the keys and maps. We booked through a travel agency and requested to have a room at the second floor near the beach with one large bed (instead of two small beds). We received the room requested and about 5 minutes of walking was needed to get to the beach (you cannot really get any closer), and about 7-10min to get to the lobby / buffet. Staff in general was extremely nice and friendly. Some could even speak french. Most of them are good enough in english, but we met some of them who could only speak spanish. Staff are always saying Hello to you, smiling and they seemed happy to serve you. Front desk people were helpful, not like many other hotels that I've visited where they did not care about you. But it's hard to say anything about their help because we never really had to get help from them as everything was perfect. There is a lot of animation on the beach and on the pool. Animators are very dynamic and happy and they did not bother us too much on the beach. Tourists in this resort are from very different places, we heard a lot of americans of course, but many french people (from France), italians, germans and others. The weather was not good. We had sun for 2-3 days but the rest was rain and thunderstorms. But this is not something that can be predicted. This was probably the only thing bad about our trip. We were a little bit disappointed by the beach itself as the water was often full of sand and a lot of plants, therefore you could not see through the water. There were also a lot of waves. We really enjoyed it, but it probably is what caused the brown water and the plants. They cleaned the sand on the beach everyday for plants. The water temperature was perfect when sunny. Food at the buffet was good. Nothing fancy but you always had something good to eat. Enough variety, bread, pizza, fish, meat, mexican things... I wish there was more seafood though. I would not recommend that you go to the italian restaurant, service was terrible and the food we ordered was directly taken from the buffet from the previous day. Drinks at the bar were nice, however small format if you don't ask a big glass so you might want to take 2 at a time. There is sometimes a person going directly on the beach to take your orders which I thought was very nice. We did not go to any of the shows at the theatres because we were so tired at the end of our days. But there was a show every night and for those of you who like to dance there is also a disco. Rooms were simple but clean and colored. We had a very large balcony and we liked it even though not everyone had it as large as we had. The only bad thing about the room is there was no curtain or door between the bathroom and the shower, therefore most of the time, the floor in our bathroom was very wet. Talking about water: DONT DRINK IT! they provide purified bottled water in your minifridge with sodas and beer if you ask it. There is a shuttle everyday for Playa del Carmen. They bring you on the 5th avenue for shopping. There is also a beach very close, don't forget your swimsuit!! Overall , a great resort to go !!

The positives far outweighed the negatives and overall was a great trip and an outstanding resort. Direct flight from Atlanta to Cancun with no lines at immigration or customs. Prebooked airport transfers through USA Transfers and upon passing through the airport, their guy was the first one, had a van quickly, and we were at the hotel within 45 minutes of our plane landing. Room was booked via Expedia as a privileged room. Arrived at check-in around 11:45 and was processed very quickly by Carlos. There was a small bit of confusion as when the booking transferred from Expedia to the hotel, apparently they took my middle name as my last name. He advised us the room would not be ready until 3 and to check back. While checking in, we were brought drinks and were told we could change at the bathrooms in the lobby or by the pool and could get lunch until our room was ready. We started out down the path out of the lobby and ended eating lunch at a small buffet beside the pool (which is in the kitchen for the steakhouse a la carte). The smaller lunch buffet was the worst food we had all week (but wasn't bad, just nothing special at all). We made our way back to the lobby and at 2:45, I approached registration and Carlos recognized me and without asking for my name, grabbed the packet with our room keys and we were off to our room. We did get a privileged room in the 6000 building. The room was very nice. Probably 20 yards from the pool, 30 yards from the beach (would be beachfront with a small swath of trees taken out). Items in the fridge weren't cold, but with any mini fridges in a closet, they work better leaving the doors open and pulling them out just a little to let air circulate behind it. The only issue with the room at all was the air conditioning didn't really get cold. When walking in from outside, it initially felt cold as the vent is right after you get past the room entrance and into the room itself. We kept the ceiling fan on non-stop and prefer to sleep with it pretty cool, but it wasn't feasible. It wasn't a huge enough deal that I brought it up, but could have been better. Other than the small lunch time buffet by the pool, the food was outstanding. We did the Mexican a la carte twice, the steakhouse once, and the regular buffet most days for breakfast and lunch. The buffet was outstanding. Had carving stations at lunch and ommleltt stations at breakfast that were very good. The Mexican a la carte was excellent, while the steakhouse was decent, but not great. The seating for the steakhouse is open air and on the outside of the building housing the Mexican and Italian restaurants. The seating is covered and fairly close to the beach, so it has a nice breeze. We did not try the Italian or Tapas (not included in AI) restaurants. The Creperie is beside the pool bar and was good. The drinks at the lobby tended to be much stronger than the pool bar (especially from a very short bartender whos name escapes me). For the most part, the drinks were fairly small, so we got used to ordering 2 at a time. The breakdown of guests at the resort while we were there seemed to be about 35% american, 25% italian, 20% french, 10% german, 5% other european, and 5 percent latino. The americans seemed to be the most, uh, difficult of the guests. One showed up at an a la carte dinner in a tuxedo tshirt, some kept talking in english so fast that the staff couldn't understand them (and yet those will probably be the same coming on here complaining about the staff not speaking english), etc... The staff was phenomenal. We speak very little english, but tried our best to speak basic phrases when ordering, etc. The staff seemed to appreciate that. All were very nice and did their best to serve any need. There were servers going around the lobby and beach taking orders. The ones on the beach tended to be more scarce and slower, but not terribly so. The pool is not huge, but is very nice. It is surrounded on 2 sides by cover and has zero entry on both sides. The beach, as has been said before, is very nice. We walked a decent way in both directions and didn't come upon any rocky areas, just nice sand to walk on. At the beach and the pool, staff were frequently organizing games of volleyball (pool and beach), bocce, soccer, etc. These seemed to be more heavily played by the europeans at the resort than the americans. The weather was hit and miss. Most days were cloudy with rain staring about 6-7 and continuing into the night. The rain brought out the mosquitos, but considering its the jungle, they weren't awful. Late in the afternoons, a landscape staffer would come around and smoke out (?) the mosquitos from the trees. Overall, the bug level wasn't bad, but take some bug spray and sting reliever. Our last night we took the shuttle to Playa del Carmen. While I know this isn't the review forum for that, we weren't overly impressed. There is some lovely architecture around Quinta Avenida, but the shopping seemed to consist of tacky souvenir shops and mostly empty restaurants with uninspired menus. i hadn't done enough research to know what way (if any) to diverge off Quinta Avenida, but it wasn't the highlight of our trip.

We were disappointed especially with the front desk staff. We booked this hotel after researching the reviews for it and comparing it to other resorts that were more expensive. We choose this hotel because we wanted to save a few bucks and the reviews about the famous Maroma Beach. As the other reviewers have been saying about this hotel most recently, we also booked a privileged room. Upon check in we were told the same story \"we are over booked and if you want to have the privileged room, you will need to move to our sister resort or take the standard room.\" We were very annoyed. We did not want to move because the beach at that resort did not get good reviews. Well, if you check out the hotel's website, there is only the privileged room listed, no standard rooms. My husband had called 2 days prior to our arrival to confirm everything was still good for our room. We were told it was. After, we got upset, they magically gave us a privileged room. It really was strange. It was not a good start to the trip. The first room they gave us was supposed to be a king bed, it was a queen and every time one of us rolled over in the bed it made a loud squeaking noise. Also the air conditioning didn't work very well. After my husband got angry with the front desk again, they again found us a better room with a newer king and better air conditioning. The room never did get really cool, so if you like it cooler don't stay here. All the other staff was very good the maids and dining staff. The food was mostly good. It wasn't amazing but good. The buffet restaurant was good for breakfast, but we didn't like the choices for dinner. We thought it was comparable to a carnival cruise buffet which I think is average. We are kind of snobby about food. The beach was exactly what the reviews said except for a lot of topless women. So if this offends you stay away. My husband and I are \"lay on the beach and swim in the ocean\" people. The water is beautiful turquoise clear and the sand is white. There aren't many rocks when you swim, it is very pleasant. I did get a massage in the spa which was very good. We rented a car which was a lot easier than we thought, the driving. We went to the ruins at Coba which was amazing. We also went Snorkeling in the town Puerto Morelos it was only $25 a person for two hours. WOW! The fitness center was pathetic one treadmill and some old weights. The wireless internet hardly worked, very frustrating. Over all the resort was ok. We probably won't be staying there again. We did learn a lesson for our traveling next time that is we will not go cheap when it comes to where we stay. So if you can afford a nicer hotel, I say this is your vacation spend the extra dough!

Check in was a breeze. We got more info from Andrea at checkin, as well as the room location we requested, than any other resort we've stayed in and we arrived at a busy time. The resort is clean and beautiful as others have previously mentioned. The food selection at the buffets is quite large for a small inexpensive property. They even had a chocolate fountain at breakfast. The salsa and guacamole were delicious. We also enjoyed the beach and pool waiter service. Our room was a privileged one in building 6 and it was very comfortable with lots of storage and a huge walk in shower. Most employees were very friendly and the service was great. Beach bar got a bit slow at times. Lobby bar makes the best drinks. Unfortunately the beach bar, the only one at that end of the resort, does not serve any drinks in glasses at any time, not even the evenings and that seemed strange. The plastic cups could use an upgrade as some of them seem to be quite old and over-used esp. for a before/after dinner drink. The a la carte restaurants in the evening were hit or miss. We ate at the Mexican and Italian twice. Do try the Mexican even if you're not a fan of Mexican food. I had a great filet in there and much better than the steaks in the steakhouse. The Steakhouse restaurant was more like a Ponderosa or Sizzler but the steaks in the Italian and Mexican restaurants were great. The also have great chocolate milk and fruit juices (watermelon!!) at the breakfast buffet. We plan to take our adult children and grandkids for a family trip next year. It is definitely a wonderful family resort and not bad for couples either if you travel at the right time. There were a few very young children there but not a lot of older kids. Most all were very well behaved and seemed to love the pool. Most employees were great. Bartenders at lobby bar were very good but not so much at the beach bar where they basically just made the drinks as quickly as possible and didn't really want to listen to any special requests.

We knew that check-in would likely be around 3 or 4pm, so we were prepared with our bathing suits handy. The pool is very nice, and quite warm. It gets rather busy around the pool area, so you need to reserve chairs early, although it wasn't hard to find extras and pull them to your desired local. The beach was stunning; I've never seen a more beautiful beach. The closest comparison is Caneel Bay, St John. The water is beautiful with a great surf. I am usually a pool person, but I sat at the beach every day. They had waiters/waitresses walking around on the beach, so I didn't have to walk to the bar! The restaurants fill up rather quickly, so if you want to try them, you shouldn't wait too late. I was a bit surprised but it didn't really bother me. I loved the buffet, and ate their most of the time anyway. There's a lot to do down there, and we spent 1/2 a day at Playa del Carmen bargaining w/ vendors and eating at some of the local cafes. They have a lot of tour options, and we did the Tulum Extreme trip where you visit the Mayan Ruins at Tulum, rappelling, snorkeling and zip line all around the local cenotes. I also did a separate excursion of a two tank dive at the local cenotes. I would recommend going through separate tour groups to book your scuba dives, and NOT the dive shop located at the hotel. The dive shop tried to gauge me with a minimum 4 tank dive costing close to $400 USD. I went through Olympus tours and booked 2 dives w/ Bahia divers with a total cost of $140 - I rented everything buy my mask. The dive master was a guy named Philippe, and he was a great dive master.

With that, we got a privledged room in the 4000 building. The room was very clean, king size poster bed, very comfortable, complete with a \"pillow menu\" to customize your sleep! The mini bar had water, and aside from the restaurants that was the only place to get bottles of water. We had a balcony with a view of a very authentic looking Mexican courtyard. All of the landscaping was very beautifully done, there were always people working on one thing or another. The hotel is located very far back from the main road, and you feel like you're going into the middle of nowhere, but then you see a spacious, gorgeous lobby that takes you to the main walkway, where you are flanked on either side by natural greenery and it is very beautiful. Pictures can't come close to capturing this, especially when you hear the delicate music that they have piped in! The food is amazing, buffets plentiful, great variety, very tasty (and we are very picky about food), much better then expected. Only downfall of the main buffet is that it is not air conditioned, and that could be very uncomfortable. The indoor restaurants are air conditioned. Italian restaurant is not to be missed, (ate there 2x...BEST Carrapicio) free house wine that was excellent, and a decent wine menu (extra $), and a Mexican restaurant that was also very good, Wonderful Tapas restaurant that was also included in the priveleged reservation, super romantic atmosphere, and just excellent service in all places. The beach is just absolutely beautiful. Words cannot say enough. We walked very far both ways, and Catalonia has the best by far. There are waitstaff that come around for drinks, but not all that often. Not a big deal. Pool is great, we did go to the spa and had a nice time, too. You could choose to have your services in the secluded \"garden\" setting, (we did-great), or there is a spot on the beach. One of our favorite parts would have to be the hammocks, swinging in the sand looking at the beautiful water, was paradise! One word of caution, at the Cancun airport there are \"travel agents\" who are very nice and try to learn about you and your vacatuion desires, and lure you into very lengthly \"vacation club\" or timeshare proposals.

We normally travel to Mexico and the Caribbean at least 1-2 times a year and my impression of this hotel is among the best (not including the higher end adults-only places). To start at the beginning, the ride from the airport is an easy 20-30 minutes. The check in process was incredibly efficient, our room keys, restaurant coupons and bracelets were all prepared in a waterproof pouch ahead of time and were waiting for us when we arrived. Even though we forgot to bring our Apple vouchers, the hotel was able to locate the e-mail from Apple and complete everything in just a couple of minutes while a waiter immediately brought us drinks from the lobby bar. Because we are travelling with children, we had asked to be moved from our original 3rd floor room down to the ground floor and that was also done almost immediately. One thing I really appreciated is that the bell-boy wheeled our luggage along with us as we were going to our room instead of delivering it at some later time like it's done in many larger resorts. We had booked a privileged room in order to be closer to the beach and were not disappointed. The room is not large, but very comfortable and many small details are well thought through, such as reading lights that offer very focused beam just large enough for a book, allowing everyone else in the room sleep (especially useful with children), louvered closet doors so that the clothes never got that musky smell, umbrellas, bathrobes, etc. I would say that the only modification I would make is to put in an extraction fan in the bathroom since it can get really musty and humid in that small space, but it's a very small matter. The beds were very comfortable, with good quality linens, and the hotel offers a pillow menu. There have been so many review about the beach that it's really not worth noting, but I can attest that they are all true and the beach is spectacular. One thing that surprised me was the pool. Generally I'm not at all a pool person especially with such a spectacular beach on the premises, but the weather during our stay made the beach unusable for about 1/2 our stay. This pool was just wonderful for the kids, there are 2 sides with beach entry into the pool and even my 2 year old felt confident stepping into the water on his own. There is also a lap pool that is separated from the rest by large concrete pillars and several deep areas that my older one used for cannonball contests. The absence of a swim-up bar is a plus to me since I always wonder at the people sitting there all day drinking but not leaving their bar-stool... (you know what I mean) and it also makes for a quieter and more relaxing atmosphere around the pool. The food ranged from just above average to spectacular. The buffet for breakfast and lunch was very extensive and varied and all the food extremely fresh. I saw employees with thermometers on several occasions testing that the cold and hot items were at the proper temperatures. We ate at the a la carte restaurants for dinner every night and it's hard to pick a favorite, possibly the Italian and the Tapas. The service everywhere was very good, from the waiters at the buffet to the head waiter at the Tapas restaurant that personally carried our table out the balcony because we wanted to dine alfresco. I was surprised by the quality of their house wine, it is Spanish and very decent. Normally we order a bottle of wine with dinner, but found it unnecessary here and drank house wine with meals. The resort itself is just incredibly beautiful, the grounds, landscaping, building, fountains are all meticulously kept up and it's just a pleasure to take a walk around. The architecture is Mexican eclectic and the colors complement the landscaping perfectly. There were some instances where I would just stop and stare at how the morning light comes into the courtyard. Writing this review I feel like I should start making reservations for our next trip.

As in another recent review, you certainly don't need a \"privileged\" room to enjoy this hotel. We were in a regular room (5221) and found the room to be spacious, with a very comfortable mattress and a mini-fridge that was stocked every day with soda and water. We really couldn't figure out what all the hype is about a \"privileged\" room vs. a regular room. The only thing we didn't have in our room was an iron and ironing board. When I asked at the front desk about obtaining an iron and board, they told me that they \"do not have them\" and if you want anything ironed, you must send it to the hotel laundry. Found this to be rather strange, after reading another review that all \"privileged\" rooms have them and we didn't. We believe that they should have ironing boards available for everyone to use, as they are a common item that is asked for. The beach is the nicest we have ever been on. We would walk it every day, wondering why we were a few of the only people walking on such a beautiful beach! For being so well-known as the \u201cmost beautiful\u201d, there sure weren\u2019t many people using it. There were no vendors on the beach all week. This is the first time we ever encountered this. Nice! Walking the beach was the ultimate soothing experience and we highly recommend it. Mosquitoes were a huge problem\u2014mostly in the open (main) restaurant. We actually experienced people getting up and leaving before they were finished eating because the mosquitoes were so bad. The maintenance people on the resort would spray around the grounds a couple of times a day, but it didn\u2019t help much. In fact, one night we experienced the fog coming right into the restaurant, near the food! However, this is a very \u201cgreen\u201d resort, so we were hopeful that the stuff they were spraying was chemical-free. By all means, bring a strong insect repellent to be on the safe side. Food was excellent in all respects\u2014everything was fresh and in abundance at each meal. In fact, the chefs were constantly checking all food items almost every 10 minutes on the buffet to see that food items were well-stocked and had not run out. I tried the Creperie restaurant one day and had the ham and cheese crepe\u2014to die for delicious! Customer service was excellent, except for a couple of items: 1) several times when we wanted to have some ice cream for lunch in both the snack bar and main restaurant, there were no ice cream dishes available. They had all been taken and not been restocked. We had to use either a plate or soup bowl for the ice cream. 2) Don\u2019t expect \u201cwaiter\u201d service at the snack bar. There were a couple of times when a waiter did not even stop at our table, and we had to get our own beverages. Note: the snack bar is always very busy and they run out of items much faster during the lunch hour when compared to the main restaurant. The main restaurant had few people in it during lunch. We also experienced a couple in the room next to us in loud argument in the middle of the night. We called the front desk to report it and they sent Security up to their room within a few minutes. This was very appreciated, and shows they care about the comfort level of guests. With a few improvements in the customer service area above, this resort could easily be a 5-star. It\u2019s just a few glitches that can easily be addressed and fixed. Also, the mosquito problem needs to be corrected. Providing guests with insect repellent would be helpful.

Switch the coatamundis for iguanas and they\u2019re practically identical. We spent the first night in a basic room and then upgraded to a Privileged room (Tikal, 4220) for US $20 per person per night. Off the top of my head the upgrade included improved d\u00e9cor, an improved king bed, an umbrella, ironing board, robes, slippers, flat screen TV, and a pass to the tapas restaurant. Oh, and two Sol beers in the mini fridge, plus the water, Pepsi, 7-Up, and Marinda (orange) that you get in the regular rooms. Half of the vanity area and the whole bathroom were not upgraded, the latter oddly lacking a shower curtain. The AC was a bit noisy and wasn\u2019t the strongest, but in the end did the job in combination with the ceiling fan. Thankfully the walls are of good thickness as we barely heard our neighbours. Even so, advantage: Catalonia Royal Tulum. The beach is spectacular with soft white sand, perhaps ever so slightly better than Xpu Ha, which itself is a spectacular beach. We frequently walked Maroma north or south and never did get to either end. The water is a gorgeous turquoise with a gently sloping entry and the ocean floor is all sand. The slatted sun covers do a pretty good job, although you do end up closer to your neighbours than you would with palapas. The resort had the amimacion staff plant some potted palms while we were there; they should be shade-worthy in several years. Advantage: Catalonia Playa Maroma. The food at the resort is very good. The buffet has a vast array of tasty items on offer. One night they had a massive roast turkey that may have been the juiciest bird I\u2019ve ever had. Another night they had a delicious pork roast. Still another was Mexican night with tacos al pastor and live mariachi music. For lunch we\u2019d generally have a plate of guac and chips from La Tortuga, perhaps a burger and fries, and eat beachside. We went to the Tio Pedro a la carte twice: the arrachera and carne de res were surprisingly good. We tried one night to get into the La Toscana a la carte but it had a 50 minute wait list so we went back to the Tio Pedro and were less impressed with the pecho de pollo as well as the brochette of camarones. We had better luck with the La Tortuga a la carte: my rib steak was again surprisingly good. Call it all a draw with the CRT. The staff are extremely hard working and friendly, the latter one of the reasons why we keep returning to Mexico. The animacion staff are friendly too and know how to interact with guests.

We paid $1,800 for this four night vacation while Secrets came in more than $3,200. So what don\u2019t you get for $1,400 less? You don\u2019t get room service, for starters.

And the meal we ate at the Terrace Tapas \u2013 if we could see it \u2013 was fine (especially the shrimp crepes). The breakfast buffet was similar to Dreams, with an omelet station, and a wide variety of juices and fruit. If one were to see a flaw, let\u2019s say the cereal selection was limited. (But I can buy a lot of frosted flakes for $1,400.) What else don\u2019t you get for $1,400? You don\u2019t get awesome smelling eucalyptus body soap, but a blander substitute. You don\u2019t get bath robes. You don\u2019t get as nice a room. No Jacuzzi, a smaller TV, no ocean view (but the courtyard is very ornate, and was a great place to drink your morning coffee when starting your day.) The room\u2019s a little less bright and luxurious, but was furnished with generous closets, an in-room safe and a small fridge kept stocked with your beverages of choice. The bed was comfortable (we were in a privilege room which I understand comes with a mattress upgrade.) The bathroom is Spartan. And what do you get for $1,400 less? You get the same spectacular beach. In fact Catalonia and Secrets are smack dab next to each other, and since all beaches in Mexico are public beaches, you miss out on nothing. But you don\u2019t need to saunter over to Secrets. Catalonia offers ample beach seating, shaded and unshaded. And if it\u2019s the pool you\u2019re after, then Catalonia\u2019s is spacious and beautiful with large sections for any swimming level (though no swim-up bar, which we find to be an over-rated feature anyway.) The beach is developed to the north with other properties. Secrets is to the south, but once you\u2019re past there, you have two miles of open beach to roam till you come to the next resort (the Eldorado Maroma). For you joggers, most of those two miles offer hard-pan sand to run on \u2013 a runner\u2019s dream, especially with the Caribbean Sea beside you. The Catalonia also offers scuba and snorkeling packages through its dive shop. My wife, daughter and I want to especially thank Natalie for the wonderful service she offered us in putting a snorkeling trip together. She\u2019s a gem. There are plenty of additional daily activities offered through the resort, so you truly can design for yourself any type of vacation you want to have, from uber-relaxing to shop-till-you-drop (and the Catalonia offers two daily shuttles free-of-charge to Playa del Carmen for the latter types.) If you need people around you, you can find all the company you want. If you prefer privacy and quiet, not once in our five days did we ever have the sense that the resort was overly crowded. We never stood in endless lines, never had to fight for chairs, and never had to rush or delay a thing. And while Secrets is adult-only, we never found excessive packs of children to be an issue here as it was in both Dreams properties. (Though there was the breakfast when a little boy sneezed a cloudburst over the pineapple. But that didn\u2019t bother me nearly as much as the seventy year old topless woman I saw on the beach while jogging. A guy should never have to see anyone\u2019s grandmother in the buff.) As for complaints about the European-heavy clientele \u2013 chill out, people. Most of the staff comes equipped with a working knowledge of English. Be friendly, and you\u2019ll get friendly back, from guests on up. If you don\u2019t enjoy yourself in a place like this \u2013 listening to those wonderful tropical birds, feeling that sunshine splash on your face, hearing \u2018holas\u2019 right and left \u2013 then chances are good you\u2019ll only have yourself to blame. One day we\u2019ll get next door to Secrets. Chances are very good though that we\u2019ll be returning to the Catalonia first.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "South East", "Title": "\u201cMASSIVE MOSQUITO OUTBREAK APRIL 25th 2010\u201d", "Author": "UKTravellerSouthEast", "ReviewID": "UR62510695", "Content": "If you are coming here in the next month and you care allergic to mosquitos then change your booking.

Overall, our stay was great...no major complaints. The staff was super friendly and always seemed interested in making sure the guests were happy and having a good time. After reading some previous reviews, I was nervous about the amount of smoking going on at the hotel and was relieved to find that it really wasn't a problem. Of course, there were smokers there, but it wasn't overwhelming or obnoxious at all. The room we had (5327) was a Privilege room on the third floor and unlike some of the others, the bathroom was remodeled. The room itself was great...very modern and comfortable. The only two issues I would note were that the AC was not very strong so it was always a little bit warm/humid in there and the other issue was with the balcony. It was pretty strange because the balcony wall was probably 4 feet high and made of solid concrete, not a railing, so when you stepped out there, it was almost like being in a concrete room. There was no view to speak of as it looked onto another building, but it was still nice to sit out there and take in the sun. The grounds were amazing. It was a bit of a walk from the lobby/buffet area down to the beach, but it is definitely a scenic walk. We did check out the fitness center and it was passable with one treadmill and some weights. There were a few shops there also that had some great stuff...everything from souvenirs to sunscreen to snacks. We were pleasantly surprised by the food options. The main buffet was great. There really was something for everyone (including my vegetarian boyfriend). Not everything was that great, but I never had anything that was truly bad. I did, however, have some things that were exceptional-particularly the Mexican foods. We went one night to the tapas restaurant and I think we both regretted it. Not only did we have to wait to get in, but it was very hot up there and about ten minutes into our dinner the animation team started setting up for a pool party downstairs with really loud music, sound checks, etc...not very appropriate during what is supposed to be an elaborate dinner. We spent a ton of time at the beach and the first two days the beach was amazing, but later on there was a massive influx of black seaweed which made the beach pretty much unswimmable. We managed to deal with this by walking a ways down the beach to where there are no hotels and the water was pristine. The beach service was good, but not very frequent. I would say that in four or so hours of sitting on the beach we were only approached once for drink orders-the rest of the time we walked to the bar to get our own drinks.

I agree that the bathroom could use an update, but the older Mexican painted sink had a lot of charm. A little more lighting in the bathroom would have been nice also. When we arrived, a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to our room with a wonderful note from the manager congradulating us on our anniversary. We found the hotel and grounds to be immaculate. Our room was cleaned daily and we had no problems. Many people have mentioned a language problem. We are from the United States and had no problems at all. Most Europeans speak English as one of their languages and the staff was wonderful in helping us and even teaching us some Spanish. The thing that was really nice was that everything was done in 4 languages. They had Italian, French, Spanish and English speaking people in their animation staff. I can't say enough about the animation staff. They made the resort so much fun. You never felt pressured to join in and even if you didn't join in, it was fun to watch. Thank you Laura for making us feel so welcome. This group of young adults were the high point of the trip. They work so hard and put in many hours a day and at the end of the day are still smiling and interacting with guests. They do a wonderful job with the nightly shows and then dance with guests afterward at the disco. They make sure that there is something for everyone to enjoy whether you are 4 or 84. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and helpful. The grounds and wildlife on them were truely amazing. It was like being in a jungle. The beach was perfect. No water shoes needed and never hot. Service on the beach was fast and with a smile. Plenty of shade and no need to play the towel game. The food was really good and plentiful. The Tapas resturant was out favorite. Very romantic and an excellant experience. The Mexican night at the buffet was also a lot of fun and the pool party was a riot. This is a resort that you can do as much or a little as you like. My husband and I have traveled a lot and have stayed at many 5 star resorts in the caribbean.

This is a family resort. All staff were warm, welcoming and excellent to be around. Paco, Jhonny and Lucio will be remembered as will all of the animation team. The animation staff will take the time to sit and talk with you if you wish and welcome this. They appreciate and thank you for coming to their event and the resort. The lobby is BEAUTIFUL. The buffet excellent. Something for everybody including a childrens section. A la cartes were ok - the Steak House was the best of the 3. Make sure you go there. IF you go to the seafood one - there is a cost of $55 US per person for lobster. Manuel & German - waiters in the evening - near the entrance of the buffet are excellent and fun to be with. Manuel will give you the GOOD tequila. During the a.m. sit in Felippe area (young man about 23 yr). Again in the entrance. The 6 housing blocks were old but VERY clean. Suggest you latch lock your room door while you are inside the room as staff knock a couple of times without us answering and will walk in. Language was a barrier. But no problems just a concern re them entering the room unannounced. The outside colours beautiful. Long pathway from the lobby to the beach - far for persons with walking issues, and young children (under 3 yrs)without strollers. Many activities around the beach and pool area -which are very close. Staff will ask you to participate but will not bug you if you reply no. Bar at the ocean/pool area not crowded - staff excellent - Abigail and Enrice very professional and warm - great smiles. There are no vendors on the beach which is a blessing compared to Puerto Plata, DR. There are vendors on the pathway near the Lobby - every 2nd evening. Again, you are not bugged if you don't want to stop and look or purchase. Evening fun is in /near the lobby area - disco, theatre, guitar playing. Disco for young crowd - not for us. Theatre good fun - not any major spectacular event however note that most are the animation employees who work around the clock and train etc. They are quite enjoyable especially for the children. Lucio plays guitar every second day - opposite a female guitar player. Both excellent entertainers and fantastic people. We were with another couple - all of us think that the whole resort and experiences are worth a return visit. We did go to Playa Del Carmen for a few hours via the free shuttle - took a cab back. Cost for the cab $20. It is worth it as the shuttle runs only at 10 a.m to go and 5 p.m. to return or 6 p.m. to go and 11 p.m. to return Playa Del Carmen typically is a shopper area - whole street of vendors with the same items offered. Bargain with them and they will lower their prices. Note - Starbuck does exist and will let you use their washrooms. Also note - that unless you show your original passport in the Bank of Nova Scotia -they will not exchange your money. Photocopies are not accepted. There are other money exchanges sites around but more expensive the changing it at the bank. No need to go to Playa Del Carmen if you want to stay at the resort. You wouldn't be missing anything - items/gifts can be bought at the resort. Also note - that the website shows the resort amongst trees/bush with nothing around it. This is not a true advertisement - picture is old. There are resorts all along the ocean. The beach at our resort was the busiest beach along the ocean side. Other beaches were very quiet. Also - be aware that there are fish that swim amongst you. They look bigger than they are and do not bite. Don't be afraid. Wireless internet is available in your room at no charge.

The hotel was great, this is a hotel which was recently bought over by the CATALONIA and therefore it is in the process of being renovated (as you probably already know) \u2013 we got really lucky and got a fully renovated room, which was really nice. Our room view was not very nice but we didn\u2019t care much as we were never in the room unless we were sleeping. NOW THE GOOD STUFF: Beach was absolutely gorgeous \u2013 white sand, almost like flour \u2013 it never heated up and you can walk very comfortably on it. Stores on the resort very reasonably priced, in fact better than pricing on 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen. Italian Restaurant (Toscana) was friggin\u2019 amazing \u2013 they greet you outside the restaurant and welcome you with a glass of champagne \u2013 the service was impeccable and food absolutely delicious. Mexican restaurant (Tio Pedro) was also very good. Snack Bar/Grill (Tortuga) also great.

Just so you know, we've been to the Riviera Maya 5 times (to six different hotels) over the last six years, so we have some knowledge of the area. We have stayed at the following properties: Aventura Spa Palace, Xpu-Ha Palace, Copacabana Beach Resort (now called Catalonia Royal Tulum), Shangri-La Caribe (now called Mahekal Beach Resort), and Grand Palladium White Sand. Besides Shangri-La (now Mahekal), the Catalonia Playa Maroma is the only other place we would consider returning to....we had a really great trip, and I would recommend it! We were there to celebrate my 40th birthday (yikes!) from 3/26/10 to 4/2/10. We traveled with four other couples (three of them with kids, ages 1-10). Overall, we had an absolute blast! My husband and I upgraded upon arrival to a honeymoon suite for an additional $50 a night - I don't think there was much difference between an upgraded (i.e. priviledged) room and the honeymoon suite, except for the jacuzzi tub on the balcony! That was nice :) We also got towel art and special gifts in our room occasionally (choc. covered strawberries and champagne, a special occasion cake, etc.) - our other guests did not receive these extra touches. The resort is spread out so nicely - yes, it is a 5 minute walk between the lobby and the beach, but it is a welcome bit of exercise after all of the eating/drinking we were doing! It is a beautiful walk with nice calm music being piped in, and the buildings were so spread out among the jungle surroundings that you felt your building was the only one there! We stayed in the 4000 block, which was fine - no ocean view, but a very private jungle view that was still close enough to the beach to feel the breeze. The grounds were so clean and well maintained. Our room was also nice as you can see from the pictures....there was NO mold in the bathroom, and it did not need updating in my opinion - it was more on the rustic side, though, which I would expect in Mexico - hand-painted tiles, etc. It was charming! The beach, as everyone has stated, is the main reason we came here, and why we would return in the future! Absolutely fabulous! The sand was fine, white, and always cool to the touch, and the water was such a beautiful shade of blue, and crystal clear! We even had some nice mild fun waves each day....it is immaculate, even when you walk further away from the resort to some uninhibited properties....clearly not much upkeep needed, which we appreciated! The only drawback to the beach was the shaded structures - we went in high season, so I guess it is expected to have to stake your spot in the shade each day.....my husband was usually able to secure a shady spot around 9 a.m. each day with no problem, although sometimes when we went an hour or two later to claim our spot, our towels/belongings either magically disappeared or shifted! It was also somewhat crowded in those structures.....if you don't mind a spot directly in the sun, then you won't have any problems finding a chair! I like the sun and getting a tan, but my husband burns very easily so he needs the shade occasionally. Regarding the food: As stated above, we've stayed at other AI's, and the food at Catalonia Playa Maroma surpassed the others by far. We had no sickness issues (as we did at Copacabana - now called CRT), and the food was actually pretty good (as compared to GP White Sand, which we found almost inedible). We liked the breakfast buffet every day, and we also liked the lunch buffet in the lobby - the lunch buffet by the pool was ok, too, when we were too lazy to make the walk to the lobby! We also enjoyed the mexican and italian restaurants at night. We had a weird experience at the Tapas restaurant (included with our room upgrade), so we weren't too crazy about that....and we never tried the steak restaurant, but our friends that did said it was pretty bad. We ate at the dinner buffet once, and we were not impressed - seemed to be a repeat of lunch that day. Overall, we found that after 4-5 days, we got tired of the food....it was good, but too repetitive for us. We ended up going into PDC for the last 3 nights of our trip, just for some variety and fun.....we love PDC! Side note: You've got to check out the \"Red Bar\" in PDC just for fun.....we're not into that sort of thing, but it was very entertaining! hahaha! Regarding excursions: We took a snorkeling trip through Mexico Blue Dream, which we really enjoyed! We were supposed to do the Cozumel snorkel trip, but when we arrived at the dive shop we were informed that the port of Cozumel was closed due to the waves! So we ended up snorkeling at Yal-Ku Lagoon and Akumal Bay....it was a lot of fun, and we didn't mind the change. Our guide was great, and swimming with turtles in Akumal bay was really neat! At the end of our tour, we stopped at a roadside stand for lunch - the kind that is like someone's home! It was the best meal of our whole trip :-) Our friends that brought kids seemed to like the different activities that were available - catamaran rides, kayaking, tennis, basketball, archery, etc....since our kids were home with grandma, we were content sitting our butts on the beach and doing nothing! The kids' club didn't seem to be much, though....one little building and a small playground fit for 2-4 year olds. Again, since we didn't bring our kids, we didn't check into it, but just from outward appearances it didn't seem like much of a club. Holy cow...I just realized how much I wrote! Hope this info is helpful to you all as you plan your future trips.

The bathroom was in bad need of updating and a foul odor would come from the floor drain at times that would require you to keep the bathroom door closed to keep it out of the room. The room had a huge patio area. The room wasn't great but we only were in it to sleep and change clothes so it wasn't a big issue. Building 5 is close to the pool and the beach and farthest from the lobby and buffet. But it is beautiful 10 minute walk up to the lobby on a jungle path where can watch the wildlife during the day and with music and a starry sky at night. We went to 2 of the al-a-carte restaurants, the Mexican and the Italian. The Italian was average but the Mexican was superb. We didn't get the third one, the Grill, as we waited until the last night and it was closed. One tip is to find out which nights the al-a-carte are closed as the hotel doesn't tell you. The first time we went to the Italian it was closed also. The buffet had a average selection of food and was OK but not exceptional. We had lunch at the al-a-carte building close to the beach which opened for a lunch buffet. It had the usual lunch menu which fit the bill. The service was great at the desk, the bars and the restaurants whether you tipped or not. Everyone was very friendly. They had a show and disco each night but we did not attend so I can't comment on them. I would given the hotel a 5 for value however Nolitours dropped the price of our trip by $300 per person a week after we had booked it. Although Selloff vacations had a best price guarantee they informed me that Nolitours did not participate in the program. That started with the trip with kind of a downer. I hope Nolitours enjoys the $600 as it will be the last dollar they get from me or anyone I know. The hotel itself appears to be an excellent value. I would defintely recommend this hotel to anyone who looking for relaxing vacation on a beautiful beach. I would go back tomorrow.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flint, MI", "Title": "\u201cI'm missing the Beach!\u201d", "Author": "swift", "ReviewID": "UR60373150", "Content": "Beautiful beach and lovely resort.

Service here is very good and the wait staff are always at your service (service with a smile). The food is pretty good (well above average). You would be hungry and unhappy anywhere, to not be able to find something good to eat here. Lovely property with a great pool and beach bar area. The beach is the best I've ever been on. Now, there's a longwalk from the beach to the main lobby. The walk has music and local wild life that is too cute. The main lobby (which is beautiful and grande) has the full buffet and a 24/7 lobby bar. I found the walk to be great, especially after an two plater meal. LOL They serve top shelf booze, but you have to request it or you'll only get well drinks. They have four other specialty restuarants, one great and the others o.k.., They have a free shuttle twice a day to Playa Del Carmen, which has a Wal-Mart and Sam's Club.

Not so. I dismissed the naysayers finding their reviews petty and assumed that there were some people who just couldn't be satisfied. Mercifully, our stay was short! First the positives: Lovely beach and sand. Very good buffet meals. Nice creperie near the beach. Lovely little animals called coatis. The negatives: We arrived at noon. It took 6 hours to get a room. Nothing like the one we requested when we made the reservation. Not a great beginning. We were assured that the section we were in was a no smoking building - a lie. there is no non smoking building. Tired and diappointed, we accepted the room. Surprise, surprise - our building - Uxmal (3000 block ) backs up against the disco of the hotel next door. When we expressed our dismay the next day their response was disbelief. Their disco was on the other side of the resort. Staff had no idea that the hotel next door had a huge disco a stone's throw away from our door! Even though the nolitours rep tried to help the staff was insistent - no other available room. Come back the next day. The evening of the second day we asked once more and finally we were given another room \" in a non-smoking building.\" ( I have asthma ) We were then taken to the Coba building - same OK standard room- but the only block that has not had a lick of paint since it was built. It looked so dejected in the early evening - we felt that somehow we were being punished for not accepting what they gave us after our 6 hour check in wait. Another lie - it wasn't non-smoking. Oh well, I did have asthma meds with me. While the buffet food was good and there were lots of choices, there are problems. As you enter you are asked if you want the smoking or non smoking area. The smoking section was to the right one day, to the left the next. Sometimes it was the table next to you. Sometimes they simply moved the smoking sign on your table and sat you down. In the evening at each food station there is a bowl of smoldering, smoking incense, I guess to discourage mosquitos - none of which we saw. No wonder. At dusk the second night we literally turned the corner to see huge clouds of insecticide rushing toward us as a man pushed a snowblower sized insecticide machine. Beware of the bamboo shelters on the beach and around the pool. ( There are no palapas). There is no covering on top and you can get a nasty burn. Otherwise there are no shady areas. The staff at the lobby desk are very disorganised. No wonder. Each and ever time I inquired about anything, the staff would stop mid sentence and serve the Italian or Spanish speaking guests beside me. Almost funny. Each and every time I went to ask about the room change the same staff reacted as if it was the first time I had approached them. \"We have no record of your requests...\" I live in a city where English speakers are in the minority. It has never been a problem getting served. Love Italians, Spanish, you name it. But something must happen when they vacation at this beach. Don't even think of dozing off ... unless you are drunk. Conversations are screamed. Cigars passed around. All a bit intrusive as the lounge chairs are in rows inches away from each other unless you want to fry in the sun. A lot of support staff didn't understand basic requests in French, English or even Spanish. I can deal with that.But that's why it is doubly important for the management to be helpful. We spent Christmas at the Blue Bay Esmeralda and all the staff seemed happy. Maybe the pay at this resort is lower. We always tip generously but we tipped even more because so many staff seemed glum. The evening of our third day a miracle happened. There on the counter in the lobby was a framed notice. \"Upgrade to a five star resort for free.\" ** note that I had requested a room change 2 hours before. Almost hysterically I grabbed the frame and ran to the nearest staff. Suddenly this previously surly attendant became friendly and assured us that the offer was genuine. People had been upgraded the day before and even that morning, he said !!! Huh??? A cab was ordered and we were whisked off to the Catalonia Royal Tulum where the welcoming champagne and wet cloths to wipe our hands almost made me cry. The staff were lovely. They gave us their complete attention after they introduced themselves. Our remaining 4 days were paradise. Our trips to the desk were solely for getting change. There were usually only 2 - 3 staff on duty at a time but they were far more efficient than the 6 or 7 at Maroma. Some serious suggestions for the hotel: Get the front desk staff some public relations lessons. Get the management at the Royal Tulum to explain the concept of serving guests graciously. Designate some non smoking areas at least in the restaurants. Tell the truth if you have none. Upgrade the wiring. It is scary when the wall lamp flashes during the night when it is turned off. Otherwise I can ignore the power going off from time to time. Suggestions for the guests: Drink heavily. Use ear plugs on the beach and around the pool.

Certainly not the long walk some reviewers complained about (bring stroller if with a baby). Our room was basic with 2 double beds, we literally only changed clothes and slept there. Housekeeping was timely and very clean, refreshed bottled water and towels daily without requests. Only complaint was our A/C did not work. Maintenance attended immediately to attempt repair.

Water is clear and turquoise, with sand bars. Shade avail, no towel problems if you set yours out at breakfast time. Many European speaking guests, but we also met many North American families we spent the days with at the pool. Pools great for kids to wade in and also deeper for swimming. No cheesy swim up bar. Entertainment staff is fun, but not loud and annoying. Buffet food was good. We also ate at The Italian, Mexican and Steak ala cartes.

Elected the upgrade room (Building 6000, near beach, pool, and specialty restaurants). Outstanding beach, pleasant rooms and grounds, food abundant and well prepared. Convenient to Cancun Airport. Competent and attentive staff. This is a mid-range resort and a good value. Very firm beds. Delightful colony of coatimundis (related to raccoons), many birds, and an occasional lizard. First-come-first-served system at specialty restaurants here is much better than the frustrating reservations system at most other similar resorts. Several midday hours of loud music accompanying activities in the pool/beach area may be an annoyance. Good snorkeling on nearby reef (extra cost for boat and guide).

This tile is beautiful but fragile. Chipped glaze is inevitable: just because there are imperfections in your bathroom counter doesn't mean it is rundown or poorly maintained.

We traveled here with 3 other couples Mar. 2010. As everyone should, we checked out the recent reviews on tripadvisor before going and found them to be accurate. I will try to provide additional details and photos on the features not covered in other reviews. 1) BEACH - Postcard beautiful. Best beach I have ever been to. Google Maroma beach. There is Maroma Resort and Spa to the north and Secrets Maroma to the south and Catalonia is right in between them. There is basically nothing else on a mile of beach so you will not feel crowded and can take quiet walks on the beach and pictures with no one else in them. 2) RESORT - Immaculate, well kept, older resort with great Mexican feel and decor. There is a long path that runs down the centre of the resort from the lobby to the beach. All rooms are located in 6 buildings that are located a short distance off the main path and give the sense of quiet seclusion in the jungle. No elevators to rooms. The lobby is a large open area with comfortable seating that allowed you to sit further away from the bar and have some privacy and the chance to have a drink in quiet during the evening. 3) ROOMS - We had a privileged room in the 4000 block which was great. Very comfortable, newly renovated, slept like a baby, mini bar with drinks daily (cans of Sol), balcony, flat screen tv, large vanity, huge closet, robes and good space. As others have said, the bathroom is not great but only contains the shower and toilet. If the bathroom was renovated and a fan added in this would be a 5 star room from a 3+ star. One couple stayed in a room that was not remodeled and had no complaints. 4) FOOD - Great. All inclusive food has obvious limitations when produced for the masses but the food here was better than average and the deserts were best. The crepes were a nice change too. We ate at 2 a la cartes and they were good but slow. 5) POOL - I know there was a pool here because I walked by it on the way to the beach. It had water in it too. Seriously though, to live near this area of beach a residence starts at 2.9 million. This is rated one of the best beaches in the world with crystal clear, warm water so that is the place to be. Go to the Grand Xcaret if you want pools over beach. 6) LOCATION - 30 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes from Playa. 5 minutes from Maroma marina with great snorkeling, seadoos, speedboats, atvs, etc. Free shuttle on a large bus into Playa during the day and then another at night 6/11 pick up times. $20 for cab one way. 7) STAFF & SERVICE - Above average. Lobby bar service was good no matter where you were sitting. Beach service was okay but when there was a group having a party they were kept well supplied as they stepped up service. Buffet service was very good. As mentioned by others, the crowd here is mixed with many languages so some staff had limitations with certain languages. This did not cause us any issues. 8) ENTERTAINMENT & DISCO - There seemed to be a fleet of staff working day and night for activities and entertainment. They were good in balancing mingling and getting people involved without being a pain in the. The shows were tough to sit through as they cycled through 4 languages so we took in the 1st 7 minutes of one. We did the disco one night and it did not have much activity but it was nice that the lobby bar was close by so people could go back and forth. TO SUM IT UP - This place was unique enough to be different from other resorts with a charm that set it apart from the grand scale or crowded spots. It is close enough to Playa to offer easy visits to town & I would go back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cThe rooms were run down; wonderful beach\u201d", "Author": "MissingTheOcean", "ReviewID": "UR59427748", "Content": "I travelled with my mother and 4 year old daughter. We booked this hotel for: location, maroma beach, free shuttle to Playa Del Carmen and a good price with iTravel 2000. The weather was great for 4 of the 6 days. 2 days of rain and overcast, so no beach or pool time for those 2 days. We went to Playa both those days to kill the time with my 4 year old and keep busy. Shopping was fun and a bit crazy at times. I will summarize the pros and cons from our perspective. Pros: * Location. The drive from airport to resort was not too long, which was nice after a long day travelling with a child. It was also not more then a half hour to get to Playa Del Carmen to shop and walk around. * Free Shuttle. The resort offers a shuttle bus that goes 2 times to Playa. Make sure to book the day before you want to go. Also make sure to be there at the time they say for pick up, as they pull up, pick up and leave. * Food was excellent. The buffet is huge and lots of variety. The grill near pool and beach didn't offer a heck of a lot, but handy to not walk back to buffet every day for lunch. The creperie was fantastic as well - located right beside the pool bar. * Cappuccinos. I was happy to be able to order a cappuccinos at breakfast or any time of day, rather then just coffee. They were delicious. * Workers were friendly and helpful. We didn't experience any issues with any of the staff. Everyone was nice and friendly. English was spoken well by some and not so much by others, but it didn't hinder anything. * Beach!! Maroma beach is beautiful. Sand is so fine and white. It never was hot to the touch. The water is clear and blue. You can see the fish swimming around your legs. The waves coming in were rough some days and even on a calm day, still some force. But once you got past it, the waves further out were nice. Fairly windy each day, so the sand was getting everywhere, but still lovely. Lots of chairs on beach, so never an issue to get a couple loungers at any time of day. At least for the days we were there. * If shower pressue is an issue for you, you will be happy to know it was really good, along with lots of hot water. * Pool was not so cold like some places. Although not heated, it was a nice temperature, which was great for my daughter. Cons: * Jungle settting. Everything is built in a jungle. It looks nice, but you cannot see anything as you walk down the main walkway. The problem for me with this setting was the bugs.. My daugher reacts to bug bites and so it was not fun with her getting bit, and I had little marks all over my legs as well. Some itchy and some didn't bother me. We had bug spray as well, which I highly recommend you bring. I have never had an issue at other resorts with bugs before.....such as El Cid or Barcelo Maya in same area. * Rooms. They were a dump! The rooms are dated, old and run down. They need to fully gut them and redo everything. The beds are hard as well. They also have next to no blankets on the bed. The breadspread was a blue sheet and coordinated with the tacky decor they kind of had going on. There was no table or chairs either, so spending any time in the dump of a room was not enjoyable. So my mom and I sat on her bed and played cards one night after my daughter went to sleep and the other nights we all just went to bed. * Maid service. It was hit and miss. Apparently we had someone different every day. Some days we had enough towels and others not. Why leave 2 face cloths when we have a room with 2 double beds. And some days they seemed to wash the floors and other days just swept them. At least they change the bedding every day, so beds are kept clean, which is the most important thing to me in the room - a clean bed. * Pool. It was nothing special. The unfortunate part from my view point is that there was no kiddie area and the shallow part drops at a certain part and it's not roped or sectioned off. So we couldn't relax while my daughter was in the water, as if she went just a wee bit too far, she would go under. Would have been nice to have an area for just the kids to play with even some structures in the water. The bonus was the water was not nearly as cold as we experienced at the El Cid last year. Loungers were hit and miss for availability. Pool area isn't huge for seating, so there just are not a ton of chairs. * The kids club. Since it's stated for ages 4 and up, I was shocked to see the play equipment outside in a smal sand area be for like a 1-2 year old. As well, the outdoor play area is not even fenced. Clubs I have seen keep the kids secure, so parent do not have to worry. The inside area was also small and not very 'fun' looking. I didn't leave my daughter and I wouldn't have regardless, however I would have gone there with her to play at different times when she was getting bored. Only so much sand and water play for her, unlike other kids that will go all day. * Resort right next door. There is a resort right next door that you only see once you walk off the main path to your complex and out of all the foliage. There is a fence that separates the 2 resorts. The problem with this for us was if you were on that side of the resort(so if you are walking down main path from lobby, it's all the buildings on the right side), that resorts disco must have been right at that side meeting up as it's was rocking more then half the time we were there. So lots of thumping and music. I used ear plugs every night and we had the air conditioner going for white noise. We mentioned to the Nolitour rep and she said she's check with front desk and they would call next door before the next night, but really, what can they do - nothing. * A la cartes and times for restaurants. You only get 2 a la cartes free of charge. We didn't use our coupons for either, as they don't open till 7 pm and you cannot make reservations. First come first seated. and seating times at 7, 8 or 9. So that was too late with my daughter. And the main buffet didn't open till 6:30pm, which we found late as well. If I didn't have a child with, then perhaps not an issue, but we normally don't eat that late at home, and on vacation, my daughter is getting tired and we are going to eat supper. * Cigarette smoke! Everywhere. The Europeans smoke a lot. Amazing with all the knowledge and campains to quit, how much smoking was going on. So it was everywhere and I don't like that, nor for my daughter to be breathing in 2nd hand smoke everywhere we walked or sat. But it was only 1 week, so we ignored it or tried to sit away. There wasn't smoking in buffet, but at the grill seating outside, people were and that is gross when you are eating. They should have no smoking in more areas. A few other things to note: * There isn't too much walking required, however it is a stretch from the beach all the way back to lobby/main buffet/disco. We had a little stroller for my daughter to sit in for when she got tired. * There is only one interenet option. You pay $10 US for 50 minutes of internet time. Only 2 computers to use for all of resort. There is wifi in lobby for people that bring their laptop. * Check out is at noon. So if you don't leave till evening or later in day, your luggage sits in the lobby. There is no locked room or secure area. * Grounds of course are kept nice like most resorts. We did see a couple cockroaches......2 different days laying on the sidewalk to our building half dead. Thankfully we didn't see any again or in our room. The doors do have tight sweeps on the bottom, so they are sealed better then I though they would be. If not, I would have had a towel laid across the bottom. * Vacationers varied with french from paris, italian, canadian and americans. So a mix of people. Also heard some german spoken. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find the europeans to be rude or ignorant for the times we mixed in line with them, etc. There were some topless ladies tanning, which we expected with the mix of people. The tacky part of that is I saw one lady just get up and off to bar or bathroom, and not cover up. I mean each to their own, but have some class. * Spa servies are expensive for the alloted time you would get for a massage say. Just not reasonable at all. * The gift shop has tons of medicine type products, along with toiletries. So if you need something or forgot something, they have it. Prices didn't seem too bad. All in all we had a nice time. The resort is nice and we did enjoy our stay. I gave a 3 star as I don't believe this resort should be rated 4 star until they update all the rooms. There are only 2 buildings that are upgraded from what I understand. Otherwise, all others are still old and not renovated. The reasons I would not go back is because of the rooms, bugs and because of lack of kiddie stuff.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del Carmen, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cFor me this is 4 Star resort on an amazing beach\u201d", "Author": "kamigrace", "ReviewID": "UR59339310", "Content": "My 1st concern in a beach vacation is \" the beach\" .

The beach is breathtaking, the service is great, and the food is amazing. Americans comprised maybe 20% of the patrons. It was mostly Mexicans, French, Dutch, and German.

From reading other reviews, this seems like the way to go. The room was simply arranged, spacious, and immaculately clean. In a place like this, you aren't going to be sitting in the room all day, and this is reflected in the design of the place. Minimalist, and clean. The bed was extremely firm, but I kinda like that, so no complaints there. TV was mostly in spanish, so couch potatoes BEWARE. Most of the food is buffet-style eating, but don't let that throw you.

At dinner times, there were several sit-down restaurants that opened, but you need a special voucher to be admitted. These are given to you at check-in, so don't toss the packet they give you. Everyone, from front-desk people to servers to janitors, was super friendly and accommodating. Many were fluent in English, and many others spoke French. I would recommend knowing a little Spanish. I would not call the service slow, but I would call them relaxed. But hey, so were we, so awesom DRINKING WATER. There is a minifridge in the room, stocked with bottled water, soda and beer everyday. You can brush your teeth with the tap water, no worries. I would recommend this place to anyone, and we can't wait to get back ourselves!", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "north bay, ontario", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth!!\u201d", "Author": "belzie", "ReviewID": "UR58690705", "Content": "We stayed at Catalonia the week of Feb 26th. It was our first trip to the Mayan and we were thrilled by this Hotel. We have 2 priorities when looking for a resort. 1) beach and 2) food. This resort had a 5 star rating from my husband and me. The beach was private, clean and breathtakingly beautiful. The food was excellent with enough variety for even the pickiest eater. The a la carte restaurants(3) were like eating in a fancy restaurant. We were never disappointed. The rooms were basic but very clean. Our AC worked well and we had a ceiling fan which we used every night. The AC turns off if you open your patio doors. Which we often did just to hear the wind through the palms. We used the free shuttle to go into Playa Del Carmen. Don't forget to reserve your seat the day before to ensure your seat. We never had to wait , or search for a beach or pool chair. There are plenty of spots in sun or shade. We loved the hammocks as we had our siesta listening to the surf every day. Heaven! There was quite a few families when we were there but the kids never bothered us and there was lots for them to do. The night life is terrible at the resort so if you are a partier at night this maybe not be for you. There is nightly entertainment but it is pretty amature-ish . We are all about the tropical mornings with sun rise and coffee on the beach. The bar is open 24hrs and we never went hungry. If I was to say something negative it would be that there is not a lot about the mexican culture on the resort. Not a lot of mexican music for sure. It would have been nice to hear their music on the resort so that when you hear it again you think of mexico. This resort is like a tropical sanctuary with lots of Jungle growth. There are these interesting animals called Koati's that come up to you looking for food. It's funny to watch them with people. Some complaints in other reviews were there was a lot of walking, but the walkway is so beautiful and manicured that that was part of the experience. We loved it. Anybody who has a hard time getting around may not enjoy that part. We ate anything and everything and had no illnesses from the food. All in all this resort was clean with immaculate grounds, excellent food and an amazing beach. Such a relaxing trip.

We chose the hotel based on the positive reviews, the location to the airport (15 or so minutes) and the price/deal at the time. I will also agree with the positive reviews and everything I read before we left seemed right on the money. The beach is really nice, plenty of chairs, nice sand, clear water, angel fish. There is a DJ/Lifeguard hut on the beach, so they play music which was nice. The pool is nice as well. 2 sides of it have walking/beach like entrances and they it has random depths throughout. Not as big as I thought, but very good for kids. They did also have a free scuba try which was fun (it was to try and get you to do it for real, but they were nice about it). We did have a priveledge room and those rooms are somewhat remodeled and next to the pool/beach/afternoon buffet/4 night time restaurants. The rooms are nice, only a shower though and the tile work needs updating (and prob will as they seem to be remodeling). There was also a separate priveledge concierge/check in. They provided us with a crib, there is a store that carries diapers and laundry service is available but is offsite (takes a day). The staff was very friendly, always smiling and saying 'hola'. They were also quick with any questions/concerns. They also have a nice entertainment team that tries to round people up for various activites like volleyball. The kids club was for 4-12 year olds and was good as well. The food was better than average. The only things I thought were subpar were the pizza and chicken nuggets. The main buffet near the lobby had a good assortment of items (pasta station, chicken/turkey/beef, mexican, pizza), while the buffett near the pool had lunchy items. I'm not a big buffet person but the turnover was pretty quick, so I tended to wait for a new batch of stuff and get it fresh. We ate at 3 of the 4 nightime restaurants, the italian, the steakhouse and the mexican. We didn't get to go to the seafood. The italian and the steakhouse were very good, the mexican ok. But the buffets had mexican dishes as well. There were alot of kids and families there, and the staff treated the kids great and there was never a hassle about getting food or drink etc. The adults get a wrist band and you are good to go. My wife and sister in law went to the spa and got a massage and gave it a thumbs up.

Our requirements are very limited: excellent beach, decent food and drink, clean room, friendly service. We don't really care about: how strong or top shelf the drinks are, the pool, gourmet-anything, English / no English speaking. I think we're pretty low maintenance. Between the 3 of us we can manage in French, toddler-level-Spanish, and excel at universal sign language. Our 2nd floor standard room 5000 bldg: clean, basic furnishings, good long vanity / sink area for 3 gals to swear at their hair simultaneously, desk, bench, drawers, large wall of hanging / shelving closet / safe area, bedside and wall lighting, ceiling fan, a/c worked fine, perfectly cleaned every day, large enough balcony with 3 chairs / side table. No coffee maker. Wireless, yes, no charge, slow. Fridge - sodas and water. We always found something good to eat at every meal. We also had a few bland / cold misfires, but overall we never went hungry. We had a couple of great dishes as well, so it all averaged out to \"good.\" I'm not a wine expert. 2 gals do drink wine, and they weren't overly enthusiastic. They still drank it, and said it improved after the 2nd glass :) Me - highlight - capuccino at beach bar was great. We ate at the main buffet for coffee / breaky, snack bar lunch, tried the crepes, and had 2 buffet dinners, 2 Med a la carte, and 2 dinners in Playa del Carmen. Pool - not a pool expert. Refreshing, different depths, areas for polo, kids, dipping. Most chairs seemed used by the afternoon. Both shade and sun areas. Spent grand total of 15 min there all week. BEACH - GORGEOUS, spent every waking minute. Lots of chairs and space. Not sure about space situation under the sun shelters. Sand - cool and soft. No rocky areas, gentle slope. Waves - had everything during the week - gentle waves / strong waves. Overall, yellow flags most days - we called them fun flag days. Service - yes, sporadic. Usually we just got our own from the beach / pool bar. Great walking beach either direction. Never felt crowded; choice action / games, or not. Beach entertainment staff - excellent - again, choice to participate or not, and they're very friendly about it. Volleyball, kayaks, sailing, all seen, but not done by us. Snorkeling - not by us, but tons of pretty white fish - no mask / fins required. Crowd - Italian, French, Canadian, Spanish, American - probably in that order? Loved the mix. Kids - yes, seniors yes. Majority somewhere in between. Kids don't bother us - we've all been through it and come out the other side. Drunk teenagers - probably, but again, we've been there. Drunk / obnoxious crowd - no. We averaged 11 pm most nights, and usually just an after dinner drink and a gab on our balcony. We popped in to the show one night for awhile. We weren't in a participating in stuff kind of vibe, just really wanted to spend time catching up with each other. Playa del Carmen - love it - been many times. We took the shuttle in 2 evenings for dinner and a stroll. Prefer to stay in town, but I've always wanted to see Maroma Beach, and the price was right for us. Recommend - yes, but only for the beach and if it was a bargain. Would not stay again. Prefer to stay in town, walk out the door and have many restaurants, cafes, and strolling options after dinner. I would say this was a good value for what we paid: 1200 CDN incl flt, taxes pp for 1 week. Booked within a month of travel, it was easy, stress free, and suited our needs for this type of trip.

We were not disappointed the room was clean and bright, the bathrooms could use some update but with x amount of showers and the weather its bound to deteriorate faster. It is very European at this resort. I never felt looked down upon like other reviews noted, but be prepared for smoking, topless bathing, and baby oil. Tipping is not required but welcomed. We didnt try the spa but overheard people saying they enjoyed it. Ok here are the basics about CPM. Food- restaurants were good, Mexican restaurant by far the best then the American followed by the. We ate at the Tapas it was decent not the best but no the worst. The buffet was good in my opinion, they had a large selection of food to fit the multicultural guest. Note: portions are meant for individuals so when you order an appetizer it is meant for one person. At the restaurants each person is allowed to order and appetizer, entree, and dessert. They have house red, white, and blush wines that are included but bottles of wine are extra. They have a crepe bar right next to the beach, it is to die for! Snack bar was ok your basic hamburger sandwich fare. The bar was great drinks were just right and served in actual cups not solo plastic. Beach- AMAZING, and beach drink service was quick and easy. Customer Service- This place was so helpful. It started to rain our first day on the trip and as I was rushing to find cover I dropped my wallet. I reported it to the staff and an hour later they showed up at my hotel room door with it. The English speaking staff is limited there but they speak enough to get you the basics. Travel Rep- they have a travel rep on site that can arrange any excursion Rooms- The beds were comfy, the showers were huge tall enough to fit my 6\"3 BF. We had internet access in the room but it was kind of slow. Our fridge was always restocked with soda,beer, and water. Grounds- The grounds here are immaculate, they do so much maintenance to keep this place looking good. Do not be disturbed by men with these huge leaf blower things that spray a gray smoke. Its to keep the bugs away because the hotel is set in a natural rain forest setting. Nightlife- We didn't go to the disco or shows, were just too tired after a long day in the sun.

The shrimp were overcooked and unpeeled with a heavy cream sauce over them. After biting into the shrimp in the shell the first time, then trying to peel the shrimp with my fork and knife... I just gave up and skipped it. My boyfriend had a really nice steak though. The steak restaurant was really good. The ribeye steaks are cut on the thin side, so order the steaks a little more underdone than you normally would. We didn't use the rest of our vouchers. We ate the rest of our meals in the buffet, which was usually really good. Not the best food ever, but better than expected.

It was a great vacation in both our opinions. We stayed at that hotel for one week. BEACH The beach was a 5/5, and that is an understatement. My dad read that it was the second nicest beach in the world. The sand was exeptionaly fine. No lack of chairs. Shaded areas and tons of area to get tanned with. the catamarang sailing was a blast for my dad, i also had a good time . The wind was perfect and the waves weren't excesive. FOOD The food was great. The buffet was really good. Many people on trip advisor critisize buffets, and i have to say that this buffet was great. They would change up the food (a little) and there was a pretty good selection. I would recommend not putting Everything you see on your plate just cause you want to try it.(your there for a few days) the food will come back every so often. Restaurants: All surprizingly great. We got 3 passes to go to the restaurants and i was delighted to eat there. I really felt like i was in a fancy restaurant. The food was great and the presentation polished everything. The only restaurant that we didn't go to was the Tapis ( extra 15$) unless your a priviliged guest. 4/5 ROOMS no complaintes. With tips every couple of days, your room will be decorated nicely, with towel designs+. Without tips, your room might have decorations, but everything is clean, no smell in pillows, no bed bugs. Beds slightly hard ( to my liking). Hot water, never a problem, Safe worked great. The room was perfect for my dad and I. there was a MINOR problem with the blinds, we could have had it fixed in 2 minutes but we fixed it oursleves. 5/5 SERVICE Excellent, accept slow with drink service at buffet in our experience, and the front desk doesnt know everything, so if you have a problem the animation team is there to help gladly. My only complaint is that there wasnt towels available at all times. If the fresh ones from your room(beach towels not shower towels) were used from earlier that day, the towel check was closed at certain hours. 4/5 POOL the hot tub is the same temperature as the pool, theres just bubbles. The pool is heated naturally and it was a good tempurature. Very nice looking though. 4/5 NIGHT LIFE the d,j was pretty bad, the replacement one was better. The d.j was actually Really bad. He would send crowds out of the disco. The shows, lip singing, but GREAT coreography. There was no night life because the disco couldnt sustain a crowd. I am 15 and i didnt like the night life(maybe because of my limited age). this resort is not a party resort. Free alchohol and there was never anyone too drunk. People got drunk but there was never a problem, no one too ubnocsious. 3/5 TOWN I had a fun time when i went to playa de carmen. The shopping was great, but be prepared to get bombarded with shouts\"hey come check out my store\"ect. Free shutle MAKE RESERVATIONS in the entrance to the hotel NOT LOBBY. The place where the guy stands to get you a taxi is where you make reservations to get a free ride to playa de carmen(25 minutes). Taxis wwere also available for 20$ one way trip. 5/5 Thats it, this hotel is great, my first all inclusive and i had a great time. I met some people from montreal(where i live) and i had a group of friends to hang out with. in all i would give this hotel a 9/10 the only thing that wasnt great was the night life.

I don't have anything to compare it to..which also means that I can give an honest first timers impression of the hotel and everything it has to offer. To make it easier, I will break it down into sections: Location: The hotel is located almost equal distance between Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. Perfect for planning excursions or taking a cab/shuttle into town. We planned many trips while in Mexico and took several cabs without any issues whatsoever. I am a small town girl and I felt perfectly safe roaming 5th Ave in Playa Del Carmen. When you first drive up to the hotel I will let you know that the road is VERY shady...turkey trail like almost...but it leads up to the most wonderful hidden gem out there. It was a decent drive from the airport..not more than 45 minutes and it was on highways with great views. Accomodations/Rooms: The hotel is all built openly and has a great feel when first arriving. Check in was a BREEZE and i was worried how this would go after reading some other reviews. The lobby had the entrances to the Disco, and theatre and also the 24hr bar was located here. The rooms are set up as little mini hotels along a common path. Our room was on the 3rd floor of \"Tulum\" building and was beautiful. Brand new marble tile bathroom, king size bed, LCD TV. It had a mini fridge that was always stocked and towels that were always clean. Amazing. Food: I am a person who has issues with all kinds of food in Canada normally, so i was VERY worried about what i was going to get here at the Catalonia. My family has a history of IBS and Colitis and i can tell you that I DID NOT HAVE ONE ISSUE WITH ANY FOOD!! The buffet was delicious and always had enough to eat and places to sit. Everyday had something different and I could have easily eaten here the entire time and been just fine with it. The ala cartes were also good. We tried the Mexican and Italian and were satisfied with the meal, although they are small portions. Beach: The beach is amazing. Very wide, covered with white sand that felt like flour. The water was crystal clear and when you stand about waist deep Angel fish swim all around you. It was the most breathtaking thing i have ever seen. It was quite busy most of the time, but I could always find enough loungers (there were 4 of us too). Pool: Tons of room around the pool with loungers. It was cold, but when it's 30+ outside it was nice and refreshing. Activities: I will let you know that this place has a large European population, and therefore as English speaking visitors, we had a HUGE language barrier with everyone at this resort from staff to other patrons. This made it very difficult to participate in the various beach and pool activities the Animation Crew put on. All i could do was beach volleyball. They go out of their way to explain everything in Spanish, Italian and French, but English is basically left out for the most part. If you are European or have a knowledge of any of these languages you will do awesome here. Entertainment: The theatre performances were BRUTAL. Not only because there was no portion in English..i dont think that would have helped. They did their best and did get some laughs..but i reccommend some drinks before hand. We did not go to the Disco. All of the bars were great and the drinks were strong so who can complain about that? Serivce: The cleaning ladies, wait staff, and land keepers work very hard for every peso they earn. Everything was kept immaculate from the restaurants, the rooms, pool, beach even the ashtrays on the path were always cleaned with an HC stamp. They do everything with a smile and always say \"ola\" when passing by. I commend them for all of the work they do at this resort for us to enjoy. And we didnt even have to tip the maid crazy to get great service. At the end of our stay we did our largest tipping. Overall this place was amazing. I literally cannot think of anything to complain about. The language barrier was frustrating at times, we just had to keep remembering that everyone is from different places but all trying to enjoy a vacation. The entertainment was horrible, but luckily with enough booze you can entertain yourselves. You can have as much or as little fun as you want, and every experience is what you make of it.

More like a 3 or less.\u201d", "Author": "globalgirl_7", "ReviewID": "UR57824910", "Content": "I'm truly surprised by all of the positive reviews for this resort on Tripadvisor - which one was of the reasons why I booked it. The photos they show you on the net and in travel brochures for this property are truly NOT accurate. They show you the renovated Privileged rooms and Honeymoon suite which you have to pay an upgrade to stay in. The standard room is more like a cell. The furniture is old, run down and the beds are like a sheet of plywood with a thin patio cushion like mattress. We arrived at the hotel at 2 am and our A/C rumbled and rattled so loud that you couldn't even hear the voice of the person in the bed next to you. My husband was so frustrated that he went to reception to see if we could switch rooms and they told us they would only know in the morning. So we had to go back at 8, then 9 and again at 10 and they said that a Privileged room would be made available that afternoon at an upgrade price of $50 pp per night. They actually contemplated charging us $50 addt'l. for each of our kids - who are only 3 and 5 yrs of age. This was ludicrous considering that the Nolitours brochure and their website claim that kids stay free! Finally they waived the fee for the children - gee thanks! Anyways, the upgraded room was renovated and much more pleasant however the bathroom was still old, damp and seriously run down. It's almost as though this resort started a few renovations and then stopped but still went ahead and advertised itself as a 4 star for the small number of rooms that it had updated. This is inaccurate and not a fair representation to the traveller. The beach however is beautiful and the food is good. The tapas bar and La Toscane are both really nice and tasty. They say the a la carte meals are unlimited however once you get there you have a specified number of meal tickets that you can use - 1 per restaurant. Note: The Tapas restaurant costs addt'l. $ if you order the seafood. We also used the spa services while we were there and the $ for what you get is lacking here too. They have this one poor esthetician braiding hair, doing manicures and pedicures, etc., so whatever time they give you as an appt. factor in it being delayed - in our case - by 2 hrs. Our 5pm appt. quickly became a 7pm appt. Not ideal. And the quality of the work is rushed - again, not the esthetician's fault but still worth mentioning. If you're looking for a very basic hotel, this one is fine, however don't be fooled into thinking that you're going to be staying at a 4 star. The rating needs to be adjusted until the renos are complete. If you still do decide to stay there please heed my warnings and spring for the Privilege upgrade or else you will most likely be disappointed. Buildings 6000 and 4000 are the two that have been renovated so push to stay in one of these. We also met a couple staying in the honeymoon suite which has a jacuzzi on the terrace and apparently their room was very nice as well, however with all of these upgrades, means additional $$$ so it might be best to just book another hotel. I know we would if given the chance to do it over again. They do however offer a free shuttle bus to and from Playa del Carmen - which saves you the $20 taxi ride. Oh and be forewarned that everyday at 6pm, the maintenance staff sprays the premises of the property for mosquitos. The product used smells so foul and the chemicals are so toxic that the person spraying wears a mask and protective gear, however the guests are left to their own defenses as the fumes envelope not only the lobby lounge but also the open air buffet - imagine all of those chemicals settling on the food and dishes you're about to eat! It's ridiculous. You literally see all of the hotel guests covering their mouths and faces with scarves and towels as he goes by. It's really quite disturbing. And even despite this toxic ritual spraying there are still a number of mosquitos on site! I would recommend bringing some insect repellent - especailly if you have kids. Another point worth mentioning, especially if booking with Nolitours - the destination representatives are not helpful. They are merely there to sell their excursions - even though they say they're not. When we asked for help with our room issues and luggage lock-up, she just dismissed us saying \"Sorry that's standard - it's like that everywhere.\" We dealt with all of our issues ourself. I disagree with her remark that this is standard practice. I've been to Caribbean at least 7 times in the past and never had these issues - I even stayed at resorts with a lower rating and was more satisfied than this. In the past, we had either arranged the booking ourselves or used TMR - Les Tours Mont Royal and even on site, the destination reps were much more helpful. Sadly, this young woman was useless unless you wanted to book a day trip on one of her tours. Also, if given the chance and you purchase this hotel as a package with Canjet airlines, try to also find out if another airline is available. Canjet was awful - no comfort, no frills and an apple, ham & cheese on a hard bun for the meal. Just say no to their meal - a total waste. Also, even though our flight was at 2 am that on the night of departure and checkout was before noon, the hotel does not offer a locked room to store the luggage. Instead all bags must be left in plain view at the main entrance. Nothing was stolen - but food for thought in case you do have valuables.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBetter than we expected\u201d", "Author": "mo32", "ReviewID": "UR57650076", "Content": "Catalonia Playa Maroma, Feb. 2010 We stayed 12 nights, returning on Feb. 28. The resort was pretty much as we expected from reading reviews here on TA. We booked this resort because of the great comments about the beach and I do have to say that the beach and water here was the best we\u2019ve encountered in this area of Mexico. The beach is flat, with soft, white sand. The water is clear, the bottom smooth, no sudden drops, and even on the windiest of days, it was easy to enter and exit the water. Plenty of room to walk in either direction and wide enough so you didn\u2019t feel too crowded even when the beach was packed on some days. I'll get the \"bad\" out of the way first. We booked a privileged room to insure a coffee maker and mini fridge. We knew even some of the remodeled rooms did not have updated bathrooms, but (and here is my main complaint), the ceiling over the shower had a large amount of black mold in one section. I just felt there was no excuse for that. I suppose we could have protested and asked for a room change, but I honestly did not notice the mold the first day due to extreme travel fatigue, so by the time I did see it, I had already unpacked and had everything put in place. We asked that the ceiling be cleaned and someone did come to do it, but within a few days, it was coming back again. As everyone here states, you\u2019re not in your room that long, so we decided to just put up with it and figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt us for the short time we\u2019d be there. I do not understand why they went through the trouble of remodeling the room without updating the bathroom at the same time. So take a look at the bathroom ceiling before you settle on your room. We had a few other maintenance issues, but all were quickly taken care of. The A/C was not working, even though the patio door was shut, it wouldn\u2019t lock, so that may have had something to do with it. Someone came to fix that the first day. A few light bulbs burned out after a few days, and that was also taken care of. The other problem I found was very poor lighting in the room. Even with all the lights on and the patio door curtains pulled back, it was a little dark in the room and very hard to see at night if you like to read. They had little lights on flexible fixtures on each side of the bed, but it had a beam the size of a penlight, lol, so that really didn\u2019t help unless you could aim it exactly on what you were reading. So, other than these little things and the bad weather (I realize no fault of the resort), everything else was great. You arrive to an open air lobby which has a brick path leading down to the beach. Three buildings on each side of this path have the rooms. We were in 6111, the back side of the one closest to the beach, first floor. There really were no ocean view rooms here, but they did have suites ocean front. We were told the 2nd floor suite would be $95 more a day on top of what we paid for a privileged room and the first floor would have been $125 more. Did not seem worth it to me. It was a long walk from our room to the lobby and buffet, but if you\u2019ve ever been to the Iberostar properties in Playa Parisio, this walk was nothing. Between buildings 5 and 6 is a small shopping area. There was a jewelry store, hairdresser, convenience store, clothing boutique, coffee/liquor store, Catalonia\u2019s brand clothing store, the gym, the spa and a photography studio where you could purchase the photos they take of everyone, everywhere, all day long. Just past this area is the kids\u2019 club, the pool, the towel hut, and then a little further on to the right, the three a la carte restaurants with the center one serving as a lunch buffet area. After all that, the beach. There are rows of shaded areas covering the chairs, but most people pulled them down towards the water. It wasn\u2019t hot here this trip, and we had a lot of wind during our stay, so we really didn\u2019t\u2019 need the shaded areas. Although there were more clouds than sun, even with sunscreen, we still managed to get a decent tan so no one back here really believes us when we told them how cold it was. They had plenty of activities for adults as well as children down at the beach. A lot of resorts we\u2019ve been to have most of their activities by the pool and since we stay on the beach, it was a nice change to be able to watch everyone having so much fun. It was also nice that they had some activities that allowed adults and children to participate in together. There was one waiter for the entire beach area. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he was very efficient and very friendly. We always tip and my husband always has to ask if they are allowed to keep their tips. This man said they had to share them, but he said this with a smile, \u201cshare them with our friends\u201d and then he added that we didn\u2018t have to tip at all because it is \u201call included\u201c. We assured him he deserved it and we didn\u2019t mind at all. What else can I tell you? The safety deposit box is new, digital, and is bolted down (read somewhere here that one resort just had them sitting on a shelf). Internet free in rooms, but of course not needed in our case. The mini bar service in the privileged rooms had water, beer and soda. I requested more beer and less soda, request granted. For anyone bringing your own coffee supplies, they have a 4 cup coffee maker that uses cone shaped filters. I had the round ones which usually can be folded to make do, but for some reason this coffee pot kept clogging with them, so we started using their coffee, and it wasn\u2019t bad. They leave two bags of coffee and two bags of accompaniments each day. They supplied soap, shower gel, body lotion and shampoo. Plenty of towels and the beach towels were also in the room upon arrival, no towel cards. Around 8:30pm, someone would knock to see if you needed water or anything else. A few nights we also had turn down service, but I guess that depends on what time you come and go to eat and if someone is in the vicinity while you are gone. Of course anything you need extra or didn\u2019t get, a call to the lobby and they\u2019d bring it to you. This was one of the most accommodating resorts we\u2019ve been to when it comes to things like this. You usually have to wait forever or no one shows up at all when you call for something. Activities (of which we took no part, lol): archery, tennis, kayaks, ping pong, and catamarans. We did play pool. Only one table and no chalk, so if you\u2019re a real pool player, throw some in your luggage. Nightly entertainment at 9:30pm (again, sorry, never made it to one show). I think it would be nice if they had some type of live entertainment in the lobby somewhere between 6 and 9:30 for those of us who can\u2019t stay awake any later, lol. One thing that did surprise me, because I didn\u2019t see it mentioned here, the rooms are all supposed to be no smoking. When we booked, through Expedia, their website said smoking or non-smoking rooms. We requested a smoking room (sorry for those that offends). When we got to our building a sign said non smoking. I asked the bellboy and he said you can smoke. I called the lobby for ashtrays and they said they\u2019d send some down. They never did. I mentioned it to the woman in the Privileged reception office and she said there was no smoking in any of the rooms, but obviously they don\u2019t enforce it. I don\u2019t think that is quite right for those of you who don\u2019t smoke, and it\u2019s not right for us that do to feel we booked a place that allows smoking and then find out you shouldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a big deal, but just wanted to give you a heads up in case you have a problem. Sorry, this got longer than I intended and I may have repeated a lot you already know. I think you will be pleased with this resort if you aren\u2019t expecting new and up to date accommodations. Cleanliness and good customer service far outweighs that in my opinion.

First, I'll say people who are staying at this resort as their first stay in this area are probably much less critical than we are. We've stayed in others that far surpass this one. Second, as I understand it they recently bought this resort and are making changes/renovations so perhaps it will get better. First thing we noticed was the front desk staff didn't seem very cordial or accomodating. We went there several times for different things and never got the impression they wanted to really help. An example of this is; we were in an older room that hasn't been remodeled. It was really rough (I'll get back to that). We were told by many people they have rooms that are remodeled and very nice. We were very interested to see one, even if it was in the process of being cleaned. We've not looking for the cleanliness of the rooms...after being there for a week we know how well they clean. If it were me I'd have ensured we saw a room. After all, we're not someone on the phone or internet who is just window shopping. We flew 8 hours and just spent a week in your resort...we're looking to see if the other rooms would be more to our liking for our next visit....definitely not window shopping. The next thing I had an issue was is that this is a predominately European (French) crowd. Initially I thought it would be great. We'd get some cultural diversity, expand our horizons and all that. The sidewalks are about 8 feet wide with vegetation right at the edge, as in jungle that is quite thick. American/Canadians seem to have a natural tendancy to move to the right and temporarily get in single file if necessary as people approach. The French don't. Initially I thought maybe it was just that they drive on the left so we moved to the other side. Didn't make a difference. They approach you and take up the whole sidewalk as if you aren't there. At first it seems comical but I can say after a week of being run off the sidewalks it starts to grate, and I'm a very easy going guy. I can also say other North Americans noticed this and it bothered them. We spoke with many people while there and many of them mentioned this. We were never the first to mention it and almost everyone we talked to mentioned how irritatingly rude the French are. I didn't even know they are considered a rude people before going here. The food seems to cater quite a bit to the European crowd also. A lot of bread and pastas. Not a big deal as the food is all good and there is plenty just not the abundance of meats we might be used to. While I'm on the food, I really liked that they have a smaller lunch buffet down by the water. Made it handy if you wanted a quick bit then back to the beach. Usually you are humping it back and forth between the beach, your room, and food. Another small issue with the foreign crowd is the resort staff have to say everything in four languages (Spanish, French, Italian, English)....makes the shows and such 'interesting' as they have to keep saying the same thing over and over. I don't know French but, unless it is a very chatty language, that is what they cater to. They would speak French for a minute or so then the English translation would be a quick sentence or two. All the jokes and adlibs they add to the show are only done in French. Either that or the French think almost anything spoken in a show is hilarious. Also, although it isn't their fault, the staffs English is about as good as most English people trying to speak Spanish. Often they would be half way through the English version before you realized they had moved on to English. I've noticed the same thing with other resorts when it is just Spanish and English. It's just further complicated here with the two additional languages. The beach-as I'm sure everyone mentions it is beautiful and very clean. The food- as I mentioned before, very adequate but it did seem that they cater to a different diet. Desserts are great. The resturants were very good. The Mexican one is awesome and the staff were great. They don't do reservations which I would recommend. You stand in line for 30 minutes waiting to get in (although they offer free drinks right there). They take people in one at a time. If you aren't the first group in you can wait an hour and a half to get in. They've always done day/time reservations at others and I didn't really care for that. I have a new appreciation for it. The staff-again, as previously mentioned the front desk staff seemed put off when we approached them. However, the beach and entertainment staff are the best I've seen. They really go out of their way to engage you in activities and talk to you. Several even remembered us from previous activities, events and discussions. Not a small task given the resort was overbooked. The room-This was our biggest issue. It was very very very old and used. Envision something you would expect if you were staying in 'old Mexico' not a resort. Mold in the bathroom. The step over area going into the shower looked like a piece of concrete that was about 20 years old and has had heavy chains drug over it every day. Tile work looked like someone let their 10 year old caulk it with putty, as in they just pushed it in by hand and didn't 'finish' it. The room smelled horrible. Every time you walk in you got hit by it. Our room was about 80 feet from the open air entertainment stage of the resort next door. Every night, until about 10:30 we could hear the concert, show, movie...whatever was playing. I don't mean just hear it a little. It was very very very loud with massive bass. If you go there definitely don't stay on the side next to the Secrets resort. Almost every morning we got woken up at 6am by the French family next door with thier 4 kids. Again, not trying to bag on the French but I can tell you I don't let my kids scream and yell and carry on at 6am in any hotel. And it wasn't just the kids. It didn't help that the 'bathroom fan' is just a 6x6 inch grate between ajoining bathrooms. We finally realized this and kept the bathroom door closed. It helped some but we still found ourselves woken up at 6am on most days. As the room was our biggest issue this is why we wanted to see another. Drinks-about the same as others we've stayed at. We've learned to stop at the duty free shop in the airport on our way in. Spend $10 and get a bottle of rum. Empty the water bottle in your room and fill it with rum. Then you add it to your drink to suit your taste. Saves you the hassle of trying to get a drink with any kick. Consider their drinks as mixers without the alcohol. We're not big drinkers but were surprised our first time to Mexico when we were drinking mixed drinks all day with zero effect (all that food doesn't help :) ). So, all in all. We'd have felt alot better about recommending this if we could have seen one of the finished rooms. Although we don't spend a lot of time in our room the smell and condition of it really put us off every time we opened the door. The food was very adequate. The French were unbelievable rude. I'll stick with getting my 'cultural diversity' from the very freindly locals at other locations.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood, but not Great.\u201d", "Author": "Toronto1187", "ReviewID": "UR57354975", "Content": "This was the only resort we could getat the very last minute in the Riviera Maya, so read a few reviews and decided to take a risk and just go. Our first impression of the hotel was that the lounge/reception area was very pretty, and clean. We were greeted somewhat warmly by the front desk, and check in was fast. We were given a room in the 1500 building which is not renovated. The room was subpar. Beyond basic. It was old, and though spotlessly clean, it was a dissapointment. The furniture is stained with age, and the bathroom is tiny. The shower has no doors and so the floor got soaked everytime you showered. Anyhow, we weren't planning on staying in the room all day so we got over it. The rest of the hotel is nice enough. Some areas are really pretty, and some need a facelift. But as I said before, the hotel is very clean and the grounds are well maintained, they just need some renovations here and there to make it nicer. The positives of this hotel are first and foremost the beach. The beach is beautiful! White, fluffy sand that streches forever, the water is clear and warm, no rocks or seeweed on the bottom of the sea. It was fantastic. There is a guy that cleans the beach all they long, sifting through it for cigarrete butts, and other garbage that people leave behind. There is also a waiter that will come to you while you are on the beach and bring you anything you want from the bar. There are really nice white fish that venture pretty close shore and you can feed the tortillas while u snorkel and they will swarm you. The weather while we were there was ok. We had quite a few windy days, and it would be cloudy/sunny all day. but, afer 1 or 2pm max you had to leave the beach because it got too chilly. The food at the hotel is good. They have 3 a la cartes, for which you don't need reservations for any of them, which was good. We only ate at the grill and mexican one, both of which were good. The mexican was the best though. The buffet is good. They always had some type of fish, chicken and beef, some mexican food, veggies, lots of fruit and delicious desserts! There was a pasta station, and fresh made pizza both at lunch and dinner. At breakfast there was always an egg station, and fresh made bread. Plus lots of fruits and a variety of freshly made juices and milkshakes. We never went hungry, although we both had very specific diets to follow. (gluten/dairy free) The resort also has a Creperie by the beach and a Snack bar, both of which we never ate at. We were there for Valentine's day and the hotel set up a giant seafood station and lots of chocolate and mousse desserts for the occasion,they also roasted a turkey and made gave us champagne. The staff at the hotel are all very nice. Everybody greets you \"hola\" when u walk by them, and all are more than happy to help you, tip or no tip. Though tipping is appreciated :) The waitstaff at both the a la carte's and buffet were all great, attentive and super friendly. They remembered us and always treated us warmly and stopped to chat with us. The bartenders are also all very nice and friendly, as is the entertainment staff who work very hard all they too keep everyone happy. The shows at night are the same as every other hotel, which is to say they aren't great, but once agian, these people work very hard all day and are not profesionally trained dancers, so we were't expecting much besides the usual cheesy musicals. This hotel not only caters to Canadians or Americans, but to lots of Europeans and some South Americans as well. There is lots of diversity and it is nice to meet people from other cultures. We never had a problem with any of the other tourists and founfd everyone to be very pleasant. There is a free shuttle that takes u to Playa del Carmen, which is 30 min away. It makes to trips, 10am-5pm, and 7-11pm. Playa is fun, thoigh the prices are all extremely jacked up. You can bargain with them, and we left with some great silver jewlery and good tequila. We also ate at a restaurant called \"Ajua Maya\" which the Nolitours rep at the resort recomended. It was great. the food is delicious, the portions big, there is live music and the waitstaff will bring you your drinks on their head! All in all, it was a memorable evening. We also rented a car from Thrifty at Playa ($55 a day) bought a map, and drove all the way to Merida, stopping on the way to see Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba, Valladolid, Progresso and finally Merida. Mexico is a beautiful country with lots to see, and beautiful people. We felt safe the entire time and never encountered a problem or found ourselves ina shady situation. On the drive there we also stopped by a Cenote, which is an underground freshwater cave in which you can snorkel. Most attractions cost between ( $5 - $20 ) for the entrance and were all well worth it.

Very nice! We did eat and the food was great. They expedited our check-in, were very swift and we were on our way to our room in no time. We were in the 6000 block, privilege rooms, right near the beach. The room was ground floor, which at first I wasn't thrilled about, but when I saw how wonderful it was the next day in the sun I was happy! The rooms are spacious and exceptionally clean. The bed was firm, but it's Mexico! If they were plush and soft I imagine they'd mold and rot in no time, so firm is fine. We had plenty of pillows. My only complaint was the blanket was thin, and since we were there in winter I got a little chilled and a thicker blanket would have been great. Not a big deal. The television was nice, as was the sofa, desk, bedside lamps and sink/vanity. Our bathroom could have used a little work in comparison to the room, but how much time are you really spending in there? Who cares. Shower had great pressure and the water got really hot, a definite plus. The beach was amazing!!! Sand so soft it felt like flour, and being it's so light in color it never got hot. Even when we were lying there, baking in the sun, the sand still felt cool. The ocean is a beautiful shade of turquoise and is never very rough. One day right before a storm it got rough and that made it very fun to play in. We had a ball playing in the waves. Not a lot of sea life or animals, which is nice for swimming. Just some angel fish, which were harmless and not always visible. The food was outstanding. This was one area I was particularly worried about. I'm not picky, but I am particular, if that makes sense. I'll try anything once or twice, and am not fussy, but I'm not the type who likes any food I put into my mouth. This place did not disappoint. Everything we ate was fantastic, especially at the buffet. Usually buffet-style food is similar to airplane food, but this place is the exception. Fresh fruit at every meal, authentic Mexican food at every meal, the option for salad at every meal, and plenty of healthy options. I'm really going to miss having all of those options to choose from, every day, 3 times a day. The waitstaff really tries hard to make sure you have everything you need from start to end. The service we experienced in the buffet and restaurant (Tio Pedro) was outstanding. Manuel, a buffet waiter, was exceptional. THANKS! The bar/lounge/reception area was fun. We sat at the little bistro tables and enjoyed a hot cappuccino at least once a day. Isabela's service was fantastic. We met other fun people in that area, and it was great to chat a bit. Fridays the live band is there and they are pretty good! We enjoyed sitting there on our last night, listening to familiar songs. We used the wi-fi here a lot, but also had wi-fi available in our room. This feature was great to have, being the kids were back home. We could check in with them for free, no phone needed! My husband enjoyed a few games of beach volleyball and beach soccer, and we were offered all sorts of other activities from work-outs to Spanish lessons. They offer these things to you, but don't pester you if you choose not to join in, which was nice for me because all I wanted to do was relax. We didn't step foot in the pool one time. We didn't need to with the beautiful ocean/beach at the Catalonia. The free shuttle into Playa was convenient and a great perk. The bus was climate controlled and comfortable. Beware though: be prompt or you'll be taking a taxi back! When they say the bus leaves Playa at 11:00pm, they are not kidding. At 11 on the nose we took off. We found we were able to sign up the same day, signing up in the morning for the evening shuttle. May not always be the case, but it was ok for us. Our luggage had been delayed, and the manager Tomas was great about helping my husband call the airport to find out what was going on. He is multi-lingual (Spanish, Italian, French and English) so having him around to help interact with patrons is a definite plus. He was able to effectively speak Spanish with the people at the airport and then relay (in English )what they had said. On the shuttle to Playa he gave the instructions 4 times in English, Spanish, Italian and French to ensure everyone knew when pick up was and where. How's that for service? Everyone here is friendly and works very hard. I believe your experience is what you make of it. Their job here is not to pamper or serve you individually, but to do their best to make your vacation just that: a vacation. And they do it all with a smile on their face. Never did we encounter someone asking for a tip or even hinting towards it (although we did tip). The people were wonderful and we credit their hard work and hospitality with our vacation being so wonderful and memorable. If you expect more than this, stay at one of those ridiculously over-priced places where the staff expects their guests to be self-important and pains in the backside. This place is great for anyone: old or young, families, couples, singles. If you're looking to go to Mexico for a great vacation, you will not be disappointed.

Included Premium Room, Tub on the Deck, 3 housekeeping services daily, Pillow top bed, newer TV, Terry Cloth robes, Mini Bar restocked daily, Romantic Dinner, Massage, Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, Picture taken by the photography crew, HM Tshirts. Basically, we had a love fest and it all renewed the woo! Other Guests OK we have enough friends in the real world, so we weren\u2019t coming to Mexico to make a bunch of new friends. I did find the other guests to be respectful and never encountered any mistreatment from any other cultures. Honestly, you need to get out more if you can\u2019t handle the Europeans. Beach This is a beautiful beach; the sand is like a fine powder so when the wind kicks up you can still handle it. I spent a lot of time beach hunting and I would rate this in my top 10 of beaches (Whit Sundays & Cable Beach rank 1 & 2) There is a large amount of Beach Loungers to choose from, so it\u2019s not necessary to pick you chair at 8am, there was never more tanners than chairs. We spent about 89% of our time at the beach, even on the windy days, and we miss every moment. The swimming area is great here to, there are no rocks or anything to hurt the feet, some days the waves were perfect for body surfing and other days you could just float with the fishes. It was great that you could walk right in and not have to deal with a large drop off, so get your shoulders in and enjoy. Snorkeling, there is none right off the beach, I would suggest walking south for about 15mins and there seems to be some snorkeling areas that way. To be honest I am happy that there was no snorkeling in the swimming area; we didn\u2019t have to worry about getting a fin to the face. There are little fishes in the swimming area, they are harmless and love to be fed a little bread. Bars I get the feeling that this hotel understand that it doesn\u2019t want stupid amounts of drunken idiots running around. They don\u2019t over pour and there isn\u2019t an obscene amount of bars available. Personally it made me happy not to see a large amount of drunks, and not having a swim up bar is great\u2026.not peeing in the pool is even better. The lobby bar, has live music in the evenings and we noticed this is where the smokers hang out. Fine by us, as we don\u2019t smoke so we headed to the other end of the resort. We didn\u2019t go to the evening activities or the Disco. Food Was really great, I would say 97% of our meals were awesome. My husband was full for the first time in his life. Main Buffet Breakfast \u2013 Fresh breads, juices, fruit, and pastries available daily. There is an egg station where you can get eggs any style done up. I hear the omelets were very tasty. Always bacon or sausage, hash browns and an assorted supply of Mexican yummies along with cold cuts, cereals and hot chocolate. Lunch & Dinner \u2013 Excellent selection of salads, fresh fruits, fish, meats (turkey = OMG so good, Veal, Roast Chicken, Roasted Ham etc), again cold cuts, and fresh soup X 4 daily, there is also a Pasta and Pizza station. I really loved the olive oil station, so much to pick from. There are great deserts and the staff is constantly tiding and replacing the food selections. Breakfast Lunch serving all stars = Rodrigo & Roberto, by day 2 they knew are names and what we liked to drink. Caf\u00e9 con Leche is great and they serve the milk warm. Al a Carte Restaurants There are 4 \u2013 Mediterranean, La Tortuga (grill), Tio Pedro (mexican), and The Terrace restaurant (extra $50 for Lobster meal). We ate all 4 restuarnts and out of 14 nights we had 8 nights in these restaurants. No reservations needed, but they have 2 sittings as they get busy fast \u2013 7pm and 8:30pm Mediterranean \u2013 Great ambience and the Service was incredible. I would recommend the Gnocchi for the pasta selection. Grill Restaurant \u2013 Meh, we went twice as we think second chances are important, we were sadly disappointed. Don\u2019t get the pork ribs \u2013 very fatty. I would recommend the Caesar salad con pollo (hold the anchovy sauce), the steak wasn\u2019t so bad. The service was terrible tho, and it\u2019s outdoor seating so sometimes you get to eat other peoples blowing cigarette smoke. Tio Pedro \u2013 Our fave\u2026.by far! The Service was great, thanks to Sara the hostess, she was great. Highly recommend the soups \u2013 especially the lime, and for entr\u00e9e the Shrimp with tequila reduction, very very good. They make such to give you lots of chips and 3 choices of Salsa \u2013 Salsa Verde is great at this hotel. The Terrace \u2013 We had our Romantica dinner here (included in our HM upgrade), we had the beef choice. This was so incredible and romantic as it\u2019s a terrace overlooking the beach. The dinner was so great\u2026I could not believe the quality of the salad and main course. The meat was the best we\u2019ve eaten in a long time (we are from AB and have a bbq) they serve 2 large fillet pcs to both of us; we are still talking about the great steak. Staff/Service I admit I\u2019m a huge snob when it comes to service, as I work in the hospitality industry and have very high expectations. I also believe you receive what you give, so it\u2019s important that you learn a couple of Spanish phrases, this way you will be able to communicate with all levels of staff. If you can\u2019t learn to say hello, goodbye, excuse me, good morning, evening\u2026.then you are stupid and should be spanked from not learning some of the language. They service here is impeccable, the Front Desk staff \u2013 mainly Ali, and that Cheeky Roberto are really great. They helped us so much and from what I gather there is an excellent level of communication amongst the FD staff, as we had a couple of requests and everyone was able to help us, even when the Agents we were dealing with went off shift. All the staff, say hello to you from the busboys to the managers, and I think that it\u2019s a gift that this happens. You can see they are proud of the property. Also there are 4 languages spoken at the Hotel \u2013 Spanish, Italian, French and English. For the most part all are spoken well, and the staff do their utmost to understand your needs. Grounds Constantly being taken care of, there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of flowers as it is winter at the moment. However, the grounds are impeccable and the jungle feel of the area is so cozy. I loved the bushes of butterflies and of course the cute Coati\u2019s~! Tours & Trips We\u2019ve both been to Mexico several times, so we didn\u2019t do any tours. We did take advantage of the free shuttle to Playa one day. However, we stayed mostly at the resort as we came for the beach time. Wrist bands. Green/Orange/Yellow/Grey We started as Green \u2013 We got great service, and no one ignored us. We were placed in a basic room in the 5000 block, close to the beach. The bed was fine, and if you\u2019ve stayed at other resorts in Mexico you\u2019ll know sometimes you feel like you are sleeping on a concrete slab\u2026.you take a look and guess what you are! This bed was not bad at all; again we might have been so tired from all the sun, sand and fun. We upgraded to the HM package and became a grey wrist band. No change in any service, we did get 10% off on a massage package tho. There is Kite Surfing available at the Dive shop - About $600USD for 6 hours, totally worth it!", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cService, Service, Service!!!\u201d", "Author": "lvsvacations", "ReviewID": "UR54958270", "Content": "We just returned from our 7 night stay at the Catalonia Playa Maroma! I had shopped resorts and pricing very hard before we left. My one major requirement: No sand bags on the beach. I've noticed many resorts in this area of Mexico have ugly sand bags which I did not want to be looking at while enjoying a day on the beach. Maroma Beach is rated one of the top 10 beaches in the worlds, and I can see why. It was beautiful! Although it was a red flag for swimming every day we still ventured in for some swimming. How can you not? It's so warm! A little upsetting we weren't able to snorkel right from the resort, but I'd imagine with that rough surf it wouldn't matter which resort you stayed at. The resort is about 30 minutes from the airport on a very direct route. We had booked a privelaged room and was whisked away as soon as we arrived to a special check in location. They took care of our luggage as well. We were brought to our room in the 6000 block, which other reviews have commented are closest to the beach, pool, and a la carte restaurants (Italian, Mexican, Steak house, & during the day the snack bar). The buffet restaurant that served breakfast, lunch, and dinner was all the way at the other end of the resort. The walk wasn't too bad though, and the grounds were beautiful. I loved spotting the wildlife along the way. I'm not sure how we would have felt if we were in rooms that were at the opposite end of the resort, because our room was so close to the beach it was easy access if we needed to get back to our room. The food here was awesome! We made an entire lunch every day out of what they considered to be a \"snack bar\". Their snack bar was a serve yourself of hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos and all the fixings to go with it, grilled chicken, french fries, pizza, chicken nuggests, cold cuts, etc. The serve yourself beer and wine was also a plus! You could sit down and enjour your \"snack\" or take it with you. If you chose to sit and eat it was full linen and staff waiting on you. Order drinks, etc. Anything you wanted they brought to you! That goes along with the entire resort. The staff is so awesome!! Everyone you pass says hello and everyone is willing to help. The drink service on the beach brought by Enrique was certainly over a plus. We tipped and asked him to bring two drinks at a time. He thought this was funny and had no problem doing so. I did take not that service was equal for those who tipped and those who did not, which is comforting since the tipping is included in the price of your stay. The rooms were nice. I'd say the bathroom toilet/shower area could have used an upgrade but it was clean and that's all that matters.Speaking of clean, room service came in the morning, and then mini bar service came in the afternoon. Then at about 10pm our first night we got a knock on the door for \"towel service\". We thought it was sort of strange, but come to find out this was turn down service. They would turn down the bed and refresh your towels. How great is it to have fresh towels in the morning AND and night? We never had to ask housekeeping for anything. Water, towels, soda, and beer were always replenished without asking. We tried all of the restaurants. We didn't really care for the Italian one, but really loved the Steak House. Also, Mexican night at the buffett was awesome. If you are expecting your \"American\" mexican food of nachos and such, you won't find them here. This is authentic Mexican food! Plus there is always pasta, pizza, cold cuts, breads, etc for those who don't want to try something new. I can't imagine not being able to find something to eat at this resort. Take advantage of the free shuttle service to Playa Del Carmen. You need to make a reservation the day prior though. The morning shuttle leaves at 10am and returns at 5 to pick you up. We didn't think we'd want to stay that long, but we ended up enjoying it so much we stayed until 5pm. The shuttle bus is a touring bus with a bathroom. Grab a frozen margarita for your ride home, sit back and enjoy! At the advice of another TA review we stopped that Tequilla Town. Largest selection of tequilla and the beers are only $1.00 USD!!! Even if you aren't a huge tequilla fan they have something you will like. I tried the chocolate tequilla....yummy!!! All samples are free! We also took a tour through Best Day Travel to Tulum. It was a small tour of 12 people which was nice because the tour guide was able to get to know each of us and we were able to hear everything he had to say. A beautiful site to see if it's your first time to Mexico. We liked that the tour didn't take up our entire day and we still had beach time later in the afternoon. I'm very happy we made the choice to stay at this resort. Our travel agent warned us this wasn't the 5 star she typically books, but I'd say the service and food was 5 star all the way. The hotel was clean, staff friendly, and plenty of great food to choose from. Can you ask for anything more? We are considering going back and would stay here or at another Catalonia property.

We were not disappointed. As everyone says, the beach is to die for. The resort - no so much. The food was great - although it was quite a trek to get to the breakfast and lunch buffet restaurant. As others have said, there is a lunch buffet close to the beach/pool, but it is truly sub-standard. We go to Mexico for the beach/pool/sun, so it's not reasonable to expect that we would take a 2 hour lunch to walk 10-15 minutes just to eat lunch and then back again. So we made do with guacamole and chips or a dried out hamburger for lunch near the pool. Not a big deal, considering how beautiful the beach is. As far as the rest of the restaurants go, the food is great for an all inclusive. There is also a creparie by the pool, it's not great - but it's the thought that counts. No complaints about the food from us. The resort is older, and so are the rooms. We were in the 6000 building, so we were close to the pool and beach, which was great. The rooms were very, very clean and had everything we needed. However, for those that vacation for that luxury feel, this is not the place for you. The beds were comfortable for Mexico. The A/C did not work well, but since it was winter, we didn't really need it at night. We were not in the room at all during the day, so it was tolerable. The biggest complaint that we had was that drinks at the pool and bar were basically discouraged. If you go to an all inclusive to drink (we don't), this isn't the place for you, either. You have to go to the bar to get your drinks, wait in a long line, and the drinks that they serve are small and substandard. There are no tables in the lounge chair area, so you either have to put your drink on the ground next to your chair, or remain sitting up until it is gone. It's quite a haul from a beach chair by the waters edge to the bar, and it's just not worth it to get a 6 oz glass of beer, or a soda with no ice (they are very stingy with the ice for sodas). There is a fridge in the room, but you have to call to get it stocked with bottled water. So, if you want something to drink while you lay in the sun, you need to be prepared in advance (call ahead for a stocked fridge), or wait in lines for a drink that is gone or warm before you get back to your beach chair). On the plus side, there were plenty of beach chairs at both the pool and the beach, so no annoying saving of chairs like some other all inclusives. Also, they give out towels freely - which is such a luxury at one of these resorts! One really nice amenity is the free bus to Playa del Carmen. It runs 2X per day. We went to town 2 nights. We left the resort at 6, returning at 11. It's enough time to shop and eat and people watch. There are plenty of really good, cheap restaurants in Playa, so we didn't mind spending the $$ to eat out. Of course, for the economy minded, you could always eat at the resort before you get on the bus. You have to sign up for the bus - if you don't there is a chance you won't get on it. You can also take the bus there and catch a cab home for about $20 USD if you don't want to stay until the bus leaves back for the resort at 11 pm. We used the spa on our last evening there. It was acceptable, but the prices were very similar to what you would pay in the US. One last comment, no need to change $$ to pesos. They encourage the use of USD at the resort and in Playa.

We booked through Expedia and we had a privileged room which is somewhat updated with fresh paint, newer beds, newer furniture and a flat screen TV. The bathroom area is not updated but was in pretty decent shape. Our sink drained slow and the air conditioner was a little on the weak side but other than that.....no problems! We slept with the balcony door opened and had a nice breeze each night. During the hotter months I would make sure that your room has a good air conditioner though. We were in the 6000 buliding on the third floor and we could see the ocean from our balcony (we had to look to the side to see it but it was better then most views available). We had two full beds and even though the mattresses are firm, they are the softest beds I have slept in while in Mexico (we have been there at least 10 times). We have traveled this area from Cancun to Tulum and I have to say that this is the prettiest beach and the most beautiful turquiose blue water I have seen anywhere! It is a wide beach with soft white sand and you can walk a long way in each direction. The food and drinks were great. We ate in most of the restaurants and enjoyed each meal.

This is not a resort for those English speaking tourists who like to mingle - the guests here are primarily either Italian or French, and they don't speak English. Our last trip saw most Italian families - a rather bubbly, fun loving group, with great clothing taste, however this trip saw predominantly French guests, who were older, without children, and fairly quiet. We paid slightly more for the \"privileged\" room, as this is an old hotel and not rapidly upgrading, however it only got us a newly painted room - the bathroom was still very old and in a poor state. And the special reception for the privileged room did not offer any refreshments, and did not advise us of what we would receive when staying in a privileged room - I had to read the comments on this website to find out what we could have done, had we been advised. I have some small criticisms of this hotel: - we needed a phone call made to our transporation company to confirm pickup time and they insisted we go to our room, call ourselves and pay $1.50 US a minute for the call. (They also don't display the set taxi fares to various locations) - The pool table use was $3 US, and we have never been to a resort that charges for that recreation. - Despite being very close to Cancun, they do not offer a free shuttle to Cancun, only to Playa del Carmen. - The bar at the pool really needs to be expanded, it is a very crowded area, as they have placed small iron tables and chairs in this area facing the beach and this adds to the congestion. There are plenty of tables and chairs towards the pool and an expanded bar with more areas to stand at would be a great improvement. - when sunning all day, it is a pain to get dressed and walk 10 minutes to the front buffet, and then back again to lounge. The small buffet area at the pool is very substandard. With two restaurants on either side, it really needs to be expanded for the noon meal to become an exceptional mid-meal location. This is actually quite puzzling, as the Europeans eat their large main meal at noon and mostly Europeans stay here. The sister resort of Catalonia Royal Tulum has it all over this resort in being arranged for access to an excellent buffet near the beach and pool. - very poor gym. (There are those of us who exercise to justify overeating the great food!) - loss of the live music in the main lobby - this used to be \"the\" place to spend the early evening - an entertainer who played the piano and sang, while the Italians danced, and families pushed their children in strollers or the older children danced and played. The tables were removed for sofas, the music has disappeared, the Italian families have almost disappeared, and there is only drinking around the bar. - pool area and beach do not have palapas, but rather small log sun screens, so you either have a lot of sun or a lot of shade. As I jotted down the negatives, I would have to advise bypassing this Catalonia for the Royal Tulum, if you are an adult. The CRT is like a high end boutique hotel, with excellent a la carte dinners (no buffet) and two excellent buffets for breakfast and lunch. It is situated on a beautiful beach and a wonderful pool, excellent gym and spa. But it is very quiet. The pluses: - the best beach in Mexico and rated very highly world wise. - a very nice pool. - usually no towel saving - though we did see one couple do that. - a reef out in the water, though you have to be taken there, an additional cost. - the jungle setting, accompanied by some natural residents. - and the one reason we like to come back - the coatis - this time around there were 11 small coatis begging at the buffet restaurant door.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "Koati", "ReviewID": "UR53319767", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a week at the Catalonia Playa Maroma. We are in our late 20s and have travelled quite a bit mainly in Europe and the Caribbean. We had a great time and really enjoyed the resort. For the most part I can confirm what you might have already read in the previous postings. The staff and the service are great. The food is incredible (for an All Inclusive) especially in the 4 a la carte restaurants. We had one of the \u201cPrivileged Stand Alone Rooms\u201d. Those were spacious and well equipped (flat screen, fridge, safe\u2026). I just wanted to mention some things that I didn\u2019t read in any of the previous postings: - The scuba dive center that\u2019s located right in the resort is probably not your best choice. It is quite pricy and the service they offer is not worth it. I did two scuba diving tours with them. Our guide went down with us but didn\u2019t lead the group to any interesting spots at all. The PADI center on Akumal Beach is better. - If you want to do a snorkeling tour on a sailing boat along the coral reef ask Memo. He is a local and owns a small sailing boat. We met him on the beach and he took us out for about 4 hours. We sailed to a lagoon and went snorkeling there. He knows all the great places and it was a great experience. We paid only 40 $. You can call him on 998 153 00 58. He offers all kinds of customized tours. - If you want to see the Mayan sites, don\u2019t join one of the bus tours offered in the hotel. We rented a car and drove to Coba and Tulum. It is cheaper and much nicer because you are more flexible. We didn\u2019t have any issues with driving. It seemed very safe to me. - The Hotel is not as remote as it seems on some of the pictures. There are two neighboring resorts. The beach never gets crowded, but you won\u2019t find a spot where you are alone either, even if you walk south for 15 minutes. If you are really looking for a very remote location, it is not the right place. The Maroma Beach itself is beautiful, but you can\u2019t compare it to places on Turks or Samana where the palms almost reach the water and you can be totally on your own if you walk a couple of minutes away from your resort.

Gotta say this is the prettiest beach so far! Nothing but clean, soft white sand and gorgeous beach. While we were there, unfortunately, there was an unusual cold front so we didn't get to enjoy the beach and pool as much as we would have. The staff is all very friendly and fun, everyone we encountered was ready to smile and joke and exchange cultures. We had two teenagers with us and the animation crew took special care to include them in all the pool and beach games as well as the interaction night shows. They are truly the soul of the resort. The buffet is located by the front lobby and we went there for breakfast every day. They make omelets for you, which I loved. There is much to choose from and all good. For lunch we went to the beach buffet located by the pool. They have pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, fruits, salads, chips, guacamole, ect. It was fine and there was never a wait. Dinners are amazing- there is a Mexican, Italian, and Steakhouse. We could not believe the service, presentation, and food. All were good, but we ate at the Mexican 3 times! There is also a restaurant upstairs over the crepes cafe but we never went. There is a bar in the big lobby up front, and another bar next to the pool. Both offer top shelf liquor and +the bartenders are funny and happy to make your day fun, quick with jokes and conversation. I think everyone I encountered there spoke a little bit of every language spoken and that shows how hard thery try. Hidalgo and his crew at the pool always smiled and remembered what we liked to drink. The shows are funny, a little cheesy, but very enjoyable. Again, the staff works very hard to ensure that you have a good time. The resort is beautiful. There is a long, beautiful walkway from the lobby to the rooms. Very serene and quiet surrounded on both sides with tropical plants and trees.And the walk is welcome when you eat as much as we found ourselves doing. We stayed in the 6000 building and we lucked out there because the rooms were great and closest to the beach and pool. Rooms include mini fridge, safes, lots of hot water and good plumbing, lots of storage, a small patio, and maid service twice a day. We went to Playa Del Carmen one day just to get out and shop. It was fun and the girls had a great time. And we took a tour that we booked right in the lobby to Chichenitza. This was my second time there and so enjoyed it again. Very easy, you get picked up right at the lobby and you always feel safe because they have a great security system. This is a quiet place so if you are looking for party and want to get real crazy you probably will not be happy.

We arrived on Wed, Dec 30 and departed Wed, Jan 6. We have both traveled quite a bit, myself to quite a few AI's throughout Mexico and the Caribbean. When reserving our holiday trip, we were looking for a resort with a beautiful beach, good service and food and a reasonable price. It seems we found all of these areas satisfactory after our stay although we are not necessarily trying to jump on the next flight to return to this particular resort. I will be very honest in review and as detailed as possible. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, I hope this review is found helpful in your vacation planning. We reserved our trip through Expedia and chose to pay the additional $20 pp (one way) for the transfer from the airport to the hotel. Our trip was what I consider a \"budget to mid\" price range at $1250 per person including air from Minneapolis, transfers and accommodations. Keeping in mind the high season of the NYE holiday. We arrived on time at the Cancun airport with no issues. The weather was warm and the sun was shining. A helpful representative from Best Day directed us to our pick up spot where we waited for about 15 minutes until our shuttle arrived. Shuttle service was good, the ride was about 25 minutes from the airport to our hotel. The entrance to the Catalonia is not grand or luxurious and the roads are not paved. This caused me some initial hesitation thinking our resort would be rather outdated and too basic. We were pleasantly surprised when we were dropped off in front of the very large and open lobby of the Catalonia. A bell boy was very helpful with our luggage as we continued through the check-in process. We hadn't realized it but after we tried to check in at the main lobby desk, we were ushered to a \"priviledge\" guest office because apparently, we had reserved the priviledge room. We were greeted with warm, moist towels and offered cocktails, coffee and hors d'voures in the priviledge office. The CSR was incredibly helpful, spoke wonderful English and changed us to a different room in the 6000 (Palenque) building per our request. We were originally in 4000 but wanted to move closer to the ocean. Unfortunately, there was no ocean-view available. The room was very nicely appointed, comfortable, clean and spacious with a balcony view of the courtyard. The mini-fridge was stocked with included soft drinks and beer. While this original room (6303) was very nice, we asked to change once again because we preferred a king bed instead of the two doubles in #6303. Concierge said there was nothing that day but we would be able to move the following day. I noticed as we hauled our luggage to our third floor room, there are no elevators. Not that important, but worth noting. We set out to explore the resort and really enjoyed the lay out. The Catalonia is a series of pathways leading to \"blocks\" of rooms in 2-3 story buildings. I favored this set-up because it gave the resort a boutique feel, not like a huge multi-story resort. There is also a central area with shops and a spa as well as an incredible pool right next to the beach. The pool was enormous and beautiful, one of the best I've seen in my personal travels. There was a shallow children's area as well as a \"jacuzzi\". I use quotations because it had jets but the water was not hot. There are only two bars at the resort, we would have appreciated more. One was very small and was in a building separating the pool and beach, the other was right in the lobby area. There is one buffet that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, near the lobby (El Pajarito). We found the food and selection there to be very good, one of the best buffets I've experienced at an AI. There is a separate building near the pool that houses two of the other restaurants (Tio Pedro, Mexican) and La Tortuga (Steakhouse) in addition to the buffet-style snack bar. We found the food to be excellent at all of the restaurants and the service was great all but one of the evenings. The fourth restaurant is not included with the AI package. It is located above the pool/beach bar and serves Spanish tapas and lobster. The restaurant is an additional $15 per person but with the priviledge package, guests are allowed one free dinner there excluding lobster. The food was incredible! The bars had \"top shelf' liquor like Absolut and Beefeater. The bartenders were very friendly to every guest (tip or not) and the drinks had great flavor. We were satisfied except for the fact that they didn't have Captain Morgan rum which is what we usually drink. No biggie, we managed :) The nightly entertainment was kind of something to laugh at but I wasn't exactly expecting a Broadway play. It was something to do for an hour or so after dinner. The spa was impressive. My boyfriend and I each got full body massage ($70 each but we also received a 10% discount with priviledge). I felt that the staff was very professional and the quality of the massage was very high. We really enjoyed the plush couches located in the lobby, it was a popular area to relax throughout the day and evening. All in all, we had a great time at the Catalonia. We prefer to be closer to the action like the streets of Playa so we probably wouldn't stay here again for the location factor.

Over all the food from the snack bar and restaurant were ok, but the a la carte's (mexican, italtian and meditranean) were awesome, the food was great, service was great and the presentation of the food made it look even better! I found that the meat isnt cooked well enough, we ran into alot of raw pork and chicken but that could have just been our bad luck, if you like your steak medium rare, or even just medium .... ask for it well done and thats how you will get it. Moving on, the staff is so friendly, very hard working people, they made our stay very pleasent ... I would go back because the service was great.

It's AWESOME. Maroma was voted mexico's best beach and this is well deserved. There isn't a rock on it, white sand as far as the eye can see, it's wide and the water is clear and gorgeous. It's like walking into a bath tub. Just lovely. There is a PADI Scuba company on site that will take you out on their boat for excursions, and we also did a snorkle trip with them by van to snorkle in a water cave as well as at to snorkel on a beach with loads of turtles. We saw a ton of turtles as well as a barracuda and some sort of ray. Really excellent sights. The down side was that the scuba staff was all Italian with little English, so for us, being native English speakers, that was a challenge. We got by but we didn't get to hear a lot of the information he was giving the other people on the excursion. The hotel itself is pretty attractive with lots of greenery and palm trees. The buffet dinning areas are outside under cover but exposed to all the mosquitos that gather in the evening so that was a tad annoying. The a la cartes are hard to get reservations in but we did get to the mexican restaurant which was pretty good and the wait staff was very nice and polite. Enjoyed a really neat after dinner alcoholic coffee drink that was set on fire. They do quite an interesting little routine with lighting it and pouring the fire from one cup to the next. The hotel is pretty quiet at night. They have entertainment shows that are fairly silly but fun enough to watch. There was a DJ who played music in the lobby and some people got up to dance. There is a \"disco\" that is very small and had hardly anyone in it when we stuck our heads in. It's a quiet night scene for sure but if you don't mind that then it's perfectly pleasant to sit in the lobby area and have an after dinner drink. The rooms are very average but I dont go to Mexico to sit in my room so I really can't say this matters much. The bathroom was clean and in working order. The Aircon worked. That was all I really needed! It was difficult to get \"extra\" of anything. We needed more towels and a sewing kit at one point and they never did materialize. The hotel has a shuttle service to Playa del carmen that goes twice a day and that is a nice feature, however more frequent departures and returns would be nice. I hear some other hotels in the area have shuttles leaving and arriving every hour. In the lobby you can arrange to go on tours to local sights. We payed about $100 per person for a day long trip to the Mayan ruins and a couple of other small stops on the way. It was a good trip in an air con van with 3 other couples and two guides. Lunch was included and water for the day. The convenience of arranging it, paying for it all in the lobby and then being picked up at the front door was great. Overall, this hotel was totally fine and fun and we had a good vacation but it is a 3.5 star so not super luxurious. The beach is amazing so if you really are just fine to have drinks a great beach and a relaxing stay with some snorkeling or scuba thrown in and some shopping in playa, this hotel is a pretty good price and will give you all you need.

We are vegetarians who love fresh fruit and the huge choice of fruit juices available at the breakfast buffet. We ate salads galore each day and were never ill. What really made our week unpleasant were a) the lack of comfortable seating ANYWHERE, at the beach bar (metal), in the lobby (metal), at the beach (old loungers) and in our room (hard mattresses), and b) the number of Italian guests, for whom this hotel seems to cater to exclusively. None seemed to be able to speak any English, French or Spanish, or they didn't care to, and they made it very clear anyone with a green bracelet was in a sub-category, in fact a nuisance. At least they left the palapas to us pale Canadians, as most of them preferred to fry, and smoke, in the sun all day. One excellent feature of this hotel that no one seems to have mentioned is the fact that it is very accessible to people in wheelchairs. There are ramps everywhere, even down to the beach, with reserved palapas for easy access. There are also special wheelchairs with balloon-type wheels which can be taken into the sea. I believe that the pool also had a ramp. It was encouraging to see so many people being able to enjoy these amenities and the hotel should be congratulated. As we were on a 2 week stay, I was thrilled when we were able to transfer at no cost, except the cab ride, to their beautiful sister resort south of Playa del Carmen, the Catalonia Royal Tulum, where we spent a wonderful, comfortable 2nd week. Fortunately, the Playa Maroma was overbooked, so they were probably glad to have our room. Nevertheless, the Maroma would be a great resort for families with children, or for groups of friends, or for Italian speakers (as most of the \"animacion\" was in Italia). The weather was lovely (meanwhile it rained the whole week in Cancun) except for one wet day.

The resort is quite spread out between the jungle (mangroves) and the beach. The front open air lobby and buffet restaurant are located at the beginning of the resort (in the jungle). The tennis/archery/soccer courts are located off to the side. There is a beautiful walkway from the front lobby to the beach \u2013 very tranquil, especially at night. The rooms are located in 5 units (each with there own courtyards) that branch off from the walkway (also in the jungle area). The pool, a la cartes and pool bar are located at the beach. That said, there is a lot of walking. Personally, I liked it \u2013 helped burn off the food and drinks! All the grounds are very lush and well kept \u2013 staff were constantly sweeping and cleaning. There are many birds and coatis (raccoon like animals) that run free throughout the resort. Mosquitoes \u2013 because the resort is located in the jungle, there can be mosquitoes. We brought bug spray, but only needed it one night. The resort sprays each evening and this seemed to take care of the mosquitoes. Food \u2013 Overall \u2013 Excellent. Buffet \u2013 this has to be the best buffet food we have experienced. Very good omelet bar for breakfast. Dinner had very nice meats \u2013 roast beef, pork, leg of lamb, fish and turkey (for Xmas eve), pasta bar (very good lasagna), delicious soups, fresh salad mixings, fresh fruits and good desserts. All the water and ice are purified, so one can drink without worry. The wait service was outstanding at all times. There was always a non-smoking section. The Supper buffet did not open until 7 p.m. each night, so that might be kind of late for families with kids (have a late day snack in the snack bar). A la Carte \u2013 only ate at the Mediterranean. It was just OK, but it was nice to have a sit down served meal. Service was excellent. There was also a Mexican and one that you had to pay for. Snack bar \u2013 typical food \u2013 hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, pizza, wings, fish, fresh salsa and chips, fruit, wine, beer, sodas. Cr\u00eaperie \u2013 lovely \u2013 our kids ate here almost every morning as they wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. Open from 10 am \u2013 6pm. Lobby bar \u2013 nice drinks, not watered down. Excellent margaritas! Every night champagne and appetizers were served at 6:30. Pool bar \u2013 again nice drinks. Beer only on tap \u2013 but was good. If you were on the beach, drinks orders were promptly filled. Also served good coffees and cappuccinos. Beach \u2013 one word describes Maroma Beach - outstanding. Wide, powdery sand and turquoise water. You can walk along time in either direction. I preferred going south. We never had trouble finding a beach chair and beach towels were plentiful. The snorkeling is not great, but if the waves aren\u2019t too big, there are these huge white angel fish that swim around you \u2013 bring a banana or some sausage from the buffet to feed them. Kayaks were available, as were hobbie cats (a guide would take two people out for \u00bd hour). Entertainment staff \u2013 wonderful \u2013 always trying to get you to participate. Our kids played tennis and archery daily. Clientele \u2013 mostly Italian, French or Spanish. Many games, etc. were spoken in French/Italian, so you may be at a disadvantage. This did not bother us. There is a complementary bus service, twice a day, to and from Playa del Carmen. We took a taxi ($20US) into Playa and caught the 5:00 shuttle back. Be on time \u2013 the bus left at 5:01. Rooms \u2013 this is the only failing grade for the resort. The rooms are separated into 5 units \u2013 we were in the Coba unit. Although the rooms are clean, the standard rooms are not nice. Beds are very hard and pillows the same. The bathrooms are in dire need of remodeling \u2013 tile is cracked and discolored (although there was no mold smell). The shower had strong pressure with plenty of hot water. In room safe. Mini fridge is stocked with complimentary bottled water and sodas. We could have updated for an extra $45 per night, but we were travelling with our kids (in their own room) and that made it uneconomical. Previous reviews stated the upgrade was $20-25 per night \u2013 so I guess the holiday season warranted the increase. We did not see the upgraded rooms, but spoke to a couple that said they were lovely \u2013 new mattresses, nice bathroom, canned beer in mini-fridge, etc. This is a solid 3 star hotel. Not luxurious - but not a luxurious price either. If your only going for a week, this is a very good choice as it\u2019s only 30 minutes from the airport and every minute that your not on the bus means your on the beach!", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cYou Will Not be Disappointed!\u201d", "Author": "Siss", "ReviewID": "UR52085242", "Content": "You will not be disappointed! I can say that the service, food, beach, and overall experience were excellent! This was the least we have ever spent on a trip in this area, but the resort and its staff are marvelous. I'm not sure about the occupancy rate when we were there, but we felt like we had the place almost to ourselves. The food was consistently of excellent quality. We never ate at any of the a la cartes because we really looked forward to the butffet. The quantity of food was less, but the quality was truly outstanding for an all inclusive (not US five star dining but just really good quality food). The beach is beautiful powdery white sand that never gets hot, water a beautiful hue and the beach stretches on forever for long walks. We didn't spend much time at the pool because the beach was just perfect. Probably less shade than a lot of resorts I've visited, but enough to get out of the sun if desired. The staff is ridiculously gracious and helpful - I would say #1 in our experience and I always thought IB* had great service staff. Can't even begin to say enough about them. The entertainment staff is a great group. We knew one girl from a previous trip to a different resort and she seemed to remember us. There were the typical aqua gym, beach volleyball, crazy games, etc. Tell Valentino hello from Sis and Felix if you meet her. I don't have kids - but the ones I saw seemed to love the staff - lots of hugs and adoring looks. Not sure what they did activity wise, but they always looked happy! There are lots of French and Italian guests - very few Americans - but again, I look for this because it's such fun to talk to others from other areas of the world and I'm with Americans every day! All the other languages and cultures make it feel a bit more exotic. We experienced no time share sales (nice!). There was a complimentary shuttle to Playa Del Carmen twice a day (10:00-5:00 and 6:00-11:00). We took it one morning and then took a cab back to the hotel ($20) because we had our fill before 5:00. Nice amenity. The only negative would be the bathrooms. They have not been redone and are in desperate need. The tiles are old, stained grout and some mold issues on the ceiling (although there was no moldy or musty smell) - but the water pressure and temperature were outstanding so it really didn't bother me - I have trouble keeping my bathroom spotless too! As far as being a different level of resort - it's not ....it may not get the \"stars\" on this site or others, but it really is top notch. Let me know if you have any specific questions I can answer. On another note - we were battling a serious personal family illness at home while here and were still able to enjoy ourselves and think this highly of the resort and i'm normally very critical in the best of circumstances, so do not by any means be hesitant - enjoy!", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington", "Title": "\u201cVery sad--but we were robbed here (building 4000)\u201d", "Author": "sobachka", "ReviewID": "UR51821397", "Content": "We are writing this review to warn american travelers to not take any valuables with you to this hotel.

There are plenty of beach activities to keep you busy, like volleyball and soccer. There are also some diving and snorkeling but you have to pay extra. The Service Great, great service. Can't complain. Everyone is very friendly and happy. Only thing is that they cater to a French/Spanish speaking crowd so language might be an issue if you don't speak either. But it's not a huge deal. The Food The buffet is very very good. The a la cart restaurants are OK. I would definitely recommend the steakhouse but the Mexican and Italian restaurant are not that great. If you want really authentic Mexican food, venture out to Playa del Carmen.

We have spent the last 10+ years 2-3 times a year traveling to the Caribbean to all inclusive resorts. We have stayed at 6 golden apples and 3 apples in the same year. We book the best deal at the time we wish to travel. This was our most pleasant trip for all the right reasons. The resort itself is a great size, not too big, not too small. The beach is absolutely gorgeous! It is clean with powder soft sand and clear turquoise waters. Some days were calm and others had great waves for body surfing. The beach service for drinks by Enrique was awesome and never have we met an employee at any resort with as much enthusiasm for his job! It was inspiring! The room we were assigned was not one of the newly renovated ones, but it was very nice anyway. It had a king size bed with an awesome mattress and the linens were so soft. The pillows were also perfect. This was the most comfortable room we have ever had at a resort. The AC was plenty cold, and the hot water plentiful. We had no water pressure issues at all. It was cleaned to perfection every day. The food was again well beyond our expectations. Although we have been to other all inclusives with more variety, NONE compare to the quality of the food served at Catalonia. The daily presentation was superb. The specialty restaurants were also very good and rank at the top. The only complaint I would have is that the service at these specialty restaurants was quite slow. However, the service at the Buffet each and every day every time we were there was beyond outstanding. We spent so much time outdoors swimming, sunning, and walking we did not see any of the shows at this resort, but I did hear they were good. The front desk is another area where I believe this resort shines. Any time we approached for any reason we were handled quickly and easily. From check in to check out we were assisted at every turn quickly and efficiently. The pool is beautiful and clean, the towel hut it easily accessible. Not having towel cards is nice. The walkway from the front lobby/buffet area to the beach is very nice. It is well lit, paved and has beautiful music piped in. You have the opportunity to see some wonderful animals and birds, and a beautiful relaxing walk. There are benches for relaxing and it is truly quite pleasant. We did not mind it at all. All in all, we found this resort to be the best hidden gem in the Caribbean, and especially in Mexico.

We are from a beautiful beach area, so we are snobby about it... Food: This was the biggest shocker. The food was really good! The Mediterranean place was the only place we didn't like.

First of all, I don't know how other people were so lucky to get an upgraded room automatically, because when I asked, they quoted me an additional $40 per night! If it wasn't for my husband, I would have paid twice that, as the room was terrible! The bathroom has no ventilation, the shower doesn't have a door, and is the size of a coffin. The furniture and walls were not only old, they were disgusting! The first morning we were woken up by the housekeepers. They told me to go back to sleep, so I did. They never came back, therefore, no water and no clean towels (and we had our 5 year old and 18 year old daughters as well). Even though there were 4 of us staying in our room, they never managed to have 4 towels. Our refridgerator never worked, so the water and soda that they did put in our room, was never able to get cold. ONE BIG PROBLEM....Some people may not have a problem with this, but when we cram a week's worth of clothing into our suitcases, they don't always make it wrinkle free. This hotel does not have irons at all!! I found that kind of ridiculous! Okay, enough about the room. As the other reviews state, this hotel caters to Europeans. Now, I wouldn't neccessarily say that, as the staff was most accomodating to us. However, as American's, it was apparent that we did not have a very big fan club. Now, I don't just mean that the other resort guests didn't smile back or say hello, I mean that they down right would glare and snuff you to make you feel unwanted and uncomfortable. We have a very blonde and attractive 18 year old daughter, and a few ladies even went as far as to look her up and down and scrunch up their faces, like snobby little school girls. We were fortunate enough to meet two very nice french men, and a lovely American couple to converse with during our stay. But the majority are not American. Some people should also be aware that there is an abundant amount of topless sunbathing, otherwise it could be a little bit of a shock. Now, for ALL of the good! As you have probably already read, the beach is truly amazing. When I saw it in daylight for the first time, it was breath taking! The sand is so soft and cool on your feet. Only one day when the wind was up, was there really any seaweed in the water, otherwise it was gorgeous and very nice to swim in. They have a lifeguard on duty, so you always feel really safe too. Yes, there is only one pool, but it is the biggest pool I have ever seen in my life. Not only is it the biggest pool I have ever seen, but it has so much character to it. I'm not a pool person, but spent quite a bit of time in it, as it was so enjoyable. The grounds to the hotel are very well maintained. They work very hard to keep it beautiful. Buy some strong bug spray in Playa, as we each had like 20 mosquito bites on our legs and everywhere else for that matter, even with the spray! In regards to the entertainment staff. Wonderful wonderful wonderful! They are always upbeat and racking their brains in order to find things to keep the guests entertained. They truly make the resort. Just seeing their smiling faces everyday was great, but it was also refreshing to see a team that really enjoyed what they do for a living. Now, I've heard some bad reviews on the kid's club. I would have to say that they don't have tons of stuff to do, but who cares? You're in Mexico. Why would your kids want to be bound to a room inside? The girls that ran the kid's club were very nice, and our daughter just fell in love with them. They played games with her, built sand castles on the beach, took her swimming and fed her lunch on two occasions, so we could have a break. What more could you want? There is one buffet that serves breakfast. The same buffet serves lunch, as well as another buffet by the beach. They did a great presentation of the food, but it did get a little repetative. The Mediteranian restaurant and the Mexican restaurant take turns being open for dinner. THERE IS NO ROOM SERVICE, contrary to a few websites advertising the hotel. The food in both dinner restaurants are very good, with quite a variety. I've also heard people complain about the walking. It is not that bad at all! If you can walk around a super Walmart, this hotel is nothing! My 5 year old had absolutely no problem. And, the walk is so beautiful, it's kind of nice to be able to take it all in.

Having had a horrible experience in Punta Cana last year at an all-inclusive, I was cautiously optimistic about trying a new venue and a new resort. My cautious optimism bloomed into pure blissful joy when we arrived at CPM!! Food -- the biggest part of the disaster in Punta Cana was the quality of the food. We could not have had a more opposite experience at CPM. The buffet is amazing...fresh meats and fish, a variety of salsas, made to order eggs/omelettes for breakfast, delicious breads and muffins, excellent pizza, fantastic desserts...all on the buffet! The snack bar by the beach offered a great selection of junky food (pizza, fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.) but also had delicious fresh guacamole and chips, authentic Mexican fare, and, of course, grilled fish. Definitely indulge in the delicous crepes in the beach bar...my particular favorite was the nutella crepe with bananas...yummy. We also ate at the two included specialty restaurants...one Italian, one Mexican. The Italian restaurant had some of the very best pasta I've ever had. The homemade pasta stuffed with spinach and ricotta is reason enough to return to this resort! I also ate fish and the spinach/ricotta stuffed chicken (we went to this restaurant twice); both were excellent. My boyfriend got the veal chops both times and loved them! Desserts were also delicious, especially the mocha cake. The Mexican specialty restaurant was also very delicious, starting off with the fabulous salsas! Excellent margaritas, and the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! After six days of this...I came back five pounds heavier, but it was so worth it! Drinks -- the drinks are plentiful at the resort. If you request premium liquors, they will provide it, but you have to ask. I had the best mojitos made with Bacardi rum (a variety that I've never seen in the states), awesome apple martinis made with Absolut, and a whole host of fruity, frozen drinks on the beach. The buffet and snack bar by the beach has \"serve your own\" beer and wine dispensers. I'm not a big drinker, but did nightly cocktail time in the lobby bar every night before dinner, including champagne! Room -- immediately upon arrival, we were upgraded from a privilege room in the 4000 building to a privilege room in the 6000 building (closest to the beach). It was very clean, nicely appointed. The bed was a bit hard, as were the pillows, but a day of drinking, eating and swimming helped to facilitate a delightful slumber every night. The bathrooms, especially the showers, show the age of the resort more than anything else. The shower is not great, but it in no way interfered with our enjoyment of the resort. The electricity seems to be tied to a motion sensor that knows when you come in/leave the room; resetting the alarm clock every night was kind of a pain, but I can totally understand the need to conserve. Loved the decor of the privilege room! Beach -- literally the most beautiful beach that I have ever seen. We got there 12 hours after Hurrican Ida had brushed the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, and the only way that we could tell was that the waves were a little higher than expected. The water was a color that I have never before seen, and the sand was so soft, like flour. There are only two other resorts on this stretch of Maroma Beach (one of which is Secrets), but you can walk for a long time in either direction. We were able to swim out pretty far after the first day (and when there were hardly any waves) and could still see down to the bottom. There are these huge white angel fish that swim around you when you are out there, which is disconcerting at first, but kind of cool after you get used to seeing them. Also, on the beach you have the option of sitting under a shaded area or out in the sun. Because we were there when the resort was at only 25% capacity, we were able to spread out so that we could have a space under the shade as well as out in the sun. The sun is intense here, so I was grateful for the rest under the shade. Staff -- very friendly. The animation team is tons of fun and speak a variety of languages (most prominent...French, Spanish, and Italian). They will ask you to join in with them, but if you say no, they move on. The wait staff, bartenders, housekeeping...everyone is extremely friendly. Not many people seemed to tip, but we did quite a bit, and it was definitely appreciated. Grounds -- very well kept and very lush. The path leading from the lobby out to the beach is very long and surrounded by jungle. I loved our daily walks up and down this path, especially at night. Very romantic walks, indeed! The pool is beautiful, but honestly, we did not use it. Why swim in a pool when that beach is beckoning? I cannot say enough wonderful things about this resort.

My husband and I got married at the Catalonia Playa Maroma on October 10, 2009 and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Both of us work in the hospitality industry and we wanted something different, not Americanized, more relaxing. We came down with a group of almost 30. FOOD: First and foremost my husband is a chef and so when I mentioned all inclusive wedding he wasn't thrilled but he went along with it after we read the reviews. The food was better than we could have ever anticipated. Completely blew us and our entire group away. There was majority idustry people there, even my family is in the industry. We did the La Tortuga for our rehearsal dinner. We had a private dinner in the Terrace Restaurant with tapas and and surf and turf. Our ice cream dessert was unreal. Also our cocktail hour was on the balcony of that restaurant. It was completely amazing. We had one person who had a food allergy and one who only eats certain items and he made sure that nothing was made with mango and he special tapas for the other. The chef came out and got a standing ovation. We did Tio Pedro the last night the lime soup was sooooo good. Also if you get the chance finish your meal there with a La Cucaracha...You will thank me later. Oh and before I forget the buffet and snack bar were equally as good. Only downside the buffet doesn't get a very good breeze so it can get hot in there. Don't sit close to the buffet lines. There was always a wide variety of things to choose from. You never got bored. Everytime I had grouper it was awesome!! Rooms: Super clean. We were all put close to each other in building 4. We asked for non-smoking but were put in a smoking section. HOWEVER you would have never ever known you were in a smoking section. There was only one of our guests who had to switch rooms. But they didn't mind one bit. Also we were all in the upgraded rooms and they were absolutely OUTSTANDING, AMAZING and totally worth it. Staff: I can't say enough about them. Can't. It's physically impossible. The only thing I do tell people is that some speak very little English. All management does and the staff that can't will get someone who can. But it didn't matter to anyone in my group because our philosphy was we are in Mexico and they speak Spanish. Adreina, wedding coordinator extraordinaire. I totally trusted her and we talked towards the end almost every day before we got there. They had Out of Town/Welcome Bags delivered to every room for us on time. She helped with everything from food to flowers to music. You name it it was done. She got us La Tortuga at no extra cost just for us. The activity staff super energetic and wants everyone involved. So if you are by the pool be prepared. Enrique, beach cocktail server, rocks. Pool bartenders are awesome. IF YOU TIP you might notice you don't have to drink as many as if you don't tip. Just saying. Surroundings/Scenery: If you didn't know this is like a jungle. It is so great because we all felt like we were on another planet. There is wildlife and soooo much green. The resort itself is pretty spread out and very calming. The grounds are kept up very well every day. THE BEACH IS LIKE A SCENE FROM A MOVIE. White beach and warm turquoise water Spa: I think like 12 of us ended up getting massages and we all enjoyed it. The manicure and pedicure were good. Not the best but definitely needed morning of. Since my hair is short I didn't have them do my hair but they were all very accommodating. All in all everyone in the group wants to go back next year. We truly had the greatest time. We did group snorkeling, took the free bus to Playa del Carmen, some people in our group went parasailing, atv tours, jet boating.

I think they might use a little less alcohol in the drinks but since they are \"free\" you can have as many as you want so.... The Mexican restaurant has fantastic food. The Sopa de Lima is just awesome! The staff is very friendly and most of them speak multiple languages. Not all spoke perfect English but they were always helpful in finding someone who could help us. There are lots of Coati there. Very cute critters a relative of the raccoon. Friendly but wouldnt suggest feeding them. Its not encouraged at all. Also so a couple raccoons and a few Agouti. Was neat to see the wildlife. The pool was fabulous. Always clean and no green around the edges. Beach was fantastic. They cleaned the seaweed up every morning. Surf was a little rough but certainly swimmable. The entertainment staff was very good at encouraging all sorts of activities from beach volley ball to bocci ball. And they had catamarans and kayaks you could use if you wanted.

Will go back as soon as possible with my husband too. We took a van from the airport, and were dropping people at various places with long paved drives. We turned onto an unpaved road and my friend and I were concerned. Little did I know that we didn't need to be. The open air lobby was magnificant and we were met with drinks and fast check in service. The manager came over while we were checking in a upgraded us to a \"priviledged\" room. It was WONDERFUL!!! I have done a lot of travelling in the Carribean, and have paid a LOT more for a LOT less!! Our room was gorgeous and large , they let us check in when we arrived (around 1p). It was perfect. We requested a non-smoking room, and altho there was an ashtray in the room, you certainly could not smell any smoke at all. And I am VERY sensitive to cigarette smoke. Air conditioning doesn't get extremely cold...personally I am glad for that. If I wanted to be cold, I would have stayed up north (where I live). Plus, it makes it more tolerable to head back out in the heat if you aren't freezing in your room!! Also, be aware that there is a switch in the door for the a/c. And should you get the curtain caught up in the door, it will stop the a/c from working. I had read some complaints about the hard beds....never noticed that. Neither did my friend who likes to sleep in a \"hammock\" (i.e. a VERY soft bed). Rooms were well equipped. Water pressure seemed low.....but as I said before I have paid a lot more for a lot less. And it was certainly workable. The beach is drop dead gorgeous!!! Enrique never seemed to tire of dragging drinks to people laying around the pool or on the beach. Mosquitoes were not bad at all. Food was excellent anywhere we ate on the property. So glad that they offered some Mexican choices at every buffet. REALLY loved the Grouper and I am not a fish eating kind of person. If you can't find something to eat there, then there must be something wrong. The staff is GREAT!! They can't do more for you if they tried. They bend over backwards to help you. And altho english is not necessarily a strong suit there, they do try and will find someone who speaks the language if there is a barrier. We met several groups of people from the US there. Everyone was kind and fun loving! Hope you ALL had as much fun as we did and a safe trip back home!!!! I would definitely stay here again. I want to go back BEFORE next year, it was that nice. I did hear people complain that the drinks were weak(???). They are free flowing, and if you want a double, just ask for it!! A word to the wise...there is NOT a huge population of people from the US at this hotel. Personally, I enjoyed it. I just can't think of anything bad to say about the place. Some people may say that it's a bit of a walk (a GORGEOUS walk ) from pool to the front desk/buffet area on the paved, lit walkway. I enjoyed the walk and glad that it forced me to move. Otherwise I may have never left my chair. And I would like to think that was my cross training for the week...LOL!!! Lots of activities going on all the time. You can choose to participate or not.

The walkway has music piped in and the foliage is so green and lush. We saw several animals crossing the walkway every morning and evening. Close to the beach is the Mexican and Mediterranean restaurants that start serving dinner at 7:30pm. We had wonderful food at both. At the beach bar there is a a place that makes fresh crepes from 10am to 6pm every day. The beach bar also serves great coffee and cappucinos throughout the day. One morning I did not go to the breakfast buffet and just had crepes and coffee. They were excellent. My husband loved the beach service. You never seemed to finish one drink before they were asking if you needed another one. The beach as expected was beautiful. There were hotel employees cleaning the beach every morning with any debris that had washed up. The swimming pool was very large and had plenty of chairs and a towel service there. As the other reviews commented there was a large international clientel there. But that just made the stay that much better.

The hotel is undergoing renovations, so I guess right now its a crap shoot as to whether you get the refurbished room or the old room. I personally don't go to that area for the room, so it wouldn't have mattered to me one way or another. The AC in the room was just once step below mediocre. They have motion detectors that turn off the AC when you leave the room, so we always returned to an uncomfortable room....but that motivated us to go do other things than hang out in the room, so that is a good thing I guess. In the hotel's defense, it was August and it was very hot and humid all of the time...but it would have been nice if they left the AC on when they turned the power off. The beach was truly outstanding. Nicest beach I have ever seen, and I have seen alot of beaches. You can walk forever in either direction. If you go south, there is an old abandoned resort that is interesting to look at, but make sure you have your flip flops if you explore because there are lots of stickers of in the brush once you get away from the water (we learned that the hard way). I highly recommend the sailing (free with the resort). Never made it to the reef because of other adventures, but the reviews from people who did were very good. The food: again, outstanding...at the formal restaurants at least. The buffet was just like any other all-inclusive buffet, but the formal restaurants were just amazing. I couldn't have been happier with the service and quality. The steaks were even good...not midwest US good, but still good. The pool is also outstanding. I was a soft slope most of the way around so you could lay half in and half out and then a deep area for laps, if you are one of those people that exercise on vacation. Lots of kids at the resort, but if you can escape the volume of the pool pretty easily by going to the beach. If you require English to be spoken by the majority, don't go here. We really enjoyed being the only English speaking people....I think we were the only Americans for the first few days. I think you should try to learn at least the basics of the language of your host country, and this forces you to adapt. We were there long enough to where my limited vocabulary started to string together into sentences. Most of the people there were Italian or French on our trip, so we got to learn a little of those languages as well. The spa offers the best massage I've had in Mexico. I would book some time there if you like massages. The bus to Playa Del Carmen was a nice feature. We took a cab back ($20 US). It goes a little early however, so you might just plan to suck it up and spend the extra $20 on getting there if you plan on going out. The resort was a little spread out from end-to-end, but its not as bad as some reviewers have said...unless you are lazy, then I guess it would not be fun...or if you have small children. Go on the whale shark excursion. Pricey, but totally worth it. Take dramamine before you go because it is a long haul. Go to Selvatica and do the zip lines too.

Stayed in the 400 block which was closer to the pool and beach areas. All of the rooms are off of a walkway that literally takes you through the jungle. Saw some very interesting animals as well as iguanas and birds. Never knew what you would see next. Food was incredible. I have found that most of the mexican buffets are pretty much the same types and style of food but the selections were huge. Main buffet served breakfast, lunch and dinner. The pickiest of eaters would not walk away hungry. Large selections of bread, meats and fishes, pasta bar, mexican bar, the list could go on forever. During the day there was a snack buffet close to the pool area. Lots of kid food. Pizza, fries, chicken nuggets, hamburgers, hotdogs, ice cream. Always had some type of meat, broiled fish, salads. By the pool bar was a crepe bar that served different types throughout the day. First time I have ever seen one in a resort. At night there was an ala carte italian and mexican restaurant. No reservations needed and never a wait to get a table.The food was very good and everything was presented beautifully. There was one restaurant that was an extra fee to eat there. We did not go but the menu looked good, lobster and rib eye steaks were a couple of the selections. Drinks were very good. Not watered down and they weren't served in the small cups that you usually get at an all inclusive. They used the larger hurricane type cups. Dos equis on tap, both the light and amber kinds. The beach drink service was an added touch. Not that I mind getting my own drinks but Enrique did an excellent job and had your drink to you in less than 5 minutes. He even went out of his way to get the amber beer that wasn't always on tap at the pool bar. 2 bars located in the beach and pool areas, one in the lobby and any kind of drinks you desire at all of the buffets and restaurants. Also, made great coffees and cappucinos. Pool area was huge and actually had very swallow areas as well as deeper areas (6-8ft.) toward the center of the pool. Pool chairs were abundant, at the pool as well as on the beach. The resort was not very full but even at top capacity I am sure there would be plenty of chairs. The beach was one of the nicest that we have ever stayed on. Walked 4-5 miles daily up and down the beach. Water was calm and very clear with soft, white sand. Many reefs for snorkeling. Attempted one day but it had just rained and it was cloudy under the water but you could walk out knee high and see clear colored fish swimming around. The entertainment staff were very nice. Always something to do but they weren't pushy if you wanted to just sit and relax. Also ran the shows at night and escorted you out if you wanted to bar hop to Playa del Carmen. 2 shuttles ran daily to Playa del Carmen if you wanted to get away from the resort and do some shopping or see the sights of 5th ave. The whole resort was immaculate. Always someone cleaning or landscaping. Rooms, restaurants, bathrooms were all well kept up. Tipping was not necessary or expected but very much appreciated. Service was the same either way. As many people have written in other reviews there is some language barrier but for us it was never an issue. Many of the staff spoke very good english while some spoke none at all. Very few Americans and some Canadians but mostly Italian, French and Mexican. We had fun listening and trying to figure out which language the other guests were speaking. And no we were not treated any differently because we werre American.

The bathroom had chunks of missing tile. We started off with two bottles of water in the fridge but getting more water every day was a challenge. They also seemed to run out of small wash clothes. One day we only received one hand towel. After several nights we couldn't take the bed and upgraded to the better room. This room had modern decor and the bed was much better.

The first day we had a problem with the air conditioner in room, we called front desk and in 5 min maintenance was there to solve the issue. The beach is wonderful with many nice chairs and shady spots to enjoy. There is bar service at the beach which is prompt and efficient. The drinks were very good AND there was a choice of beer other than Corona. We cannot say enough about the delicious food and presentation in all of buffets and restaurants. We felt as if we were in 5 star quality restaurants with the Mediterrean and Mexican. Each day was a varied menu in the buffet., something we have not seen at 4 & 5 star properties. There is also crepe bar poolside that offers several delicious crepes during the day, what a TREAT! There is constant activity for those who wish to partake in pool and beach games. The animation team is very personable and vibrant. It was fun just to watch them. Another benefit is a FREE shuttle offered twice a day into Playa , a savings of a $40 taxi RT ride into town. We also found the shops in the resort to be competitive to town prices, and sometimes a bit cheaper. The resort is 8 yrs old and is being refurbished . The rooms are very basic and need to be updated. If room appearance is important to you then book a suite but who stays in the room when there is such a wonderful beach and ocean to enjoy!!!!! I highly recommend this resort as it was a great value! We have traveled to the area for 8 yrs and have stayed at several 5 star properties.

We found the staff at the front desk helpful and if they didn't understand English very well, they didn't hesitate to ask another staff member who did. We got fresh towels every day and had hot water every day contrary to some other reviews here. We stayed in the 3000 building and couldn't access the internet there but had no problem in the lobby. The rooms could use some sprucing up but we spent so little time there it wasn't an issue, but the bed was extremely hard. The food at the buffet was good - the salad greens were really fresh. We never ate at any of the specialty restaurants but met others who did and said the Mexican restaurant was great. This was the first time one of us didn't experience any stomach problems at an all-inclusive and that was a great relief. The snack bar near the pool was really convenient at lunch time (chicken wings and salad were my favorites). The staff in the dining areas was always very attentive and they do a great job keeping glasses full and dishes cleared. The beach was beautiful, and our only complaint was that there is not enough true shade anywhere in the resort unless you are in a building. The structures on the beach block some of the sun but even using 30 SPF sunscreen we still burned. There was a bit more shade at the pool, but never any lounges available as all were saved with towels on them first thing in the morning and then remained empty throughout the day. How rude! It's one thing to save a lounge chair if you plan to use it and we've done that many times, but to leave it empty all day is just ridiculous. All in all, we had a great stay and totally relaxed which was what we really wanted to do on this trip! We would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to friends. We have been to 6 or 7 different all-inclusive hotels (3 to 4 star) in the Caribbean and this was one of our favorites.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Under where?", "Title": "\u201cA definite 3 star/sun resort with room to improve - full review\u201d", "Author": "willy7519", "ReviewID": "UR35793504", "Content": "Just returned from 8 days at the Catalonia Playa Maroma. Want to emphasize we had a fantastic time while there, and enjoyed the resort despite some obvious shortcomings. Before we went I did a lot of research and expected the place to be about a 3 star/sun, and it was. The review below lists the good, the bad and the ugly (which there was little ugly to complain about). We booked our trip through Vacation Travel Mart who used Best Day Tours once we arrived there. I've traveled quite a bit throughout the Caribbean/Mexico, and have stayed at resorts ranging from 2-5 suns/stars. The CPM is a definite 3. Resort The resort is located on Maroma Beach which has been rated as one of the top 10 by several magazines and the Travel Channel. It's about a 20-25 minute ride from the Cancun Airport. Upon arrival at the airport, we were greeted by Best Day workers and promptly transferred to the CPM. We had to make one stop to drop some other folks at another resort but still made it to the resort in about 25 minutes. Upon arrival, you walk into a very large, open air lobby. Bell hops immediately took our bags and escorted us to the desk to check in. We had done some reviews and one common complaint was the basic room. So we upgraded for an extra $30.00 per night. I could care less as long as the toilet flushes and the place is clean. My girlfriend however likes things a bit nicer, so we decided to upgrade. After spending 8 days, I can tell you the upgrade includes new paint and fixtures, and little else. Oh...and an alarm clock...the basic rooms don't come with alarm clocks. Resort has Wi-Fi and it works very well. The bathrooms in the older and newer rooms are identical, and in BAD need of repair. Filthy grout, broken tiles and other things that should be fixed are still present. The towels/cloths are very cheap/thin but serve their purpose. Lighting is very poor around the vanity. Beds are very hard and the linens are very cheap, but again in my opinion serve their purpose. The upgraded rooms look very nice with the color scheme chosen, and include a flat screen tv and ample storage space. The rooms come with electronic safes. A refrigerator holds sodas (no diet) and water that was refilled regularly. No beer is available for the fridge despite my begging and tipping. The A/C struggles a bit as our room was humid for the entire week, but again we went in July and it was oppressively hot in Mexico. The initial cool air feels good coming in from the outside, but after awhile you could feel the moisture in the air. The tv gets plenty of channels, including several English speaking and movie channels. Maid service was good. We tipped daily and came back to a very clean room every day with one exception. We noticed our sheets and bedspread were not always changed. The grounds around CPM are very nice, including a jungle that extends from the lobby area to the beach/pool area. Very natural surroundings, including wild animals (coati) that aren't afraid to walk up to you and want to be fed. We saw workers cleaning/grooming/sweeping every single day at all hours of the day and night. The walk from the lobby area to the beach/pool is about 1/4 mile. It gets very, very hot. Oh...bring lots of bug spray. The natural jungle environment is laden with mosquitoes. They spray every night around the lobby area but we were mauled the first couple nights until we bought bug spray. A friend of ours by week's end had 77 bites, including a barrage that occured while hiking through the jungle on another tour. Bars/Restaurants CPM offers a lobby bar that gets quite busy at night. The bartenders work very hard and do a great job. There is a disco connected to the lobby that opens at 11:00pm, also has a bar. Only went to the disco once. There is a pool bar that also gets very, very busy during the day. While at the resort, they were only at about 40-50% capacity thanks to the swine flu scare and the overall world economy, but lines were heavy at times at both the lobby and pool bars. Can't imagine what it would be like with fuller capacity. Could be fixed, though, with having more workers. Premium liquors abound. Beer is Dos Equis. Staff do a great job with making drinks and will make them as strong or as weak as you like them. There are three a la carte restaurants at CPM. Tio Pedro is a Mexican restaurant that is excellent. Great food, great service and great drinks. There is a bar inside the restaurant but it is not open for lushes like myself wanting to drink there...only for those eating. The other restaurant, Tortuga, is a Mediterranean restaurant. Food was okay. We had an incident the first time we tried eating there. We waited 1.5 hours for our meals that never came. No water service, no drinks, no bread...nada. We advised the hostess we were leaving and walked out. To be fair, we went back and tried again a couple nights later. Service was still delayed, but we did get our food and it was fine. Hostess made it a point to apologize for the first night, which was unnecessary but appreciated. Third restaurant is extra cost and we didn't eat there. They specialized in seafood, and since we live in Florida, there was no reason to spend $65 on lobster. They opened a brand new Tapas bar while we were there. $15 per person gets you wonderful appetizers and incredible drinks, all with an ocean view. Buffet is near the lobby and is quite a walk from the beach/pool areas. We ate there a few times and really enjoyed it. Good quality, wide selection and much attention to detail. Obviously, in the Caribbean and Mexico there are bugs and with leaving food out it is bound to attract them. The staff had smoke pots, or incense which kept the bugs away. Very creative idea. Snack Bar - near the pools/beach served hot dogs, burgers and a variety of meat and other dishes from 11:00 - 6:00pm. Check out the ice cream....great stuff. Pool/Beach The resort offers a huge pool broken into 3 sections. We didn't spend much time around the pool as it was about 85 degree water...seriously...it felt like bath water. The pool is very nice and is open until 11pm, a nice added touch for night swimmers. Many of the day's activities are centered around the pool. The beach is beautiful, one of the top 3 I've seen. Only comparable to Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana. Miles and miles of white sand and clear, turquoise water. Staff daily raked seaweed and other trash in the mornings. We had great weather and a strong sea breeze all week, but a few days the water was like glass. Truly beautiful. There are tons of angelfish that are used to being fed by guests. Grab some bread from the buffet or snack bar and feed them. It's hilarious how close they get to you. Watersports/Activities/Staff/Service I want to make it a point to emphasize how incredibly awesome the staff at CPM are...for the most part. They work their butts off. We had one incident where our patio door would not lock. We waited and waited and waited and had to call three times before someone finally came. The events staff work tirelessly to get people involved and there were so many activities to participate in....water aerobics, drinking contests, dance lessons, Spanish lessons, stretching, volleyball, soccer, archery.... The other staff were very friendly and worked very hard to make things right if they weren't already. Everyone from bartenders to wait staff, to maids all work very, very hard. We appreciated their efforts as they lent to us having a nice time. Tipping goes a long way, and no, it isn't required or necessary, but it means a lot to the people working there. And it also guaranteed my drinks were waiting or were made ahead of others. Trying to speak a bit of Spanish goes a long way, too. Many of the staff speak 2 or 3 languages and despite some previous postings, the resort does not cater to Italians, or Spanish, or any other nationality. We felt very, very welcome. There is a watersports center and dive shop. They offered kayaking, Hobie cats, parasailing (extra) and jet skis (extra), and many other activities. Excursions While there were booked several excursions. We did a party hopper trip in Playa del Carmen that took us to two bars and to Coco Bongo. A great, entertaining trip. We also did several snorkeling excursions. One to Puerto Morelos, to a protected reef that was amazing. The other went to Akumal Bay, and to a salt/freshwater lagoon. Tons of fish, sea turtles, barracuda, and sting rays. We also took an excursion that went to a Mayan village, to a cenote (an underground fresh water lagoon typically in a cave) and to Mayan ruins. All excursions were great and offered us the chance to see some of Mexico and its culture. OVERALL The CPM is a definite 3 star/sun. It's very quiet there and was super relaxing. We had a great week. Don't go expecting the Hilton or you will be disappointed. The rooms need some definite attention but the resort overall is fine if you are happy with a 3 star/sun. Food is great, service rocks and the beach is amazing. Booking excursions is easy enough. Wear sunscreen. The sun this time of year is brutal. Contact me if you have any questions.

Awesome! Unbelievably Nice! We'll be back! The people that say otherwise are crazy and must be the type that are never satisfied. This was the Best Beach, Best FOOD, Best Service, Best room, Best grounds we have ever experienced, and we have been traveling to Mexico for years. We definitely recommend this place! We started our research on this hotel back in March. We thought we might go back to the previous resort we'd been too called the Allegro, since the service and the food was good on prior trips. However, we thought we should try something different. We are so glad we did, as the Catalonia proved to be worth it! We looked over the ratings of various hotels and stumbled upon the Catalonia. We booked our vacation, but continued to look at the ratings people posted before we went on our trip between March and June. The reviews were of some excellent and some down right bad. Well we were a bit nervous, but thought the bad experiences couldn't have been continual for each day these complaining couples stayed here. So, we were optimistic. We were so pleased, from day 1 of our trip, with the service, the beach, the food, the hotel, room, grounds, everything! We actually thought we would most likely experience a bad day, or something negative during our stay, but NEVER did! Everything was EXCELLENT! We stayed for 5 days in June. Not nearly long enough. We tried to extend our trip, but there was a hang up with the airline. Next time we will be sure to book for a longer stay, for this is a paradise we did not want to leave. The food was Excellent! We were so lazy (Tango Way-buh) and relaxed, we only went to the buffets, so we cannot comment on the restaurants. The buffet had a nice variety and was fresh for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fresh salmon locks, all kinds of fruit, salads, breads, various dishes, freshly made Mexican dishes, tacos, steak, fish, chicken, eggs, bacon, italian, plus your regular favourites hamburgers and fries, milk, chocolate milk, freshly made juices: tangerine, orange, mango, watermelon, even celery, all VERY GOOD! Freshly made Guacamole! Homemade pastries, cakes, pies, yogurts, and ice cream, etc... Too many items to list! You could even get a few things hand made during any meal at the buffet. All free, all part of the package. The beach was by far, the nicest beach I've ever seen. The sand was soft and the ocean, a beautiful turquoise, cool, warm and clean. There was NO crowd at all, so it was very peaceful. We had no problem finding a lounger under the shade or in the sun. The pool was really nice, but rather warm, so we stuck to the beach mostly. The sun heats everything up and is MUCH more intense then in the states, so bring your sunblock. We only spent about 30 minutes directly in the sun, flipping over every 15 minutes. We did that for the first few days, then had to back off, as we were getting plenty of sun and didn't want to burn. We used block 15 on our bodies and 30 on our face. Next time we will probably try 30 block for the body and 45 for the face. You will get plenty of sun, trust us! Be careful! We saw people burned, but they kept tanning. Amazing! Of course, you wouldn't see those people out again for several days, b/c they were probably nursing their burn in their rooms! Never a problem getting a drink, top shelf brands, without even asking. No, you don't have to tip. We chose to tip a little bit each day, maybe the equivalent of a dollar for 3 out of 8 times we were served daily, by bar, by special order at the buffet and with the maid. That was our choice though. We saw NO ONE else tipping. So, it's up to you, but it sure does light up their face when you do tip. We were always taken care of regardless, and so was everyone else we observed, no matter their nationality. We disagree with those who say this place caters to the Europeans. We agree there seem to be more Europeans then Americans/English, but the Europeans did not get any special treatment, nor did we get any less treatment. There are just more Europeans here. We felt like the Europeans were a bit snobby. They would never address you or say \"hello\", in any language, when you passed by them. BUT, the staff? They always smiled and said \"Hola\" when you passed by them. The staff seem to know more Spanish and French then English, but we were able to get along fine with our English and limited Spanish. The people love it when you try to speak their Spanish language and are more then willing to teach you. Even if you butcher their language, they are happy you are making the attempt. Not many Americans were at the resort, we think mainly because of the \"swine\" flew scare nonsense. We totally enjoyed ourselves, and the quiet peacefulness of this resort was just what we asked for. If you are into a party scene, go to Cancun. If you are interested in a quiet, no hassle, comfortable resort where you can eat drink and be merry, then this is the place for you. The Catalonia is Secluded bliss with all you can eat and drink, with an Awesome beach! The room was magnificent! We ordered the upgraded room. It was very nice, very comfortable, and we even had a fridge, which they stocked with whatever we wanted. No problems! The resort grounds are truly amazing! The walk through is mostly shaded by trees and appears like the jungle. Yes, there is a walk you will have to take, depending on where you are on the resort. But, we are active people, and a little walking was FINE with us. After all, we felt better walking, since we were pigging out on all you can eat food and drink. They have a nice workout room, and we thought we would use it, but were too lazy. If we had more time, we would have. We admit, we never left the resort, as we have already seen down town Playa Del Carmen, traveled to pyramids, etc... We only wanted to relax, and so we did. We understand you can catch a ride to Play Del Carmen, but we've already been there. We never asked, because we were content to be lazy and enjoy Catalonia solely. The entertainment staff were very friendly! We got to know a lot of them! We took a private taxi (USA Transfers) to and from the airport. We loved this! A van took us in comfort and air-conditioning, private, direct trip to and from the airport/hotel without having to wait for other couples to be dropped off at their hotels. This not only did this maximize the time at our resort, we didn't have to deal with any other families or couple traveling to their own hotels. Well worth it for the money! It was approximately $100 for the round trip to/from the resort/airport. They showed up ON TIME, each time, and we highly recommend them! It's kind of strange how you pay, part on credit card upon reservation, then the other part in person in cash. We thought this was strange, but we didn't have ANY problems. They also have rave reviews from people on their website too. All glowing reviews. We'll be writing one up soon as well. http://entertainment-plus.net/tour_transport.cfm See our pictures!

Language with resort staff and other guests can be an issue, but if you are willing to put yourself out a little - use some of that high school spanish, hand gestures and a smile it works wonders.

The hotel ended up closing the dinner buffet and we all ate at the hotel resteraunts every night. **Tip - If you go to the Italian ala-cart, get the Cantaloni pasta...IT.IS.AMAZING...I literally moaned when I took my first bite...ok, a little too much TMI! :) Beware the coffee...you might as well have a large cup of espresso, but the cappacinno is great. If you hit up the crepe \"stand\" next to the beach, try the peaches and cream. Very good. I was expecting the walk to be pretty long from the other reviews, but it wasn't too bad. Especially if you're used to a HUGE resort. This seems pretty reasonable. The rooms were outdated, but ok. I think next time we will upgrade. The maids came in even if you put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign up. One day we asked for 5 waters (we also had pop) and they gave them to us. I got a 50 minute massage and I think 15-20 minutes of it was just petting and stroking, over towels of course. I wouldn't spend my money on it again. The beach was beautiful. If you go south past secrets, there is an abandonded building...maybe it was a hotel, but it's really nice to walk to the top and watch the sunrise. Not much selection at the buffets, but that may have been due to the low numbers. We went kyaking (which is free) and it was a lot of fun. I recommend doing it. No collectivos...they don't start until Playa Del Carmen, which is a 200 peso ride...kinda stunk. Next time we'll rent a car.

We were wrong. We kept being told to check back with the front desk every 1/2 hour to 1 hr. The room was finally ready at 6:30 pm. The prior reviews about the front desk manager being rude and unwilling to help is true. Room: We could not get an upgraded room because they were booked during our stay. The room is outdated and the bathroom needs to be fixed and cleaned a little better. Most of the tile are cracked with mold in them. The beds are hard but that is pretty much how they are in Mexico. Our cleaning lady was excellent but I think tips go along way there. The air conditioning broke one day and was miserable in our room but it was fixed before we went to bed. OUr room was on the third floor and I don't think the air conditioner worked the best. They get very few English speaking TV stations. Food: I have absoultely no complaints about the food. We tried both the Italian and Mexican restuarants and they were excellent. The buffet was better than average. Usually I can get sick of buffets by the end of the week but I never got sick of this one. Drinks: Yes, they only have Dos Equis for beer. Their wine is horrible, in my opioion. They only have white or red and it comes out of a beer tap. It is probably comparable to a really bad \"box\" wine in the states. The mixed drinks were ok, not as strong as some places that I have stayed. There are 2 guys that wait on you at the beach. Most of the Europeans do not tip. We found that a tip at the beginnign of the day ensured that you had drinks for the rest of day. There are only 2 bars and I wished they had more. There was not even a swim up bar. Entertainment Staff: Yes, we were Americans at this resort and there were very very few people that spoke English. We knew this going into the resort and did not mind. HOwever, I really never had a problem with the language barrier at all. We were given a green wrist band which designated us as \"American\". We learned that some of the Entertainment staff does not speak English and there are maybe only 5-6 that do speak English. The staff is broken down between nationality. There were certain staff that were \"assigned\" to talk w/ the English speaking people. They try to get you involved in almost anything that they do. The shows were ok, but I have never been big into the shows. All in all we had a great trip. The beach, weather, and food were awesome. If you go expecting that you probably won't run into many English speaking people, then you will be ok. If you can live with an ok room, then you will be ok. But then again, I did not stay in the room that much. Oh... and if you like to take siestas, the resort basically shuts down between 1pm and 3:30pm. Everyone disappears during that time and then show back up. This is much different for me than any other resort. However, the beach is \"active\" till around 7pm or late. It was nice for us because we were at the beach between 1-3:30pm and we were the only ones there.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service & Management, book somewhere else if not too late\u201d", "Author": "Howard2009", "ReviewID": "UR28655680", "Content": "When we arrived at the hotel to chek-in ther was no bell boy to help us with our lugages, the front desk staff are not very nice.

The Food is good and you have a great choice every day. About the rooms, well they are kinda old and need a remodelation as soon as possible. Funitures are trashed and the bathroom needs to be re-built since every tile is broken or coming of the base. We ask for a room change but there wasn\u00b4t any available for the next 3 days?

Maroma is the most beautiful place we have ever been to! And consider we live in Brazil. The water has a blue color we just can't describe. Gorgeous! Perfect! - HOTEL OVERALL: Prepare yourself to walk. To go from our room (6000 building) to the hotel lobby it was a 10 minutes walk. But you walk through mangroves and it's beautiful. Many kinds of birds, the sound of nature. Hey! You are on vacation, so relax and enjoy the walk. - ROOMS: Well, the 6000 build is just nice. Our room was kept clean, without having to pay tips. The room seemed to be refurbished, since some things looked brand new. One day they forgot to replace the bath towels, and when we got in the room there were no towels. We called the reception desk and in about one our they brought us some towels. We've been to Iberostar hotel here in Brazil, and lets say the Iberostar rooms are nicer, but Catalonia rooms also seemed to be just fine. - FOOD: El Pajarito main restaurant is nice, great breakfast, good lunch and good dinner, but we rather have lunch at the Tortuga Snack (near the pool area). We had dinner twice at Tortuga regular restaurant, once at el Pajarito and the other nights we went to Playa and had dinner there. - POOL: Fine! Clean and not crowded at all. - BARS: They have one at the lobby and one at the pool. Also great service in both. - TRANSPORTATION: The hotel offers transportation (free) to Playa, but you have to make a reservation the day before. We rather get a taxi. 200 pesos each way. Much faster and you can also get some useful information with the taxi driver. They do speak a little english and are very polite and friendly. -LANGUAGE BARRIERS: The hotel caters mainly to french and italian. In third place, americans. We were the only brazilian couple there and the only they have had there in the last few years. Lets say 50% of the hotel staff speaks english, but recreation team unfortounately only speak italian and french (and spanish, of course). Kids may face some difficulty. But the language barrier was not a problem at all for us, and we also had the opportunity to learn some spanish! It was nice and funny. Note: in Brazil we speak portuguese.

We found the rooms and grounds very clean, the staff responsive and friendly, and the food great. It has been stated before, and should be empasized that this resort caters to Europeans. Yes, English is a second (or third or fourth! )language among the tourists here, but we were not looking to find new friends amoung the guests - we just wanted to kick back and relax. We speak English only and found absolutely no problem communicating with staff, Yes, like many European beaches about 10% of the women are topless. It seemed very tasteful somehow with many families and no gawkers. There are plenty of loungers to go around and we never had a problem getting one. The beach itself is incredible with soft sand, and warm shallow water with no rocks. Do yourself a favor and take a drink down there after the sun goes down - so peaceful....We dont like the nightlife all that much so didn't try out the disco but it certainly wasn't loud where we were staying so i dont think this is a great place if you are into having a wild time. Also, it is in the middle of nowhere so don't expect to pop out for a drink or a shop. There is no corner store nearby, so if you have a daily need for a Mars bar or Potato chips bring a stock with you. The nearest town is Playa del Carmen and it is a $20 cab ride away (and the resort also supplies a twice daily shuttle bus on a first come - first served basis). The food was fairly consistant throughout our trip - like I said two weeks and we always found something to eat. The atmosphere in the cafeteria wasn't the best - the horrible music made it feel like you were loitering outside a seven-eleven - but the waiters were always prompt and after a while even rememberered to bring a post-meal cappachino to my wife unprompted. We only tried the Mexican speciality place (and went twice) - found it quite good. We never saw the snake that others have reported - thank goodness - but the other animals we encountered were cute including a few pet iguanas in our compound. There were a few drawbacks - the music in the dining room, the fact that there were only two computers for the internet ($10 per hour - we didnt know they had a wi-fi sport for your laptop otherwise we would have brought it), and a horrible fitness area (no bikes or treadmills, just a uni-gym and some free weights), but these certainly didnt detract from our stay. We had absolutely no worries or problems on this trip and I wouldn't hesitate to come back. Tips: 1/ The outside of Cancun airport can be quite chaotic. The people that coordinate the buses and mini-vans to take all the guests from all the tour groups to the various hotels are great, but the logistics are sometimes overwhelming. Grab a drink at the roadside bar there, and just make sure that you keep reminding him of where you are going. Eventually, you will get on a bus and get to your destination. 2/ We went to Playa del Carmen - found it to be a bit of an overpriced tourist trap. That being said, we got some good deals of things that we forgot at the Mega (a sort of Mexican Wal Mart). We also went on a trip to Chetchen Itza which included a swim in the cenotes - found it to be a great deal at $100 a person.

Tripadvisor was immensely helpful to me in choosing the location and there were no surprises. I could see how someone expecting something different could have an awful time, but for us, it was just what we were looking for: an affordable resort on a great beach with good food and some unique qualities. Since I agree with the vast majority of reviews here about the beach (awesome), the rooms (decent), the food (pretty good), and the layout (pretty jungle path - long walk), I'll focus on the culture. Because that is what (besides the beach) sets this resort apart. The place is thoroughly European-dominated, mostly Italian with a good deal of French. There are few Americans - most of the English speakers seemed to be Canadian and competent with French. There is very little English spoken. Most of the staff will understand you enough, but don't expect any announcements to be in English. For those unfamiliar with European vacation norms, there is an interesting juxtaposition worth noting. While the resort and beach is very family friendly (there are many small children, and lots of teens with their parents), the bathing suits can run as skimpy as physics allows. And yes, there is some toplessness on the beach. The Italians and French tended to be polite but reserved, except with those they already knew. Don't expect smiles or conversation, but don't confuse this for rudeness. The children, in particular, are very well behaved. The American style of assumed informality toward strangers, smiles, and chit-chat is not present. Yet not for a second did me or my wife feel the slightest discomfort, snub, or condescension from anyone. The Italians and French drink, of course, but there was zero perceived drunkenness. The bars were always easily accessible and the bartenders friendly and competent. Those after spring break rowdiness, Sandals-type structured activities, or new friends should look elsewhere.

The food was awesome, especially the Tortuga. The guacamole was also great. The buffet food was good but alot of different dishes which we didnt like but was ok because you will not go hungry there. Fish was good, not so much their chicken. The walk to the lobby was wonderful, peaceful and beautiful, if you dont like to walk it is not for you. We had a great vacation in the sun but would have rather stayed at Secrets or the Maroma just because of the fact that the Catalonia was so crowded. The front desk people were nice but not overly friendly.

It was less accomodating and the rooms were falling apart at the seams (ie.fridge didn't work, locks on doors, towle rack, burnt light bulb etc....little things that added up) Main reason for writing - Lock up all your stuff and leave nothing valuable in your room. We had our $800 video camera and ipod stolen from our room. Apparently this is rare - but it happened to us. Staff were not sympathetic at all and very rude. They seemed more focused on the fact there was no \"evidence\" that anything was stolen (at times sounding as if we were making it up!) rather than the fact that someone (ie staff member) entered our room one evening and took our things. Our friends had similar experinces with staff. They had \"lost\" luggage and found staff didn't seem to care or go any distance at all to accomodate (ie extra shampoo/toothpaste etc..) Hey - maybe it was just one of those \"bad luck\" holidays, but Maroma was not at all close to what it was for us last year. We managed to enjoy but will not be returning for a 3rd year.

We stayed for two weeks from Jan 18. We booked last minute with trip central and flew out of Toronto with Air Transat. Terrible airplane food but that is to be expected. Arrived late at night in Cancun, and we were the only two people going to the Maroma. We found our room on the 3rd floor of the 6000 block and we pleasantly surprised at the room, it was an upgraded room with two double beds, flat screen TV, lots of closet space and a nice shower, sink and a toilet that flushed, what more could we ask for. A nice view from the balcony, we could see the ocean in the distance. Food was great, breakfast we had eggs, bacon every second day, sausage the other day, fresh juices and baked breads, lots of fruit. Lunch was either at the buffet or the beach snack bar, the buffet had more selection but the snack bar was fine too. I had salsa and quacamole almost every day, it was fresh and tasty. Supper at the buffet was good, lots of selections, a different meat every night, like duck, beef, pork, etc. Always Mexican dishes as well, and always pasta and pizza. There were two special nights at the buffet, Mexican night and Seafood night. Both were excellent. We went early and took pictures of all the food, I felt like I was on a cruise ship. We did the two specialty restaurants, both were great but I preferred the Mediterranean. We had good service in the lobby, we bought internet cards for $10/50 minutes. We had a ceiling fan that didn't work for the first week but they had to order parts for it and it was replaced our second week. Excellent cappucinos at this resort, we had them at the buffet, the specialty restaurants and the lobby bar, all were good. We tried quite a few drinks at the pool bar, all were good. I did like the fact that they used real bananas in the banana mamas. The beach was wonderful, we walked in the mornings each way, you could go on for miles. The sand was nice and soft, swimming was good, a bit of waves for a few days but lots of fun. Mostly Europeans at this resort, very few English speaking but we did meet a few. This was a nice relaxing vacation, food was good, neither of us had any sickness. Service in the restaurants was good.

We are a couple from montreal aged 27 years old. Lets start with the best part: BEACH: 1 word...amazing... The sand is white and water so clear with different shades of blue. you can walk for miles on this amazing beach. No corals and small to medium waves. Perfect for a little swim and relaxation. There is plenty of chairs, you dont have to wake up at 6 and reserve your chairs. The hotel was booked 100% and even when we arrived at the beach at 10am, there was plenty of chairs available. We give the beach a 5 star rating ROOMS: We stayed in the 5000 bloc on the 2nd level. It`s the closet bloc to the beach and a la carte restaurants. About 8 minute walk to the lobby. But a nice walk it is. A little outdated, but really, how much time do we pass in our rooms ? we are there for the sun and outdoors. They could use a little renovations, but they are ok for sleeping. Always kept clean by the staff and we never ran out of water in our fridge. we give the rooms a 3 stars rating RESORT: The resort is beautyfull...It`s in the middle of the jungle, the walk from the lobby to the beach is really somthing. You walk thrue the jungle on a nice pathway..You can see different animals and lots and lots of birds. There is nice quiet music playing.It`s really something. This is not a big resort and that is the reason why we chose the playa maroma. RESTAURANTS: the is 1 buffet and 3 a la carte restaurant (1 you have to pay extra) The buffet is really good, always plenty to chose from and always different food each day. We tryed the 2 free a la carte and they were really good. Really well decorated and really great service. 1 mexican and 1 french..the extra one is the seafood. Also during the day there is a pancake bar just behind the beach bar...They are really tasty. You need to try them...It`s like a little french bistro with a nice terasse. BARS there is a nice lobby bar with plenty of different drinks to chose, there is also a beach/pool bar. Ther drinks are good, but the coffee is great. With all the europeans there, they have no choice of serving great coffee. For the people who complain about the language problem, I really dont see what they have to complain. The staff mostly speaks english and spanish. They need to consider that the french and Italians have their special animation people on the resort just for them. But The catalonia playa maroma as also their own animation people ( you can recognize them as they have a white and blue t-shirt with the name of the hotel on it). The others are either in red or green, they are there only for the europeans. I really recomend this resort as we had plenty of fun. I would go back for sure.

Including Christmas day celebrations with great festive cocktail and dinner, mariachi and unlimited spanish \"cava\" (bubbly) that makes mariachis sound so much better. Setting of the hotel buildings is absolutely great within a natural mangrove; walking towards the beach and back thru the mangrove is a great relaxing experience; new age music emerging from within the tropical lush vegetation enhances the experience. Best spot to be after a hard day's work laying on the beach is at a table on the terrace by the pool enjoying french style pancakes and a Sombrero (Kahlua + tequila, cream and crushed ice mix). All this accompanied cha-cha / salsa dance lessons (\"un-dos-tres - colata, cinco seis siete - colita\") and ending up with tropical sunsets. Three animation teams - one from France, one from Italy and one from Mexico are doing their best to keep you entertained the whole day (though sometimes a bit overwhelming especially the chief Italian entertainer Ms. Valentina Tosta whose unmistakeable voice follows you everywhere you go, beach, pool, bars, lobby, show, disco, name it, the girl is really everywhere). Very little conationals from Canada, most guests are from Italy and France, so animation is very often in French, Italian or Spanish; therefore not too inviting for Americans but it suited us perfectly. Absolutely great walks on the beach on both sides of the resort, you can go and get back for a total of more than 2 hours to the right towards the Eldorado Maroma resort, with pelicans, crabs, iguanas, horseback riding tourists, marina, etc. to keep your eyes busy while strolling along the incredibly beautiful beach. Did I mention the beautiful sunset on Christmas day ? Twice a day Playa del Carmen shuttles take you to the busy Quinta Avenida where you can have a rather pricey dinner and obscenely high wine prices in a beautiful and perfect people-watching setting at a balmy 25 degrees C feeling more like over 30. Kind of nice when coming from the North Pole. Some of the Playa del Carmen highlights: Mexican wedding in the beautiful small basilica at the corner of Avenida Juarez, mariachis everywhere, usual moon over the Caribeean, bar on the shore next to the Cozumel ferry terminal where on a special tune (oldies) there is the usual waterhosing of the guests - seems to be quite americanized which is not necessarily bad. More Playa del Carmen highlights: Surfing the internet on a terrasse while mexican kids come and sing Christmas carols, friendly policeman of the \"policia turistica\" on ATV stopping and waving so that you can take his picture, North-American imported Santa Claus on Quinta Avenida.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cOld and shabby\u201d", "Author": "Snakemagic", "ReviewID": "UR23213413", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel for two weeks and to put it in a nutsshell it is for sure NOT worth the paid price. 1.

Hotel: In first instance it`s looking actually nicer than it is in real. Beautifully located within the Mangroves-jungle creates hope for a good choice, but .... everything seems old and shabby. Especially the bathroom is not acceptable covered with mildews and foul smelling. At least the cleaning service was acceptable each day., because without it would just be too awful to stay. 3. Beach: The beach seems quite nice for calm tides. At our time there were just many waves and consequently a lot of plants and mud from the sea. The other hotels beside just cleaned mostly of the plants to give a nice chance to take a clean bath, but Catalonia Maroma didn`t do anything. 4. Pool: Old and shabby as well. We didn`t stay one time inside because the water seems to dirty. 5. Catering: Unstable to give a clear answer. The main buffet is just a little bit monotone with ugly wine qualities. The a-la-carte-restaurants are way nicer. Especially Catalonia Maroma just tried to offer higer-quality foods like lobster and seafood but with bad quality. Some shrimps just tasted like flour because of bad quality. And the extra restaurant \"La Terazza\" is just to take some money of the guests without solid quality. In our mind it is additionally not accetable to get cocktails without any fresh fruit. Everything is artificial and cheap so save money by offering low quality. 6. Animation: There is a bunch of shouting guys to animate the guests. In our mind the animation is very inattractive and inconvenient without direct orientation to the guests wishes.

Shows are cute, don't expect Broadway though. The two restaurants apart from the buffett are absolutely wonderful. I had incredible steak and fish over my 7 days here. Try all the restaurants or you are missing out. The service was top notch at those restaurants as well. Spa is decent. The tropical, lush environment with animals and birds is so much better than the nearby sterile, Americanized resorts.

We are no rookies when it comes to traveling to Mayan Riviera, we have traveled to Playa del Carmen every year for the last 16 years and have stayed at different hotels everytime. This place was different, not because it was a 3 star hotel but this place caters to europeans (italians, french and spaniards) and if your not use to the way they vacation; this can be an experience. Before I get in to any specifics, let me tell you the beach here is the best. This beach was voted #1 beach in Mexico and other hotels on this beach are: Secrets Maroma, Maroma Beach Hotel (very expensive) & Catalonia Playa. The reason I say this hotel is okay for an \"american\" is because the life styles we carry here in the US, all we want is relaxation, great food, excellent service and we get to sleep in as much as possible. Well, at this Hotel be prepared; rooms are very noisy, you can hear people talk that are walking by, constant moving around at every hour of the day. These Europeans do not sleep?? they are all up at about 6:30 am having breakfast and hit the beach by 7:30 annoying you for hours at the beach while they all SMOKE! Be prepared they are smoking all over this place, pool area, restaurants, lounge, lobby, etc. It was very annoying and hard to avoid. If you love to SMOKE this is the place for you. There is not a good lay out of the restaurants. You are having to walk pretty far from one end to the other and it gets exhausting. The europeans love to walk so they don't mind. There is no beach bar service area; if you want a drink or food, you need get it yourself. There is no one coming by asking if you want something to drink while you lay at the beach :o( . The food is okay, not that great. The presentation looks better than it taste. Like I said before, they are at a great location as far a the beach goes and offer free shuttle service into town 2x during the day and free WI-FI in the lobby area. As an american, we still need to connect into the real world and work our butts off with this economy. And the europeans....... they just keep smoking away.

They are all friendly, especially the mother. Bring some food for them. Grab some burgers from the buffet. Now keep walking to your right. The dogs will probably follow you.

We booked our dream vacation through the dumbest and worst travel agency ever called Cheap Caribbean whose hired help consists of a bunch of TELEMARKETERS most of which are clueless how to book vacations for you. Cheap Caribbean has also been written up as Unsatisfactory by the Better Business Bureau (who I contacted to file a complaint for my money back) 38 times complaints on file in the past few years in the Eastern Pennsylvania BBB. That is pretty bad!! In the form of my most favorite comedian I am placing my review of the compound from hell Cheap Caribbean called a hotel. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF you like light airy room. Their rooms were OLD, dark, poorly maintained, smell like hell, with tile falling apart everywhere. Cheap Caribbean agency told us this hotel was charming & rustic. We would like to correct them and call this hotel a demolition sight. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like to be able to enjoy views from your open windows and fresh air. THERE ARE NO VIEWS FROM ANY ROOMS IN THE PLACE and NO WINDOWS at all only sliding doors, which work sometimes, and once open everyone walking by your room can see in from one of many views. This goes for all the rooms. So if you like privacy and openness you will not find it here. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like air conditioning. Most of the rooms have none and if they actually work it is minimally. You can\u2019t stop sweating especially in the Summer month. We were unlucky enough to have a room which had no air conditioning. After 8 calls to the front desk (located a \u00bc miles away from the rooms), the staff finally wandered over to our room at 10 PM. They defrosted the coils and about a small pools worth of water spilled out of the coils that were frozen solid. Bet this puppy has not worked for a while. They changed our room at midnight, we repacked our cloth, and my two 7-year-old twins cloth, woke the poor kids up and went to our new room. The new room had air conditioning but you could just barely feel it when it was placed on full blast. So you sweated a LOT in your sleep. My 7 year old son asked me on the second day of our stay if we had come to Mexico to die? I told him I hoped not and that is when I began packing again to make our great escape. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you don\u2019t like being electrocuted in your own room. Yes in dead my husband turned on a switch the second morning we were in the room and he was thrown backwards by the bad electric switch this hotel called a light. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like room service and well trained staff that knows what it takes to run a hotel and care that you are far from home. There is no one there for you friends. You are on your own. You will find the staff to be apathetic, useless, inconsiderate, lazy, and flippant even if you do speak Spanish as I can. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you expect the electricity to work for you and you don\u2019t like being electrocuted in your own room. Yes in deed my husband almost bit it when he turned on a light switch the second morning we were in our new room and he was thrown backwards by the bad electric switch this hotel called a light. All I heard was of [----] and away he went backwards from the jold of electricity. Well that was clue #2 that maybe when a 7-year-old figures out that we should not really be here and my husband is almost electrocuted we need to get out of dodge. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you are traveling with a handicap husband with two bad knees and who can barely walk yet we were promised a hotel with easy access to all amenities about 16 different times from Cheap Caribbean. Each time I spoke to them they told me that my husband would be well taken care of. Yep leave it to those good old gals at the telemarketing school of how to make Cheap Caribbean rich while hurting their customers. There are no handicap anything here. My poor husband had to hobble to and from \u00bc mile to eat about 6 times a day. If you needed ANYTHING AT ALL the service desk located in the front \u00bc mile of the hotel you had to walk to them, they did not come to you because in all reality they did not want to walk the \u00bc mile to get to you. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you want to use a telephone. Don\u2019t do it. This hotel knows how to nickel and dime you for everything they can think of. Catalonia Playa Marona is for you if: you like walking non-stop to everything you need to get to in 100% humidity and 100 degree temperatures. After two days from hell in the Maroma, with not a single person to help us with anything, my husband, myself, and our 7-year-old twins, left the hotel in a taxi in the hopes of saving our vacation and finding a hotel to take us in and hopefully save our vacation. The hotel attempted to stop us and the officiallys there gave our taxi driver the third degree about where we were going. He had to tell them or else.........who knows. On our first try at finding a new hotel we found heaven. The new hotel we stayed at was finally home. It was professionally run beyond our wildest dreams, cared about us in every way, room service came with a smile and in less than 15 seconds, had the MOST comfortable rooms we have ever seen, drop dead killer views from all the windows, huge Jacuzzi tubes, wine waiting for us with two glass wine cups, all inclusive even alcohol, fun fun fun people, elegant air conditioned dining facilities with 5 star cuisine and service unmatchable. Our new hotel was 360 degrees different from our hold hell hole\u2026\u2026\u2026.our vacation was saved and we even stayed an extra week just because we liked the new hotel so much. Please be careful there are lots of really bad places in the Riviera Maya and you may never know it until you know what you are missing out on. I now know of only 2 really nice places to stay but that is it\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026ask lots of questions. We have also found out that Cheap Caribbean. Com travel agency is not only a telemarketing company but it has not storefront at all. It is just a call in company. They have an address but they are not there if you go visit them. We have filed several complaints with the BBB, and the attorney generals office, which we feel, should shut them down. I hope all this makes some sense since I wrote it really fast\u2026\u2026\u2026 photos from new hotel Happy traveling.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at Catalonia Playa Maroma\u201d", "Author": "nika111", "ReviewID": "UR19938410", "Content": "Great trip! Beautiful beach, hotel is located between a jungle so it is very tropical looking all the way from the lobby to the pools and beach area. The food was great at buffets, something different everyday.

Drinks were very good, Banana Mama made with fresh fruit, bananas, very nice. Entertainment staff is amazing. They are always involved with the tourists getting everyone to participate in bocci ball volleyball aerobics and other games or activities. At least 90% of the tourists were from Italy and France so no to many people spoke english, but we didnt really mind. We upgraded rooms for $30 a day. There are 4 of these rooms on the top floor of each of the 6 buildings. They have beautiful washrooms with a rainshower and just overall much nicer than standard rooms. The beach was so beautiful but many waves due to the hurricane Gustav influence on the Gulf of Mexico. The workers said their beach is usually even more beautiful, calm waters and you can walk and walk with water only reaching your knees. I would recommend this hotel even though it was rated a 3.5 star I would give it a higher rating. It doesnt have a pool swim up bar, pool should be resurfaced as the bottom is a bit rough.. but very big and beautiful pool and grounds around it. Hotel was 50% full.

This was our second visit to the Yucatan Peninsula. I'm giving this a \"Okay \"rating as this resort has many down sides but has the BEST beach I have come across. The sand was soft and no rocks to be seen. Therefore no snorkeling as there is no reef. This is a huge Italian and French resort. The staff spoke French and Italian but very little English. The beach staff made sure that everyone with a blue or red band (French or Italian clubs) were included in all activities. If you wore a green band ( English or other) they routinely excluded you. There were only 2 bars, one at the beach/pool area and one in the main reception building. Line ups were long. The bar menu was limited. If you chose something on the menu, no problems. If you wanted something else, they automatically didn't understand English. They had only one buffet restaurant, one snack shack and 2 ala carte restaurants, which only one was open every night. Both the buffet and snack shack were housed outside so the birds would come in and eat off the breads, the bugs would be found in the fruit etc.. The food quality was good, not great. Not much variety after 14 days. The rooms were fair size, musty smelling from the air conditioner. We had to ask to move rooms as our first room smelled real bad and the air conditioner didn't work well. The cleaning staff was good. We had to ask them to change the sheets and clean the floor a few times even when leaving tips. All in all the staff was great, and tried to help out when needed. There is limited night life at this resort, the shops closed at 5pm. After a day at the beach, all there is to do is sit at the reception area and drink. They had a one man band singing from 6pm to 9pm every night. He sang the same songs night after night. The theater started at 10pm and they only spoke Spanish, French and Italian. So we didn't understand what they were saying so left half way thru and never returned. The disco started at 1200pm to 2pm. They had a free shuttle in to Playa del Carmen at 10AM and picked you up @ 6pm. This resort had very limited amenities. In my opinion, if all you want is beach then this is a place you might enjoy otherwise look somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our stay but will not returned. Spend a little more where you have a greater variety or restaurants and amenities. The language barrier was expected but I didn't think we should have to have less service because we were not French and Italian.

After reading many reviews before leaving for the resort, we definitely took some advice: if you don't get a \"premium\" room at first, UPGRADE!!! The 1st room we had was \"okay\", but had a mildewy smell and the room's safe kept messing up. It was replaced twice. After a couple days of this, we upgraded and were completely satisfied with the new room; they stock the fridge with more than just water in the new rooms! Not completely sure what a lot of other people complain about for this resort; in my book, I just write those ones off as folks who are probably used to being jet-set travellers checking in to a different resort each week. The beach is BEE-utiful! The food will keep you going; not gourmet, maybe, but better than what I usually make at home. When you go to the buffet (the main chow-hall by the lobby) spray down with bug-spray 'cause the skeeters will eat ya. And (we found this out the hard way) don't put any stock in the \"rule\" about being dressed to the nines for the \"reservation only\" restaurants; make your res and show up. If you have long pants and a collared shirt... cool... if not, oh well... you still eat. Overall, I have no complaints about this resort. My first international excursion was primo, thanks to these folks! The staff keep you involved, especially if you linger in the lobby area in the evening for the live entertainment. And when you go to the bar in the lobby, ask for the \"boom-boom on the playa\" (sex on the beach). The regular \"boom-boom\" is awesome, too! If you're worried about Montezuma's revenge... ask for your drinks with \"no jello\"... means \"no ice\".

This hotel is absolutely gorgeous! The grounds are lush and well taken care of. It is truly a Mexican style property with bright colors and open areas. The food was very good in both the buffets and the Tio Pedro restaurant. The mediteranean restaurant was closed the day we wanted to eat there so I can not comment on that one. The beach! OMG i can not say enough, it is simply gorgeous. This resort is so isolated and not commercial around it at all. No high rise resorts like in Cancun. The water is simply beautiful and the beach is very wide. There are shade shelters and most of the time you can find chairs under the shade. One thing we did dislike is people would put their towels on a chair in the shade and then leave and be gone for hours and hours. I thought that was rather rude. Always was a game of volleyball or bocci ball going on. I will warn you if you are going to go to this area in the summer be prepared, IT IS HOT! All area's are open air and the only airconditioning is in your room or the specialty restaurants. If you get a seat under a nice fan it was okay. Also, bring bug spray. At night the mosquitos are vicsious. The management did start putting out citronella candles which help a bit but i do recommend the bug repellent. We put it on before going to dinner and never had a problem. Also, if you have difficulty walking you will have a hard time at this resort and most in this area. If you get a room in the 3000 block or 4000 block you are pretty much in the center of the resort and it is easier. But it is hot and walking through the jungle you will feel the heat more. We had read alot of the other reveiws and decided before going to upgrade our room when we got there. It was well worth the $30.00 a day additional. The bed was very comfy, room comes with a dehumidifyer. Set on 50% and we would pull almost 1 gallon of water a day out of the room. Also, upgraded room comes with minibar stocked with water, soda and beer. The rooms are new and the bathroom is all marble tile with an awesome shower. However, all upgraded rooms are on either the 2nd or 3rd floors and there are no elevators so be prepared to do stairs. Our room was always well stocked and clean, we never had to ask for a thing. Also, this hotel is owned now by a spanish company. They cater more to the Europeans. Mostly Italien, French and Spaniards. The staff is wonderful however, and most can speak enough english to help you. Actually the staff is awesome! Make sure to have Dondie in the lobby get you a drink in the daytime, she is so sweet and speaks english so well. Also, because there are so many europeans be prepared for smoke. They all seem to smoke and they don't care where they do it at. Most make no attempt to interact with you at all if they realize you only speak english. From everyone i've talked to who has travelled to this part of Mexico, most of the resorts are mosty european, so it is not really indicative of this hotel and I wouldn't let it stop you from staying here. We truly enjoyed our stay here and would definately go back again, but this time not in the summer. This is a nice family, couple vacation spot.

Because we booked this last minute, and we had a price range there wasn't much to choose from and although I had read some bad reviews, I decided it couldn't be as bad as people had described. Let me start this review by saying that if you speak English, you are going to be a minority, and don't expect many people to speak to you. This hotel is definitely catered to the European crowd, and upon speaking with the hotel staff, the informed us that the resort had been an \"Italian Only\" resort, and they had opened it up to all travelers in late 2006. The resort is a little outdated, and the rooms aren't that great. The first room we had was leaking, with water all over the floor. Upon mentioning it, they said someone would come to fix it, however it wasn't fixed and we eventually had to change rooms. The washroom in our room and our friends were pretty gross and you needed to wear flip flops at all times. We didn't have any problems with bugs or ants, and since your not in the room that much....it's not a big deal. The beach was okay, been to better beaches. The water was not crystal clear, but the sand was white and beautiful. The food is pretty good at the buffet, and we actually prefered the buffet to the a la cartes. Was disappointed there was no 24 hour snack bar, but the snack bar at the beach had alot of things to choose from, and the salsa and guacamole was AMAZING. The drinks were okay, and although there was a 24 hour bar at the front it seemed like they didn't want to serve you after 12. We would have to stand at the bar waiting while the staff talked to each other. Overall, I would not visit this resort again. It wasn't worth the money we spent, and I wish we had spent another a bit more to stay elsewhere. One more thing....when buying anything at the shops please be sure the count your change, as the woman working at the cash desk tried to short change us.

We had to go out of our way to make conversation at the buffet with our server, almost like pulling teeth - but had no problem chatting it up with the french group beside us. whatever. The rooms are horrible. Ants everywhere, I know it's the jungle but come on. The ceiling fan didn't work in one of our rooms. Our 2 rooms were at opposite ends of the building. The shower is gross!

We just got home yesterday (June 6th) and are pretty happy to be home. Here's our breakdown: First Impression: BAD. Long, bumpy road to the hotel - embarrassing and didn't instill much confidence in the hotel's quality. Rooms: VERY BAD. Outdated, no working remotes, loud AC, fan on the verge of flying off the ceiling, hard bed, sandpaper towels, scary bathroom. And oh yeah, ANTS. We changed rooms, but wished we would have upgraded to the new rooms for $30/day. These rooms were much much nicer. Food: GOOD. The buffet offered a good selection of Mexican/North American cuisine - something for everyone and it didn't taste bad at all. The a-la-carte restaurants (all 2 of them...the third costs extra) pretty much serve the same food as the buffet with different presentation. If you're picky, stick to the Mediterranean. Drinks: OKAY. The mixed drinks were a little watered down but still tasty. Weakest Pina Colada ever. We recommend the Conga. You have two beer options: light and dark. Both are no-name and kind of taste like Corona. Takes a few to feel anything from them. Service: GOOD. The staff is always cheerful and eager to serve you. We were advised by our tour rep to tip a buck here and there and, to be honest, we could sense that the servers fully expected it. But this seems to be how it is everywhere we went...always asking for tips. Entertainment: GOOD - if you are fluent in Italian, French or Spanish. 90% of the guests at this resort don't speak English, and we knew this going in. But the language gap definitely affected how much we participated in the daily activities (and how often we were invited to join in). We didn't go to the nightly shows, so we can't comment. Beach: BEAUTIFUL. Long, soft white sand. The water was a little rough because of the weather, but was a nice temperature and clear. Lots of lounges. Pool: OKAY. Went in once. Few lounges available. Overall, the place is OKAY if the weather cooperates, you spend lots of time on the beach and know conversational Spanish. We're a young, english-speaking couple and definitely felt out of place.

They should really think about repaving the road. Check in went smoothly. I read reviews on tripadvisor before we went so i kind of had an idea what to expect. We went ahead and upgraded our room after we saw the hideous original room. I have been to my share of hotels in Mexico and havnt ever seen a hotel room as bad as this one. It was clean but very outdated. The shower looked as though you needed to wear flip flops in it. As i said we upgraded for $30 a day which was WAY worth it. If they have availability you should def do it. The beds are a lot more comfortable and the bathroom is great! It has a great walk in shower with a \"rain\" shower head. The walk to our room from the lobby was a long one. We were lucky to be in the middle (3000 block). It was good exercise and the walkway is paved with beautiful jungle. Everything else was great! The staff was great and very helpful. The food was wonderful! The pool was nice too. They have 3 restaurants and a snack bar by the beach. You should def make reservations at \"La tortuga\" restaurant. They have great Mediterranean food a la carte. The beach was good. Everyone said the beach was the most beautiful they have ever seen but to me it looked the same as the beach in Cancun. It was still very pretty though. This is definatly a resort for older people. There are also very many italians and French people there. That is mainly the majority of who all is there. Very little americans at all. You def feel like the outcast.

CHECK IN: Took less then 5 minutes and also received a welcome drink at that time. They accomendated our request made with the travel agent for a room close to the pool/beach are. ROOM: The walk to our block 5000 took about 5 minutes. This pathway is also used to get to and from the lobby. Block 5000 is closest to the beach but farthest from the lobby, theatre, main buffet. It's not well lit at night. The room was outdated. Bed was hard and pillows too. The sheets did not get changed until we noticed a smelland asked. The shower made me uncomfortable! I wore my extra flipflops in it. We didn't have warm/hot water the last two days. If you can afford the 30 dollars a day to updgrade, do it. I posted a pic in this review. We did it the last two nights and wish we done it earlier. TV There is only 2 english speaking channels. cnn, and another channel that repeated shows every few hours! Fox news was fuzzy in our room. Upgraded rooms have the same but with a flat screen. GROUNDS: This is a big resort. I liked being close to the jungle. It's very clean and green. Although more flowers would have made it more pretty. There r maps all over to help you out. Construction is taken place next door, but the noise didnt bother us, SECURITY: We heard about a few guests who had trouble getting into their inroom safes (but were fixed within hours). You will see a lot of security guards around which made us feel very safe. We had a towel bar down and the whole time the maintenance worker was in our room fixing it, the security guy was right outside our door waiting for him to come out. LANGUAGE: you will be able to communicate with this hotel staff and 95% of the guests If you speak spanish, french or Italian. It was hard to ask for things and get it across to them. Asking for an extra towel or toilet paper from the maid was difficult. This bugged us the first day but we did the best we could to speak with all. Bartenders knew a little English. European guests did not seem to smile and don't give you room walking down the path, We just brushed this off. AFTERNOON: Between the hours of 1 and 4 the pool and beach areas will empty. It seems that this time was for napping. You can find some chairs with shade during this time if you didnt in the earlier hours. We loved this time. FOOD: Typical for a 3star hotel. Not much variety. The meat made me uneasy since it looked raw for most. So we stuck with the pasta, rice and breads.,,,carbs! Breakfast was the best!! We stuffed ourselves every morning. The snack bar was always the same, burgers, hot dogs, rice, amazing fries, pizza, fruits and some dessert. BARS: Lobby bar was 24 hours. But we adored the staff and service much better at the beach/pool bar. Our favorite drink was the banana mamas. If you feel your drink is watered down, they are more then happy to add more liquor for you. Beach bar is where you can request ice cream cones too. During the afternoon nap hours, a waiter would come around to the pool and beach area to take drink orders. SHOPS: there was a few shops to visit by the pool area. Souvenirs, bathing items and convenience shop. You can probably get items cheaper in the city. Also a spa and hair salon that we didnt visit. We also did not enter the fitness room. Every thursday a few vendors from the city come and try to sell things in the lobby. Tshirts are very easy to bargin for. I paid 8 dollars instead of the18 he was asking for. ENTERTAINMENT: Again, these entertainment staffers cater more towards the Italians, Spanish and French guests. I think I saw one show that was in English. This would have been a lot more fun if they were English. After the third day we stopped watching them altogether. Water arobics were done in french. You were never pressured into joining in fthe activities. One staffer would attempt to scare the guests sleeping on the lounge chairs by wearing a monkey mask and tapping them on the shoulder.. My sister jumped so high when he got her! Watching it happen to others was hilarious! THIS hotel is not a Party Hotel at all. If you are looking to hang out with singles and have a great night life, go somewhere else. It's more families and couples. besides us, we saw 4 others that were just friends. It was a great place to just relax. POOL: You will find more people at the beach than the pool. It had a nice lay out. Clean and great temperature. We spend the afternoons here most times. Both of us brought water floats with us and enjoyed the pool to ourselves tanning on them. It's not hard to grab a chair along the pool. BEACH: Saved the best for last. It was beautiful. Apparently it's also the best in the area. Soft white sand with blue water. Small waves to cool you off. No garbage or seaweed at site. Ashtrays are available under the shaded areas. Staff collected water cups every hour. No need to wake up early to save your seat in the sun or in the shade! There's plenty of chairs to go around. It's a big area. The shaded areas could have had more shade though. I found being under the huts werent always a great way to get out of the sun. Sun peers in threw the spaced out wood above. And boy can it get VERY hot by the jungle. Walking to the left will bring you next door to a spa hotel that had very comfy bedlike tanning mattresses on the beach. We laid on them every morning until their guests came out. You will not find local beach vendors selling items AIRPORT: The bus ride to and from the airport is about half hour. watch your bags when your entering their airport to come back home. One person on our bus had their luggage stolen. As soon as our bus stopped, the outside staff opened the baggage compartment before any of us got off the bus. ~*~ Overall, a great week. I would have liked a better shower so I could have felt more clean afterwards. Words can't explain the beauty of the beach! But if I had an extra 200-400 dollars, i would stay at a diff hotel and not this 3 star hotel.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding location\u201d", "Author": "Yeicho", "ReviewID": "UR16220093", "Content": "Having stayed in different resorts in the Mayan Riviera in the past, we chose Catalonia Playa Maroma for its location (one of the best beaches of the world) and its incredible price.

Rooms are large and comfortable, a little bit dated and basic, but having a fabulous beach and so many options to visit, the room was ok for us. Rooms are located in villas and are very quite. The hotel is nested within a mangrove jungle, so occasionally you can see coatis, chipmunks, iguanas, lizards and birds. An \"environmental translator\" has two daily trips around the hotel and she explains facts about plants and animals living in the area. I don't know why many people disliked the pool, we found it fun, it's great for kids, and it has a section where you can practice your swimming skills. There's a free shuttle bus to Playa del Carmen that departs from the hotel twice a day. Go there, Playa del Carmen is busy, with lots of restaurants and stores, but don't expect the typical colonial Mexican Town. The animation team is the heart and soul of the hotel, they invite guest to participate in different sport activities, and fun games, if you don't want to join them a simple \"no thanks\" is enough. These guys and girls really move crowds and you'll notice the response they get from the guests, from aqua gym, to Latin dance lessons to beach volleyball. Don't miss the lobby bar at night, they might ask you to dance with them. The nightly shows are pure fun, because the boys and girls from the animation team are the main performers, so go and watch your new friends performing extracts from musicals like \u201cGrease\u201d or \u201cChicago\u201d. You'll notice how the staff at this resort is truly authentic and friendly; they make every effort to make sure you're having a nice stay. Just some final words, this beach and the resort environment is beautiful, so please respect it, try to get in touch with locals and other guests, you'll get a smile back.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice Beach as advertised\u201d", "Author": "BeachExpert", "ReviewID": "UR15875038", "Content": "My wife and two kids, ages 9 and 11, went to the Catalonia Playa Maroma 4-14 April. We had an enjoyable stay. This is our 4th visit to the Riviera Maya area. I feel this was our best hotel pick yet. We have stayed at the Catalonia Royal Tulum before. It has a great beach also, nicer rooms, but the food selection was a little less. The Windham Maya had great shows, where as both Catalonia\u2019s had more adult shows with less talent. The Windham more of a Broadway show with actually singing (not lip synching). The Windham beach was destroyed in the last hurricane so it is now very short. I scan photographs to find the best beaches. My criteria is that the hotel has to have a superior white sand beach, with good food and few complaints about the food. I was happy with my choice. They had a wide selection of food and I thought the food was very good. And I like to eat. The Beach is the best in the area and one of the best in the world. Other than perfect white sand and blue water the water was not rough. Cancun proper had huge waves and the Moon Palace had a red flag all week, where our friends said they could not go in the water all week. They have two nice catamarans that were great to use. You can take them out for 25 minutes. The guy told me if he had to come out and rescue me he would charge me $20. I had to laugh. Let me address a popular posting question: the Italians and French. It turns out that the Lookea French tour agency (red bands) and Ventaglio Italian tour agencies (blue bands) are sort of partners with the hotel. I was told that Ventaglio had 125 rooms reserved for their guests (and I thought he said those rooms had bidets in them because they like to feel like they are at home). Both tour agencies supply about 6 people for the animation group. So the reason why so many shows are in French and Italian is that the animation team is French and Italian! That didn\u2019t bother me but my wife felt that if we were all paying for a stay there that they should not get special activities, special shows, and people to make their experience enjoyable. If you did not make a reservation from those two agencies you get a green band and are essentially unrepresented. They do get special treatment from their tour agencies. Depending on how much this fact bothers you or how much this impacts you this may or may not affect your stay. I did not feel that they were load or boisterous any more than any other group. Everyone essentially stayed in family groups. The pool is not very interesting and we rarely saw too many people in it. We got a few mosquito bites, so I began wearing long pants to dinner. The new Secrets hotel is set in concrete just South of the hotel. It will be a much nicer hotel than Catalonia with views for all, but it will be more expensive. There was no noise while we were there. It appears that the major construction is over. The rooms are a little dated. There were always plenty of chairs with no need to save chairs.

That should tell you how nice the beach and location was....however here is our view of our vacation. We have just returned from our 3 week stay at the Catalonia Playa Maroma. Beautiful beach, wide white sand, and no rocks , seaweed and perfect for swimming. You can walk forever. Lots of chairs at any time. Not sure about the pool, but any time we walked to and from the beach there were always chairs available. W have travelled to Punta Cana,. DR, Margarita Island, Venezuela, Cuba and other parts of Mexico and this beach is one of the top. We heard it's rated one of the top 10 in the world by the Travel Channel. At least 200 feet deep of beach and cool white sand. Food is fine, a bit repetitive after 3 weeks, but you will certainly not go hungry. Mexican night is on Thursday, lots too eat. I actually perfer Mexican food and wished they had more of it on a regular basis at the buffet. The ala cartes I heard were wonderful, in the 3 weeks stay we never went, so the buffet must have been fine.. The snack bar located to the left of the pool always had great burgers, panini's , fries, chicken nuggets or pizza. Hotel staff are very accomodating, no problem with any language as they speak at least 4. The hotel is clean and yes the beds are a little on the hard side, but slept fine. The rooms could use some interior decorating but if this happens the price will also go up as with a beach like the one they have could certainly ask more. The Spa hotel to the right of the hotel on the same beach charge for 1 night what you pay for 1 week at the Catalonia. You share the same sun and beach for a fraction of the cost. Yes, lots of European travelers, but we always found a few English speaking to pass the time. Go with the idea you will have a great vacation and you will.

I read many reviews on Tripadviser which helped us make our decision to stay here and we were not disappointed. We arrived around 7pm and were met with a refreshing drink and a quick and curteous check-in. Our rooms were not adjoining but side by side and we felt very safe at this resort.The kids room had 2 double beds and ours had a king bed and we found the rooms to be clean and comfortable. We were located in the block closest to the lobby and restaurant and furthest from the beach but it was no more than the 3 minute walk to the water and we enjoyed the walk down the beautiful walkway. The beach was incredible -- soft, powdery white sand that never got too hot, beautiful water and swimming area with no rocks or corral (didn't need water shoes) and lots of beach chairs (never had to rush to save seats). My kids and husband went kayaking a couple of times and we all did 2 trips with Divy Dive right there at the beach to go snorkeling at the nearby Maroma reef. The guides were awesome and spoke good English and we really enjoyed this experience. We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Some spoke better English than others, but all tried and were very curteous and pleasant and helped us pick up a little Spanish. The majority of the guests there were Italian and French and although we couldn't communicate we found them to be friendly. (I'd smile and say hello to most people and I'd receive and smile and nod back.)Everything was announced in Spanish, Italian, French and then English so you'd have to listen carefully for instructions but it was no big deal. We really didn't mind being in the minority for once. The food was great and mostly we ate at the main buffet. We did try the Mediterranean al a carte one evening, but my kids didn't like it so we didn't eat there again.(My meal was good though.) The main buffet was great for kids because there was always fresh fruit, yummy bread, and pizza. The snack bar down near the pool was also good for kids as they served hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken nuggets, fish fillets, and the best fries I've ever had. As well as fresh fruit. We found the entertainment staff to be fun and funny and we enjoyed the nightly entertainment as well as the piano man in the lobby every evening. The entertainment staff may cater to Europeans but we were invited to participate in different activites and could choose to or decline as we wanted. The resort offered a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen and we took it twice. It was comfortable and air-conditioned and they dropped you off right at 5th Avenue where all the shops are. We never took the shuttle home because it left at 10am and returned at 5pm and that was longer than we cared to stay in town so we took a taxi back to the resort for $15, but it was nice to have that option.The negatives of this place were there were always a few topless sunbathers at the beach or pool and also that a lot of people smoke and we are used to the \"no smoking in public\" policies in Canada. But overall we had a wonderful time here and would highly recommend it for an excellent family vacation. It was a peaceful, relaxing vacation in a clean, well-maintained resort with a gorgeous beach and great food and entertainment.

The beach was amazingly beautiful as promised and the food was actually very very good. Even just the regular buffet. Lots of choices for even the pickiest of eaters. All the fresh fish was wonderful. We only ate at the a la carte Mexican Restuarant and it was wonderful. We ate at the main buffet the rest of the time and I must say it was my best all inclusive food experience in Mexico. Even the coffee was wonderful. They had cappuccino/expresso machines at the main beverage bars. AWESOME!! They really do cater to Europeans, hardly any Americans were there, which was fine by us. I even got to practice my spanish. Topless women abound as is the custom in Europe. Dont go here if this offends you. Crowd was mixed. Familes and groups, all ages. Not too many young partiers. No groups under 21, at least that I could tell. Important for you to know. The new rooms are now considered an upgrade. They even have a sign when you check in. You pay $30 extra per day for the upgraded rooms. Which actaully seems fair because they really are very much an upgrade from the regular rooms. We decided not to upgrade because none of the new rooms had 2 double beds. Luckily our room was fine and it all worked out. Room Clean and everything worked. They really are just in need of renovation. The room was nice enough just old. If you are picky and want luxury, book the NEW room. It is worht the price. My husband would not have stayed in the old room. We girls were fine. But by European standards, the old rooms are like new. Important to note: The West side of the property is under construction. Guests staying on that side should request an interior courtyard room, or an interior room to the midway of the resort. I would assume the resort next door will take about another 6 months to complete. Service. Wow!! for a 3-4 star resort they were on it. Everyone was very friendly. And eager to please. Every request was met with a smile. There is no beach service for drinks. However, they are constantly picking up and keeping the beach free of cups, plates etc. There is a main drink bar close to the pool and beach. Premium liquor is happily served upon request. Drinks are made per order and we never had a long wait at the bar and or anywhere else for that matter. Full spa on site actually has fair market prices. They do not jack up the price like most other resorts, so indulging in a spa treatment is totally doable. Beach chairs always available no need to rush the beach or save spots. NICE!!! We did do a $25 short snorkeling trip right from the resort. The boat picked us up on the beach. The reef was right off shore. It was awesome to swim in the sea with the fish and see the coral. We were back on the beach within an hour and a half. I have paid more for similar trips. Ofcourse they do night parties, shows and they have a disco. We were in bed by nine every night so I could not rate this area of the resort. Sorry we did our cocktailing in the afternoon on the beach. However, several folks were coming in as we were getting up for coffee. They all seemed to have had a great time. Ofcourse they have a full activity staff on site that is there to make sure everyone has a good time. They were not too in your face. We really came to relax on the beach and stayed away from the fanfare. If traveling with kids there really did seem to have lots of fun things for them to do as well. I would go here with my son in a heart beat. One day they did a mini olympics in the pool area. They had a series of survivor like events set up. The kids and young adults looked like they were having fun. I would go next door to MAROMA with my husband for a romantic trip. Catalonia was perfect for our girls trip and groups traveling together.

We were not looking for a party resort, but wanted a good deal and a place that would be nice and relaxing. We read many reviews of the Catalonia Playa Maroma (CPM) and decided that the good reviews out-weighed the bad ones and stayed at the CPM from March 29th-April 5th. Our hotel room was simple, but nice. It was cleaned every day and the bathroom, although also simple, had everything that we needed. The rooms are right in the middle of the jungle and we woke up every morning listening to the birds! There are numerous geckos and small iguanas all over the hotel complex and for us, being from the cold, wind-swept prairies, this was quite exciting. Depending on which hotel 'block' you stay in, you can be a little far from the beach. However, the walk is no more than a 3 minutes. The other thing to consider is that if you are in the block furthest from the beach, as we were, you are closest to the dining hall and entertainment. So, in the end, it all balances out. The food at CPM was great! The buffet had many options. If you weren't interested in being adventurous with your food choices, there were always 'american' options, such as pizza, available. The resort also has theme nights at the buffet such as seafood night and Mexican night. We enjoyed the food at the buffet so much that we only took advantage of one of the a la carte restaurants. The food and atmosphere at the Mexican a la carte restaurant was great. Make sure you ask a waiter for some Mayan coffee. The display they put on making the coffee is well worth it! Dinner at the buffet started around 7:15pm and, once finished, many people headed to the the piano bar in the lobby before attending the evening entertainment that occured nightly at 10pm. If you still were looking to have more fun, the discotheque opened its doors shortly after the conclusion of the evening entertainment show. The beach itself was unbelievable.The water is incredible and there are lots of chairs on the soft sand, cool to the touch, and there are plenty of activities such as volleyball, kayaking, and soccer. Other activities offered by the resort included: yoga, aerobics, spanish lessons, numerous dance lessons and bar-tending lessons! Most of these activities were located around the pool which we sat around later in the afternoon. A lot has been said about the language barrier at the CPM, however, if you have any bit of patience this is not an issue. We had no trouble communicating in English but there are many French and Italians there. Basically, every activity is announced in four languages: Spanish, English, French and Italian. There are many tour options that your tour director will go over the first or second day there. We chose the Mayan Adventure Tour. This included a tour of the Coba ruins (the tallest in the Mayan and also one that you are still allowed to climb up, unlike Chichen Itza) and a trip to a Mayan village where we hiked, canoed, rappelled into a cenote, and ziplined across a crocodile pond. We also took a free shuttle bus into Playa del Carmen for the evening. An evening was really all we needed, as Playa del Carmen was way too touristy for our liking. We were incredibly impressed by the Catalonia Playa Maroma and would certainly return there in the future. Please feel free to contact us with any questions! P.S. The road from the highway to the resort is terrible but do not be discouraged as the destination is worth the trip! P.P.S.

You never have to wake up at 5 am to claim a chair at the beach or the pool..... the reason may be apparent later. The ala carte restaurants were fantastic. Very good steaks and salads and soups. I suggest if you stay here to reserve a restaurant every night because the buffet food was very avg. The staff were nice and we didn't have any problems. The BAD: Unless you book in the 6000 block you have to walk a mile to the beach. We were in the 6000 block so it was great but you still had to walk a mile to get to the lobby. They cater to Italians and French so there isn't much English but it didn't bother us. Hardly any rooms have a beach view. Most of the views even from the upper 2 floors can only see jungle. The UGLY: The Catalonia Playa Maroma room we stayed in had a few dead cockroaches on the floor on the 5th day. It was definitely disgusting. Makes you wonder what's crawling on you at night. We had no food in the room and the only thing we could figure is the construction all around had stirred the cockroaches up. It made it very unpleasant to sleed the next couple nights.

We are five people from various countries, ranging in age from 17 to 56. We stayed at Catalonia Playa Maroma from March 28th, 2008 to April 4th. Starting at the beginning, we arrived at the ridiculous hour of 2 AM. We were met with snacks and drinks, and check-in was efficient. As other reviewers have noted, there are no porters here to carry your luggage, and the farthest of the six accomodations is about 200 meters from the lobby. That would certainly be unacceptable to some, but we knew this was the case and had no problems with the walk. The rooms are more than adequate: roomy, air conditioned and attractive. The mattresses are firm but we all found them comfortable. It is true that Mexico seems not to have kept up with the rest of the world in the area of plumbing, and at times there was a very faint odour of sewage from the floor vent in the bathroom. This is very common in Mexico, folks, so just accept it. Keeping the door closed precludes this smell from intruding into the bedroom area. The first room my Lady and I shared was next to the new resort under construction on the south side. Though the morning construction noises were very muffled, my Lady is a light sleeper and we therefore requested a different room. I must say that we found all of the staff here to be helpful and cheerful. We also experienced the problems with the safe not working, and door keys (electronic card readers) failing. Again, these minor problems were remedied speedily and graciously. The magnetic strips on the \"keys\" seem to be susceptible to erasure by proximity to magnets (purse latches) and electronics (cell phones, etc.), so just take care. The lack of a coffee machine and booze in rooms was not an issue for us, as we prefer to get out and enjoy the beautiful grounds, beach, weather, staff and entertainment. We all found the food to be to our liking. Most of our meals were taken in the main buffet, where there was a huge variety of well-prepared food. Though we all found something not to our liking, this is not unexpected when trying dishes from other regions. We always, always, found plenty of stuff we enjoyed, and found several new dishes at each meal. The staff in the buffet were terrific. We had one supper at the a-la-carte Mexican restaurant which was excellent, as was the service. The poolside bar makes excellent cappuccino and, although all the bartenders automatically reach for the cheapest liquours they happiily give you the premium, international brands if you only ask. The Bacardi and Johnny Walker bottles aren't there for decorations. We enjoyed very good Rusty Nails once we explained how they were made. The bartenders were genuinely eager to please and to learn about new (to them) drinks. The beach, Playa Maroma, is as beautiful as a beach can be: perfect soft, white sand, an absolute absence of rocks or coral, and the clear turqoise waters of the Caribbean. What more can one ask of a beach? Always plenty of chairs in either sun or shade, and lots of activities from the gregarious A-team. The music at the beach comes from the lifeguard tower, right in the middle. The speakers, which play fairly loudly, are pointed out to sea. The lounge chairs extend a good fifty meters to either side of the source of music and, if you are even half that distance to the side you will be barely aware of the music. One- and two-person kayaks are available at the south end of the beach for free. The resort also has two Hobie Cats, again available for free. If the very helpful Rafael doesn't think you know how to sail, he will take you out on the seas himself. Diving and snorkelling tours are available at the beach as well, at added cost. There are four fresh-water showers, for rinsing, in pairs on each side of the beach/pool bar. Half a dozen haded hammocks, rarely used, are on the north side of the pool bar, together with the outdoor massage tables. Now, about that 200-meter walk from the lobby to the beach: it is beautiful and unique and we loved it. At a moderate pace it only takes three minutes, and it is through dry mangrove/jungle complete with iguanas, raccoons, coatimundis (in the trees), cats and birds. There are speakers hidden in the jungle playing quiet music from Enya to Debussy to Latin. The birds' calls and songs are also lovely. We noted an almost total absence of insects during our week at Catalonia Playa Maroma. The semi-professional evening shows were delivered with enthusiasm, creativity and obvious fun on the part of the performers. Though the majority of guests are Italian, there was only one skit, presented entirely in Italian, that we could not understand. All others were introduced in English and most would be easily comprehended by anyone regardless of language. We had a great time dancing in the small disco, particularly on \"Revival\" night, when the music is predominantly \"classic rock\". Each evening also includes some form of entertainment at the piano bar in the lobby. The majority of guests being, once again, Italian and French means there will be more smokers than we are accustomed to in North America but we never had any problems and, quite frankly, I was surprised at how few smokers we did see. Also, a small percentage of women do go topless, both on the beach and at the pool: if this offends you, don't go to this resort.

Does sum it up but there's much more. :) We stayed at the Catalonia from March 14th thru March 22nd. We had absolutely perfect weather the entire time we were there. We had a few days of gusty winds but nothing a little strategic turn of the beach chair couldn't help. Plus, the wind as well as the constant gentle breeze on all the other days made it the perfect temperature on the beach! The evening weather was just as nice (and that's coming from a person who's cold all the time..never happened!) We checked into our room late Friday night. Check in was fast and simple and we were in our room probably within 10 minutes. The walkway leading to the beach (and our room) was beautifully lit and our first impression was \"wow, this is BEAUTIFUL\". You will walk this path often as it is the only way to get down to the beach, pool and a la carte restaurants and up to the lobby, lobby bar and buffet restaurant. There is soft music playing all along the path which is lined with lush tropical mangrove. We are \"hunters' and enjoyed every step of the way noticing all kinds of wildlife and foliage/flowers all along the way...loved that! There is also an \"ecological interpreter\" who will take you on a tour of the grounds and tell you all about everything (we didn't do that). The grounds were impeccably manicured all the way down to cleaning every single leaf that hit that sidewalk. Ver y beautiful. The room, while dated, was spacious and very clean. There was ample closet space, drawers, a large vanity area and the fridge was stocked with bottled water daily. We agree that the air conditioning could have been a \"hair\" colder and as another review stated, our ceiling fan also had an element of being possessed, it was not intolerable. The beds were a tad on the hard side for those who care...we didn't. It was fine. :) The food was the best we've had at an all inclusive and we've been to many. We spent most of our time at the buffet and we commented on the fact that we NEVER said \"we wish they had *insert desire here*.\". ..because they had EVERYTHING you could want and it was GOOD! Our only comment might be that coffee \"service\" at breakfast could have been a little more attentive but we never went without. Again, a minor observance. And Alicia the morning egg cook was wonderful !! The beach....wow. THE most beautiful beach we've ever been to in Mexico. The water was warm and clear where you could see down to your feet even with the water up to your chin ! You could see an occasional fish swim by! NO seaweed, NO trash just beautiful cool white sand for as far as you could see. The beach like the rest of the resort was so, so clean with the workers picking up every last cigarette butt in the sand with little nets. As others have stated, the beach \"drink server\" was limited but the beach bar was right there and easy to take a little walk and get whatever you wanted. Giraldo was the beach bar bar tender and ALWAYS enthusiastic and friendly :) There were constant activities for adults and children. The kids always seemed to be having a great time and at NO TIME were any of them loud or disruptive. In the evenings there was always music, most days a piano player/singer and a little champaigne and hors dourve table in the lobby . People met there, chatted, relaxed before and after dinner and before and after the nightly show. Very pleasant and noticeable that there was ALWAYS something to do SOMEWHERE if you wanted to. Or...your could just lounge in your beach chair with your book and enjoy the sun, sights, and sounds. Lastly, the staff were always helpful and attentive. We had occasion to deal with customer relations for a few questions and needs and we were helped promptly and with courtesy. The worst part of our trip was getting in the cab to go home...very very sad....but a perfect ending to a perfect week with our bags brought up front for us in a timely manner and a breezy check out. Yes, we would definitely go back!", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBest Bang for your Buck!\u201d", "Author": "playalover78", "ReviewID": "UR14351382", "Content": "Hola All! My partner and I stayed at the CPM between March 9-16 (Canadian March Break). We had a fantastic time and both of us are experienced travellers. Like most people have already stated, there is a large European population. But to be honest, I noticed about the same percentage of Europeans in many of my vacations to the DR. We had NO PROBLEM at all with any guests at this resort and found it rather refreshing to truly get away from the \"drunken North American tourist!\" There was never that crazy drunk guy before noon, or parties that went into the early hours of the morning waking everybody up. If you are looking for a party then look elsewhere. Grounds: are beautiful! Request to be in block 6000 (closest to the beach), or 4000 or 2000 as they are not on the construction side (although we never heard any construction even when on the beach). You can not see the other buildings of the resort due to the lush and tropical mangroves that line the main pathway. Beach: Fabulous! Unlike a previous review I would recommend walking to the right most days as it is about 1 hour before you have to turn around. Yes, there is garbage (not near the water) that is swept up, but that is not because people are throwing their garbage onto the beach. The sand was cool to walk in and the water was warm. There were great waves to play in most days with no undertow. One of the best parts is that you can find a lounger, sun or shade, at any time of day! Food: the buffet was good with a fabulous layout that prevented lines and allowed you to only hit the stations (10 different ones) that you wanted. If you want to book an a la carte the person is at the front of the dinner buffet. Both a la cartes were very very good and you can book them as often as you want. You book the dinner for the following night. Shuttle: There are 2 shuttles running daily to Playa Del Carmen. One leaves at 10 am and gets back at 5. The next leaves at 6 pm and gets back at 11. We went into PDC for the evening and had a great time! Rooms: Okay, the rooms could use a bit of an update. But they have a great balcony, were cleaned daily and I slept well each night because the resort was so quiet. The air conditioning in our room could have been colder and the fan was possessed and in serious need of oil. Not sure what English channels the TV got as we never got aorund to turning it on. Our fridge had 2 bottles of cold water waiting for us daily. Staff: The animation staff are italian and chat up the italians. However, nobody is excluded from the activities! I got involved in everything I wanted to and chose to lay in a lounger for the rest. People, if you want to go play...go play! They had tons of aqua aerobics and beach volleyball daily. Bars: the bar service was excellent and had a wide variety of brand name alcoholic beverages. There are only 2 bars at this hotel (pool and lobby). I would suggest they put in a beach bar that serves only beer, pop and juice as many people order mixed/frozen drinks at the pool bar and the line gets backed up. The pool bar is very very close (right on) the beach. Ask for designer alcohol ie. Barcardi, Smirnoff, Beafeater etc... there is no need to drink gut rot if you don't want to. They are happy to oblige with the \"good stuff\". We got this resort for a fraction of the cost of what most people paid for their March Break vacation. CPM is a relaxing hotel that is not surrounded by the noise of PDC or Cancun. I would highly recommend it to anybody who is looking to get away for a little piece of heaven. Tours: We went to Xel-ha on our own (rented a jeep...safe and fabulous way to get around) and found it to be quite the tourist trap. We only wanted to snorkel, but you must pay $75 for an all inclusive pass. On top of that there were many extras to be purchased (dolphins, snuba, etc.) There were NO exotic fish because tourists have destroyed much of the coral by standing on it. Look elsewhere.

As we walked from the lobby to the beach, we simply acknowleged peope with \"hola\" and were either met with a smile or a greeting in their language.

During our wait, we walked around the resort, had a drink at the pool bar, had some lunch, and the wait didn't seem long at all. We were able to book many excursions with no problems at all. We booked the Coba Mayan Experience, we went Parasailing (this excursion was done through another resort, but all this is very easy to do through your tour representative) For our housekeeper, we left a 5 dollar tip the first day, and 2 dollars each day afterwards, and we couldn't have asked for better service. (Including fresh flowers in our bathroom) The drinks and service were very good, and you could order as many as you wanted. There have been comments about wait staff on the beach. There did some to be service some days, but the walk to the beach bar is so close, that it wasn't a problem for us go get our own. The staff that was on beach were working so hard, picking up glasses, picking up garbage and cigarette butts, keeping it clean. We appreciated this much more then having drinks delivered to us.

The food was good, and the Mediterranean restaurant was excellent. There were always plenty of choices, and we ate at the restaurant closest to the pool for lunch (great burgers, wings, hot dogs, etc). The rooms were fine, but the beds are indeed hard.

I understand the phrase \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\" but we were not in Europe - we were in Mexico. We tried very hard to talk to the event staff and some of the guests but were mostly shut out. There were a few people that we could count on one hand that would engage in conversation. The day before we left a large group if Canadians came in and made us feel very welcome and accepted but prior to that it was very lonely. The beach was beautiful with chair space available every day. The rooms were very clean but not that desirable. The staff was mostly friendly although besides the cleaning room staff and guest reception - no one acknowledged our existence very often. This included anyone smiling (which I always thought was a universal language.) I would be hard pressed to recommend this hotel to anyone even if it came at a great price.

The Italian and French guests were very rude!!!! The event staff never once approached us to participate in activities, they talked to everyone around us, but not us.

There are no clocks in the rooms. We had a ground floor room and we did NOT have any problems with bugs. Do NOT go to the salon, it is filthy and they dont polish worth a crap. There is only one waiter on the beach so dont count on him getting to you, plan on going to get your own drinks. They have a pool table but they actually charge 3 us dollars for one hour of play. They dont have jet skis, para sailing, or boogie boards. All they have is kyaks and small sail boats. We did have a nice time because we made the best of what we had to work with.

Moreles, it was pretty amazing, but the day we went, the water was pretty rough, it would have been nicer had we had a clear sunny day. But I still enjoyed it alot.

I have traveled to many places around the world, and most recently in the Caribbean. I picked this resort from reading the reviews on Trip advisor as I like to research each place before making a decision - after all, it can be a lot of money wasted if you hate where you stay. The main reason I picked this resort was because of the beach. This beach is beautiful; it reminded me of the beaches in Punta Cana, soft cool white fine sand. The waters are clear, and warm... I would go to this resort just for this beach!!! I also knew that there was a heavy group of European travelers to this resort, and this made for quite a different experience then I am used to. I thought that having a more European influence would get me away from the loud boisterous North American crew that can pop up at most resorts and annoy the surroundings with they\u2019re drunken stupidity. (I have encountered this more then once, and I am only in my early 30\u2019s \u2013 so it is not like I do not enjoy the odd party time \u2013 but not all the time, there is a time and a place for everything) This was a plus for this resort. There was minimal activity that would disrupt an afternoon on the beach (you could lay on your beach chair \u2013 while the Europeans would go in for their siesta \u2013 and just sun tan and listen to the waves), or nightly coffee or night cap by the beach bar. The only thing I found as dislike is that this resort caters to the European crowd to such an extent that if you are North American (green wrist band) you felt isolated from the rest of the resort. It was very difficult to try to converse with the staff, and any activities are in different languages also. I do not mind this usually, and my group and I tried desperately to use whatever Spanish we knew or learnt (and even some French) on the trip to speak to the staff. The staff is very friendly, and tries their hardest to understand you, but they have to know Spanish, Italian and French almost fluently... I did have one particular staff member in the Italian Restaurant ask us what everything was in English so he could learn\u2026 he was a great waiter, good sense of Humor! By the end of the trip though with a week of being ignored by the animation team (the spa staff know pretty much NO English at ALL), and not knowing what is going on half the time, it can feel a bit isolating. I also asked on arrival at check-in to be AWAY from the construction and was told \u201cno, it is finished\u2026 they are not working anymore\u201d (biggest lie ever!). Then preceded to the room that they gave us (which was shown at the desk as being a different room on the map) which was RIGHT BESIDE the construction. Our group really did not have much of a problem with this as they did not start construction (or at least we did not hear it) till later on in the day. We liked to sleep in until at latest 9am, and never had a problem with hearing any construction waking us up \u2013 bring a alarm clock and a watch, there is nothing in the room. Plus, we were not in the room during the day at all. There is no rush in this resort at all, which is very nice compared to most all inclusives I have been at. The breakfast buffet closed to at 10:15am which gave you plenty of time to have a snooze in and go a little later, and the beach always had a spots available. This is a nice break from other places I have been \u2013 e.g. getting up early rushing for a beach spot, and/or all the good food is gone if you don\u2019t go by 7:30am to eat and they don\u2019t restock it - can get annoying. The buffet restaurant is very good at this hotel; the food is always restocked and available. The a-la-carte restaurants are fantastic as well; just don\u2019t have the house wine in the Italian restaurant as it tastes like vinegar! (A French family had it and the father literally spit it out at the table beside us... he was quite disgusted by it... it was very humorous.) I went on two excursions which were both worth it : 1.) Chichen-Itza 2.) Xel-Ha These were great!!! And I would go again. I heard many guest complaining that Chichen Itza was a far trip, but really it is quite worth it... I figure why travel all that way and not see one of the wonders of the world that is there... it is a air conditioned bus that gives you food and drinks and is all inclusive (you also stop and swim at a cenote on the way which breaks up the ride \u2013 tip: they say to wear your bathing suit, but there are washrooms and you can change in them so wearing your bathing suit is not necessary! And you watch a movie on the ride back). Xel-Ha was GREAT! If you like to snorkel this is the place to go... there are dolphins you can swim with also for some extra $ and something called \u201csnuba\u201d for extra $ and other things but it is all inclusive as there are 5 restaurants that you can eat at and all drinks are free when you are there. I went snuba diving. So glad I went. I have never scuba dived but always been curious to try, and this is somewhat the same but your tank is floating above you on a raft and you only dive a little over 10 feet down...so you really get the feel of scuba diving! Great experience ($45 for an hour! \u2013 not a bad price). Bring a banana with you if you are snorkeling, FISH LOVE BANANA! Overall, the resort is nice. I will sum it up in positive and negative below: Positive - beach (White soft fine sand, clear water - not rocky at all) - available spots any time of the day on the beach - no rushing for anything - walkway to the lobby and beach is not long, with very lush greenery surrounding it (at night they play Enya music) - Food is better then most resorts I have been too (including a 5 star in Jamaica) - No boisterous drunken guests all around - If you like to keep to yourself, you will not be bothered. Negative - major language barrier if you only speak English (if you know some French or Italian that will help you out) -can feel isolated from the activities around the resort - Disco is awful (went on a Friday night, there were more kids \u2013 as in 10-17yrs) then actual adults) opens at 12am. - Rooms need a bit of a upgrade (and I know that they have a few newer rooms \u2013 so I think they are in the process of upgrading) - Construction beside the hotel \u2013 don\u2019t hear it often and our room was right beside it! One more thing\u2026 NO matter where you stay in Mexico, bring tipping money. They expect tips everywhere outside of your resort! And will literally ask for it. It can get bothersome, but you just have to remember that these peoples wages are much lower then ours and they are trying to make a living. This is a great place if you want somewhere to relax.

We\u2019ve read so many negative reviews about this resort and decided that it must be a great place, and a great place it was. Most of the negative reviews were born out of ignorance and malice. The fact that the hotel caters mostly to Europeans is a great bonus and not an irritant. Some people fail to realize that the Europeans come there through Venta Club and Lookea, both of which are similar to Club Med. Hence the reason why there is dedicated staff for these tourists. There was no discrimination going on against the North Americans as some have stated. The fault lies with the North American travel agencies which do not provide the same quality service as the European ones. The young European staff assigned to work at this resort was in fact very friendly with everyone and were trying to engage just about everyone at the beach and during the night activities, should you care to join them. They weren\u2019t employees of the resort but of the above mentioned clubs. This is a 3.5 star resort with a beach 3 times better than the 5 star resorts in the Playa Del Carmen (confirmed by our friends at those resorts), and the tranquility of the jungle setting was perfect for R&R. The jungle pathways were a bliss making the experience all that more unique. The food was almost at the gourmet category with more choices than any normal individual can possibly eat and desire. Granted, there was no junk food in the menu and the local birds weren\u2019t served as deep-fried dish...as some may have possibly desired. We\u2019ve overheard one couple at the Mexican a-la-carte restaurant expressing a desire for \u201ccorn dogs\u201d. They should have taken a vacation to the sunny Wyoming instead, were the motto is: you kill them, we grill them. The Europeans were nice to be around and they were there to relax and not to make small talk. It was nice to see a display of nicely dressed people in the evening. The beach: if the occasional topless lady bothered you, spend your vacation at any Motel 6 by the interstate. Mexico is not an all American exclusive place and the Mayan Riviera is a favourite spot for the Europeans which pour millions in the local economy.

Also, I was very upset at the Cancun airport and tried to get help from a female official, only to be told, \"No English\". A few minutes later she was having a very fluent English conversation with another person from our flight. This was not a good start to our vacation. We chose the Catalonia Playa Maroma because of the beach, and the beach was amazing.......as long as you didn't venture too far off the resort, once you do you had better be wearing some sort of foot wear.....lots of garbage. The food at the resort was also amazing, we went to the Mexican Buffet twice and the Mediterranean once. The food at the buffet was also very good, lots of variety, something different each time. This was my boyfriend's 7th time away, and the agreed that the food was the best he had ever had! I have to say that the wait staff at the a la carte restaurants are very pleasant too. So, other than the beach and the food, everything else was sub-par, especially since we stayed the the 5 star Bahia Principe Punta Cana last April. When we got our room there were bugs crawling all over everything, and I woke up with new bites everyday desipte sleeping with long pants tucked into socks ( not very attractive I know). The bugs were so bad in fact, that upon our arrival home, we took all of our luggage into our underground parking to transfer our clothes into garbage bags for immediate washing. We also disinfected anything that couldn't be washed in the machine. There was a bar fridge in the room, but it was never filled with anything! We had to take water off the carts that were outside of other peoples rooms when they were being cleaned. Before we left the country I went out and purchased body lotions, nail polishes, perfume and other toiletries to leave for the person cleaning our room. Well, when we left our room after the first night, we left American money, body lotion, candy, body spray and nail polish.......when we came back at 6pm, it was gone, but our room hadn't been touched! I was very offended, and only ended up leaving about half of the gifts that I originally purchased. Our room was cleaned all of the other days, but your bed sheets will never be changed, the bed will only be re-made. Our bathroom towels were also only changed twice. There was also the day that our toilet wouldn't flush and my boyfriend had to fill the garbage can with water from the shower and pour it down the toilet. He joked that we were on our most expensive camping trip ever, but I didn't think it was very funny. The staff at the main lobby is less than helpful, and most staff members speak limited English. Which is frustrating when you are trying to locate lost luggage. The Catalonia Playa Maroma is a European resort, I am not enitrely sure why it was opened to North Americans as it clearly caters to Eurpoeans, mainly Italians. Everybody is given a wristband and the colour denotes your country of origin, Canada is Green, on the beach the staff members look at your bracelet and keep on walking, only to have a very friendly conversation with the Europeans right beside you. One other Canadian commented that he felt segregated, and I agree, why is this resort open to Canada and the U.S. if you are treated like an intruder while staying (and paying) there. After our first night there we were missing our toiletries so I figured I would pick some up on the resort, the first store we can upon was closed so we moved on to the next one, which looked very nice, so we walked in, but as soon as the clerk saw our wristbands, she informed us that the store was for Italian guests only and we couldn't purchase anything there!!! I was disgusted. As it turns out, the Italian store has a much wider selection of merchandise to choose from, including clothing and different toiletries, the main store for all guests is not that great. I would not return to this resort, and probably will never return to Mexico. There are plenty of other resorts along this beatuiful beach, I would suggest looking into one of them.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cLower your expectations\u201d", "Author": "lizardoschmoilito", "ReviewID": "UR13618377", "Content": "Yes, the beach was beautiful, we'll give them that.

The rooms are very simple but adequate. They are clean and nice and cool to sleep in. We heard no construction what so ever as others in previous reviews have complained about. Our room was located in the Coba building which is furthest from the ocean but you have a beautiful pathway to walk down so we enjoyed the stroll. The pool area is huge and clean but we never used it as we preferred the beach. As many others have shared the beach is amazing. I would come back to this resort for that aspect alone. Tons of room and an ample supply of chairs (sometimes tough to get one in the shade). Loved playing in the ocean, the water was a refreshing break from the heat. The food was good at the buffet (they have breakfast ,lunch and supper) and lots of variety. I highly reccomend doing the 2 a la carte restaraunts (one is Mexican and one is Mediteranian) at least once each as they were both delicious. The staff works very hard. We had no language barriers at all as most of the employees speak some English and we always made the attempt to use our limited knowledge of Spanish.

There IS a snack bar but it took us 3 days to figure out where it is. It is in between the two restaurants over from the pool area. There aren't many english speaking people there so if you go on vacation to socialize then don't go there unless you know either Italian or French. You will feel quite isolated.

The beach is suppose to be one of the most beautiful in the world but if you go for a walk there is so much garbage out of the resort area it is pitiful. It was like a garbage dump. You can walk for miles but BE CAREFUL. You have to watch where you step because of what you might step on. (we saw four syringes and a lot of other disgusting stuff) That was a huge disappointment. For someone that wants good value for a good price (watch for sell offs if you can) this was a reasonable hotel.

I've been 8 times now, but this was my first time to the Caribbean side. It was a little different, not better or worse and I will most certainly go back again. Probably not to this hotel though. The good: The pool. Not too crowded, very clean. Nice buffet, good selection, alright food (not fantastic), good service. Two very nice, 5 course meals included at the nicer restaurant. The beach was nice but we went into Playa del Carmen and checked out the beach there and I didn't see much difference. White sand, turquoise water, I don't think it matters where you go along there. I saw quite a bit of garbage on our beach as well, so.... The bad: The buffet restaurant is the Only place you can get food during the day. Buffet times. Breakfast 7am - 10am. Lunch 12:30pm - 2:30pm Dinner 7:00pm - 10:00pm. They do not have a snack bar like they advertise. The 'snack bar' serves drinks and ice cream cones. If you are hanging out by the pool and want to go for lunch, expect the process to take about an hour. You can't wear swim wear in the restaurant (not that I would) but that means you have to go back to your room to change, then walk to the restaurant which is quite a distance from the pool, (I didn't think that would bother me when I read it here on trip advisor, but it is the time it takes, not the distance). I've stayed in other all inclusive hotels that have pool side snacks and restaurants by the pool, it is just nice to grab a quick bite when you're trying to enjoy as much sun as you can. There is no pool side waiter. There is one waiter on the beach that takes care of everyone, so order 4 drinks while you've got his attention because you may never see him again. Only order drinks that are on their drink menu, the others taste awful (which unfortunately means bad margaritas). The beds are harder than any mattress I've ever slept on, and I've been to Mexico 7 times before this trip. Major construction! They are building a new resort right next to the hotel (on the left side if you are facing the hotel while standing on the beach) and construction starts @ 6:00am, and goes all day every day except Sundays. So that means, dump trucks, jack hammers, just general loud construction, and it is right outside your door. I read about the construction here on trip advisor and had asked the person that was helping us check in if we could have a room away from the construction, and when he showed me the map of the grounds he told me that the construction was on the other side of the hotel from where our room was, so he flat out lied. The only reason why it was bearable for me was because the noise of the air conditioning drowned it out somewhat. The hotel is farther from the town of Playa del Carmen than I thought (totally my fault for not looking into that more) it is 20 some minutes by cab into town. 200 pesos or $20.

We booked this on a last minute deal so didn\u2019t have a lot of time to research but we have stayed in various hotels in this area from 3.5 to 5 stars four times before and knew what to expect. The rating of this hotel is bang on. For a 3.5 star, this hotel as far as food and service rates better than The El Dorado where we stayed last year. Why would we say this? The El Dorado was all al la carte with no buffet so you had to book every dinner so when you had late days after excursions it was tiresome to get dressed up late at night to eat. The other frustrating thing at El Dorado is dealing with the constant bombardment with time share people. The Maroma had a good buffet with excellent service and when you wanted to go al la carte the meals were as good as El Dorado . This is a comparatively small hotel and we found this advantageous as the food was turned around quicker and the service more personal! The rooms are older and they are in the middle of renovating and upgrading. We had an older room that has not been upgraded but the bed was new, the air conditioner worked and the housekeepers worked hard to keep the rooms clean and maintained. We blew a breaker on night and maintenance was there within minutes of our call. Our check in was seamless and found the front desk staff easy to deal with. We were not leaving the hotel until 7pm and had no problem keeping our room for a cost of 40 USD. The beach at this hotel is amazing and you can walk without interruption both north and south for as far as you want. We recommend walking south to the eco-park and take in the clear waters and white sandy beaches which were by far the best we\u2019ve experienced in our five trips there. They compare to Punta Cana DR when we were there three years ago. We walked north to the Iberostar resort and the beaches were more crowded because of the size of the resort and the beach did not compare to the Maroma. The cost of the Iberostar was much more than the Maroma. This was the first time in the Mayan Riviera where we didn\u2019t have to run down at 6am to reserve a beach chair at the pool or beach as there was plenty of space. The staff tries very hard at this resort and we watched a lot of training going on. The lobby staff is the greatest and the pool staff could take some lessons from them. Special thanks to Diony, Roberto and Gilberto as they made us feel like family. My husband had tutoring in Spanish off these three every time they came to the table and they relished the fact that he was trying so hard to learn their language. The animation staff caters to the Europeans but this is to be expected as they transition to accommodate Canadians and Americans. Keep in mind that if you go there that this resort used to be exclusively European (French and Italian) and English speaking people are a rare breed right now but that will be changing in the near future. The Europeans have their own culture that is much different that Canadian or American but there is good and bad in everyone and we\u2019ve been embarrassed to be around some of our own at times! The road into the resort and spa next door is built from sand and it had been graded when we arrived there.

You should lower your expectations to the ground level, and then your impressions from staying at the Catalonia Playa Maroma would be just fine. Expecting a 4 stars hotel experience you might be slightly dissapointed. We were considering this place to stay because of affordable price, relatively good reviews on tripadvisor, sattelite images on seeyourhotel showing a lot of pools, and google-maps (and official hotel's photos) showing only one hotel next to it and jungle on the other, left, side with at least a mile of wild beach, and nice colorful photos of 2-3 storey buildings. What all those sources did not tell us on the web-pages devoted to this hotel: - seeyouhotel shows screwed up map (you see the 307 highway is not alligned with the actual road) -- they marked the wrong hotel with that name -- in reality what they call Catalonia Playa Maroma is Playa Paraiso/Iberostar, and CataloniaPM is about 1km south. Correct names are in wikimapia (here: b23.ru/njy), and it is much smaller with much-much smaller pool (but large enough to swim). - jungle to the lower-left from the real CataloniaPM is not so virgin anymore. There is a huge construction site in January 2008 for the another hotel next to it, which until completed (call to find out if it is already) will wake you up 6 days a week (except Sundays) starting hammering after 7 am. - there will be water all the time on your lavatory/restroom floor because the shower lacks the curtain - there is a mile walking distance you'll make per day between your room, buffet and the beach: it is 250m between the buffet and the beach, and your room is somewhere in between - this hotel's beach is significantly more crowded than the next one's (Maroma Beach Resort), which has huge beds on the beach with real pillows instead of your plastic (although durable) chaise-longues. But you'll share weather, white sand and blue water with folks (stop by to look into their eyes) who paid for each night (with only breakfast included) the same as you did for your entire week-long all-inclusive vacation. Yes, including your air-tickets. Yes, for both of you. - about 2% of females staying in Catalonia Playa Maroma would be sunbathing topless. It's about 6 to 8 females around the pool and on the beach total. It's not like in Europe, no -- you'll find where to hide from them if you need to. - at least 60% (may be more) of guests will be italians. Most of the evening entertainment will be in Italian. Which might be a little boring is you don't understand it. - iron will not be available to you no matter what they promiss on the web -- it's an additional additional fee service - internet is $10 per 50 minutes -- there are TWO computers in the lobby; I've seen them non-occupied many times - taxi to Playa Del Carmen from the hotel is $20. You might find someone ready to drive back for $15. There is a shuttle going there at 6pm (it's dark already) there, and back at 11pm -- it requires reservation a day in advance. - taxi from the hotel to the airport is $32. Two persons travel from the airport to the hotel on the shuttle is $48. - you could make a trip to Tulum from Playa Del Carmen -- there are buses (1 hour one way for $4 per person) going there each 45 minutes from the 5th avenue. They'll charge another $4+ per person for entrance. No need to pay about $100 for this trip to your travel agent.

There are many negative reviews about the Catalonia Playa Maroma in the previous posts. The problem I have noticed with many of these reviews is that their basing there ratings on hotels in a higher class. Therefor the following is a review of a 2 1/2 to 3 star resort, not a 4 or 5 star property. As many of the previous posts have stated there is a strong Italian presence at the hotel. This is what attracted my wife and I to the property. The further away from the Cancun party seen we can get the better. Europeans tend to be more relaxed travelers and much less obnoxious than the Americans you'll find in Cancun ( and yes I'm and American). Ok, now for the review. I'll start with a slight negative. Seeing that the resort has a strong Italian influence you'll find plenty of Italian food at the buffet. If you love Italian food you will be in heaven, if not you might want to rent a car or take the free bus to Playa Del Carmen for mexican food. There isn't a lot of variety, but for the most part you can find some good dishes. Another option would be to make reservations at the resorts mexican restaurant Tio Pedros. for a 21/2 to 3 star resort the food is adequate. As for the rooms I would say they are average, nothing to right home about. If your looking for luxurious accomadations this may not be your place, and I would assume you would not be researching this hotel if you weren't on a budget. With that said, you get what you pay for. One highlight of the room is the large balcony, perfect for having a drink and smoking a cigar. Besides once you see the beach all of your concerns will fade away. The beach is simply amazing. There a plenty of chairs to go around and ample space on the beach to relax. While the beach on the hotel property is great, do yourself a favor and take a short stroll down the beach heading south. You will find a short walk will take you to your own deserted strand of beach, with only the occasional passer by bringing you back to reality. The property itself is beautiful with it's dense jungle setting and low rise hacienda style buildings. It's 45 minutes from Cancun and 10 to Playa Del Carmen so if your into late night partying or constant action, you'll want to look elsewhere for accomodations. If you want a relaxing trip on one of the best beaches in the world for an affordable rate this could be your place.

The layout of the resort is quite expansive! Timed, the walk from the beach to the lobby/ buffet; which is at the complete other side of the resort takes 4 \u00bd minutes each way. Make sure you bring a watch for the room, and a waterproof watch to wear. We foolishly thought that every room will have an alarm clock. That it did not. We were told to keep calling the lobby to know the time, pretty inconvenient with the distances between room and beach/ buffet/ etc. But luck for us, two guys we met who were from Canada were generous enough to lend us one of their watches. The rooms are basic, as many others stated. Do try to spend a bit of time on your balcony, even if it\u2019s only to lay out some wet clothes to dry. All the views are either of the jungle your in or on the courtyard of the buildings which is equally as nice. The sink we had in our room was sort of functional. We actually used a pen to place in the opening so that the stopper remained in the open position. It only seemed to add to the quirkiness of our trip, so why not?! The passageway to each building is its own little jungle; very pretty and secluded. The main sidewalk was just the same, but a little bit more open with a bench here and there to rest if you\u2019d like. We saw many animals as well as encountered many \u2018creepy crawlers\u2019 while we were there; it is in the jungle you know. A snake and a few raccoons (who were surprisingly very calm and friendly around people) to name a couple. Bugs weren\u2019t the kind you\u2019re thinking of. Not mosquitoes, although there were flies in the restaurants. Huge bugs fell from the ceilings usually right onto your head (which really can freak someone out i.e. myself). They all seemed to be about half the size of a regular flip cell phone (picture a Motorola Razor, in the closed position, cut in half). My only advice is brush them off your head ASAP and don\u2019t look at what was just on your head. This generally only happened in the theatre and buffet restaurant. The entertainment staff is awesome, especially Zazil and Dario. Get to know these two, they\u2019re great people. The DJ at the nightclub Salvadore was also a great guy. He\u2019ll be happy to share his music interests with you as well as listen to your preferences and maybe mix a few of your favorite songs for the next disco night. All the activities done are mostly described in Italian, French, and Spanish. But, if you participate, any of the other activity staff members are happy to translate to English. And they are always trying to get you involved. If you\u2019d like to know what activity is going on when, go in the direction of the lobby bar and between the nightclub and payphones you will find an \u2018activity board\u2019 which says what is going on when. The lobby bar personnel are awesome. They will remember you as long as you put in some effort to say hello either in English or Spanish. Great staff overall at the Catalonia Playa Maroma!!! As far as food goes, breakfast was the best meal at the buffet. We made sure that this was the one meal that we always made. For lunch, I would definitely recommend making a reservation to La Tortuga for a Mediterranean lunch buffet. Make sure you try the fish\u2026.any fish actually. For dinner, we tried the buffet, Tio Pedro restaurant, and La Tortuga restaurant and they all seemed pretty similar.

This was our 6th visit to the Caribbean: twice in Punta Cana, once in Puerto Plata and three times on the Mayan Riviera. We stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma from November 30th to December 7th, 2007. The travel brochure (Nolitours) had this hotel rated as a 3.5 stars. We got a VERY good deal for this hotel. Based on the hotel rating and the price we paid, we were very satisfied. We booked this hotel because of the small size, the beach and the overall good reviews on food. OVERALL: You get the pros and cons of a small hotel (300 rooms): short walk from the beach to the main lobby (5 minutes) and but a smaller selection for food / restaurant and pool (only one large pool, but not crowded at all). ROOM: This is the weakest point. Rooms need some upgrades (new paint and new furniture). The ceiling fan and air conditioning were making too much noise. We didn't ask to change room because our room was very close to the beach (less than 1 minute walk). As specified previously, mini-bar had only water. NOISE: Buildings 2000-4000-6000 on the north side are far from the construction next to the hotel. Buildings 1000-3000-5000 are on the north side. Each building has 3 floors and a total of 50-60 rooms. You don't hear construction from those buildings. Construction starts early (6:30 am). The noise didn't bother us at the pool or at the beach and we were sitting near the construction at the beach. I thought the music at the pool and at the beach was more disturbing (but not much than any other hotels). The good news is the music was playing between 11:00 am and 12:30 pm and then from 3:00 pm to 5: pm. From 12:30pm and 3:00pm, it was siesta time: pool and the beach were almost deserted. ROAD TO THE HOTEL: By bus, it takes 5 minutes from the main road to the lobby (2.2 km) and 4 minutes by taxi. There is portion of the road with a lot of holes. This portion is not owned by the hotel. Without all those holes, it would take about 60-90 seconds less. So, you're losing a grand total of about 5 minutes during our stay because of those holes. FOOD: Excellent, nice buffet, good service. Because the hotel is small, you get less choice as compare to a hotel with 1000 rooms. This is mostly true at the beach / pool. You can't have breakfast at the beach/pool restaurant and the snack is limited (chicken nuggets, fries, hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, ham and cheese, fruits salad, ice cream). There is a buffet restaurant next to the pool, but you have to reserve the previous day. We didn't try this restaurant; maybe it was possible to go without a reservation. BEACH: This is the most beautiful beach that I've seen on the Mayan Coast (stayed at Playacar next to Playa Del Carmen and at Bahia Principe near Tulum). The beach is as nice as in Punta Cana without the palm trees, without the noise from motor boats and helicopters and without the crowd (+ nice slope to enter the water and no rock). If you sit on the north side of the beach, you don't hear the construction. Shade from the wood structures was available at ANY time; no towel game. When looking at pictures, I thought that with those structures that provide shade that, we would be very close to each other, but this was not the case at all. You can walk on both sides and the beach is desert BUT only the portion in front of the hotel is cleaned every day. When walking on the beach, you will find a lot of seaweeds (which is natural) and a lot of garbage, not from the Catalonia hotel guests but garbage pushed by the waves and coming from this sea. This detracts from the idea of walking on a desert beach. You can't blame the hotel for this. ITALIAN: Most of the guests are from Italy and France (40% each). There were a very small number of English speaking guests. Don't go to this hotel if you want to meet a lot of English speaking guests. Staff can speak English as in any other resort, i.e. not all staff speaks English, but those at the bars, restaurants and reception do. I didn't' find any particular about all those guests except for the fact we didn't see the familiar behavior \"It's 10am, I'm drinking beer in the pool and I'm drunk by noon\". With upgrades to the rooms and to the mini-bar, I think the hotel would be a solid 4 stars and with upgrades to the restaurant at the beach, it would be a 4.5 stars.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel overall...\u201d", "Author": "cnydfly", "ReviewID": "UR10905805", "Content": "We just arrived from Playa Maroma from a one week stay (Nov 10-17/07) Overall, this hotel is ok.

Even though there were Canadians, French, Germans and Portuguese tourists, the whole show was a play in Italian only. We just left. By the way, the tourists that arrived after us that were placed in block 6000 were Italians. The hotel layout is not as convenient. From our block, it is quite a walk to the reception/restaurant area but the scenery is great. The hotel staff were friendly, especially in the restaurant. The hotel is kept very clean. *Beware: tons of mosquitos! Bring your bugspray! One of the biggest disappointment was the lack of transportation to the local town - Playa del Carmen. They have one shuttle bus daily leaving at 6:00pm and returning at 11:00pm. Not very convenient for us (travelling with small children). A cab ride to the town will cost you around $40 US (both ways). The tours they offer a bit costly so bring $$. We went to Xel-ha (we rented a car though). The all inclusive price without transportation is $75US pp. With transportation is $119 US pp. We will definitely go back to the Mayan Riviera but not necessarily to this hotel. I have nothing against Italians but I did have a problem with the entertainment team disregarding the rest of us tourists in the hotel!

The experience can be summed up as follows: An exceptional trip for the money. This hotel was one of the most cost efficient all inclusives we found outside of Cancun. For under 200 bucks a night, two adults and two children under the age of seven ate, drank and enjoyed the beautiful beach of Playa Maroma. At times, the food being offered was less than appealing (snack bar). At other times, we had a great piece of grouper or rack of lamb (La Tortuga at night). The buffett at the front of the property was nice for breakfast. They had a wide variety of Mexican breakfast items as well as comfort foods like pancakes and eggs. Service could be horrible (breakfast) or fantastic (La Tortuga for lunch and dinner). The most troubling aspect of the hotel is this inconsistancy with service and quality. You have to exchange your beach towels from 5 to 7. Any other time and the exchange booth is closed (ridiculous policy and bad service). The towels are old and need to be thrown out and replaced. The bath towels need to also meet the same fate. The rooms are old. The beds are harder than futons. However, the a/c kicks and the safe works. One trick, the a/c will not work unless the patio door is completely shut. There is a button that is trigerred when the patio door closes. The pool is very nice and the kids loved swimming and jumping off of the pillars in the pool. The hotels became crowded in the middle of our trip and was chock full of Italians and French. However, this was not a bad thing. Italians are beautiful people and love to show offer this natural beauty. The beach is very nice and you can walk in either direction for a long time. Walk toward the lighthouse to the south and enjoy the shallow waters on the point. The drinks were good and the bar staff knew their stuff. If you do not speak Spanish, you may stuggle a little. For those who love Rum, ask for Anejo with your Pina Coladas or Cuba Libres. That is the good stuff, dark aged rum. Overall, a good trip with some great food, good food and bad food; great service, good service and bad service.

There was time for many languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, etc but not for English. The bartenders knew a little, The front desk could communicate well, but forget most others. The restaurant staff was not able to communicate, the security staff??? could not. Scary, huh!

The drinks were watered down & the beer was the only thing worth drinking. I would not return here, but would to the area. The Road into the property is horrible. The only shuttle into town is the evening. Cab ride is $18-20. We have been in the area many times before & have seen the prices for outside activities soar over the past few years. Take lots of money if you plan on doing things like the nature parks, dolphin experience, scuba, snorkel, etc. One word of caution, use your credit card only for emergencies and when you can be present when they charge your card. We have stayed at many resorts which welcome Americans and want them to return. I did not feel welcome at any time while at this resort, a feeling shared by every American guest we found, very few of us tho. My 13 year old daughter was unable to talk to anyone but mom & dad and one member of the entertainment staff. I was shocked by the rude behavior of the guests which obviously disliked Americans. I could go on, but the forum won't let me post what I really feel about this place. Feel free to contact me. Better yet, stay somewhere else.

There are several really good things about this resort and some things that, while not bad, need to be taken into consideration. This was a bit of a different trip for us anyway, because it was just my 15 year old daughter and me. We left Dad and 20 year old daughter at home for a special \"mom/daughter\" trip. We tried to find another mom/daughter to go along, but since this trip was price driven and booked on short notice it was just the two of us. We had read the reviews and knew that there would be a majority of Italians at this resort and decided that would be part of the fun of the vacation. The reality, however, is different; and we only met two other groups of English-speaking people. The Italians are not rude, they are just not interested in interacting with anyone other than the person or persons they arrived with. Because of this, the staff is not as friendly as we expected because they are not accustomed to the guests speaking to them. For me, it was kind of isolating; however, teenagers seem to be able to overcome this, and my daughter had a wonderful time getting to know several teenage Italians. Upon arriving, check-in was a breeze and came complete with some kind of fruity drink from the bar in the lobby, which is lovely. Our room was a bit tired, but spacious. And even though we had requested double beds, we shared a king. The air conditioning ROARS and barely keeps up with the heat and humidity, but on the plus side it drowns out the noise from other rooms or people walking by outside! But the beach! The sand is more powdery and whiter than Panama City Beach. We were in Cozumel last year and would say the sand was better at Catalonia, however the water in Cozumel was much clearer. I think the sand is so fine it kicks up and clouds the water. There are lots of chairs at the beach evenly divided between shade and sun. We never had difficulty finding a place in the shade. The activity staff was wonderful to us. One in particular took my daughter under his wing (no fool, he) and made sure she got involved in things including a short group kayaking trip and some bocce ball on the beach. In the evening there was a singer in the lobby who was wonderful. He had a player piano and played guitar and sang. The activity staff was there talking to all and getting people up to dance. They were very kind to me as I spent time alone while my daughter hung out with her new friends. There was always a wide variety of food. We only had time to eat at the buffet or the snack bar at the pool. We didn\u2019t find anything to eat that we were really crazy about, but we didn\u2019t go hungry either. Would we go back? It was a gorgeous and romantic place, and I would love to go back with my husband. Am I sorry we went? NO WAY. A vacation is what you make of it. My daughter had the opportunity to meet people she never would have (though communication was non-existent for the most part \u2013 her best bet was using her two years of high school Spanish to one of the Italians who also spoke Spanish who translated it into Italian for the others!) We had lunch everyday sitting at a table looking over one of the most beautiful beaches I\u2019ve ever seen while a tropical breeze blew by.

I went by myself simply to relax and recharge my batteries from a stressful job. First off, the \u201cItalian\u201d issue. There is a large contingency of Italians there, with a sprinkle of French, German, North Americans and Spanish as well. Italians are not \u201crude\u201d or \u201cugly \u201c people but simply Italian and therefore different than North Americans. They consist mostly of young couples and some families with children. They are not loud, drunk partiers and will keep to themselves. Also, the kids are very well behaved. I firmly believe that this European influence classed up the place considerably. If Europeans bother you, don\u2019t go there. Yes the rooms could use some sprucing up but I found them adequate and kept very clean. But be warned that the beds are hard and so are the pillows. If you have extra space you might want to consider bringing your own pillows. There is construction in progress on the south side next to the resort, which I did not find intrusive, but then my room was on the north side. Rooms in the 2000,4000 and 6000 series are on the quieter side. An important note on sunscreen!! Bring plenty of bottles since at the resort and at Playa Del Carmen an average size bottle cost between $20 and $29 dollars US!! I found the food to be exceptional and varied. Although I never went to the restaurants, I was happy to eat at the buffet all week long. I have never seen so much food with such variety before. Ham, beef, duck, chicken, fish, pork, were served on different days and there very many different tables set up with vegetables, Mexican dishes, pizza, soups, fruit, desserts, cheeses, sea food (I think that was on Sunday), a fruit juice bar and much more. All I know is that I ate too much during that week. I even went back just before closing time to get a late night snack consisting of a sandwich, some fruit and a little dessert\u2026just in case. The beach is phenomenal as everybody is reporting and is one of the main reasons why I went there. Super clean with white sand and clear water. There are hundreds of little fish that swim around you close to shore, so many in fact that one of the guests was catching and releasing them with his t-shirt. Lots of chairs and cover from the sun is available at this time of year. The only thing I didn\u2019t care for too much was the very loud music they were playing on the beach, however if you stay on the south side it\u2019s generally ok. The staff is very friendly and will make every effort to make sure you are comfortable. English is not widely spoken by them but at the reception they speak it fluently. I made a point of always tipping $2 for every meal as well as the maid daily so my service was exceptional. However what you tip is up to you (I don\u2019t ever remember seeing anybody else tip\u2026strange.) I experienced no bug problems, had a few lizards in my room (they come in from under the door), had amazing weather (the entire week was supposed to consist of thunder showers and more rain), was never sick while at the resort (but I did get very ill for 24hrs the night I got home) and experienced nothing too negative. They do have a small and Spartan gym that is air-conditioned which I found adequate. If you\u2019re a gym rat like me you\u2019ll have to use your imagination a bit. Taxi to Playa Del Carmen is $18US. Some improvements the resort might want to consider. - Tone the music down - Get some sailboats or windsurfers - More English speaking staff - Have the Playa shuttle bus leave more than once a day - Have some English entertainment/shows Overall I was happy with my trip and found it money well spend.

I should say that the staff was also easily identifiable, every level of staff was differently attired; security was in white, grounds keepers where in brown, customer relations where in yellow and blue or blue and white. My point is, is that they where very professional and easily identifiable making interaction so easy. I wasn\u2019t asking the cleaners what species of tree I was looking at or asking a security guard to bring me a drink.

We also saw lots of iguanas, a few (harmless) grass snakes and several animals we'd never seen in our entire lives roaming all over the property (including the lobby). This place is truly in the JUNGLE, so you're in the middle of THEIR home. Very cool. The buffet was never boring, and we ate there almost 3 times per day. Rarely were any entrees repeated; we always found pleasant surprises and never ate anything bad. I sometimes have a sensitive stomache but never got sick from any of the food--and I ate seafood, salads, everything. They have special nights, too, where they focus on local specialties or other types of foods. They had a \"Mexican Fiesta\" night and another time a huge Seafood night with majorly elaborate spreads of foods. We ate at Tio Pedro's one night and it was fabulous! You have to get reservations the night before, and even then they're usually booked--but it's part of the all-inclusive package so we ate there. You HAVE to get the Mayan coffee--it's a huge production and they make it at your table with fire & lots of showy things. Very strong (lotsa alcohol) but worth it. The food at the pool area is basic, but something different every day. All you can eat ice cream, fun drinks. However, the LOBBY BAR has the BEST drinks anywhere on the grounds. Their mojitos were some of the best ever, as was the Blue Lagoon. Gotta do a few Boom-Booms while you're there, too--potent. Great buffet in the lobby before dinner, around 7-7:30 p.m. There's a guy who plays piano and sings, reminded us of Don Henley. Really nice. COFFEE LOVERS: The coffee in the buffet sucks. I recommend getting the 'Americana' from the lobby bar--they have an espresso machine--and take it with you for breakfast. I didn't learn this until the last day as we were leaving...drats... This is our first morning home and I MISS THE BREAKFAST JUICES in the buffet!! I had fresh watermelon juice every a.m., my husband always had the banana. They also have cantelope & honeydew juiices and several others. Just the best. We kept reading about how hard the beds were, and while they're not pillowtops by any means they were very comfortable after long days of non-stop activities. They have FREE KAYAKS and there were always lots of comfy chaise lounges on the beach and around the pool. There are flow-y covers on the beach if you don't want too much sun, and shaded areas all around the pool as well. Hammocks, outdoor massages, the works. They also have archery lessons, tennis & all kinds of free activities (aqua gym, beach volleyball, Spanish lessons, etc). When researching where we'd stay on TA, we kept reading over and over about the Italians. Part of the reason we chose Catalonia was for this reason--and now, more than ever, WE LOVE ITALIANS!! They were so much fun, we love their accents and love their passion for life. We met a grumpy woman from the US who complained about being 'a minority' and tried to tell us the Italians got preferential treatment from the staff. When we realized how bitter and angry she was, we sort of started backing away from her. So sad she ruined her own vacation that way; we saw her a few days later standing by the pool with her arms crossed, a scowl on her face. Tsk. By the end of our trip we were saying 'ciao' more than 'adios' to people and we made many friends simply by using bits and pieces of Spanish and Italian words. Viva la differences! Here's the only downside: my husband and I both got the dreaded Baja rash. I'm going to my dermatologist tomorrow to find out what's happening, but we think we got it in the water when we went snorkeling on one of our excursions. (We went to Xel-Ha, the Mayan Zip-Line tour and the Chichen Itza tour.) I know I got a spider bite while at Chichen Itza, but that's because I forgot my DEET spray... All-in-all, it was a beautiful, near-perfect vacation for us and we'd love to go back to the Catalonia again. There were only a few Italian children and ZERO crazy spring break types. My husband and I are in our 40's and felt very comfortable and safe at all times. Next time we want to go to Tulum, and we found out (as we were leaving...) that for $25 the Dive Shop will take you via boat to a great reef for snorkeling. Other than that we'll just stay on that beautiful beach and take it easy every day.

We are between the ages of 22-25 and we are from Grand Rapids, Michigan. This is my third trip to the Riviera Maya and my first time staying at this hotel. It was a pleasant trip and this is what I thought of this hotel: The Hotel: The resort itself is located in a forest that is isolated from other resorts in the area. It has beautiful grounds that are carefully maintained. The groundskeepers really go the extra mile in ensuring that the grounds are kept beautiful and clean. The lobby has a really nice bar, nice water fountains and a high thatched roof. There is allot of walking involved at this resort, but the scenery is nice and makes the walk easier to deal with. The Staff: For the most part the staff was friendly and helpful. This resort does cater primarily to Italians and other European guests, so much of the entertainment/activities/tours are not spoken in English. Most of the staff do speak a little bit of English, but obviously prefer to speak either Spanish or Italian. I do not desire allot of attention from the staff, and they pretty much stayed out of our way and focused on serving the European guests. If you do like to participate in activities or meet other guests, then you should probably either learn Italian or stay at a different hotel. My girlfriend and her sister are from Europe and they even found it hard at times to get assistance from the staff due to their preference to serve the Italian guests. The Rooms: Average by most hotels in Mexico's standards. The bathroom definitely needed to be renovated (no ventilation, allot of mildew, sand mites everywhere). The air didn't work properly anywhere in the hotel. Many guests complained, but the situation was never resolved. The beds were hard, but that is to be expected when staying in Mexico. It was annoying that there was no alarm clock, iron, or ironing board in the room. Overall, you don't spend allot of time in the rooms so it is best to just deal with it. The Food: There are three restaurants. The buffet was really good, but the other restaurants were not up to par. One of the restaurants serves lobster or steak at an additional $80.00 per person. We did not eat there. The other restaurant requires a reservation, but the service is bad and food isn't that great. Overall, you are better of sticking to the buffet if you stay at this resort. The Beach/Pool: The beach was very beautiful and secluded. It was the best part of my trip. The water was warm and relaxing. The beach is kept clean and has very soft sand that is easy on the feet. It is a bit windy and at times the waves can be rather large, but we still enjoyed the beach thoroughly. Overall: If you can deal with the average rooms and don't mind the lack of attention from the staff then this is the place for you. I got a good deal, didn't mind the staff leaving us alone, could tolerate the rooms, liked the food, and really enjoyed the time we spent by the beach and pool. I will probably stay at a different hotel my next vacation in the Riviera Maya due mainly to the ever-increasing amount of hotels developing in area. For the right deal though, I may be willing to stay there again. It was an above average hotel set in a really nice location.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cGreat time!\u201d", "Author": "melissas-7", "ReviewID": "UR7708294", "Content": "We stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma resort for 2 weeks in May. I came here with my family and my boyfriend so we had a large group. The resort is beautiful. The grounds are well maintained, very green and beautiful. You can see lots of wild life on the grounds. The best part of this resort is the beach. The sand is white powder sand. The water is crystal clear and so warm. We spent the majority of our time on the beach. There are waiters that serve you on the beach. Every night there is a great singer that sings lots of popular songs and lots of people dance to this music. He sings for a few hours and then there is a show at 10pm every night. After that the disco opens and people just party. The rooms are basic but they are fine. You don't spend much time there except to sleep so they are fine. If you are coming to this resort and are expecting to have pampered and lux. room then maybe you should change this resort because the rooms are basic. The food was amazing. There is so much to eat all the time. Tons of fruit, cold cut meats, different breads, salad, veggies, pizza, pasta, hot meat, gravy, fish and so much more. All of the la carte restaurants were amazing. The snack bar was also amazing. It was constantly stocked with fruit salad, burgers, hot dogs, chicken strips, fish sticks, fries, pizza, ice cream and more. The drinks were also great. You could order anything you wanted and the staff does a great job at making sure that there is lots of alcohol in your drinks. The staff were so great. They have Spanish lessons every day, aerobics, water aerobics, salsa dancing lessons, soccer tournaments, volleyball games, water polo and more. They staff goes out of their way to make sure that you have fun. They were so great to us. There are a lot of Europeans and Italians. If you come here by your self or with one other person it might be hard to communicate with the Italians unless you speak their language. There was definetly a language barrier between some guests as there are many Italians who come. But there are also lots of people from France, and some from America and a few from Canada. Because we were in a big group we didn't have any problems with this but I could see how one might. We went to Xel ha, Coba, Deep Sea fishing, Cozumel, Tulum, Playa del Carmen and the pub crawl in Cancun. All were great and I would recommend them to anyone again! Overall we had a perfect vacation.

I was not the typical travler. My husbands passport did not arrive in time for him to go on this trip and my reservations did not allow for a refund. After careful consideration, I figured what the heck, I went by myself. I am so glad I did. This hotel is not for the party crazed spring breakers. It is a jungle environment and secluded. Far from town and frequented by families and couples. Most everyone was from Italy or France. I met a few folks from USA. I found everyone there to be very self-absorbed. This was fine with me. Being alone I was not looking to socialize with people, for my security reasons I kept pretty much to myself. I would say hola to those passing by me and they would always smile and say hi back to me. The look of the hotel was colonial. I had been to a resort - Eldorado Seaside Suites, last September which was much more elegant. I actually preferred Catalonia Playa Maroma! It felt very natural and more like being in Mexico rather than just at an upscale fancy hotel that could have been anywhere. The room was modest but clean. I noticed that everyday the floors in my room were not only swept, but mopped. Always a fresh smell when I arrived back from the beach. They provide shampoo and body lotion and a mini fridge with bottles of cold purified water. The restaurants were great. I preferred - Tortuga restaurant. My meal there was- caprese salad, lobster bisque with which I had white wine with. My main entree was chateaubriond and it was delicious. I had red wine with that. Dessert was a lovely browned sugar crisp shell with sliced fresh fruits and mango ice cream. I had cappucino and amaretto with that. Service was very attentive and everywhere I went I was called by name, though being the only woman dining there by herself, the staff thought I was a bit of a mystery. The staff remembered me everywhere I went and made me feel very welcome. The buffet was fabulous for breakfast. I especially loved the fresh assortment of juices - cantelope, watermelon and many mixed blends of different types of native fruit. The assortment of breakfast foods was amazing. Everything from chiliquelas to crepes and waffles, eggs and sliced meats and cheeses. Just delicious. I ate at Tio Pedro the last night and it was good. Being from Texas, mexican food was no big deal to me, but the food was very good and the service excellent. The beach. OMG it was amazing. I have been to Cancun and Playa Del Carmen more than 20 times, this was the most beautiful sand and water I have ever seen. Clean white sand, you dont need beach shoes as far out as you can walk in the water. The water was crystal turquoise, warm and beautiful. Absolute heaven for the sun lover. There was so many activities going on, it was so cute to see about 40 couples doing salsa dancing on the beach in the afternoon. There were also many spirited beach volleyball games going on too. Any hotel can have a misstep. I am sure this hotel could have one too. But, my weekend was just lovely in every way. I can't wait to go again....next time with my husband!

But we found out that if they don't fill out the restaurant they will open reservation the next day in the morning only for that same night. The rooms are musty but which room isn't in mexico.

Although my husband and I do love soft beds, so of course the beds for us were especially hard. If you have ever traveled to Mexico/Bahamas/Jamaica you understand. Our room had a musty smell, but thats because of the climate. We are from Minnesota, so we are not used to heat and humidity 12 months out of the year. Honestly, nothing to complain about there. The food was great. Always something to eat. The road getting to the hotel, well if you have been doing a lot of drinking and have to go to the bathroom, its rough. But other than that its fine. No different than farm roads up here. The staff was like that of a cruise ship. Everyone tried to get guests involved, whether it was beach volleyball, to beach darts, to dance lessons, to aerobics and so on. They all spoke english very well, and appreciated it when you tried to speak spanish. Honestly, after visiting my friends hotel (El Dorado Royale) and staying at ours, we would choose ours in a heartbeat. At hers, you could only eat at a restaurant if you made reservations.

In fact-the staff was cleaning the beach, as well as the grounds nightly. Maybe they are in reference to the beach south of the hotel.

We never saw her she was always with her new friends - and in a safe environment. The pool was beautiful. Everyone raves about the beach on this website - We were very disappointed in the amount of garbage that would wash up on the beach each day - some days were cleaner than others - so, it could be a spectacular beach, but the garbage is really nasty.

I had read the earlier reviews and thought that my vacation would be a nightmare... and let me tell you -- it was far from that. I'll start with the bad, and really there aren't that many bad things about this resort. Firstly - the a la carte restaurants aren't all that spectacular. Probably it's because a lunch we had in Playa del Carmen overshadowed every meal we had after that. However, if you are only staying on the resort and not going anywhere else- then the a la carte restaurants are perfect. The buffet can get old after awhile, but all in all the food is good - lots to choose from. The snack bar is where we would hit late in the afternoon if we were heading out for the evening - and there was absolutely nothing wrong with that. Aside from that - my husband and I seemed to be plagued with the \"room card\" issue. Our card wouldn't work many times - but honestly - the walk back to the main desk wasn't a big issue for us at all. If you are staying in a room closer to the main desk - the beach can be a bit of a walk, but it is a nice walk because the pathways are beautiful!! Now... as for the previous reviews on the guests there. Yes - this resort used to be a European exclusive resort... yes - the majority of the folks there only speak either French, Spanish or Italian... what I can't believe with some of the previous reviews from Canadians is that they didn't think to pull out their Grade 7 french and try to learn!! What's wrong with you guys??!! ?Yo no hablo Espanol? Then learn!! The entertainment staff come around each day by the beach bar with a whiteboard to teach you.. and you can write it all down too. After a day, you'll be walking by people along the path and speaking basic Spanish to all of them. Occasionally, I would have Italians stop me and start speaking to me - in the broken Spanish they know along with Italian. Any Canadian who took basic french can sort of understand what they are saying, and you'll be suprised to learn that many of them want to learn english as well! By the end of my trip many of the Italian guests were waving, speaking a bit of English and stopping to talk - even though I didn't understand them. Wear a Canadian pin - and it seems that almost instantly they like you. No kidding here. I didn't have a single person butt in line in front of me, and even if they did- who cares! It's not like the drinks or food run out anytime soon. I am really happy that the resort has not opened up for Canadian guests. I would have missed out if I went anywhere else, and I personally feel embarrased that I took the earlier reviews to heart. We took a tour to Xel-ha and the Tulum ruins, and dropped other tourists at other hotels along the way home, and I am so happy with the layout of the Catalonia compared to other resorts. I won't comment much on the room aside from saying that it was clean, nice, and a place to rest your head after a long night of drinking. Although the road leading to the resort is full of craters, but the lobby is much prettier than other resorts I saw in my opinion. There is a gorgeous grass roof in the lobby, beautiful at night when hanging out in the lobby bar - where you will find a lot of latin dancing, karaoke, and a piano bar. Don't know how to latin dance? They'll teach you that as well - poolside in the afternoons. Then later on in the evening, the entertainment staff is more than happy to dance with you - be it a beginner or an expert (like my sister in law who rocked the joint with her talent!). Among the group of Canadians was a young girl - approx. 17 years old and she was bored. Perhaps she didn't hit up the staff and do some of the extra-curricular activities, but the younger children there were always doing something. If you are on the beach at the right time, you'll get to see the \"pirate parade\" - all the 3-6 year old guest walked along the beach with balloon swords, let by one of the staff members. Very cute - and it made me miss my own children, who were at home. I had wished I had brought my 9 year old son, he would have had a lot of fun there. My only disappointment would be that the beach bar isn't open past 11:30pm - because the lobby bar can get a bit hot, and it would have been really nice to have sat close to the seabreeze later at nights and tie it on! Now the best part -- the staff. No - a lot of the maintenance staff do not speak english, but they certainly try hard to understand you. Our housekeeper was so adorable, I held back the urge to pinch her cheeks on several occasions. If you've taken your basic spanish lesson at the resort, you can get by enough to at least say hi to them, and they say hi back and smile a lot. I think that they appreciate you trying to learn the language. We tipped as often as we could - everyone from the housekeeping to the buffet staff to the bartenders work extra hard - with or without that tip. The Alberta service industry could learn a lesson or two from these guys. The entertainment staff (or the \"party kids\" as my husband was calling them - ha ha) are absolutely wonderful. They love to get guests involved - be it with beach volleyball, dancing, kayaking (sp?), snorkelling, you name it - and they do it. They even have a staff member who will take groups on tours down the pathways to educate you on the different animals, trees and flowers on the resort. When you get to the front desk, ask when that tour is on - they do French, English and Italian tours. I missed out on that one, and I am still kicking myself for not asking. There are two staff members that I absolutely adore - Dario and Yanelli. Dario was my saving grace one night when I met up with a group of folks from Spain, and they speak so quickly, he was able to be my translator. After many cervazas, he promised to teach me basic Mayan. Mayan is hard to learn!! wow! But ultimately it's Yanelli that I will never forget. I sat and talked with her many times, she was eager to learn about Canada, and I was eager to learn about where she comes from - Jalisco. We three (my sister in law) talked many times. She was also my spanish teacher as well. We got her email address, and plan on emailing her this week with pictures of our vacation. I am happy that we built a great friendship over that week, and hope to see her again in the future. She is a person with whom I would open my home to, that is if she ever decided to brave the frozen north and visit us! I do reccomend that if you see her, stop and say hi. She speaks near perfect english, and is great conversation. There weren't that many Americans there, but there were enough Canadians at the resort that they had a \"Canadian night\" in the lobby bar one night. Many Quebecois there, and there must have been about 25 or so Western Canadians. All of those guests were pleasant and fun to hang around with. I hope to keep in contact with a the ones I met! I can say more about the resort and staff, but I think you need to be there to experience it yourself. Don't take those previous reviews to heart at all - and in the end, you get what you give.

The rooms further lacked any appeal and as others stated you could never be sure your room would come with towels, Kleenex and such. More than that though there were a couple of occasions in which there was no hot water and well, no water at all. Construction was occurring outside our room at times until late through the night. The staff was largely okay and as other stated the Italians were too much\u2026and made us feel as though we had no right to be there! The beach was amazing I cannot say enough good about that but really truly, that is were it ends. The food was okay lots of repetitive items as well as some strange things (tuna/other strange fish on pizza). I would not refer anyone to this resort and I say that with the utmost respect. As I said my intent is not bash this resort but people work hard for there money and this was an utter disappointment and waste of money. I do not feel that I my wife and 2 children will return to Mexico, at least not anywhere near this resort. I really encourage people to do their research and believe the negative reviews you are reading, where there is smoke this fire!

If you are looking for a great beach and good food, and can tolerate the Italians, this place is for you. The food at the al a carte restaurants was fabulous. Five and six course meals. We ate at the a la carte restaurants 5 nights. The buffett food was pretty good. The only down side to the buffett is that the menu didn't change much for breakfast and lunch. The snack bar at the pool wasn't great. Mainly a buffett of nachos, hotdogs and pizza. The staff was more than accomodating. They seemed friendly and most spoke reasonably good English. The event staff all spoke English well and were helpful. Getting a drink or help was very easy. The rooms were pretty plain. The king size matress was very hard. If you are used to a soft bed (I have a pillow top), you may not get a good night sleep. Room service did a good job of keeping the room clean and presentable, but you never knew if you would get the towells, kleenex, bottled water, etc. that the room intially came with. We tried tipping, but eventually had to hunt down a maid or laundry cart to get what we needed. As other reviews have stated, this hotel attracts a lot of Italians. There was a healthy amount of Canadians and French there also. Very few Americans. The Canadians were fun to be around. The French were fine, seeming to just want to be left to their own devices. The Italians treated everyone as if you were an imposition to them. They were rude to staff and other guests alike. We watched muliple times as an Italian (young and old) cut others off in line, chastized the wait staff, or ordered staff around (on one occasion we sat next to a family who let their young daughter badger the waitstaff and smile.

If you can get over the shock of the road on the way in, you will be pleasantly surprised. We booked this very last minute- Thursday, left Sunday and choose it based on best deal and we needed a break. It was colourful, friendly, good food and a very beautiful beach. Everything including day trips, service and checkin-departure was painless- just what the doctor ordered. Not lots of kids- we are emptynesters who really like kids but prefer quiet time with nobody running around the dining area. There were younger families with very well behaved children. Did not see many teenagers- keep this in mind unless they love the beach or pool- seemed there were limited activities for that age group. The lobby which is very open with a variety of comfortable seats is a great place for coffee and drinks before and after meals. A variety of activities are included dancing, archery, tennis, volleyball etc. The staff works endless hours to get guests to participate, they are multilingual and very friendly. We did a trip to Xel Ha- amazing and kids would love this one. Get your travel host to arrange a private car / full day excursion if you have time. We spent the whole day there 10:00 am to 5:00 pm and could have done another. Amazing snorkelling, ride a tube down the river, jump off cliffs, walks on the jungle good food, plenty of drinks, ice cream, efficient and clean. Great value for money $59.00 US for the day plus cost of transport. It is like a water amusement park and was definitely a happy place. Towels, lockers and snorkel gear are all included in the price. I would recommend this resort to those who are budget minded and don't expect glamourous rooms. The room was in one of the six buildings set back from the main pathway, it was quiet, and only improvement we would make would be a comfy chair or two inside the room for reading or relaxing. (we use the lobby one afternoon). Overall for a last minute deal we really enjoyed our stay. It is further from Playa than stated in the brochures (approx 30 mins) but the hotel runs a bus in the evenings (prebook, it's free) and a taxi is $18.00 US each way. I enjoyed the experience and have only once before done the all- inclusive thing- it was better than I expected. Word of caution- there seems to be a gentle breeze coming off the ocean at all times- really lather on the sun screen- we saw and met a ton of people (Canadians) with sunburn.

I did my homework before I left and we had a fantastic time. As the other posts describe, the beach was incredible, the food was outstanding, the staff were very nice and spoke adequate English, the rooms were large and had beautiful views but were not 5-star, the night life didn't get too crazy, and the Italians were for the most part rude and ugly. We went with a group of 11 Albertans, mostly couples, with no kids on this trip. Going as a group, we didn't have to rely on friendly Italians for company (good thing). The best we got was the odd smile from the Italians due to our crazy antics (don't all Canadians like to drink, laugh, and skinny dip in the ocean??). Being relatively young (late 20's and up), we spent one night in Cancun on an all-inclusive Saturday night pub-crawl to Senor Frogs, Daddy O's, and the greatest nightclub in the world Coco Bongo. I don't know if I could take a whole week of that kind of body torture, noise, and drug-filled peers, but one night was awesome. Google it if you want more info on that. I should mention that we booked our vacation through SunWing Vacations. I would highly recommend this (or something similar) since you will have an honest local person working directly for you. There are many scam artists and creeps in Mexico you need to be aware of. Our local person was known as Mexican Brad Pitt. I kid you not, everyone that knew him called him Brad Pitt. He told us which outfits were shady and which were worth the money and we paid everything directly through him. He organized everything for us. On the pub-crawl we didn't realize we were part of a larger group and when everyone left the first bar we stayed behind waiting for someone to tell us it was our turn to go. Little did we know nobody was going to tell us. Out of nowhere Brad showed up, even though he was not on duty at the time. He gathered us up and flagged down a city bus in seconds and paid for our fares and had the driver take us directly to our next destination. I think even the locals on the bus were amazed. Then he brought us right into the bar (even in front of the other VIP people that were still in the VIP line). He also reminded us of the things he'd explained before about good things to try and do and what not to do and about the included drinks. Anyway, enough about Brad, but we really appreciated having him take care of us while we were in Mexico. Book your trips through your local person and he or she will take great care of you. We did the pub crawl, aquatic adventure, coba maya encounter, the tulum/xel-ha trip, the cozumel trip, and the horseback riding, quadding, and seadooing trip (we didn't all do every trip but we combined pictures at the end). The best part about the Catalonia Playa Maroma resort was that I really appreciated the quiet, romantic, and secluded resort to go \"home\" to. The resort was amazingly well kept, clean, and accommodative. There's plenty of room to do your own thing whenever you want. Drinks and snacks 24 hours a day. Totally secure area so if you want to walk down the beach at 4 AM you feel totally safe. There are no locals or panhandlers anywhere on the resort. It's location is perfect, far enough away to be your own little paradise and close enough for a quick cab or bus to Cancun, Playa del Carmen or Cozumel. Xel-ha and Tulum are also not very far away. Here are a few other notes I'd like to include: The waves were larger on Tulum beach so the body-surfing was better there (you could ride the waves for around 20 to 30 feet sometimes); take off all necklaces, rings, hats, and sunglasses before body-surfing or you will lose them; bring snacks on the plane because the food isn't great and it takes around 6 hours (from Calgary); look for Ricardo at the main buffet for breakfast and lunch; try the archery; all Mexican drivers are crazy; take some time to learn some Spanish; they'll keep the disco open as long as you want if you don't leave but it's usually not that busy so if you're not there when it starts they'll likely shut it down; the disco usually plays some good dance music (Canadian nightclub style); the salsa, meringue, cha-cha, etc. dance lessons looked like fun; there are occasional topless women on the beach (sweet...); the earlier mentioned skinny dipping was at night on two occasions, just remember if you dare to do this try to be sneaky (obviously) and if you get caught make sure to have extra cigarettes on hand to pay off the security guard(s)... Lastly, if you tip the bartenders/waiters they'll be very eager to serve you drinks wherever you go. We had drinks brought to us right on the beach so we didn't even have to get up from our beach chairs. They come as often as you want and you can even make special requests. I recommend vodka sunrises if you ever get sick of the beer. Best tipping advice is to tip well on the first drink and last drink of the sitting rather than a little bit every time. I think it's more respectful (they're not dogs) and it actually saves money in the long run. All in all, we had a fantastic time and we'd definitely go back to Catalonia Playa Maroma again. I recommend this resort to anyone that doesn't mind paying a little extra for a quiet, romantic, and secluded resort to go \"home\" to and be pampered after a long day of activities or a night on the town.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cWe had a fantastic vacation at the Maroma (from Vacnouver, B.C.)\u201d", "Author": "AWellTravelledFellow", "ReviewID": "UR7232013", "Content": "We booked this at the very last minute and had no idea what to expect. We read a few of the reviews after we booked, and were someowhat nervous. But now that we have stayed there, I have to wonder at the problems that some of the others are writing about. I take special exception to the idea that the place was full of \"Euro-trash\". What is \"Euro Trash\" anyway? Are we \"Canada Trash\"? Yes - most of the other visitors were Italian, with some French and a few Canadian (and fewer Americans). The people we encountered were warm, happy people, enjoying their vacations. Aaide from the fact that more of them smoke than we are use to (but that is Europe for now) and some of them sunbathe bare-breasted (also Europe), I saw no issues at all. In fact, we were very poleased to be able to show our daughters that other kinds of people exist in this world. What a treat! Now - on to the place itself. The beach - the nicest I have ever seen in the world. Soft, small-grained, nearly white sand. Never any problem at all getting beach chairs in the open or under shade. The water was very warm - much warmer than Hawaii, and the weather always perfect. The ocean was an incredible, clear turquoise blue. And the staff were always coming by with drinks of various sorts - a real pleasure. In additon, the staff was always working tirelessly to ensure you were having a good time - you could participate in non-stop activities, or lay low and vegitate. The staff - completely wonderful. They all worked hard to speak english as best they could. It was never a problem, and the best I can do in Spanish is to order a beer or Pina Colada. The service staff were always friendly and always accommodating. Make sure you have dinner at the Tio Pedro restaurant. We did and the food and service was amazing - right down to the flaming Mayan Coffee after dessert. All included - no extra charge. There was one restaurant that did cost extra - La Terraza - but we never went there so I cannot comment. The food was very very good - especially at Tio Pedro. But even the regular buffet was excellent. And I was in a juice-lovers heaven every morning at breakfast. They had a wide variety of smoothies and fresh juices (made then and there). And at the beach there was an open bar and snack bar. I spent most of my days enjoying nachos with all the fizings, and sampling from about 20 different beach drinks they made (all the usuals plus many I never heard of). It was such a treat to wander up to the bar or snack bar and order without having to worry that it was going to cost me a fortune. Our room was very nice - very quiet. Yes - the beds are harder than we are use to. I experienced the same thing in most of the european hotels I have been to, so perhaps this is an effort to cater to their european clientelle - I am not sure. The room was spacious. By North American standards it was not 100% clean, but was very good considering Mexican hotel standards. My wife, who is a stickler for that kind of thing, was fine there. The room had a safe in it, as well as a fridge. When we first arrived, there were snacks waiting for us in our room. The room was cleaned and made up daily without exception. The security seemed very good in the area and we had no hints of any problems. It is true that there is a short bumpy road from the main highway to the hotel. But who cares - it is all of 1/4 of a mile long and takes 3 minutes to go over it by car. We only left the resort a couple times. The setting there is amazing. The hotel exists in a jungle and they took full advantage of the jungle in designing the hotel. It is magnificent. The rooms are split into 6 buildings - all 2-3 stories, beautifully set, and each separate from the other in the jungle. You walk on concrete walkways through the jungle to the rooms, restaurants, beach, etc. The jungle sounds and animals are beautiful. It is soooo much nicer than a typical mega-building. It is true that there is construction next door to the resort. It is on the south side. We were on the far side (in the \"Coba\" buildings), and had no issues with noise. While the construction continues, make sure your room is on the North side of the walkway that splits the resort (on the same side as the Coba if you see a map or want to describe it to them). The construction is only during the day, but may wake you early. So if you intend to sleep late, get a room in any of the buildings on the North side of the resort. Note that our last warm vacation - 9 months ago, was to Maui staying at the Four Seasons for $1,000 per night for a small suite. Admittedly it was nice, but: the beach could not hold a candle compared to that Maroma, the service was not a whole lot different than the Maroma, the hotel was not nearly as beautiful as the Marmoa (in terms of setting, etc), I got tired of paying $80 for lunch and $8.00 each time I had a drink on the beach (all included at the Maroma), I could almost never get a beach chair at the Four Seasons unless I was out at 7:30am or 3:00pm (never a problem at the Maroma), and I felt like a second-class citizen at the FS because I was not in one of the $2,500 suites (which had cabanas reserved for them, etc). All in all, I would absolutely go back to the Maroma - but not rush back to the Maui FS (don't get me wrong, it was great, but not great enough to justify the price). Besides that, it rained most of the time we were in Hawaii. The weather was perfect at the mayan Riveira. I hear from others that our weather experience was not unusual. So - for us, we have never had a nicer beach holiday, and certainly never had better value.

You were allowed as many visits as you wanted to the a la carte restaurants. We visited both the Mexican and Italian restaurants. Both were excellent. Two nights we ate dinner at the buffet and the food was excellent! Almost as good as the a la carte restaurants. The desserts were amazing! The selection was huge - from turkey dinner with all the trimmings to sushi to crabs legs and oysters! There was definitely something for everyone. There was even a 'Kids Corner' with food like chicken wings, fries etc. The pool was beautiful and clean. If you wanted a drink, you had to go into the pool bar to get one. I was not approached once the whole week and asked if I wanted a drink. The whole area clears out about 2:00 p.m. With mostly Italian people there, they disappear for a few hours for a siesta. Around 5:00 p.m. people start drifting back to the pool. If you want a seat around the pool, be prepared to get up around 7:30 a.m. and leave your towel on a chair. Even though the whole place clears out, they all leave their belongings on their chairs so they can come back later. About 90 % of the speaking done on the speakers in the pool area was in Italian with a little in English. It was hard to know what was going on ie. the times for water aerobics, salsa dancing class, volleyball games as all the written notices around were in Italian. Also, many of the women sunbathe topless and some even pulled down their thongs to get a tan on their behinds! The beach was breathtaking! Too rough to snorkle in though. We did not go in once, instead going on 2 catamaran snorkle trips. The snorkle trip with the lobster lunch on board was awesome! And the trip to Island of the woman was the best bang for your buck as it included a catamaran ride, a snorkle excursion, shopping and finally a buffet lunch at a private beach club that was right on the ocean and also had a pool. All this was only $56.00. A person could always get a chair on the beach but it was often very, very windy and we actually got cold. It was nicer around the pool where it was more sheltered from the wind. The free shuttle left every evening at 6:00 p.m. for Playa Del Carmen. You had to book this the morning prior to when you wanted to go. The shuttle comes back to the hotel at 11:00 p.m. which was a bit late, as the stores closed around 9:00 p.m. We would come back to this resort as we did not spend a lot of time in our room and were there for the beautiful beach and excellent food.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campbell River", "Title": "\u201cCatalonia Yucatan, Feb. 18-25th/07\u201d", "Author": "JewelCampbellRiver", "ReviewID": "UR7166112", "Content": "My husband, daughter and I spent 1 week in February/07 at the Cat.

The airport was a bit of a nightmare with all the condo sales people. You think they are a part of the airport information service as they look all official in their booths they just want to rope you in to visit a resort so beware and avoid eye contactand keep walking till you get out into the fresh air outside. once we got our shuttle to the hotel all was good untill we turned down this dirt road full of potholes and at that time we both thought oh my god what the hell are we doing here however the road dosn't belong to the hotel and the owners for some environmental reason cant fix it so don't worry too much because once you get to the main entrance to the resort you quickly realise that everything is ok. Our check in was painless and we followed a porter to our room which was basic but functional.

Woke up early the next morning hungover and made our way down to the beach in the daylight to check everything out. What can I say the beach is absolutely spectacular with pure white powdery sand and unbelievably blue, blue, water with no rocks or seaweed (absolutely perfect) Hung out for a bit and decided to go to the buffet for breakfast, lots of choice the omlettes are made to order and a good selection of fresh fruits, salsas, sweets, juices and mexican dishes that were strange but pleasantly tasty. We then went to the booth at the entry to the buffet where we were able to book up dinner at the mexican alacarte restaurant that evening no problem whatsoever. Bar service was really good and most of the bartenders were friendly drinkswere good and had no problems ordering as much as you wanted or asking the barman to make you something a little bit different. From around 11am till 5pm there was always something to eat at the pool bar pizza ,chilli, hamburgers, hotdogs salsa, guacamole and nachos. Never made it to the disco or entertainment at night as we were usually done by 10pm each night so that we could get up early and get to the beach as early as possible. Eat at the Mexican twice and was very good each time, I loved the black bean soup. We paid the surcharge of $100 US to eat at the seafood restaurant as it was my birthday that night, we had lobster in a very romantic settingand thoroughly enjoyed the meal and service. We ate at the itallian restaurant for lunch and dinner and were impressed with the quality and service (this restaurant is the busiest as most of the guests are itallian) We ate at the buffet a few times at night and were happy each time as they always had something that we liked, the pizza and seafood pasta were awsome. The hotel has a free shuttle that takes you into playa del carmen but you have to book a place the day before and it leaves early evening and brings you back to the hotel around 11pm. We never took the shuttle but did take a taxi into the town one day it cost around $20US each way but we managed to share with another guest that was planning to go also that day.

We have travelled to many places in Europe, Canada US Africa and the carribean but this was our first all inclusive resort, and decided that it is the only way to go and thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Mayan Riviera, just booked a trip to the dominican all inclusive also and hope it will be as enjoyable as this vacation.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe best Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "MilkaOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR7154440", "Content": "We have just come back from our vacation at Catalonia Playa Maroma (March 2-9). I have to say one thing we were very, very nicely surprised, especially after reading some of the negative reviews! Starting with the road leading to the Hotel (1.5 Km of the main highway). Yes, it was a tad bumpy, but so what, the total amount of time spent on it is about 30 seconds? Further, a road of similar quality leads to a 5 star hotel, The Moon Place, and no one has complained! You are in Mexico, rural Mexico, and you spend your time on the beach not walking or driving on this road! Staff, yes mostly Spanish speaking, but very, very friendly and makes diligent effort to speak English. More, they were eager to teach us Spanish and we loved that! We have never had a problem to communicate. We had some problems with the safe in our room and the support staff was there within 5 min to help us. Rooms. Big and clean, not a 5 star, but we knew we are booking 4 star hotel, so no surprise here. Besides, we were just sleeping there and taking a shower. I do agree that the bathroom needs some renovation, it would be nice, but it was always clean! Food. Absolutely fantastic. Main buffet, always fresh, a lot of salads, fruits, freshly squeezed juices. Very good choice! No matter what time we went for our meal we had a full choice. The best part \u2013 Mexican restaurant. Beef in chili sauce is a must! And ask for a Mayan coffee. They will prepare it next to your table, it is quite a show and coffee is excellent! Snack bar/ Bar. No lines at all. The bars were great. Bartenders very, very nice and friendly! Ask for tequila boom-boom. You will love it! Pool. Just wonderful, big and clean. Beach. Loved it. This is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my life. I could not believe my eyes. The sand is white and so fine and soft. Guests. Yes, mostly European. Good looking and well dressed. Nice and friendly. We never had a problem with them. But I do understand why some people feel bad there. If you are a self-adoring, weight challenged, also known for the most part as a typical North American resident, no one will be paying attention to you there. You will be the part of the universe not it\u2019s center. Sorry guys! It is a typical European place. If you want an American vacation, go to Cancun and you will find there a typical, plain American city, nice roads, cars and American crowd. If you want to experience something new go to Catalonia Playa Maroma. Oh, and please, do not complain that you have to walk between beach and restaurant! The gardens are great; you are in the middle of the jungle! Watch for the animals and birds around! It is a nice walk, so do not be a lazy person who needs a ride to get to food!!!!!!!! The meals are great so the exercise will do you good and you will burn some of those calories. Overall. Great experience.

After arriving on time at Cancun airport, it took over 5 hours to get out of it. Partially because airport was extremely busy but Conquest reps were not doing good job at all. We were sent from here and there for a transportation. If only they did check our names at the exit door to direct to the right bus,,,. As everybody have said before, hotel ground was beatiful. But room needs renovation for sure if they want to claim 4 or 4.5 star hotel status. In our room, balcony handle was broken. Cracks on the wall. Water didn't drain well. No international phone service from room. Also broken glasses on the floor when we arrived there. Food is OK. But not much seafood except one theme night. For lunch buffet with reservation, I have to say \"why should we make a reservation for that?\". Mexican restaurant for Dinner was nice. Beach is beatiful. But not for small children because of high wave. Pool is nice. But I saw brown water was coming out from filter once. I think it needs major clean up around the walls, too. Shuttle service to Play del Carmen is good but returning 11:30 is not ideal at all. As I said, because we bought a good deal, we were OK there. But if we had paid for full price, we would have been disappointed tatally. We have stayed at Barcelo Maya Beach and Bahia Principe Coba before. Those are truly 4.5 star hotel. Not Catalonia. Lastly but not least, workers there are working very hard. I think they deserve more tips. We had a good time but I don't think we would go back there again.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, Toronto, Canada\u201d", "Author": "travelbudsBradford", "ReviewID": "UR6901588", "Content": "We stayed at the Catalonia Playa Maroma from Feb. 11-18, 2007, and after reading the reviews were a little bit apprehensive about going. The road into the resort is yes very bumpy, but once you get there, it was a great surprise. The resort was very clean and the front desk people were very generous and always spoke to us in English. This resort was one of the cleanest I have seen. You always saw the staff either in the lobby, pool, beach or on your way to your rooms cleaning. ROOMS - Your only going to sleep in the room, so you don't actually spend much time in it. Our room was very clean, we never had any problems with our bathroom, it was also very clean. The bed was a bit hard, and the pillows were not the greatest, but overall not as bad as everyone has said. Everyday when we got to our room there was something made up with towels on our bed that the maid had done for us earlier. FOOD - The food was great, never had a complaint. You had many things to choose from, and everything was always filled up when it was close to being empty. The al a carte restaurants were great, the service was amazing. BEACH - This resort has one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. The white sand, and the crystal clear blue water was breathtaking. You never had to wait for a beach chair, there was always some available. POOL - We swam in the pool about half the time we were there, and it was always clean and you could always get chairs. The pool bar was never a problem for us. The bartender was always helpful, and spoke to us in English. We tipped generously, so I'm sure that helped. The lobby bar was were we spent most of our time in the evening after dinner. The bartender at that bar was amazing, and they all knew how to speak English. Our drinks were always ready for us when we got up to the bar, as by the middle of the week they knew what we were drinking, and made an effort to have everything ready for us. They were great. If you go to this resort I highly suggest that you go on the Pirate Ship Adventure. It was the most amazing night we had there. We took a taxi to Cancun, and boarded a ferry that had an open bar, and then the pirate show began. You took this ferry over to Isle Murajes, where you were treated to dinner on the beach, and another show. It was well worth the money, and I would suggest this to everyone. We also went on the Mayan Ruins adventure, and this was great also. Would also suggest this. Overall this was a great vacation, and I would recommend this resort. I would definately go back.", "Date": "March 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cdamn italians...\u201d", "Author": "RACER17", "ReviewID": "UR6898661", "Content": "Well what can I say?? The reviews I read here said beware of the rude Italians. We were only a handfull of english speaking people there and we found the Italians some of the most un-mannerly people we've ever met! i couldn't help wondering how these people we're brought up ?? Is this their culture to stare you down all the time, or have no respect for a line up , make NO effort to make eye contact and even a pleasent nod once in awhile ,bang into you with no appoligies?? All the other english people we met had the same problem. The Italians treated the kind mexican staff like servents ,and would step directly infront of you in a line up to the bar ,or buffet, and walked down the narrow pathways 3 and 4 people wide and didn't even try to move for you!! As for the staff.... they couldn't do enough for us, they obviously have the same problems as we did and we spoke to a couple of staff and they can't stand them either. The resort was quite nice. The food was good, the beach was beautiful (with the exception of all the garbage the tides brought in ) and as I said the staff were excellent. The rooms are 3 star at best but we didn't spend much time in them so not a big problem. I can't believe there was no swim up bar ,I thought all 4 & 5 star resorts had them?? Anyway...If the Italians find another resort to stain this would a better destination \"in my oppinion\" !!", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cDon't Go Here\u201d", "Author": "irene13", "ReviewID": "UR6833798", "Content": "After travelling past gorgeous hotels, we turned onto a long dusty road full of pot holes, which led us to the hotel.

The next day the hotel moved us to a different room, after we complained of the problem. The front desk was quite ignorant and would refuse to communicate in anything but spanish or italian, even though they did speak and understand english, This is an italian only hotel, that went bankrupt, so italian quests resented non-italians being present and us aware of their displeasure. The beaches and pool are are beautiful and well looked after. The food was ok, and there was lots of it with good variety.
