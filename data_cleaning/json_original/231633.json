What can I say the only good thing was the breakfast, I really liked the pastries :) The bed was uncomfortable, in the evening it was quite cold in the room and a few days passed until I thought to speak at the reception to turn on the heating. Not very clean either, in order to put my clothes in the closet I had to wipe the thick layer of dust. Some evenings I had to take showers with cold water as it wouldn't get hot no matter how long I would leave it running. Very far from city center. I liked the fact that I had free Wi-Fi.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNever coming Back\u201d", "Author": "JimmyB12233", "ReviewID": "UR114855411", "Content": "I booked the room for value because i needed to get some work while traveling for a good price.This hotel has a weird smell is not 4 stars at all i believe it is a 2 star hotel it seems like a ghost town i felt like the only person here...wish i didn't book it and i wished that people wrote real reviews about the hotel is really like the location is horrible and the beds are lumpy. i thought i was getting a good deal online but you get what you pay for.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lenexa, KS", "Title": "\u201cA very comfortable place to stay, with quite good service\u201d", "Author": "rganti9", "ReviewID": "UR107953136", "Content": "I have stayed in this hotel for close to 21 days, during april-may 2011, i was very happy with the help and service they provide. I being a vegitarian, found that the smll kitchen provided was the best, the bed was quite comfortabl, but for the pillows they were flat so had to use the other flece blanket as my pillow, aprt from that had plenty of sunshine. Close to the bus stop and also to the metro station, so you will find yourself connected. A few good restaurants nearby to help.

It was good for us at price, because in that period (the Catholic Holy Week) all what we found was almost at the same price, but less stars. And if a 4 stars look like this, I only can imagine what it may be for 2-3 stars. The hotel was recommended as a good one for that price. I did not like it too much because: - it wasn\u2019t very clean - it was noisy because of the rest of the guest (I can hear them when they were on the hall and when they close their door) - there were few TV channels, and most of them in Spanish - the reception desk is not nice", "Date": "April 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks.

The hotel is located close to the A30/A2 junction and was easy to find. It also has a garage which is very useful - 11 Euros although our package included it for free. The room was very spacious - large sitting area, small kitchen and the usual comforts and modern bathroom. Furnishings seemed new and when we had a maintenance problem it was sorted out straight away. It is in a residential area so noise was not a problem. It is quite a long way from the centre of Madrid and the metro, but the hotel recommended the No 21 bus which runs every 5-10 minutes and stops just outside the hotel, this took us to Playa Colon where you can get the metro, pick up the tourist bus or walk down to the Prado easily. The bus took about 30 mins but it is interesting seeing the locality and travelling with the locals, so don't let the non-central location put you off if you need a car park. This hotel came as part of a deal, pay for food and the room is free. The main problem was spending enough on food! The breakfast buffet was adequate - hot and cold food - but nothing special and I think it was better if you got there earlier. Staff very friendly but only speak Spanish so take your phrasebook. The dinner was fresh and plentiful but a bit cheap and cheerful. The wine on offer was excellent. The hotel cafe/bar is also used by locals which makes a change from being on the tourist trail.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201caverage good but some embarrasing problems\u201d", "Author": "Yull", "ReviewID": "UR10019717", "Content": "The hotel is rated 4**** but... First unpleasant experience was at the reception. We had the hotel payed in advance but they asked for credid cards. I have to tell you that this is for the very first time when this happened. OK I can understand that they don't trust us (minibar) but whey should we trust them ?? Anyway. Then I had a big problem. The toilet has no toilet bowl cleaner brush!!!!!!!!!!!!! As I was not alone but with my wife and obviously we have to share the toilet this was a very embarrasing problem. I report this at the desk and they didn't react in anyway. Just tell me that the maid will clean after..........All six days we were, the brush never appear. I don't want to tell how I solve the problem. The hotel is located far away of the downtown (Atocha etc). In the surrowndings we didn't see restaurants but some tapas bars. So, hotel restaurant was the option. After walking all day long in Madrid all we need was some dinner and maybe a beer. Unfortunately, the restaurant staff speaks no English. At a moment I went to the reception, ask the lady to write me on a piece of paper what we want to order in Spanish. The rest was quite OK", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and very average\u201d", "Author": "Blonde-Aussie", "ReviewID": "UR5782868", "Content": "Although the room was quite large the service in this place is terrible.
