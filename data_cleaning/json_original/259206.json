My last review suggested that attention to detail was missing, it should come as no surprise to find things had not changed. I asked on arrival for an upgrade and was told no and I would have a view of the wall of the next building (standard room corporate booking $260 a night). I met an other person during my stay who was given a suite with a view for $230 a night, she had made her own booking. Breakfast - 1st day none - I left my menu out the night before hanging on my door at 9pm but no-one collected it. When I complained I was assured it would not happen again. They fixed that problem for me by not leaving a room service breakfast menu in my room for the rest of my five day stay. It rained a lot last week which encouraged me to finally try the meals. The meals are fine, despite my order going astray due to their new booking system which did not relay the order to the kitchen. Staff were apologetic and offered a free glass of wine (not forthcoming so had to ask for it). My meal arrived but it was the wrong meal and I had to ask for the salad. I could not bother complaining further and ate what I was given. Will I go back......no.... despite its great location it continues to disappoint. I think that it is strong demand due to its great location and they just cannot be bothered with improving service, whatever the reason .....Accor here I come....goodbye Vibe Hotels.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location\u201d", "Author": "Canucks-down-under", "ReviewID": "UR127960685", "Content": "Located across from Milson's Point train station and easy walking distance to North Sydney.

If you are travelling with a vehicle, the location is very difficult for parking, with highly vigilant parking police. On-site parking is available for $25 a day for overnight guests, and is really the only option. The hotel is still stuck in the Australian broadband access mindset of a decade ago. There is allegedly 15 minutes free WiFi available if you buy a drink in the bar on level 1, and in room rates are around $25 a day! Despite these shortcomings, the hotel has remained my favoured option on trips to Sydney from Canberra for sporting and other events.

In general couldn't fault the hotel or the staff. We arrived at silly o'clock in the morning off the back of a 24hr flight from London and were found a room within 15 minutes despite the 2pm check in time. The room was quiet and kept clean & spotless by the \"invisible\" cleaning staff, something which we appreciate a lot is not being hassled at hotels by staff on deadline to clean rooms. The hotel is located 2 minutes walk from Milsons Point station with easy access to just about anywhere in Sydney, you also have access to Sydney Harbour bridge and the walk across to Circular Quay and The Rocks. At the bottom of the road you can pop on one of the many harbour ferries as well. One negative comment: WiFi: I don't mind paying for WiFi at hotels as I find you tend to get a better service than the so called \"Free\" service from other hotels. However if I pay for WiFi I expect it to cover ALL my devices and not just a maximum of 2. When my wife and I travel on business we take 2 laptops, 2 or 3 WiFi enabled phones and more than likely a Kindle or two. The Vibes WiFi service only allowed 2 devices to be connected at any time and there was no method to \"unsubscribe\" a device and connect another, forcing us to pay the daily or hourly rate (much more expensive than the weekly rate) and choose which devices to connect for that period. Using the \"free\" 30 minutes in the Curve restaurant was not an option for us though it may be for other users. I would suggest The Vibes management revisit this 2 device policy or provide a method to unsubscribe devices as paying for WiFi on a daily or hourly basis to get around this or even purchasing multiple WiFi packages does increase the cost to a point where I would considering looking else where to stay. Being picky now: The room safe is not large enough to accommodate 2x 15 inch laptops and there were no anchor points in the room use a Kensington lock to secure the laptop to which is a must these days for business travellers. An anchor bolt fitted to the wall by the room desk is a $20 upgrade at most.

It's right across from the train station (yes, you CAN hear the train in the morning.) It's nice because it's in North Sydney, away from the uber-high traffic area of the CBD. But a nice stroll across the bridge, or a quick train ride, takes you right into the main city. Also, there's some very interesting restaurants 100 meters away in Kirribilli (try Kirribilli Hotel for drinks, Garfish for great seafood or Stir Crazy for (relatively) affordable Thai Food. Rooms are good sized w/ couch or two chairs plus very comfy bed. Clean and efficient would be a good description. Get a front-facing room or else you're staring into the apartment complex 5 meters away (and yes, they can stare right back into your room). Bar is nice, restaurant food is quite good and there's an outside terrace overlooking the harbour. Plus: Breakfast is A$ 20.00, but you can often get it comp'd into the rate, or coffee guy right outside the front door, or small breakfast nook one door away. Fridge in room. Olympic pool and fitness center are a short walk away -- ask the front desk for comp passes (you can get one per person per day.) Oh, and it is really Olympic as in it's where they had the swimming during the Sydney Olympics!. Always cabs out front. Negatives: Train noise might be bothersome for some. They charge for internet service (really Vide?) They charge 1.50% extra for paying by credit card (really, really Vibe?) Service is... well...examples. 1) Room wasn't ready at check-in, but they offered to upgrade me to one that WAS ready -- for $75.00 per night. 2) Pipe broke in ceiling above room and flooded the bathroom at 3.30am. Had to pack up everything and move to another room. Not their fault, but didn't comp anything on the room rate at first. After arguing with manager, they finally agreed to knock $100.00 off of a $279.00 per night rate (and mind you, I was there 8 nights.) Definitely should have comp'd the flooded room. Tips: There's little brochures in a rack by the elevator. The one for the Vibe North Sydney contains a 2-for-1 coupon on dinner. Take it and use it! Food is really expensive in Sydney.

Unless you are planning to take a train everywhere you go, the location really isn't that great. A cab ride into the city (say QVB for shopping) will set up back by AUD 12 on a Sunday where traffic on the bridge is quite light. The train is about a 3-5 mins walk away though. Room: A really really basic room and bathroom, do not expect any amenties. The wifi in the hotel is very expensive. I think for the 3 day package I paid approx AUD 60. At least the room itself was clean. Note that complimentary bottles of water is not provided. But there is a convenience store about 2-3 mins walk. Food: The complimentary breakfast is really nothing exciting. The usual spread, looked a little like it had been sitting there for awhile and it was 730 in the morning. Didn't bother with breakfast after the first morning. The one thing they did which I appreciated was that they set up a little coffee stand outside the hotel in the morning for you to grab your coffee on the way to work. Service: Typical friendly Aussie service. The one thing that was really shocking, I didn't realise that check-out is at 11am. Somehow the hotels have changed it to 11 from noon? Anyway, when I got back to the hotel, I went up to my room only to realise that my keycard was not working. Headed back down to the reception to have it reset. Lady never mentioned that it is coz I passed my check out time. While I was in my room packing, there was a knock on my door, reception came up to ask when am I planning on leaving?!?!

The rooms are spacious and modern. The bathrooms are nice and clean too.! We had been allocated a room on the 8th floor. Unfortunately we had very noisy neighbours who made very loud noises past midnight. The staff at reception are very polite and helpful. Liked the additional free copy of Marie Claire magazine available at reception. For travellers, the hotel is minutes from the Harbour Bridge and Luna Park.

After switching between services apartments and hotels, I have in the last two years made Vibe North Sydney my number one choice in Sydney. It's location is second to none, local restaurants, trains across the road, short walk to city or North Sysney and the morning walk around the harbour foreshore via Lavendar Bay and Luna Park is one of Australia's best. The Vibe has it's rare days, and I say rare days where little things are not right, but in all my stays (in excess of 150 nights) I've only ever asked for a change and it was nothing to do with the service or the hotel itself. The prompt and sincere response I got from their manager Mia was brilliant. The vibe management are regularly seeking out feedback and improvements which is a great way to keep on the front foot for customer service. I can honestly say, they don't just take it in and smile, they act and follow-up. The staff on reception, resturant and bar always make the effort to remember their customers and personalize the service, excellent work guys and it's something that I've not only noticed, appreciate. When new staff join the Vibe team, clearly the management have put in place a proactive training strategy to ensure that personalize customer service is maintained, proven as recent as this week with a new member Abby, referencing me by name, acknowledging my return visit and providing with a complimentary welcome gift. The new GM, Matt has made himself accessible to his customers and clearly has instilled this in his own management team. The management team in Mia, Janine, James and the head chef (sorry im bad on names), but all approachable, all great people. I will confess I miss the duck from the menu and would like to see a currie added to the regular menu given some of the great meals I've sampled which are not always on the menu. The steaks are good and the fact the chefs will accomodate your dietry requirements where they can is appreciated, and the after hours pizza's and chicken ceasar salad are brilliant. The Vibe rooms are good and well appointed, they like all hotels have the bigger and more expensive rooms and as a regular guest I also appreciate the upgrades and the fact that it's always provided when the occupancy is not 100%, great work and a privilege I appreciate as a regular, thanks for that. Its not 5 star resort, but the people in the Vibe are and they provide a 5 star service. Thanks guys for looking after myself and my company colleages.

Just over a kilometre over the harbour bridge if you wanted to walk into the city - actually took us about 15 minutes stroll! The Milsons Point railway station was directly across the road from the hotel, and so was the bus stop - excellent if you didn't want to walk! We decided to walk, even tho the weekend was a little drizzly - it was great for a change - and besides, the railway station was closed due to maintenance on the line! The room was adequate, though a little on the small side, and for a double room, I thought 3 pillows was rather a strange amount for 2 of us... easily solved, I rang housekeeping and 3 more were brought promptly up! We ordered room service mid afternoon, only because there was no-one on duty in the downstairs bar, but the menu was the same price and items for room service, and we decided it was worth paying the $4 service charge to get the food in our room so that we could drink our own beverages that we'd brought with us rather than paying hotel prices - this probably more than saved our $4 service charge! We ordered a chicken satay pizza and some shoestring fries with garlic mayo and I have to admit, it was absolutely delicious, and a perfect amount for the 2 of us (we only needed a snack as were out for dinner early the same evening) We had a lovely comfortable sleep, and enjoyed the view from our window when we woke up in the morning and had our coffee. Our breakfast was very nice too. There was a good choice of fruit, breads, cereals etc, and the hot breakfast was a buffet type, and also very tasty by the way (except for the really strange bhaji/hash browns - they had vegetables in them, and the scrambled eggs were a little on the runny side, but at least they tasted like egg, unlike another hotel brand I stayed at) All the staff were very friendly and extremely courteous. We'd only booked a standard room, and asked for an upgrade to a room with a view as we were worried that due to the distance from the hotel next door, we could end up looking out of our window onto a wall. This was no problem at all for the staff, and for an extra $20 it was well worth it - ok, we didn't have a full view of the harbour bridge, but we were right above it, and could see all the traffic which I personally sort of liked anyway! We also could \"just\" see the opera house if you tried hard enough, but we had the most wonderful view of north sydney and the harbour. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone wanting to be right on the doorstep of the centre of the city, but not wanting to pay the price of a city hotel. This cost us $249 for 2 of us including the room service ($29), breakfast (included in our rate), the upgrade ($20) and the secure car parking for the night under the hotel ($22), the hotel was clean, and like I said it had a perfect location!", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NSW Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location good facilities\u201d", "Author": "FamilyHay", "ReviewID": "UR100224885", "Content": "Stayed at the Vibe for two nights on business.

The room was divided into living and sleeping areas, and there was a kettle, microwave and plates etc in the living area. Very handy for a simple breakfast. My biggest bugbear however was the staff, who could not answer my question about calling a toll free number from the room. In most hotels, a toll free number should not attract charges, but after going through several staff members (who seemed not to understand what I was talking about) they told me that it would be charged at local call rates. Seeing as I wanted to participate in a 1 hour teleconference, that would have cost me AUD 48!!! If this is really true, this is 100% profit for them, so be warned.

The hotel itself is nothing special, not sure where the vibe comes in, but the rooms were very good average hotel rooms that you get anywhere. I was staying in the executive suites and they were large, roomy, comfortable but I wouldn't call them funky, the vibe is business. Couple of comments, staff aren't fully briefed by management as to the hotel status, it was 35 degrees when I was there so I went down to reception in my swimmers holding my beach goggles to get something from reception on my way to the pool. I forgot what level the pool was on so asked at reception, then headed up (its second floor by the way) only to find out it is shut and looks like it has been for quite some time. I wasn't happy as it was pretty obvious why i wanted to know where the pool was (I was evening holding swimming goggles), so went back downstairs in a bit of a mood to tell the guy exactly what I thought about his hotel knowledge. Not my proudest moment, but at least I didn't carry on like an idiot. In any case the manageress heard and apologized. Also, bear in mind when you check in to ask for an internet cable as they aren't in the room, and they won't send someone up with a cable, I had to come back down to reception to pick one up, which again is kinda annoying....Overall though very good business hotel and I will most likely stay there next time I'm in Sydney.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location, very poor service.\u201d", "Author": "Jammdee", "ReviewID": "UR92817407", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights in Jan 11 in a guest room.

The hotel has an interesting location which might work for your travel plans. It is located across the street from the train station, and a five minute walk from the ferry. Its proximity to public transportation makes it convenient to get around. It would be a hotel to consider if you want to stay outside the CBD, yet be close to either the CBD or North Sydney. (I believe they even offer a shuttle service to North Sydney.) If you are a tourist with only a few days to see Sydney, then this probably isn't the hotel for you. It is also located close to shops and restaurants. It is also reasonably quiet. The rooms at the Vibe are adequate - maybe 3.5 star rather than 4. The finishings are not fancy or flashy, but are comfortable enough. The least comfortable feature of the room was the airconditioning. It was difficult to control the temperature setting - usually too hot or too cold. There was a mini fridge in the room, which was a nice convenience. The hotel was adequately clean, but certainly not spotless. The hotel does not have a fitness centre on site, but does give you a pass to a nearby gym if you ask for one. They have a pool. In addition, there is one complimentary washing machine and dryer, which is handy if doing a lot of travel. Internet access was pricey. There were two computer stations in the lobby, offering extremely slow internet connections for too high a price.

Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 7) stayed for four days during September 09 and thought it was great value for money. Obviously not a 5 star hotel, as my 10yo pointed out, but it is certainly 4 star. My husband and I had stayed there a long time ago and remembered it favourably. It is in an excellent location, opposite Milsons Point Railway station (2 stops from Central Quay) and a 5 minute walk from Milsons Point ferry. The Kirribilli shops and cafes are a 2 minute stroll on the other side of the station and we ate there most mornings and evenings and I recommend a stroll around this charming area, checking out the PM's and GG's houses. There is a great park 100m down the road that my children insisted on visiting every day. We booked a senior suite - 2 large rooms, flat screen lcd tv, desk, sofa/bed, king bed and lots of big windows with a water view (could even see the Opera House off to the right) Only criticism of the room would be the tiny bathroom, although given it included a bath, it was more than adequate. Hotel pool was ordinary, but they offer free passes to North Sydney Olympic Pool and Gym which is 5 minutes down the road and the kids spent an afternoon there enjoying the excellent facilities. It was fantastic being so close to the city, one morning we all walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge (which you could almost touch from the hotel), another morning caught the 2 storey train (a novelty for the kids), but mostly travelled everywhere by ferry. We would absolutely recommend this hotel as good value for money and out of the touristy hustle and bustle of the cbd - book on the hotel's website or direct for a great price. If you can afford it - the senior suite is a pretty good size for a Sydney hotel and don't forget to explore nearby Kirribilli.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery funky!\u201d", "Author": "cityriver", "ReviewID": "UR38317198", "Content": "Loved this hotel!

Overall thou, an average to disappointing stay, firstly the hotel is getting a little worn, the rooms are average at best and could do with some modernising, if your looking for LCD tv's, nice beds and furniture or a modern bathroom then this is not the place, none of these are unusual in other so called 4 star hotels, dont get me wrong there was nothing bad about the room, it was clean and tidy and a place to sleep but 4 star is a bit of a stretch. Apart from the room, the pool area is also a bit average a bit of an afterthought tucked out the back of the building, and pretty small - perhaps 10m long maybe shorter and 3m wide. It also get direct sunlight in the afternoon with no real seating area or cover and as such the water is a sort of weird luke warm temperature. Not warm, not cold, not enjoyable. Noone seemed to last more than a couple of mins before leaving . The location itself is not bad, it is close to Luna Park and the train station is across the road which is handy. But it is the northshore so on foot there is nothing apart from Luna Park nearby and you find yourself traveling into the city often which makes you wonder why you didn't stay in there. The biggest complaint is the parking, I had confirmed and included on my booking I required a carpark which I was told I would pay for but would be no problem . Until I got there, yes they have parking - about 10 parks for the entire building of 100-200 rooms - so there was none, the entire time we were there. First in first served it appears even thou it was booked and noted on my confirmation. This wouldnt be the end of the world if ALL the surrounding streets were not pay parking - up to $3 AUD per 1/2 hour and you cant put more than 1 hour in and this runs until 12am every night - so effectively there is no parking - in the end we had to walk a good kilometer and find street parking which again was only good after 8pm without a permit . Average at best. Staff had a pretty much a tell someone who cares attitude and despite living and working there could not even explain what the parking signs on the road mean. So overall , average at best , its a room in a hotel nothing more.. its not particularly cheap so unless being very close to the also very average Luna Park is important would be worth considering other options, If your a tourist, pay a little more and stay in the CBD its worth it .", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "perth Australia", "Title": "\u201cTotally 'Vibeless'!!! very ordinary for a four star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Elliotthoney", "ReviewID": "UR29805996", "Content": "This hotel was a big disappointment!! i'd research quite throughly before booking hotel as my husband & I were attending a friends wedding in Sydney and wanted to make the most of our time away.

I found someone else's hair lodged in my mango which was very off-putting, then just a few minutes later, my dad who had joined me for breakfast found a different hair baked into his bread!

There was a microwave and coffee making facilities. The room had a great view of the Harbour and Harbour Bridge. The location of the hotel is very good, a 1 minute walk to the Railway Station or a 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7 minute walk to the pier to catch the ferry to Circular Quay.

Some reviewers have had problems with musty rooms but our was OK, also the furniture was not scratched or knocked about as some have reported. It is probably worth upgrading to the water view rooms as they seem better maintained. The aircon was efficient and very quiet (although it will not work until a room key is inserted into a slot - get two keys at check-in so you can leave one in the slot while you are out).The bathroom is small but nicely tiled. A potential problem for those travelling by car is that the car park (extra cost) is small and you are not guaranteed a spot. If the car park is full you have to park down the street at another parking station about 6-7 minutes walk, and back up a hill. We got the best deal by calling the hotel directly (better than their own website). This hotel is definately not five star, but at the price we paid it was fair value.

After leaving our bags there and checking in (but not into the room) earlier in the day, we arrived later that night to be told we did not have a room and that there was nothing resembling our name in the system. This misunderstanding was overcome by the duty manager (but with some unnecessary rudeness thrown in we thought) but then we ended up being given a key to a room with someone else in it. Not a nice thing to walk in on someone while they are sleeping - and not nice for the sleeping person either I imagine!! After another trip downstairs to reception we got another room key to the real room but this did not work. It took even more trips up and down the lift for this to be sorted out and by this stage we were both getting very annoyed at both the service we had been given and the general rudeness and bad attitudes that we were encountering. We realise that we were not acting the angels by this stage either but the way we were treated was totally uncalled for. Eventually, we had to call the groom to come to the hotel from the other side of the city and sort it out for us as we had both become quite upset after all these hassles. Finally we got into our room and it turned out to be quite nice (it was a suite) with a view over the harbour but unfortnately we were in no mood to enjoy the night lights. We were on the verge of just checking out the next day and being done with the place rather than staying the next 2 nights we had booked, however, the new duty manager the next morning was the ultimate professional and apologised for what had happened, asked us for our side of the story and treated us with the respect that had been missing from the night before. He compensated us for our inconvenience and made general amends for our bad experience. The rest of the stay was largely uneventful although the toilet was always running (which is annoying when trying to sleep) and the room was starting to show some signs of wear and tear.

Vibe's marketing material highlights a crisp and clean upmarket hotel. The upgrade is great but it shows a little wear and tear already. I was surprised that management did not notice this when they check rooms. It wasn't as fresh, new and sparkly as I had hoped for compared with the promtional material on the web and brochures. It's amazing what a professional photographer can do. Overall, after staying 2 nights in a Aqua View room I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs an excellent location and it is pretty good value.

It is a short drive to the city or you can catch the train across from the hotel and be in the city in a few minutes, and the trains seem quite good in Sydney.
