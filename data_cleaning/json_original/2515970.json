I have stayed at some amazing hotels and in beautiful suites but I have never experienced customer service like at the Omni. They really have their stuff together. Upon arrival at mid-day on Friday (in the crazy streets of the Financial District), there was plenty of space in front to park while transferring our car to the Valet. We were greeted warmly by a charming and friendly doorman who gave us quick instructions on how to check in and where to go. The helpful desk staff had us checked in within minutes, during which time we were offered an upgraded room, a mini fridge to hold any needs for our baby, a backpack full of treats and activities for the little one, a short menu to order complimentary breakfast beverages each day of our stay, waived fees for Wi-Fi in our room, a crib for the baby, maps of the city, and any additional needs such as extra pillows, towels, and blankets. Also, we were checking in three hours before 'check-in' time and it was not an issue! (I believe you have to sign up [free] as a member of their loyalty program for some of these benes) The room was amazingly clean with high ceilings that made the room feel even bigger than it is, and it was a good size. The bathroom was large and very clean. Marble floor and counter tops and luxury soaps and other amenities. There was also a hand written note from the housekeeping staff welcoming us to the hotel. After spending just a few minutes there, we left for a few hours to explore the city. Upon our return, the beds had been turned down and there was complimentary milk and cookies, two bottles of water, and another handwritten note from a staff member welcoming us to the hotel. Each time we stepped outside the front doors, we were greeted by a doorman who asked if we needed directions, a map, or suggestions on places to go. At one point, we were outside waiting for our car with at least 15 other people who were waiting for taxis, coming, going, or just standing around and we still received personalized friendly service. Those staff members must love their jobs because they are all so friendly (or they get paid very well)! it was a fantastic experience in customer service and I will definitely stay there again in the future. The room rate was incredibly reasonable at $215 per night which included valet for our car.

Free wifi and wired internet and 2 free pressed laundry per day if you become a Select Member, which are close to non-existent in most hotels of this class. Oh and they serve free Starbucks brewed coffee in the morning and warm apple cider in the afternoon of a rainy day. Comfortable rooms - While a bit lacking, the bed is super comfy. Bathroom is roomy and well maintained. Robes in the bathroom are simply heavenly. Baby Friendly - we have an infant with us. While Omni didn't give us cookies and milk (as if she can eat it any way), we were able to get a crib immediately upon checking in and even a baby tub, which was unexpected!

At the Wharf you can easily grab the F Line trolley and ride from the Wharf all the way to Castro area. The Ferry building is within a few blocks..very easy walk from the Omni. Two block walk drops you in the thick of Chinatown. Highly recommend!!

This was my second stay at the hotel and I am pleased to say that I found it as excellent as my first visit. Firstly, I have to thank Sarah Crown for her assistance in dealing with my room request prior to my stay. She gave first class customer service and it was an absolute pleasure to deal with her. Secondly I would like to comment on a couple of reviews below which I believe are unfair to the housekeeping staff. My experience at the Omni is that the same high standard of cleaning is carried out irrespective of whether a tip is left or not and housekeepers are certainly not noisy. I stayed for five nights on my first visit and seven nights this time. On each occasion I cannot fault anything about the way in which my room was maintained. As far as I am concerned the housekeepers are friendly, hard working and meticulous. I certainly did not hear any door slamming by them and I was in and out of my room at various times during the day. The only door slamming I heard was in the early hours of the morning by guests returning to their rooms. I very much doubt that the housekeepers are cleaning rooms at 02.47! As an aside, I fail to understand why some guests have no consideration for other people and seem incapable of shutting a door quietly rather than attempting to remove it from it\u2019s hinges. Perhaps they live in door less houses and have not fully grasped the concept of how a door should be closed! OK, having gotten that off my chest, I will get to the review. Although I have previously reviewed this hotel it is a real pleasure to spend time preparing another review as the standard of the hotel warrants it. The location is great. An easy transfer from SFO by BART and short (flat) walk up Montgomery. It is only a short distance to Union Sq and an equally short distance to North Beach and my favourite bars! An excellent welcome and speedy check in from staff who really seem to want to go that extra mile to be helpful. All the staff I encountered were, in fact, first class in all respects. Rooms are a good size and, as aforementioned, well maintained. Beds are comfortable and there is a good selection of pillows. The Wi Fi signal is strong and I suggest joining the (free) Select Guest programme to avoid a $9.95 daily charge. Other benefits of the programme include complimentary water, beverages and turn down service. It is well worth spending the short time it takes to join. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and also a mini bar. The large comfortable chair and footrest were particularly beneficial after a day negotiating the hills of San Francisco. I can\u2019t comment on the bar or Bob\u2019s Steak and Chop House as I haven\u2019t used either. To be quite honest there are so many great places to eat and drink in this wonderful city it seems a shame not to get out and enjoy them. I have seriously lost count of the number of hotels I have stayed in over the years both for business and leisure. I have a lot of experience of the good and the bad and, take it from me, I am not easily pleased especially as regards noise and cleanliness. The San Francisco Omni is, without any shadow of doubt, one of the best hotels I have stayed in and ticks all the boxes. My next stay is already booked for September and I fully intend to return in 2013. My advice is to give it a try.

My \u201cleft over\u201d hair (I have long hair) was left on the bathroom floor for the three days we had staid and so were the pillows we took of the beds the first night, and the Stair-stick I dropped on the carpet.

A few moments later, our bellman welcomed us to our room where there were cold milks and cookies already waiting for our kids (that was SUPER impressive given we were not in the check-in area very long and gave no warning of arrival prior to walking in the door). Our room was clean and the furniture and carpeting was in great shape. We found the beds to be very comfortable (although because we are four to a room, queen beds would be very nice to have instead of just doubles). The second day of our stay we made a big oops and left the privacy sign on the door as we went out to explore the City. When we returned around dinner time, our room hadn't been cleaned, but we had a message from housekeeping explaining why. We requested our room be \"freshened up\" while we went out to dinner if possible, and it was cleaned and ready to go when we returned about an hour and a half later. We have stayed in the City many times before, and we love to walk and use public transportation, so we don't mind that much of the Financial District is quiet and closed on the weekends, but if you want something very close by, you should be aware that it can be a challenge. We love to walk and take public transportation -- we find that both are very easy to do from this location, even with kids. Chinatown is literally three blocks away, and Union Square and the Embarcadero are also quite easy to walk to. The cable car picks up right out front the hotel, and the front desk often has muni tickets for sale, which is super nice!!! We really do love the Omni and will be back again!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cSolid\u201d", "Author": "skitowin", "ReviewID": "UR125908582", "Content": "I stayed here for a week with my wife.

While booking, there was an option to enroll in the hotel loyalty program, which I did because it was free. Laura, at the front desk checked us in and was wonderful. We anticipated not being able to check in because it was around noon, and leaving our luggage for a few hours. However, Laura explained to us that by joining the loyalty program we were awarded with early check-in, free in-room wi-fi, complementary pressing and shoe shine, and breakfast beverage service for each of us every morning of our stay. She tipped us off that if we order one coffee, there was enough in the pot for three cups, so it would be wise to order one coffee, and one juice to share. Made perfect sense to me and was probably not something I would think of myself, so that was nice of her (its the little things like that, that make me happy). We were given room #1108, which is a standard King. The hotel is in the financial district, so our room looked out immediately to other office buildings. Good location if you want a better chance of less night life street noise. I was a bit disappointed that the windows were not well sound-proofed, and what little street noise there was, we heard clearly. Unfortunately, the same could be said of the walls. For both nights of our stay we were sandwiched between guests with small children. We could tell exactly when the guests were in their rooms with the children playing, crying, whining, and the age-old argument between a wife complaining to her husband about not being able to shower because she had to watch the kids. The bed was very comfortable, even when we were shaken awake by the small earthquake that Monday morning :) The wi-fi was actually decent!!! Both my husband and I were able to go wi-fi only at the same time, a rarity it seems at hotels. Although I don't use it, I liked that the hotel provided spray starch for ironing. Good business hotel touch. The bathroom was spacious for a standard size room, the products were customized via Sysco but still nice, the shower pressure good, and well lit. I always appreciate it when hotels provide robes. The cons: Few. Aside from the \"thin\" walls and windows, if you stay on the weekend, all the really close-by breakfast food places are closed. I'm not a big breakfast eater, but I do like to be able to quickly run out, grab a pastry, and then come back to the hotel to get ready for the day. On weekdays this isn't a problem because there are many cafes that cater to the business crowd. La Boulange is right across the street and is probably the best option. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I would recommend the Omni easily for the business traveler. I was immediately impressed by the loyalty program providing exceptional perks on only the first stay. A free pot of coffee is definitely a cheap way for a hotel to make a good impression.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite SF hotel so far\u201d", "Author": "errant", "ReviewID": "UR125710982", "Content": "I've stayed in many hotels in San Francisco and so far I think this is my favourite.

Our room was large and the king size bed was very comfortable with great pilllows and sheets. Two robes were provided (hotels that only provide one drive me nuts). There is nothing trendy about the decor but it's inobtrusive and very comfortable. The bathroom was very large with a separate and spacious shower and nice amenities. Maid service was sympathetic and inobtrusive. The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful, with the exception of one person (who helped lose the fifth star in this review). All in a all, a great stay and I can easily recommend this hotel. Why did it lose a star? The gentleman who checked us in was okay at first but when he found out where we were from, not that pleasant. I guess he didn't like a city in our country. Wow. That was WEIRD, dude!

He has so enjoyed his time at the San Diego Omni, that we went here the following year. In my opinion, this place was even better. First, it has a grand and really impressive lobby that makes you think of the 1920s. The rooms were nice, and large by San Fran standards. Some of the decor was a little dated, but I felt this lent to its old world charm. The concierge was AMAZING! We talked to them several times for directions, food recommendations, and more! The other great thing is that this hotel offers free walking tours. We took a free walking tour of Chinatown that was one of the highlights of our trip. The location was...interesting. Close to Chinatown, with great shopping and food, it is far from Union Square and Fisherman's Warf. The Omni is in the financial district, and what is nice about that is that on the weekends its really quiet and empty. We walked to Fisherman's Warf and after 20 minutes, so we gave up and hailed a cab. Not a big deal, but be aware. I wouldn't necessarily want to stay by the Warf beacuse its loud and dirty. Staying by Union Square would have been nice, but for the price, the nice large rooms and GREAT service, I would choose the Omni.

That prompted me to book a night there for a quick trip my wife and I had planned. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by every single hotel staff person we encountered, with offers of help and welcome. This was not done in any overbearing way and felt quite genuine. Our room was on the 14th floor. The room was very nice, clean, and very quiet. We hadn't opted for a view and indeed were given the opportunity to look into office windows of the three buildings surrounding the alley courtyard behind our side of the hotel. The TransAmerica Building could be seen soaring high above one of them. It was sunny and well-lit, so we weren't disappointed by that. A little background: Our last hotel, two weeks earlier, had been in Beijing, China. The contrast couldn't have been greater. A 4-star hotel, it looked very fancy at first glance (and from 20 feet away). A closer inspection was almost horrifying. The place was absolutely filthy. In the 8 days we stayed there, our sheets were never changed, the bathroom always smelled like a sewer, and our clean fingernails at night were dirty upon getting up in the morning. The bed must have been made of concrete, and the lock on the entry door didn't work. So by contrast, the Omni was absolutely a wonderful place. Mind you, this comparison is quite unfair, in that the Omni should not be described with any association with the other hotel. The Omni stands in its own right as a fine hotel, a world-class hotel, with a staff that went out of its way at every opportunity to serve us with a smile and no hesitation. Location-wise, it is terrific. Sited at the intersection of Montgomery and California, it is about 6-blocks from the Ferry Building, next door to China Town, the California Cable Car runs by the front door, and Nob Hill is just to the west, up the street. All the major cultural and performance centers are within easy walking access and restaurants are all over the place. We slept soundly, enjoyed the lovely clean, nicely scented bathroom, and comfortable clean (did I say clean?) bed.

And now this is where I'll be staying when I come in the future. As other reviewers mention, the staff is not just friendly and helpful but competent. When checking in, I asked about where the local markets were. The front desk person proceeded to show me in great detail on the map exactly where each of them were - Safeway, Trader Joes, Whole foods. Wow! When I needed to mail something out after checking out, the front desk person got me the forms and hunted around for a suitable sized box that I could use. There was no subtle sense that I was \"imposing\" on them which I have experienced at other hotels. On to the rooms: they were super clean and shiny and the lighting was really nice. Nothing in the room seemed worn out or run down. The bathroom amenities were products that I would actually use outside of the hotel. They have turndown service with great chocolates. I was able to use the refrigerator to store some leftovers and food items without any hassle (there's no sensor-type system which automatically charges you) so I didn't have to order a refrigerator. When I needed a cab, the door man efficiently called one right away. All these small details really add up to a pleasant stay. The staff is attentive and the accomodations are elegant, but there's never a sense of it being over-the-top or ostentatious. The place has just the right combination of refinement and humility. The one thing that wasn't quite up to the high standard was the fitness center. The cardio machines were good and the room had windows, so that's a plus. But only one of the TVs worked and the sound system on the machines didn't work well at all. The treadmills had individual screens but I could not for the life of me find a headphone jack.

It is a gorgeous King suite attached to a fun room with bunkbeds, bean bag chairs, toys and books. I need to start by saying that we really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again. However there is a little room for improvement. When we made the reservation we asked if we could get an early check-in at noon. The reservations assistant said they would put in the request. We got there later than expected at 2pm, and the room wasn't ready and that was kind of a bummer. They said they would put a rush on it, but I wish they had done this earlier. When we got into the rooms we were very impressed. My kids loved that the room was catered to them. Now here come my small complaints. The movies were like $11 to rent, the video games were $6.95/hour, and they had a little fridge and basket in the room with outrageously priced snacks. Snacks that were VERY tempting to my kids. Bags of skittles, cookies, M&M's, etc. In the fridge they had yogurts, drinks, etc. Actually, some of the snacks weren't exorbitant, but I still didn't want my kids drooling over them. The snacks in our room (the King bed side) had insane prices. A candy bar was $5. A large bottle of water was $7. Needless to say we didn't partake in any of these foods. More than the foods though, the kids were really bummed they couldn't play the video games. It seemed like such a tease to have a game controller there that they had to pay to play. So my biggest suggestion would be to include the use of the video games (and if possible some kid movies too) in the cost of the $350/night room. Also, maybe bring the prices down a bit on the snacks. I thought we were going to receive a newspaper and juice/coffee in the morning as being Select Members, but they did not come. Maybe we were supposed to request them? Now back to the good. The rooms were really quiet, clean, tastefully decorated, and spacious. The bed was soooo comfortable. All the staff was exceptionally nice and attentive. They did give the kids little backpacks upon arrival with a few coloring items and small toys. They did also bring them cookies and milk in the evening which was really sweet. Overall I thought this was a quality hotel in a great location. We easily walked to China Town and jumped on the cable car line for lots of other destinations. We will go back to The Omni, maybe without kids next time for a romantic getaway.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull place!\u201d", "Author": "fionita", "ReviewID": "UR120869593", "Content": "I like very much this hotel, is a wonderfull place to stay in SF!

Or take the cable car up the hill where you can swift to either o fine Powell street cars to head to the wharf or downtown.

The first was a business trip that was picked up through our company. I was placed at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental a few blocks up California street from the Omni. What a boring hotel. Seemed everyone there was very snobby and that if you didn't conform to a certain dress code you were frowned upon. So, imagine my surprise when I came back to San Francisco on a pleasure trip and stayed at the Omni. What a totally different animal this place is compared to the \"stiffs\" at Mark Hopkins. I have always loved the Omni brand. I stay at their hotels across the country often during business conventions. Every single Omni hotel I have stayed at has been a class-act from the staff, to the rooms and the food. Coming to San Francisco was reward travel for being a member of their loyalty program. When I built up enough credits for 2 free nights, I decided to come out to my favorite city in the United States. From the moment I arrived, I felt like family. The rental company upgraded me to a huge Lincoln Town Car. So, when I arrive in front of the hotel, the valet ignored me thinking I was car service dropping off passengers. It took a while, but the doorman recognized that I was just sitting there waiting and he came over and made certain I was taken care of. I don't know who the portly doorman was, but he as incredibly charming and funny. You could not have been wanted to be met by anyone more personable than this guy and I wish I had the opportunity to have talked to him more. He was gone by the end of Friday afternoon,and I am guessing off for the weekend I was there. When I got inside I was also greeted very warmly by the gentleman at the front desk who asked me where I was from. When I told him I was from New Jersey, he told me a story of a sub shop he remembers from Princeton, a town not too far from where I lived. Just one of those really nice exchanges that makes you feel welcomed. And, even though the hotel was sold out the day before and rooms were scarce at the point of my early check-in, the clerk went out of his way to get me into a room. I had a room on the 8th floor, facing the middle of the hotel center. This means it didn't have a view of the street. That was fine. The room was actually very quiet. That evening, I got a knock on the door from room service and was handed a bottle of water and a bag of vegetarian granola (which was really good), as a loyalty program \"welcome back\" gift. In addition, as a loyalty member, I get free WiFi and my choice of free beverage delivered to my door every morning. And you know what? All it takes to become a loyalty member is to sign up on the Omni website prior to your stay. I think Omni has the best loyalty benefits of any hotel I have stayed with. Free Internet and beverages? How can you not be happy staying at the Omni. And, for the two days I spent at the hotel, you couldn't walk inside without a staff member smiling at you with a \"hello\" or \"welcome back.\" Step in the lobby and there is this faint perfume smell that really warmes the senses. ....and, while valet parking is about expensive as any other hotel in the city (at least $50 per night), there is a substantial discount on Friday and Saturday nights. Valet Parking only cost me $30 each night which I thought was great. By the way, the valets did a superb job in getting me my vehicle in a short timeframe. I don't think I have anything negative to say about this hotel. I don't think I'll ever stay at another hotel when travling to San Francisco. The people here seem much happier than they do at the Mark Hopkins. Much more smiling and the sounds of \"hello\" in the elevator. Clean, comfortable, inviting.

It was a great trip. I explored the city (tourist and neighborhoods) with great shopping and meals in a long weekend. I'd go again without hesitation. The Omni was a nice hotel and in retrospect, I was glad it was away from the crowded touristy attractions (think lots of people and a push to get into the hotel lobby-ugh). The hotel is located in the financial district and is 4 blocks from the metro. I took it at 7pm in the evening and had no problems. Only do this if you're traveling light- there are stairs going up at your arrival location. Rooms are styled in typical Omni style (think conservative colonial) but are well appointed with luxury details. Service is outstanding- the front desk is to be commended for true 5 star service. You can trust the staff for excellent food recommendations. Front of the building has better 'views' (street scene). For me, it was quiet but a very light sleeper might be bothered by the street car that runs in front of the hotel. Join the loyalty program before you go and you will receive free wifi. The lobby bar is a good (but expensive) hangout if you're coming in from a redeye flight. You are around the corner from Chinatown (good eats), 2 blocks from the Pier/Waterfront. I felt safe walking during the day and early evening. It is not a neighborhood hopping with nightlife- you'll have to taxi out but it is very nice to return and recharge from the crowds. In this location, you can explore a street fair, take a short zip line (over the open area in front of the pier- it looked fun), walk along the Pier and browse a smaller open air stalls (think upscale gift shops) in the pier building a few blocks from the hotel. Although the street car runs in front of the hotel, it is not your best option. It is expensive, ($8.00) and there is no on and off. Each time you come on, you pay. One on and off stop could cost a family of four enough for dinner. No wonder they only had a few unsuspecting tourists during my stay. With that said, San Francisco is not a walkable city. One look at the steep streets will quickly force you to go to plan B. As I did not want the bother of renting a car, my plan B was to purchase a 2 day pass ($50- all access) on one of the sightseeing buses that run on loop in the various SF neighborhoods (Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, Haight-Ashbury, Chinatown). Depending upon your package, you have the opportunity to go to other destinations outside of the city. I used this package to tour the bridge, shop the neighborhoods throughout the day and tour a small waterfront town just outside of the city throughout the weekend. No charge for getting on and off. I took one loop to get a feel for the city and spent the rest of the time getting on and off to explore and shop in the different neighborhoods. Haight-Ashbury was a blast (think retro 60's) with nice shopping and cheap eat restaurants for lunch. Union Square was shopping and Fisherman's Wharf was tons of crowds but a great area for young children (small parks to run around, stroller friendly streets, people watching bars for the parents to chill out at). Other things to do... take a ferry to Saucilito, a small waterfront town to browse the art galleries. Rent a bike and take a guided tour across the Bridge (bike over, ferry back). Take a Segway tour of the neighborhoods. Best shopping (think funky shops, not national malls) is in Haight-Ashbury neighborhoods. There is a nice Macy's and Bloomingdales in Union Square for the mall deprived. The hotel front staff is excellent and extremely well versed about the city, but if you're looking for neighborhood nightlife, (jazz, clubs, brunch), I'd use your 'free' wifi to browse Yelp and find recommendations to plan your non-touristy excursions. This worked well for me and allowed me to find an amazing small, neighborhood jazz brunch for Sunday morning and fun evening out. As an experienced (and hopefully smart) traveler, I used the internet for choices and then vetted transportation/neighborhoods/reputation with the front desk after to make sure I was informed with the best choice as a solo traveler. In summary: Upscale luxury hotel, excellent staff and service. Good location- away from the crowds but close enough to Chinatown to explore. Be sure to use your AAA card (best rate) and sign up for the loyalty program (free wifi) for the best experience. The TripAdvisor community has been great.

The only cons i founded in this hotel is the restaurant,the food is very good but ultra expensive, no worthy to throw the money that way in only breakfast, there are many places around that are cheaper, but yet,not that cheap, its always San Francisco,an expensive city. anyway, we loved it and it's really close to the Ferry building and tourist attractions, also to chinatown and its colorful life and good restaurants. I recommend it to families because its totally suitalbe for childrens, not easy to find in the city!!!

There was no time to plan for anything, other than a rental car and a hotel for the first couple of nights. Randomly chose the Omni after reading some reviews and what a great choice. Yes, this is more of a business hotel because of the location, but honestly, staying down by the piers would just be too touristy for us. The hotel has a very helpful and knowledgeable concierge, but honestly, every staff member knows their \"stuff\" and is more than willing to spend time informing you. The doorman would ask \"where are you headed? Do you need directions? Ideas?\" etc. Perfect for us Floridians who had no idea other than the Frommers book I read on the plane there. The hotel is spotless, the rooms are very nice, the decorations (fresh flowers huge bouquets, chandelier, etc.) are wonderful. Took the train from the airport, and with their help via phone, walked the two blocks at nine p.m. and found the hotel. Called before hand asking for a roll away bed for my daughter and they had the bed all set up and room waiting for us. Starving, the front desk recommended Tadich Grill which is a half block to your left out the front door. Wonderful historical restaurant with great seafood. You are very close to China Town here, but better than that, get up at 7 a.m. Saturday morning and head left out the door to the Farmers Market before the crowds show up. Best market I've been to in a long time, and bring your camera! Fresh flowers, produce, types of tomatoes I've never heard of, seafood, organic poultry, crafts, muscisians, breakfast and all right on the water. On the way, past hundreds of women in pink for a breast cancer walk along with a bike cop assisting the walk. He wore his cop uniform with a pink tutu and pink rabbit ears! Only in San Francisco. It was great. The cable car runs right outside the hotel and there is a public parking garage for the church on the corner to park at that is much cheaper than the hotel parking. Great start for a wonderful last minute vacation before we sent our daughter off to college!

Focused on providing responsive customer service, the Omni staff is friendly and pro-active in addressing the needs of guests. You will find the rooms are sufficiently large and the beds are of high quality - with thick, soft comforters. The bathrooms are more than adequate in size and quality. From a location perspective, the Omni is well situated in the heart of downtown and within easy walking distance to Chinatown, the Bay, and Pac Bell Park (the San Francisco Giants stadium). One recommendation for those wanting to save a few $. The subway (BART) runs from the airport to Montgomery station for $8, which is only about 5 blocks from the hotel (a comfortable walk). This is much cheaper than the $40 you will pay for a cab, for those who cannot expense their travel. While I can offer no drawbacks to the rooms or staff, there is some street noise that filters into the rooms, esp when sirens go off or horns are used. This is not unique to the Omni, but since it is situated on a busy corner of downtown, you get a lot of traffic - even in the evening. I will also point out that the rooms do not have particularly nice views. You can see other tall buildings and the streets of the city, but not the Bay nor the broader skyline. Not a big deal, but definitely not a romantic setting. Speaking of romance, this is not the hotel to bring your spouse for that special occassion. While a perfect stay, in many ways, for the business traveler, there is nothing about this hotel that lends itself to romance or having a memorable experience with your true-love. A steak restaurant is housed on the main floor of the hotel, and provides a solid, though not spectacular, dining option for those who arrive late and do not want to go out for dinner. The steaks come with side dishes (do not need to purchase ala carte), and are offered at a reasonable price. Other dining options include several high quality and authentic Asian restaurants in nearby Chinatown.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for a city visit\u201d", "Author": "LesleyLu", "ReviewID": "UR118083194", "Content": "Friendly staff greeted us and the hotel is very impressive when you arrive.

The Omni was easily the favorite of our five hotel, 12 night trip. The customer service at The Omni was unparalleled and sets it apart from other hotels, both on this trip and in my overall travel. It was nice to show my son what world class hotel service looks like. Reservations staff, front desk personnel, the bell staff and most prominently the concierges were all great to work with. The excellent customer service started even before we checked in. I had been checking various websites for several months before we left on our trip, looking for bargains and good deals. When I saw a reference to a $199 per night rate for The Omni, with full cancellation rights up until the day before check-in, I immediately made the reservation, recognizing this was a great price for a highly rated hotel in San Francisco. I was quite surprised when my credit card bill arrived about 7 weeks later with a charge for the full four night cost of my reservation. I made a call to the hotel and left a message with the reservations staff. Within an hour they had called back to tell me that the rate I had booked was a full prepayment rate with no cancellation rights. They immediately told me that I had apparently booked the first day the rate was on the website and that it originally had been erroneously set up without prepayment requirements. The offer was corrected the day after I made my reservation and an automated billing program searching for the package I bought without a charge, billed me for it. I was told that a full credit had already been issued to my account and the package name was changed to keep me from being charged again, but the price and all other components of my package would be honored. I had expected a fight, but The Omni clearly recognized my reservation did not state prepayment and they immediately admitted it. It was nice to not only receive information that my credit was issued, but to also be told how it happened and what was done to make sure it did not happen again - for me that is very important and is a sign of good policies. We flew in to SFO around Noon on a Saturday. We foolishly took BART from the airport in to The City. I say foolishly simply because we spent too much time getting to the BART station and then waiting for the train. We should have taken a cab. We lost an hour of sight-seeing opportunities. Having said that, the walk from the Montgomery Street BART/Muni station was easy, even with our 12 days of luggage. The walk was generally flat. The Omni sits at the base of the climb up California Street that eventually reaches Nob Hill. Our request was for a room on a high floor away from the elevator. Because we arrived prior to check-in time, not all rooms had been cleaned. We were offerered and took a room on the 9th floor, near the elevator. Our concerns about noise near the elevator were unfounded. The room was very quiet and we enjoyed the convenience of being close to the elevators. We joined the Select Guest program when I made the reservation. Members receive free wireless internet in the room as well as free morning beverages. We had orange juice delivered each morning \u2013 very nice to have. Cookies and milk were brought each evening \u2013 a nice touch although we were rarely in the room when they were delivered. Maintaining a comfortable temperature in the room was easy, the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was appropriately sized, towels were plush, toiletries were very nice. The in room safe was large enough for my netbook and my son\u2019s Mac. As I noted above the concierges were incredible to work with. All of the concierges were very helpful with directions (to the Golden Gate Bridge, AT&T Park, Alcatraz Cruise, etc) and dining recommendations. We want to single out Juan in particular for his assistance and interest in what we were doing. Juan even recognized us on the street and called to us by name as we were returning to the hotel and he was heading home for the night. After a poor experience with a concierge in San Diego, it was nice to deal with competent, engaging staff at The Omni. We enjoyed the location of The Omni \u2013 an easy walk from BART/Muni, right on the California line cable car and within a few blocks of many bus routes. You can buy a Muni pass in the baggage claim areas at SFO - we used the passes often. We walked to Union Square as well as to the Ferry Building. The primary purpose of our trip was baseball \u2013 we saw three Giants games. AT&T Park was about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. We took the Muni to the games, walked back. The area around the hotel was not busy late night after the games. We did not feel threatened at all, but we did have our wits about us \u2013 paying attention to where we were going, watching who else was out and on at least one occasion crossing the street to the other side just to be safe. There are not many restaurants near the hotel \u2013 ask for recommendations from the concierge staff. We did not do this the first few nights we were there, we wish we did. Consider the Royal Exchange, a few blocks away. We had an excellent early dinner before a Giants game there. We rented a car at the Budget counter in the Hyatt Embarcadero after checking out of the hotel. The bell staff held our bags until we could get back with the car \u2013 we loaded up in front of the hotel and set off for Santa Cruz. I really do not have anything negative to say about our stay. I have stayed in more luxurious hotels and in larger rooms and suites \u2013 some may stay the physical plant of The Omni is not a five star hotel and I don\u2019t think I could argue the point. But the service is most assuredly five star quality. I would absolutely try to stay at The Omni if I returned to San Francisco \u2013 but price would be a consideration. I am not sure how much I would pay to stay here \u2013 I would pay more to stay here \u2013 but I can\u2019t say for sure how much more.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Tx", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "TxTxAustin", "ReviewID": "UR118029083", "Content": "This is an absolutely fabulous location in the city.

We were traveling with young children, and had requested a connecting room. As always, we would not have booked there if this wasn't a possibility. During our first leg of the journey, there was no problem. We had two lovely, connecting rooms, and the service was genial. We were struck by how expensive the restaurant was; we decided right away not to eat there if we could avoid it (and with the culinary delights of San Fran beckoning, didn't mind that too much). However, the one breakfast we did eat there was no fun. It took a while just to get water, and even longer to place our order (and even longer to get the food!). Our sweet waitress apologized profusely, and even management admitted to being very busy. (Please remember this was the week Hurricane Irene was traveling up the E. Coast, and many people were stranded.) When the food did arrive, it was wrong--my daughter's order was completely different, and mine was not what I'd been told it would be, even after very specific questioning. We also had a dinner there after being delayed one night, and it was okay. If you DO go to the restaurant (and you probably shouldn't), stick with the steaks, which are very good. Anyway, we had plans to check back in to the Omni on our return leg--like our initial reservations, these had been made two months in advance. Because of the hurricane (we live in NJ), we had to add another night to our reservation. That was all done with no problem. But when we checked back in, we were informed (after a lot of hemming and hawing) that we did not have connecting rooms. I asked why, and was told that it was OUR fault, that when we'd extended our stay, we'd forfeited our rooms--though no one told us this upfront, and it seemed really weird, like we were somehow being penalized for booking an extra night!!! At any rate, they offered to pay for one of the room, and told us we'd be moved to connecting rooms the next day (after having to pack and repack for our trip so often, by then, I could barely imagine doing it again). So, while i was far from happy, I took that as a gesture of good will... Then we got into our non-connecting rooms (meaning one adult would, of course, have to stay with one child). And guess what? One of those rooms had only a King bed--meaning an adult would have to sleep with one of the kids. Not only that, but the room we were given was pretty bad--right above the street, right above the entrance to the restaurant, dirty carpeting, cramped, etc. (NOTE: If you stay here, request high floors. Though the financial district is pretty dead at night and on weekends, it sits at the intersection of two very busy streets.) Again, after the manager did initially blame us for the problem, the hotel in general did try to make it up to us. They even paid for that regrettable breakfast mentioned above. But it felt pretty bad to be spending so much money there, to have done all OUR homework, and to be treated so badly. Furthermore, there wasn't a lot of value-added to this hotel. It would have been nice to have, for instance, an alternative, more casual, LESS expensive dining alternative (and forget about room service--it was absurd). I see they are trying to lure more families with the cookies and milk at night and the little backpacks (which, frankly, were kind of babyish for my 7 and 10 year old).", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat start to our trip\u201d", "Author": "Jeni49", "ReviewID": "UR117622806", "Content": "We spent three nights here at the start of a recent trip down the coast.

We have been to the city a few times and have stayed in Union Square but we loved the Omni. What stood out the most was the amazing service. They were so friendly and welcomed us with open arms from the moment we pulled up in the car. We had a really nice king suite which gave us more room than we needed but it was nice. Though we did hear some street traffic during rush hour. We could have probably got a better deal if we had chosen a smaller room or had a different week (for some reason our week was heavily booked). But I've seen great deals on priceline which would make this selection of hotels even better and would have given it 5 stars for value but instead gave it 4. Since we were celebrating our anniversary they gave us an amazing (best ever) plate of chocolate covered strawberries the first evening. Our turndown service had a rose on the bed with robes and houseslippers. There were always nectarines in the lobby to eat as well as tea. The gym was new and had plenty of machines/tv's. I think the concierge was by far the best as we had reservations at amazing restaurants with great seating. I highly recommend the Waterbar.. fresh seafood daily, great ambiance and a beautiful view of the bay and bay bridge ( the concierge will get you a seat by the window). They also recommended the show Billy Elliott at the Orpheum which was fantastic. You have to get a cab there.. I didn't miss not staying in Union Square.. I can shop at all those stores in a mall.

The hotel is an easy and flat five block walk up Montgomery St from the BART station. Check in was very smooth and I was quickly in my room. It was spotlessly clean with a welcome note and complimentary bottle of water as I joined the Select Guest programme. I suggest that anyone staying at an Omni joins this. Complimentary Wi Fi, newspapers and morning beverages are just some of the benefits. It costs nothing to join and is well worth it. I had emailed ahead to request a quiet room and was allocated one overlooking the courtyard without any traffic noise at all. Not a great view but who cares? A quiet nights sleep is more important to me. The room did, however, back onto the elevator shafts so I was woken early whilst they were being used more frequently. The noise was not, however, that loud and most people would have taken absolutely no notice at all but I am obsessive about noise and a difficult person to please. The term \u201cGrumpy Old Man\u201d fits me perfectly or so my wife says! I asked at reception if the elevator noise always started around 6.00 and without me even asking I was immediately offered another room. The second room again overlooked the back and was so unbelievably quiet that I slept like a log for the next four nights. Facilities in the room were excellent. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. A big armchair and footrest were welcome after a day of San Francisco hill climbing! Wi Fi was fast and easy to connect. I was quite impressed with the workstation which had plug sockets built into it. Little things please little minds! All too often in other hotels I have had to scrabble round the floor looking for them. One thing that really impressed me was that the maid left a handwritten note to thank me for the tip I left her. I think it was a really nice touch. I always tip maids and this is the first time I have been thanked for it. I very much appreciated it. The hotel is located in the financial district which was very quiet over the weekend. Just a short walk to North Beach, Market Street and Embarcadero. I didn\u2019t eat or drink in the hotel so can\u2019t comment on that side of things. There are plenty of great bars and restaurants nearby especially North Beach. Finally, I cannot complete the review without mentioning the standard of customer service again. This was exceptional in all respects. I have stayed in countless hotels over the years and the Omni is in a league of it\u2019s own. All the staff I encountered had a smile on their face and were amazingly polite. I never had to open the front entrance door or call for the elevator as one of the staff always rushed to do these. I originally planned to stay for ten nights but couldn\u2019t make the first five nights in view of illness in the family. It was such a delight to stay there that I really wish I could have made the full ten nights. Will I be back? Without any shadow of doubt. I am planning my next SF trip now. Would I recommend a friend? Certainly not. This place is way way too good for them!", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA, CA", "Title": "\u201cMakes you feel at home.\u201d", "Author": "3376", "ReviewID": "UR115143235", "Content": "We just came back from a family reunion in San Francisco.

Ferry building and Market Street is within walking distance in about 10 minutes, and Tenderloin area is in the other side of town where you prefer to stay away, so it is safe and convenience. Cable car\u2019s California line operates in front of the hotel; it was cool to see the cable car passing by while you run on a treadmill in the 3rd floor gym. We arrived at the hotel late, but valet-parking and check-in went smoothly; the young front desk lady is extremely helpful, she did the check-in process efficiently while answering questions from me and my wife continuously about where to go and eat in detail, even made a reservation for us like a concierge. The bell staffs are friendly and helpful, after a day outside it were them who made you feel welcomed. The thing that impressed me most is that they tried to remember your names instead of just saying sir or ma\u2019am.

A very warm welcome on arrival by the doormen and the reception staff also made you feel special by being very attentive without being over the top, we did get the immediate feeling that if there was anything you needed they would be more than glad to help. We had requested a quiet room with a view if available as this was a trip for our wedding anniversary and they certainly matched our request with a great room on the 17th floor. This is a city where a couple of the main features (as there are many parts to San Francisco) are a fantastic bay area & many steep slopes, but if you can cope with the slopes you get the payoff of great views. This is a great city, I love New York & I love Boston, but this is right up there and I'm still deciding if this has just gone to the top of the list. We stayed for 6 nights and in all honesty could have stayed more. If you are a tourist coming here you just have to do Alcatraz which we thought was brilliant, but be warned you need to book this before you get to the city as the trip is very busy and you cannot guarantee getting on a trip by just turning up on the day. We also did a Napa Valley tour (through Viator) which was also a great trip. The people in this city, and seemingley in California as a whole are warm, friendly and welcoming people who are glad to help and have a chat with you. The location of this hotel we felt was excellent. Nice area & turn left out of the main front door (not up the hill) and you are heading to the Ferry Building / Embarcadero & the many piers of the bay. Approx 10 minute flat stroll and you are at the Ferry Building & turn left when you get there and you are heading towards Pier 39 / Fishermans Wharf and the sea lions etc. This hotel is also only short walk to Union Square and the shops that are there. If you are up to it, biking over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is well worth the effort. My wife and I (45 & 50 years old) managed it and the it will be a memory that stays forever as to view this iconic structure from such a close up and personal viewpoint is just awesome. We stopped frequently to take hundreds of photos, had lunch in Sausalito and then caught the ferry back which is really easy, as through Blazing Saddles they give you a ferry ticket ready for use in the morning, which you can either use or not. You pay for the bikes at the end of the trip & hence if you don't come back on the ferry you don't get charged for the ticket so long as you return it in full.

The desk in the room had really handy outlets right on the front of the desk, no crawling aroung looking for an outlet! Bed was comfortable, but just two flimsy pillows on the bed just doesn't cut it. I like a bed with lots of comfy pillows great for propping up to watch TV. That's really the only thing here that was anything but superlative. Not a deal killer. Front desk staff were very pleasant and aimed to please.

I have to say that this hotel is the epitomy of professionalism. The door staff are polite and helpful, and the reception staff even more so. The room we had was probably the best we stayed in during our trip to Vegas and SF. It's got a very distinct touch of class about it (though not austentatious or showy like some hotels). The bed was large and comfortable, with a large flat screen TV and coffee machine (which didn't work properly). It had a nice big desk in the room as well as sofa chair and foot stool, and the bathroom was perfectly nice enough. We didn't see hide nor hair of the cleaners which was a complete contrast to the other hotel we stayed in where we were woken up early. It seemed as if they were invisible until the time when you left your room and came back and everything has been cleaned to perfection! The only slight annoyance (if you can call it that) was the turn down service, where they fold a corner of the bed and angle your pillows to face the window. Seemed a bit odd to me and rather pointless. If someone needs the corner of the bed to be folded down in order for them to get in, they probably need a psychiatric home and not a hotel! We got a really good deal through Expedia and paid less than \u00a3100 per night, which I thought was good value for the quality of the hotel. We didn't eat in the Steak House restaurant as it was a tad pricey, and also be aware that room service can be expensive as well. It's fine if you arrive late and need some food, but there are plenty of other places to eat and it is within 5 minutes of Chinatown. The hotel location was good but not excellent. It's near to Market Street, but is a good 10 minute walk to Union Square as it is located in the Financial District. This also means that there aren't a lot of eateries nearby or shops like Walgreen's if you need to dash out for something. You'd be surprised how early things shut in SF! Also worth noting, if you want to get on the internet (i.e. you don't have a laptop in your room) there are several computers in the lobby you can use but you have to pay $5.95 for 15 mins to use them via credit card, but they are perfectly secure and delete all your web history on exiting.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with great everything\u201d", "Author": "Thereza_B", "ReviewID": "UR107619657", "Content": "The hotel is a wonderful home away from home.

The rooms are nice, not massive but big enough for two people. The hotel has an old fashioned luxurious feeling to it, different to the usual chains we have stayed at. We were disappointed slightly that the cable car was not running on California Street right outside the hotel, closed for refurbishment of the line. We would have liked to seen them running instead of the roadworks, but this was not the hotels fault. I do think Thomas Cook could have let us know about this before booking though. It was only a small inconvenience to our stay with there being trams a short walk away or another cable car at the top of the steep hill. We went all over in San Francisco and bought a 3 day travel pass from reception. We also went to see a Giants game which was good fun, concierge were very helpful sorting out the tickets for us. The hotel is in a good location in the financial district and a short walk to Union Square and all the shops, although being in the financial district did mean a few coffee shops and restaurants were closed over the weekend. We ate nearby at restaurants recommended by concierge and also in the hotel for lunch and dinner. The onion rings in the hotel restaurant show as a starter ($12) and look amazing. Be warned, the portions are massive and we struggled to eat them all, along with steaks for main course. My only small complaint is that I struggled to get english tea. There is fruit and earl grey tea in the rooms and free coffee downstairs for guests in the morning. They did get me english tea in the morning when I asked but made a point of saying I should really be charged as only coffee is free. The maid did her best to get me english tea for the room but I ended up with more earl grey!

The wonderful woman who checked us in pretended that I was fine even though I'm sure she could see the pain etched across my face.

I found the general feel of the Omni very comforting - like they've been taking care of important people for years and I was in good hands. I might not be considered that important by many other people - but they appeared to find me so, and I enjoyed going along with it. A huge positive point for me was the fact that I slept like a baby. Like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room, in fact. This hotel is made out of good, solid materials, not the usual plasterboard and echo-ey corridors of an ant hotel. I wasn't once kept awake by frisky neighbours, or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms. Good sleep = good mood and good work. In comparison to other business district hotels I found it very reasonably priced. I loved the morning delivery of coffee and juice that was included as part of their rewards programme. Oh, how such small things make such a difference to the way you start your day. Other than that ... friendly, helpful staff and great location for the business district. Although it's a little way from the tourist hotspots, it's no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport ... or, (heaven forbid) use your legs! The one and only issue I stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant - so maybe it's not that fair to post here ... but since the restuarant is affiliated, and there's a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it, I will! The issue? The gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate, reclining in its self-satisfied way against my mightily over-priced and, presumably, very embarrassed steak. That long, lone carrot was, quite honestly, the most revolting vegetable I've ever eaten - and that includes the times I've accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery (food of the devil) in a salad. I can't believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere. If you're a beef aficionado - or even just someone who likes good food - just don't bother. Yes, the steak tasted good ... but not an eye-rolling, conversation-stopping, stress-sapping, umami-ridden explosion of great that I'd expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef.

This is a lovely hotel. As so many of the other reviewers have mentioned, all of the people who work at this hotel (from the doormen to the housekeepers to the front desk people) are as helpful and accommodating as can be. Even though this is a big hotel, it has a small, elegant hotel feeling about it. The rooms are very nice, impeccably clean, large (and we had a standard size room), and the showers are great. In the lobby on each day of our stay, there was delicious hot apple cider and yummy Christmas cookies. I agonized over the decision as to which area to stay in. A lot of the locals suggested that the hotels right around Union Square were better for a tourist. Well, I am so happy that I did not follow that advice. First of all, I didn\u2019t find Union Square to be all that exciting. Sure, there are a lot of dept. stores and bright lights, but I was not really interested in shopping opportunities. I found the location of the Omni to be great \u2013 2 blocks from Chinatown and close to the Ferry Building (with all sorts of great food gathering opportunities-Blue Bottle coffee and waffles, Frog Hollow pastries, Cowgirl Creamery\u2019s cheese, Acme bread) and the Embarcadero (which we enjoyed strolling along). Also, out of curiosity, I walked into some of the recommended hotels in Union Square and didn\u2019t find them nearly as inviting as the Omni. There are a number of restaurants close to the Omni, although we tended not to eat in the immediate area (and some of the breakfast/lunch places are closed on non-business days). Also, there are tons of other restaurants within easy walking/public transportation access. I have no doubt that we will be staying at the Omni for our next trip to San Francisco.

The first moment we walked into the hotel we knew that it would be special. The front desk staff were very courteous the concierge was extremely helpful in giving us directions to a restaurant we had a booking at and also giving us advice on good places to shop. The hotel room itself was clean and cosy, with the most comfortable, softest bed that I have ever slept on. Signing up to the hotel's Select Guest program we were provided with complimentary wifi in the room as well as 2 free bottles of water and 2 coffee/juice options each day. My husband and I found this wonderful, to wake up to find complimentary drinks at the door. What made this hotel more special was the fact that the housekeeping staff wrote a handwritten note to us on the first night wishing us a enjoyable stay. It's small touches like this that makes guests like us feel welcomed and at home. During our stay, the Omni Hotel had complimentary hot apple cider and Christmas cookies on offer near the lifts. The apple cider was simply delicious and Christmas cookies scrumptious. The hotel itself is about a 10 minute walk from the nearest underground metro station and a short stroll from Union Square. The hotel also offers walking tours around China Town which is a short stroll away. Overall, during our 5 week stay in the US (around various cities and hotels), my husband and I both agreed that the Omni Hotel in SF was the best and most memorable hotel that we stayed at.

The second is other than Chinatown, there aren't a lot of activities around the hotel because it's in the financial district, so if you want a decent meals (other than Chinatown and not the tourist traps or fast foods) you will need to get in a cab, which we didn't have trouble finding, even when it was raining.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest experience\u201d", "Author": "mtoon", "ReviewID": "UR91420967", "Content": "We\u2019ve travelled quite a bit but this has been the best hotel experience we have encountered.

We didn't use room service and never had to call housekeeping, so I can't review that. Robes were provided, and the tub is extra deep, which I loved after getting caught in a downpour down at Fisherman's Wharf. The bathroom is all marble, with Kohler fixtures, but watch those sink handles! They unscrew easily after being turned on and off, and will drop off onto the counter, or if you're unlucky, onto the glass soap dish or q-tip holder. The handles are heavy, and it's possible something could be broken. The two windows only open about six inches, for safety purposes. Street noise is minimal as long as the windows are kept closed. The heating unit in the room worked great and was not loud at all. We didn't try the A/C, of course. The king-sized bed was very comfortable, but firmer than we're used to. A good quality blow dryer in a drawstring bag hung in the bathroom, and an iron and board in the closet and a 32-inch flat screen tv for bedside viewing. A small coffeepot with quality coffee is provided. There is also a small portable fridge in the television armoir, to which you are given a key at check-in. You can use the fridge to store your own stuff if you want, but don't try to store too much. The fridge has a small amount of liquor, beer, wine, soda and sparkling water that the maid checks every day to see if you've used anything. If you don't want her digging through all your stuff to find their stuff, don't cram it full of your stuff. Unless you want to pay top dollar, don't drink the bottled water they leave out for you and don't eat any of their candy or drink anything from their fridge. Bring your own snacks and keep a six-pack of your favorite soda in the fridge. The restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steak and Chop House is a fine restaurant. A little pricey, but worth it. If you want breakfast, you must be there before 10 am. Not easy for late risers like us. But if you miss it, the Subway right across the street next to the Wells Fargo serves breakfast sandwiches and has fresh hot coffee. Also, I highly recommend the Wells Fargo History Museum, since it's right there. The very site of the very first Wells Fargo. The cable cars were not running on California Street. That's the main reason I chose a hotel on a cable car line, so we could step out the front door and catch one. I checked SFMTA's website, and it said that due to construction, the entire California line will be shut down from January 3rd, 2011 until June 2011, so it should have been running while we were there. The hotel staff did not know why it was not. The hotel is non-smoking, so you'll have to go outside the hotel to do that, if you smoke. The windows don't open far enough to be of any use, and although you can remove the plastic stops to open the window all the way, there is a very real chance you would fall if you leaned out even a little, so I do not recommend this to smoke, or for any other reason. No, we did not try this. Parking at the hotel is valet only, and costs $48 a day. Outrageous! Do yourself a favor and find another garage. There are a couple nearby on Kearney. You can find web coupons if you're really into saving extra money. Lastly, do yourself a favor and leave your car parked. Buy a 3 or 7-day muni pass at the hotel desk. It's good for all types of bus, cable car and trolley car transportation throughout the city. There's also a discount at the Ghirardeli square chocolate store and the SF Zoo if you show your muni pass.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "French_Australian", "ReviewID": "UR90956245", "Content": "We just checked-out from the hotel where we stayed 3 nights in San Francisco, the Omni.

The rooms themselves are the size of usual hotel rooms and are in B+ condition. The reason I checked out early and will not be staying at this Omni again is I did not get a good night's sleep because of the noise from the cars, buses, cable cars and sirens. I had a suite (which is just a very small sitting area connected to a standard-sized room). All of the suites have the same noise problem because all of them are on the corner of the hotel, overlooking the busy intersection. If you do not want a suite, the hotel (which footprint is shaped like the letter L), does have interior rooms that do not face either street. However, those rooms are small and have views of only the backs of neighboring buildings.

From the moment we arrived it felt right. The welcome from reception staff (particularly Jake) was wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. The doormen were always so polite and always smiling and unlike many places in San Francisco, I didn't feel they were only being nice just to get a tip out of you. We stayed here for 3 nights initially on floor 5 and had a great view of California Street and the cable cars. The cable cars never disturbed us at all as they stop at a reasonable hour in the evenings and pass by the hotel quickly. Our room was fantastic, large, clean and comfortable and the bathroom had that wow factor with lots of marble and complimentary toiletries & lots of fluffy towels. In the wardrobe (closet), there were luxurious bathrobes to use during your stay, an iron and ironing board (useful as the airport luggage handlers squash your cases so much your clothes have creases where you didn't think they could have creases), plus a safe to keep your valuables in. The beds were soooo comfortable I wanted to take one back home with me - clean crisp sheets, clean crisp duvets and covers and lots of comfy pillows. After spending a few days out of town travelling other states we returned to the same hotel for the last few nights of our stay in San Francisco. This time we were on the top floor (floor 17) where the room was exactly the same layout but being so high you only had little windows and this slightly lost the fun of being on California Street as we couldn't see the street - only the buildings opposite. Being in the financial district had its pros and cons. Cons being there weren't that many places to eat around the hotel however there is a lovely new Irish bar just opened on Sacramento Street (about 2 minutes walk away) plus another restaurant next to it (can't remember the name but recommended by hotel staff). Also, as someone else mentioned, I felt a little out of place in casual wear when most other people were in business suits but this was mostly apparant during the day rather than at night. The pros of this hotel's location is that it's only 3 short blocks from the Montgommery Street BART stop and took us only 10 minutes to walk from the BART to the hotel. Another good point about the hotel being in the financial district is that (unlike every other part we went to - particularly the tourist parts) you didn't get any 'down-and-outs' hassling you for money as the businesses and hotels in the area don't take kindly to the down-and-outs hassling their clients. It all felt very safe around the area. I don't know if it's a sign of the financial downturn at the moment, but be warned if you are out and about in general San Fran - there are a LOT of beggers / down-and-outs / homeless / drunks constantly trying to get money out of you and it gets a bit tiring after a while. If you are going to San Fran, stay here - it's fantastic.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colmar, France", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "roomservice99", "ReviewID": "UR79281295", "Content": "Our room was spacious, nicely furnished and very clean.

We took the Bart rail system from the airport which stops 3 blocks away and walked to the hotel with our cases which only took a few minutes. On arrival we were tired with the long journey and there was a hiccup with our room as we had booked our room through Hotels.com. I had booked a room with 2 double beds some months earlier . We were told straightaway on arrival at the hotel that when you make such a booking through the internet the spec.of the room cannot be guaranteed. We were shown to a room with just one king bed in and were told a fold away bed would have to be added for my son which we weren't happy about. This was going to be a 4 night stay. The desk manager quickly found a double bed room for us which needed cleaning and were given a complimentary drink in the bar while the room was being cleaned. I tipped the bell hop Marlin to take our bags to the room for us while we were having our drink but after 3 hrs the bags never arrived. I went back downstairs to find Marlin had gone home without delivering my bags and his relief had to deliver my bags without any further tip being given which I felt awkward about but I didn't see why I should have to tip again. After this our stay was problem free and we found this hotel was placed fantasticaly to tour the surrounding area. The trams on Knob Hill are just outside the hotel, Chinatown just a couple of streets away and the fishermans wharf areas are a nice 10 minute stroll away. The hotel itself tends to be occupied by well dressed business type people and at times I felt a bit out of place dressed in shorts/\"t\" shirt . This hotel is sitauted in the Banking district with very tall high rise office blocks nearby. Fresh fruit and a drinks urn containing water with lemons in were available every evening next to the lift. Free wi=fi is available in the reception area. The hotel is spotlessly clean and cannot be faulted. San Francisco was found to be cold most times with the cold Pacific breeze from the sea and we had to wear light fleeces most of the time which I didn't expect in August. We done the normal Alcatraz tour and city bus tour which is a must do. We walked all around the area and despite the high number of homeless tramps in the town we felt safe. Having said that a German female tourist celebrating her silver wedding was accidently shot dead a couple of blocks away as the result of being caught in crossfire from some youths who had fallen out at a nearby disco ! This made us cautious but appears to have been a one off incident. But after our 4 day stay we moved onto Las Vegas and then onto New York.

Marathon. We are both in our early 40's and are quite active and love to travel. We decided to try out a hotel that was within walking distance to the Ferry Building, which would help getting to the race and also provide lots of sightseeing options. The Omni was the perfect choice and had a great deal going for 2 weekend nights at around $150 a night (which we got from Expedia.) I later read on Omni's website that they will match and beat any published price as long as you first book your stay on their own website. That's pretty cool. Getting back to the important stuff...the hotel is beautiful. It's not huge compared to other high end places around Union Square or the Embarcadero area, but 'just right' in our book. The lobby, elevators and general interior is impeccably clean. The room we stayed in wasn't huge, but it worked just perfectly for the 2 of us. The bed was comfortable and pillows were ample and of the highest quality. Needless to say, we both got great nights sleep during our stay. Probably the most impressive aspect of the hotel is the staff. They are truly wonderful people, very friendly without being overbearing (I can't stand dealing with hotel staff that act snobbish and just go through the motions solely to get that tip). The staff at the Omni are genuinely friendly, and seem to relish in sharing any information they find on new and fun things to do in the city. It was almost as if we were around good friends than your typical hotel staff. Another important thing is to go on the Omni website and sign up for their free 'Select Guest' program, which will automatically allow you to customize your room preferences, free WiFi (great!), complimentary morning beverages (2 per person), complimentary pressing (2 items) and shoe shine, express check in/check out, and an evening turn-down service as well. All that for the grand total of $0.00. Don't forget to sign up! We did not use room service, nor did we eat at the Steak house that is inside the hotel. We were on a bit of a budget, so we chose not to splurge that way.

Not mentioned previously by TA members was the room service for breakfast. I had originally looked at the Bob's Steakhouse menu online and thought no way, too costly. There are less expensive alternatives through room service. Bagel and cream cheese was $5 and bacon, egg and cheese sandwich was $8. A few other things too. Obviously you could run out to get those for less but it was nice to have the breakfast delivered with the free beverages and just relax and eat in your pj's. Right on time at the time requested too! The gym was a good size also. Towels, water and earphones available. The lobby has a bowl of fresh fruit and citrus water out in the afternoons which was a nice pick me up after all of our sight seeing. Did a lot of walking! As previously mentioned in other reviews, hotel is in a good location if you are a fit walker. We went to Chinatown, North Beach, Ferry Building and even walked to and from Fisherman's Wharf at least one time each way. We booked their Linger Longer package which was great, pay for two nights get the third for free. I would say the only issue would be that I booked, and was going to pay with a debit card. When you do that, the hotel holds $200 on your account for incidentals and credits it back in a couple of days. That was never mentioned during the booking session.

The citrus water is a great touch after a long day. However we picked up the keys to our room on the 10th floor and was so disappointed. The room was small as I expected (no different from NYC), but what i wasn't prepared for was the NASTY carpet. This carpet was dirty outside the room in the hall and so nasty on the inside I would not have walked on it without my shoes. The ottoman on the chair was frayed and had dirty spots on it. I went back to the front desk. Received an apology and was given a different room. We went to our room on the 12th floor and it was better but not much. The furniture is cherry wood with nicks on it. The lamps do not have built in electrical plugs so if I want to use my computer while in bed, I have to unplug the clock. The desk has outlets for internet and electricity, but again the lamp on the desk does not have an electrical outlet. The chair and ottoman are in better shape than the room on the 10th floor, but one can tell it could use a good steam cleaning as well. The beds are comfortable. The sheets are clean and white. But the duvet cover does not have the same crisp white look or smell. Nice flat screen TVs and large bathrooms with a pocket door. San Francisico is definitely cooler than the South, but the room goes from stuffy to cool. I cut the temperature to 71 but it still is rather warm. Another thing, I used the iron board and had to run because we were late, but when we returned to the room the iron board was right were we had left it even though the room had been made up. I have never had that happen not even in a Days Inn. One more thing. I signed up for their loyalty program and received free internet. However, I am going to have to remind them at checkout that I shouldn't have to pay for the internet. But get this, I was having trouble getting on the internet and called the internet help line. I got a voicemail and was told to leave my name and number and she would call back. Not good service for the internet. Again, the customer service at this hotel is outstanding from the front desk and other employees. The location is in the financial district so it is away from the touristy Union Square. Also, there is a great restaurant down the street called Tadick Grill. It's the oldest restaurant in San Francisco and the food (especially the seafood) is the best!! Honestly, I received a great rate on this hotel and love the customer service, but I don't think I will stay here again until they make some changes in cleanliness.

We were celebrating a 20th anniversary and I wanted to see the new Impressionists Exhibit at the DeYoung (DON'T miss it). The Omni had a fabulous package available with room, parking, breakfast & VIP DeYoung tickets at a bargain price, $287...I snapped it up. Then I called as I forgot to put a note in the reservation regarding room preferences. I spoke with Tofique at the front desk and asked about my preference, after some chatting he asked was their any 'special' reason we were coming that weekend. I said 'Yes, it's our 20th anniversary'. He then asked if he could upgrade us as a surprise for my spouse, of course I said Yes, Please!. When we arrived we found ourselves in the Pony Express Suite on the 14th floor, it doesn't give sweeping views of the city but it was lovely and very, very plush AND to make everything even better we had champagne & choc covered strawberries awaiting us!! We had dinner out in the city but had breakfast downstairs in Bob's. Although there was only 1 waiter and he was a bit overwhelmed (staff had called in sick), he made me the best hot choc and rec a wonderful breakfast which was more suitable for two! The food was mouthwatering and we went to the DeYoung thoroughly rested and satisfied! The Omni has moved to the top of my list as my favorite pick in SF to stay. From the time you arrive and are greeted by the doorman until he bids you a good-bye you will feel quite regal! Oh, and don't forget to request the turndown service & have your hot beverage delivered to your room in the morning (all complementary), it will finish your evening and start your day off RIGHT!

The service was personable (the valets repeatedly addressed us by name), generous, unpretentious and sincere throughout our stay. The drawbacks of the Omni should be mentioned: (1) there's little to no view from any of the rooms; the hotel is unfortunately surrounded by tall(er) buildings -- so if you're looking for a grand view of the Golden Gate or Bay bridge, this is probably not the hotel for you; (2) we had to pay for bottled water in the room whereas many top hotels provide 2 bottles of free water/day (pet peeve: if a hotel is not going to provide drinkable/filtered tap water, then it shouldn't charge for bottled water); (3) internet access was not free -- we ended up joining the Omni frequent guest program (no charge) just so we could get the free internet.

I don't like the location as much as some other hotels, but it's still close by. Email below: I believe I've stayed at an Omni hotel (not the SF one) in the past, but definitely not since I became a regular business traveler, as I have been for the past 3.5 years. I usually travel 2 to 8 times per month, and I've stayed at a variety of 4 stars around the country (primarily SF, NYC, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, LA and Seattle). As one of two partners in my firm, I will admit cost is a large driving factor in choosing hotels (since T&E comes straight out of my pocket), so I'm a member of nearly all Hotel reward programs out there. For some reason, however, it's taken until this week before I joined Omni's Select Guest program. I can say with absolute certainty that it is the best hotel rewards program out there for any \"chain\" hotel. While I've seen one or two of the benefits you offer (free wireless and free water bottles) at other hotels, but the total combination of items that I care about as a business traveler (free clothes pressing, free shoe shine, free beverages in the morning, free water bottle in the evening, and pre-check-in/guaranteed room) make the Select Guest program almost too good to be true. On top of that, the fact that it's only 5 stays or 10 nights to get a free room AND only 6 (I think) nights before I move up to the next tier in your program DOES make it too good to be true. I've already sung praises of your program to 3 people, and I just checked out of the hotel this morning. In addition, another pleasant surprise was a gentlemen at the front desk named Stephen (a caucasian, bald man around 6ft tall), who was not just friendly, but one of the most informative front desk people I have come across. He also clearly remembered me the next morning and was just as helpful. I've never written an email to a hotel manager to praise their hotel, but the combination of the two topics above drove me to do so.

We received free internet access ($9.95/night otherwise I believe), morning newspaper, and breakfast drinks (2 per person). The hotel is in the financial district. There were many ATMs nearby. I had to get some unexpected work done and luckily, FedEx Kinko\u2019s and the UPS Store were a few blocks away. The hotel is walking distance to Union Square and two blocks from Chinatown. We walked to both. We also walked to the Cable Car Museum (free) and onward to Ghirardelli Square via North Beach and Russian Hill. Ghirardelli Square was a bit far for walking, but we wanted the exercise. We took a cab from Pier 39 back to the hotel ($10) though.

The location of the Omni in the center of town does not lend itself to views in any case.

Best bet is not to have a car, if you must there are cheaper self-park alternatives (parking at corner of Sutter & Stockton is a municipal garage)", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, California", "Title": "\u201cNot perfect, But a Good Stay and at a Reasonable Cost\u201d", "Author": "jsr914", "ReviewID": "UR45449182", "Content": "My wife and I vacation in the Bay Area frequently. Given the number of top-notch hotels in The City, we usually pick and choose a new one each trip. This time we landed the Omni on a discount website for about $125 per night. Given all of the good reviews on Trip Advisor, we were excited to give it a try. The location of the hotel is better for business than leisure. While I like the Embarcadero area for its proximity to BART and the ferry building, we found ourselves constantly trudging up-hill toward Union Square or Pacific Heights for dinner and sightseeing. We do a lot of walking when staying in the City anyway, so the additional few blocks (all uphill) was a bit of overkill. In short, we largely prefer staying in Union Square and probably will skip the Omni because of its location on our next stay. All other aspects of the hotel were well above-average -- our check in went smoothly. The staff was attentive and pleasant. Our room was clean and comfortable, although very average in size and accommodations. The lobby area is attractive and the hotel is a very good mix of luxury and value. Overall, we found the Omni to be an excellent value and a good choice for a home base while staying in San Francisco.

My husband and I have never been to San Fran and we came with 5 others for fun. On the day we arrived we came in late from the airport and had 30 minutes to get to Pier 33 for the night Alcatraz tour. Thank goodness for Michael at the front desk, he not only checked us in, took all of our bags and had us all whisked away in time to make the tour. That was just the beginning! Every morning Joey at the font desk would greet us and ask whats on the agenda today. Well he made lots of suggestions and was very helpful in teaching us how to take the cable cars to the Piers, which was very easy. It picks you up right in front of the hotel and you take it to Powell street. On Powell you can either take the Hyde Cable car or the Mason. They both take you to the water at the different spots but the Hyde takes you to Lombard Street where you can get off and walk down the famous street and its only a couple of blocks to the Pier. For us taking the cable cars and walking around was the best way to see and experience the life down there. Parking would be crazy, so if your able to walk, that is what I recommend. We also did the Night cruise to Alcatraz. We bought our tickets a month in advance and believe me if we hadn't we would not of been able to go. It is definately worth the price and a great tour! We also top the Hop on Hop off Bus tour over the Golden Gate Bridge. It was ok I was a little disappointed that we got on the wrong bus and didn't get to go to Salsalito. Once your on they do no transfers so your stuck on the bus going where its going. It wasn't bad we went to the Exploratorium, the Presidio, over the bridge and the Pacific Heights Mansions. It was nice but really heard that Salsalito was a great town to go to! Other than that the Bread from Boudini's and the seafood is Awesome! We went to a show in North Beach, Beach Blanket Babylon and thought that it was great! Different, funny with great costumes and the humor was with all the current events that are going on today and Singing. If your up for a funny show you will have to get your tickets ahead of time for this too! Had no problems taking the BART to and from the airport. Hotel was just 5 blocks away. A special thanks to Joey and Michael at the Omni for always helping and going way out of their way to make our stay better! Definately planning a trip to go back with our kids next year and would definately stay at the Omni again!

At the end of our trip we stayed 3 nights at the Omni. It was the BEST of all the hotels we stayed at and I feel I booked some nice hotels. There was always a doorman and Darryl is the best of ALL. They were polite and would say welcome back. Darryl would even ask how your outing was. The front desk always said hello to me and my mom as we descended the stairs in the lobby. The room was clean and comfortable. The bath was very nice indeed. The room service was excellent in taste and value. My mom liked the tea they used so much I had to go online to order some for her. I personally loved the blueberry muffins with honey. Some people might say $4 plus tax and gratuity is expensive but go try to buy one at another establishment. It would cost about the same and is not near the quality or quantity. I have traveled coast to coast about 45 times and abroad twice, some was business and some pleasure. Some of the hotel/motels cost $40 a night and some $500. In those stays I have NEVER encountered the service as I did at the Omni San Francisco. I even took mom inside 3 big name hotels at the Wharf to compare our value and we knew we had made the right decision immediately. None of the hotels had a doorman available, the concierge was either aloof or rude (and yes I asked for 'directions'), and no one said hello as we entered. Also, when we left, I noticed there was no one to call a cab. I will say that we got spoiled on a refrigerator to store goodies in along our trip - as the Omni has items stored in theirs to buy, but it is overall TRIVIAL and I can't see myself staying anywhere else the next time I visit San Francisco.

The wall decor is pretty sparse, the Sharp flat panel TV has the slowest channel changer I've seen in a long time, and the nightstands are flimsy. (3) The rooms only have wired internet access.

Yet the cable car runs infront of the hotel/china town begins behind the hotel/union square is a 15min walk to the right and the ferry building/coit tower steps and the piers are roughly a 15min walk to the left. Seven minutes exactly straight on takes you to Market St and lots more Muni bus/Bart options. I have read on the forum that this location is not favourable but i totally disagree. Union Square was so noisy and with a tramp on almost every corner was not for young children. Fishermans Wharf was great if you like a Blackpool type area - we were glad we didnt stay there. If you like to be close but not too close to the main areas this is for you. Extra children's goodies included backpack with goodies in and first night cookies and milk. Tips negotiate a parking deal for around $30pn or park opposite sat/sun till 4am only for $7 per day. Join select guests to get free internet and coffee/juice in the morning.

The other complaint is that there is no shopping around the hotel. Everytime I come to San Francisco, I have a long shopping list from friends and family.

This is what you should expect and what you pay for in a four-star hotel. If you like \"old elegance\" this is the place for you. The location is great and the area around the hotel is very clean. We booked a sigature room based on the reservations agent description of it. It was not worth the extra money. It was on the sixteenth floor and overlooked Montgomery St but was so high you couldn't see the street, just old rooftops. There was no advantage in being so high up but the major disadvantage was the long waits for elevators. We found the staff to be very nice. Housekeeping was OK- skipped our room once so we didn't have our room done until after we left for the evening. Some days we recceived the number of towels we should have and other days we didn't. We received the fresh fruit and bottled water two of the four days. There were not many hotel guests while we were there. When I booked our room I inquired about the \"in-room\" safe size and was told my 15.4\" laptop would fit in it. This was not the case and everytime we went out we had to take it to the front desk to be locked in security and then wait again to retrieve it upon return - a major inconvenience. When we first discovered this upon checking in we spoke to the on-duty manager who said they were in the process of renovating the rooms and the renovated rooms will receive larger safes. He did not offer to move us to a renovated room nor compensate us with a complementary breakfast or the like for our inconvenience. The on-site restaurant is so over-priced it is comical. We had breakfast there twice and each time there was a major problem. We finally switched to room service - something we never do. .

In general we found all the door staff to be really nice. (Every time we entered or left the hotel there was a warm welcome,) Some hotels can be impersonal and cold, the Omni, however, was friendly and welcoming and although this was a reasonably large hotel we almost made to feel part of the family. Reception staff were lovely, as were all the staff throughout the hotel. The lady that serviced our room was cheerful, friendly, and professional in every way, The rooms were of a good size and were clean and tidy and well maintained, the bed was very comfortable, we had fantastic nights sleep, the rooms air conditioning was good and there were plenty of fluffy towels.

I knew about this hotel from when I lived in San Francisco and worked in the Financial District. We booked an entire vacation on Hotwire and paid a little more to stay at the Omni only because I'd always wanted to stay there. Little did I know what an experience we were in for. We checked in on Saturday night. Crystal at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a concierge floor room. She was genuinely friendly, professional and outgoing. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was elegantly furnished. The only drawback was that it seemed small. We were there for eight nights and we found that it lacked storage for all of our clothes. I think for a shorter stay, the room would've been absolutely perfect. From the bellman to the front desk attendants to the valets to the doormen to the room service people, the service was nothing less than spectacular. Everyone remembered our names, what room we were in, had our car waiting for us in a timely manner. We had breakfast at Bob's Steak House one morning. The french toast is to die for and the portions are big. Though the food seemed expensive, the portion size made up for the price. The room was appointed with a plasma TV, king size bed with down comforter. We had turn down service nightly with water and fresh fruit waiting for us when we returned from the day out. We had drinks of our choice and newpapers waiting at our door every morning. The hotel was originally a bank that was gutted and rebuilt in early 2000's. It was beautiful on the inside and out. It didn't seem overcrowded at all. As a matter of fact, it seemed nearly empty most of the time we were there. It is located on California Street @ Montgomery, on the California Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of the Financial District. I liked this location because it was out of the way of all of the tourist traps and it was nice to come home at night to a quiet, much more relaxed environment.

The hotel is convenietly located in the Financial district within walking distance of Union Square, Fishermans Warf etc. Our room on the 5th floor did not have a great view but was very quiet and well worth sacrificing the view for. The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch. The only small complaint we have is that the one and only bar in the hotel (Bobs bar) is very small and gets very crowded from approx 5pm onwards, and getting a seat was almost impossible around those times. However it is no reason not to stay here. When we first arrived after our lengthy journey from Scotland, we were informed that our room (booked and paid for 8 months previousley) had been cancelled by Octopus travel who we had booked the room through. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in rectifying the situation. San Francisco is well worth a visit and has plenty to offer for all. We would recommend visiting Alcatraz and taking the coach tour of the city, however book your Alcatraz tickets online as far in advance as possible to ensure you get the dates you require. We also hired bikes from Blazing Saddles and rode over the Golden Gate bridge to Tiburon via Sausilto. This is a fantastic way to see the bridge and surrounding area (weather allowing). Sausilto is a must see when you are there and can be accessed by Ferry if you prefer not to bike it, dining is recommeded at Angelino's while you are there. We also took a wine tour to Napa valley etc and would recommend this trip, with plenty of samples included in the day ensuring the hoilday spirit was flowing. Union square is packed with all the usual big name shops, but visit the hippy district at upper Haight street for some of the funkiest shops available. We visited the zoo but found it to be dated and shabby with many of the animals not available to view. Of course you must take a ride on a tram while you are there, we would advise getting a day pass for 11 bucks, which allows you to hop on and off all day at your leisure. Finally Lombard St aka the most crookidest street in the world is worth a look with camera in hand. We had 2 days of cloud followed by 8 days of glorious sunshine while we we there.

All of the amenities you would expect for a business hotel are available. The hotel is located very close to the Ferry building and Chinatown. Being located in the financial district makes the hotel close to San Francisco's excellent restaurants including, Aqua and Perbacco. We ate at Perbacco and would recommend to anyone. We used the concierge services extensively and they were always courteous, quick, and thorough. It just wasn't the concierge that helped us. Everyone in the hotel goes out of their way to help. The lady that checked-us in, Crystal, was superb!!!They made a number of reservations for us and provided excellent recommendations.

It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we weren't sure of which area to stay in, but the Omni turned out to be perfectly located for us. It's in the Financial District, so it's quiet at night, but we felt perfectly safe walking there after dark. It's also on the cable-car line, within easy walking distance of Chinatown and the Ferry Building and if you don't mind walking a bit further, you can easily walk to the Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas from here. The hotel itself is lovely and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. If I had to pick one thing to fault the room on, it would be the fixed-head shower. I didn't have a particular problem with it, but it was just ok - investing a little money in the shower would really bring it up to the standard of the rest of the accommodation. Staff at the Omni were very friendly and helpful, from check-in, where they offered to help us book any attractions we wanted to see, room service bending over backwards to make us happy when there was a slight problem with our order, the concierge recommending places to eat, right through to the doorman offering us the hotel car when we were leaving for the airport (at only $5 more than the taxi fare, this was a nice option). In addition, when we had an issue with the guests in the adjoining room holding an impromptu party late one night, hotel security dealt with it very quickly. We joined the Select Guest program online for free and this entitled us to complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice every morning, as well as complimentary WiFi access and a daily newspaper. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant, which was somewhat expensive, but excellent quality and really tasty. There was complimentary fresh fruit (peaches, apricots, plums etc, not just standard apples) and juice or iced tea in the lobby every afternoon, which was nice when returning from sightseeing before going out to dinner.

But the rooms are definitely hit or miss and it is quite random whether you will get a nice accommodation. On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located downtown in the financial district. A bit far from the convention center or tourist destinations but great if you are in town for work. The staff is generally professional and helpful. The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past. Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a \"premium\" room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size. Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def\" TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn. Premium rooms offer \"a courtyard view\". Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual \"view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer. If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek. The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about. All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel.

The financial district is very quiet on weekends, which, like another poster said, we liked. We were at the end of a 10 day trip out west and thought the Omni was the best hotel we stayed at, and we stayed at nice hotels! We checked in early, no problem, and when we were leaving they held our luggage all day because our flight wasn't until 10:00 that night. We loved all the personal touches and luxurious bedding and robes! As an added tip, we joined their hotel rewards program when making the reservations (it's free to join) and that got us extra perks like coffee/juice/paper in the morning, get fit kit and the room and a few more things.

The Omni service was exceptional which is why this hotel is so highly rated. The \"premium\" class room on the top floor (17th) was large with the usual first-class amenities - king size bed, armoire holding the TV - mini-bar-drawers for clothing, a writing table and a chair. The room was very much like other major UPSCALE hotel chains but nothing palacial. The room was accurately described as having a \"partial view\" so I was not expecting more than this. I could see the bay but I also saw a lot of the side of the L-shaped Omni itself. The only hotel that I saw there that I would like to investigate next time was the Intercontinental Mark (somebody). It is a high rise on Nob Hill which is elevated already so I am sure the views were pretty spectacular. I am sure the price is as well. We had brunch at the Top of the Mark which is - you guessed it - on the top floor and we saw the view ourselves. Spectacular. But back to the Omni... When we told the concierge that this was our 20th Wedding Anniversary, they immediately arranged to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room - complimentary. Having a bottle of champagne around just changes the whole mood of a hotel room - I highly recommend it. I am not suggesting that you lie about it being your anniversary, though. I had the 3-1/2 days in San Fran very well scheduled before we arrived because I wanted to make the most of our short stay, so I took the wind out of the concierge's sails when I showed him my calendar chart of restaurant reservations, Alcatraz cruise, Wok Wiz Chinatown tour, etc, but I would have missed the opportunity of eating at the Slanted Door if the concierge had not pointed out that they were in fact open for lunch (I had seen information indicating they only opened at 5 and could not work it into our evening time slots.) Tiger prawns, Vietnamese crepes, beef short ribs. WoW! One complaint: when you stay at the hotel that is rated #1, any little thing that is wrong will seem like a big deal. For instance, I had to take the coffee service tray out of the armoire and set it on the table and then I had to crawl under the table to reach the electrical outlet just to get it plugged in. I found myself getting quite indignant (silly pride) at the effort I had to personally exert just to hook up the thing. I have done this before in other hotels and not been nearly as bothered. Lesson: limit your expectations and you will always be more satisfied. Also: This is in the Financial District. While we never felt like we were out of the main part of town, it does get quiet on weekends. This was pleasant to us. You are still only a few blocks from Union Square, the Ferry Building, and Chinatown and you have cable cars running directly in front of the hotel. You will not feel isolated in the least.

Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by. HOTEL: I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no \"wow\" factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room. SERVICE: The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star. Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest. HOTEL TIPS: Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest. RESTAURANT TIPS: We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there. Go early (before 11:00) to avoid the crazy crowds!", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!

My baby's blanket was accidentally taken by the cleaning staff. Omni took all measures to locate it, and then refunded 1 night off the bill and treated us to a free breakfast.

The hotel was fantastic. From greeting us with roses and first class service upon checking in, to our beautifully appointed room. It was a deluxe room with two double beds, marble bathroom, with no real views but very comfortable. We are wary of hotels but felt right at home at the Omni, as everything was clean and comfortable. I have stayed in Fairmonts and nicer hotels, and I would say that this hotel was at par with a 4+ star, it was great. My girlfriend celebrated a birthday during our stay and we only mentioned it to the front desk clerk when asked why in town, after dinner one night they sent up a bottle of champagne, two small birthday cakes and a personalized card. It was perfect! The gym was great, tv's on all the equipment and was never full, or even half full. Get your water there as there is complimentary water, and the bottle in your room is $6. Oh and there is also fresh fruit in the gym, which might be a nice snack as the mini bar and room service are quite pricey. Which isn't too much of a problem since the Omni is near alot of nice cafes, restaurants etc. (right beside the Omni there is a cafe which has everything and makes delicious panini's.... which are worth the trip back to San Francisco). We never ordered anything from the hotel.... except a bagel and fruitplate in the morning.... and it wasn't outrageous. No pool, no views, but what the hotel lacks in those areas, it completely compensates for in friendly helpful staff. It is close to China town, Union square, North beach and across the street from the Carmelian room which has amazing views while you dine. Become an Omni select guest member (free online) and you can get a complimentary morning beverage and paper, turn down service and upgrade after so many stays. Being on California street, alongside the cable cars, the Omni makes it easy to get around without a rental car. I would actually say avoid renting one if possible as parking in San Francisco is expensive and hard to come by. The hotel charges $45 I believe. So we rented one to drive up to win country, and returned it the same day, just to save us the hassle of paying for parking and returning it the next day. San Francisco is a fantastic city and the hospitality extends far beyond the hotels and tourist areas. Everyone is so nice and made our trip so enjoyable.

From the on-the-spot front doormen to the absolutely perfect front desk clerk (Bridget? not sure but hope that's correct) I couldn't have been more impressed.

The Pecksniff's and Moulton Brown toiletries were much appreciated. Mornings we received complimentary coffee and fresh squeezed OJ delivered to the door along with a newspaper. That perk is yours if you sign up with Omni's frequent guest program online. Overall the hotel was in top notch condition and kept spotless. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings in the dining room. As it usually is with hotel dining rooms the prices were pretty steep for breakfast. However, it was convenient for us and worked out fine. Having lived in San Francisco I would say that the location is definitely geared to the business travelers. It is located in the financial district and is a short walk to the more touristy areas, such as Union Square. The Omni offered us complimentary town car service to Davies Symphony hall which was a very nice surprise! Overall we were treated very well.

I reserved a Signature Room at the Omni San Francisco Hotel through Hotels.com for 4 nights, arriving August 31 and leaving September 4, 2007. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed that they had over-booked their rooms. I was told that I would be put in a lower cost standard room, a room without the Signature Room complimentary services. Needless to say, I was not happy about paying the Signature price for the lower cost room, this because I had paid in advance. When I complained, I was offered a free breakfast. After I refused to accept the room they had offered, I was finally given a Signature Room. No doubt some other poor schmuck got stuck paying top dollar for a standard room. A first-class hotel would never have suggested downgrading a paying customer, regardless of how or how much they paid. But then, Omni isn\u2019t a first-class hotel. Once I had checked into my Signature accommodations, everything was fine except for one minor detail. On Monday morning, September 3, while entering the bathroom in my suite, I stepped on a carpet nail that was protruding upward out of the carpet in front of the bathroom door. I didn\u2019t think I needed to be concerned about walking barefoot in my own room, not in a first-class hotel. I wasn\u2019t as angry about being injured by Omni\u2019s negligence as I was by their response. When I contacted the front desk and explained that a nail had punctured my toe and that I was bleeding profusely, their staff offered me a band-aid. Given the fact that I was in pain and limping, given the fact that I now had to contact my doctor to find out when I last had a tetanus shot, given the fact that I now had to worry about catching some horrible disease from the last person who impaled themselves on their carpet nail - I would have expected a first-class hotel to be more consolatory than to offer me a band-aid. After I returned to my room, the Omni staff sent me a note stating that they were unable to find the nail that had injured me. They insisted that I point out the nail to their building engineer, which I did. As their building engineer was pounded the offending nail back into the floor, he stated that he discovered 2 more nails protruding upward out of the carpet in the same general area. I wasn\u2019t aware that I was entering a \u201cmine field\u201d when I checked into the Omni hotel. But the final straw occurred as I was checking out of the hotel. The desk clerk inquired as to my stay. I explained the whole sordid tale, the nail, the blood, the limping, everything. I then asked what was the best way to get to the Oakland Airport. To add insult to injury, she suggested that I walk 4 blocks to the BART station. Once I returned home, I contacted the Omni management to complain. The hotel manager promised to send me a voucher for several free nights stay. This never happened. A first-class hotel manager would have been a man of his word.

After such a great stay I knew that I had to come back to the Omni, and I am so glad that I did. Let me share my wonderful weekend with you. We came to celebrate my fiance's birthday. I made sure to let the Omni know during my reservations and when I spoke with the concierges to arrange for some cider to be sent up to the room. On our way to the hotel I realized we would like a DVD player in our room and when I talked with them I was informed that we wouldn't have to worry about asking for a DVD player because we had been upgraded to a suite (which included a DVD player)! The weather was pretty nasty the day we arrived, but we made it there (sopping wet, but still...). Greeted warmly by the door-man I got my keys and we headed to our suite. It was on the 7th floor, and at first I was disappointed because I had requested a high floor, until I opened the door to our room. The suites have a separate sitting room with a couch and two sitting chairs, as well as a desk and entertainment system set-up (I will post pictures shortly after the review is posted). The stereo was turned on, playing some soft classical music as we entered the room. The ambiance was magnificent. On the table were THREE separate greeting cards, wishing warm birthday wishes to my fiance', inviting us to ask for anything we need to be comfortable, as well as a personally written greeting card from the general manager! This is why the Omni San Francisco won top honors for best service in the United States! Within minutes of settling in there came another knock at the door. My fiance' and I were both surprised to see in-room dining had sent up a slice of chocolate birthday cake! It was very good and we were wondering if they planned to spoil us rotten all weekend. While there were no more additional amenities, the Omni, as always, was very fast and professional with any and all requests that I made. The night that we arrived, for example, I called the front desk to ask for recommendations for a good italian restaurant. The concierge I spoke to (Justin I believe was his name) was very friendly and recommended the North Beach restaurant/area, stating that there were numerous italian restaurants in the area that we could choose from. We took him up on it and sure enough we found a charming little place called Franchino's to have dinner. Our room also came with free breakfast each morning we were there. I've heard mixed reviews about the restaurant from other people, but I thought that the breakfast was very good. Granted that it came with my room and I didn't have to pay anything except for the tip. I'm not sure I would say the same if I actually paid the 25 dollars for the breakfast. Still, as an amenity to a hotel-room package, the breakfast is very good. If there was one thing that I had to say that was not the best experience during this last stay, it was that Cabs were hard to come by this time. I heard something about local taxi services boycotting the Omni, but I'm not sure if that was true or not. Whatever it was, many cabs dropped off their customers and just sped off rather than pick up people waiting in the cab line. So, my fiance' and I did a lot more walking than we probably planned to. Still, if you requested a copy of the 2007 rewards for hotels, you will see the Omni San Francisco won a number of honors. Ranking in at #34 worldwide in Luxury hotels, #3 in U.S Luxury Hotels, Best in the San Francisco Destination (of the top 25), #4 in World- Customer Service and #1 in U.S- Customer Service. That's not the chain, it's this branch! To any Omni San Francisco staff reading this review, thank you so much for making my stay so memorable and I can't wait to come back and visit you again. To anyone visiting San Francisco in the near future: Make your reservations! I can't stress enough how great this hotel is.

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids. Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u2019ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. The Omni was arranged through a travel agent in Brisbane, though as usual I had checked with Trip Advisor, and then asked the travel agent to book it when I was satisfied. He got me better rates than going to the hotel direct, too. We were also staying at an Omni in Boston, and as I'd joined the Omni's Select Guest program (free, via the internet), there were advantages to be had. Plus, we'd previously stayed at the Omni in Washington and it was spectacular (my favourite of the 3 Omnis I've stayed in whilst in the USA), so we thought it would be good. We weren't disappointed. Fairly large rooms (we had a double and a triple, though the kids weren't particularly happy at 2 of them having to share a double bed - but then, they're not paying!); interconnecting which was useful. Free internet (I had a laptop) for Select Guest members (if you stay at the Omni, the Select Guest program is recommended - free juice/coffee and newspaper delivered every morning). Very reasonably sized bathroom. In all, very comfortable. It's a grand building with an impressive foyer. We received a lovely sincere welcome from the bell captain on arriving. The hotel is not all the conveniently located, but we were happy to walk and find our way around. Finding cheap restaurants (try feeding 5, including 2 big boys, for 4 weeks straight - you won't be eating at the hotel restaurants very much!) was a bit of a task, but not impossible. Speaking of meals, we fell over Francis Ford Coppola's Italian cafe in Kearney Street on the way back from climbing the Coit tower - it was great. Google it if you are interested. I brought some of the wine back to Australia. We decided to eat there purely on the basis of the menu and the look of the place, then found out who the famous owner was. Recommended purely on the Italian food and the venue, if nothing else. We did a tour of the city (booked through the travel agent), which was absolutely worthwhile. Stopped at good views of the city (from a high lookout), and another spot for views of the Golden Gate Bridge (which the bus drove over). It also included a harbour cruise from Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf, which went under the Golden Gate Bridge and circled Alcatraz Island. It's a good way to see the highlights.

The extra attention the entire staff including the housekeeping service was beyond our expectations. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. Chinatown and Union Square are within walking distance. Other transportation we purchased the 3 day muni pass and rode the trolley and cable cars to every destination on our list. The suggested tours of Muir Woods and Napa Wine Country were awesome. Tower Tours picked us up from the hotel front door, they were well worth every cent. The tour guide named Will was outstanding. It is recommended 100%. We will certainly return to the Omni for our next visit to this fantastic city and would not even consider another hotel. Although we did not dine at Bob's, I regret not having done so.

Well, the upgrade (and what I was told I'd receive when I made the reservation) would have been an upgraded courtyard view.

There was no availability for either unfortunately I was told and initially we were placed in a smoking-permitted floor and room. I called the front-desk to ask if any accomodation could be made. The night manager, a wonderful person named Ellen K., indicated she would have us moved to another deluxe room that was non-smoking if we didn't mind moving to another room on our third day/night's stay. This was fine with us. Ellen subsequently called back a few minutes later and said the third night would be an upgraded deluxe suite room on an upper floor because of the trouble (at no extra charge of course). The entire stay was extremely nice, the BellHop area held an extra bag for us for three days while we went to Big Sur in a Miata and provided the bag as needed. Overall a great customer service environment. And the rooms/beds/furnishing was top-notch. The only possible knock is that the hotel is in the financial district.

I asked for a rollaway bed, and ages later received a ridiculous inflatable bed not suitable for a comfortable night\u2019s sleep. I managed, but it was very uncomfortable. The worst part, however, came after my stay when I had a $300 charge on my credit card. I called to inquire about the charge and they proceeded to tell me it was for room damage. I had no idea what they were talking about and after further investigation, they told me there was a hole in the wall of the room we stayed in. I of course asked for the manager to call me, and was extremely taken aback at how I was treated. He was pompous and rude and immediately accused me of putting the hole in the wall. He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state. I told him that they did, and that my friend (who I immediately phoned afterwards) actually saw the hole \u2013 but forgot to mention it to me (it was at the bottom of the wall near the baseboard in the hallway near the door, making it easy to miss). After I relayed this to the manager, he made a snide remark about how guests of his hotel are high-class and would call and complain if they received a room with a hole in the wall. Having no idea of the consequences of not reporting the hole, my friend didn't feel he needed to say anything and thus I never knew about it. The manager was horribly condescending and from his last remark implied that I was not a high-class guest and \u2018didn\u2019t belong\u2019 at his hotel. I again assured him that the hole was not from me and he had no proof. He again insisted that his staff does not make mistakes and would never rent out a room with a hole in the wall. I was not going to budge and insisted that he reverse the charge. After going back and forth for awhile, he finally succumbed and reversed the charge. However, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I should not have had to defend my honor, and I knew he thought I was lying even after he reversed the charge. Even though I got the charge reversed, I still didn\u2019t feel like I won. This hotel should not be four-star, as four-star hotels would never treat their guests like this.

I had also signed up for Omni's free Select Membership benefits online: i.e.complimentary morning newspaper - notify Front Desk which one, complimentary morning beverages - write on Breakfast menu tag and hang outside door before going to sleep, late check out - after 12 noon but notify Front Desk, evening turndown service, etc. We parked at St. Mary's Garage (entrance on left-side, 1/2 block before California, while driving north on Kearny). $32 for 24 hrs. No in-out privileges, but we didn't need our car since we could take public transportation everywhere, or walk a few blocks to Union Square/Chinatown/North Beach/Market St. We walked less than 10 min. to the Embarcadero stop on the F line (SFMTA's Muni ) to Pier 29/Chestnut St. to enjoy a dinner & show at Teatro Zinzanni. We enjoyed this European-style cabaret, focused on fun through comedy, music, Cirque du Soleil-style feats, audience participation/interaction, and a 5-course dinner. Since the seats are arranged in concentric circles, all views are good. We hardly noticed that 3 hours had passed when the show ended as we ate dessert. We also saw the da Vinci exhibit at the Metreon (4th/Mission, south of Market), closing Dec. 31. The range of inventions displayed and re-created was astounding, especially the precursors to modern inventions. If you show a BART ticket until Aug. 31, you get a $4 discount off the adult admission price.

They got to know us and were very helpful and attentive to our travel plans. Not so at the SF Marriot! The Deluxe room was well appointed but not luxurious.

We preferred the deluxe room on the 6th floor as we actually enjoyed hearing the clangging of the cable car bell. If you prefer quit then get a room above the 8th floor.

Cab rides were readily available to anywhere else. I'd definitely pay extra for a Signature rooms on the 16th floor, as the little touches, like a high thread-count sheets, are definitely worth it. The bed is EXTREMELY comfortable. I'd also advise you to sign up for the Omni Club prior to check-in, as membership has some nice freebies, like complimentary beverages and newspapers brought to your room each morning. Free wireless access, too. That said, the decor and furnishings at the Omni are nothing special, rather bland and corporate.

It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend. Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square, 15 mins tops. Loads of places to eat there. The cable cars are great, get a $11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception, valid for the cars and buses. Rooms are lovely, nice and big and great bathrooms, all marble, rooms have air con big TV , video games etc. We used as base to explore, Lombard street, G Gate bridge, Fishermans Wharf, Italian quarter, Coit Tower. Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy. One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off, hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all. Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street. This one passes over Lombard Street just by the 'crooked street' bit. Great fun standing on the side and leaning out.... which you are not supposed to do of course. We did have one evening meal in the Bob's Steakhouse, attached to hotel and one brealfast.

As previous reviewers described, this hotel has NO view (I stayed at the Hilton FD last time, the views are GEORGIOUS, check my previous post for pictures).

There are few restaurants nearby (Tadich Grill is a must go!) few blocks walk to the bart station. Its not that bad of the area at night to walk around with but however it is a very boring area if nightlife is what you are looking for. Chinatown is nearby but still a bit of walk.

This is not a 5 star hotel or comparative to the Four Seasons though it did remind me of a Ritz Carlton.

We took the ferry to Sausalito and that was great.

WRONG. If you have a pair of legs and can walk you can be on Market St/Union Square in 5-10 minutes. I'm used to big busy cities and there is nothing worse than staying in the throbbing throng with all the tourists. For this reason the location of the Omni is a real bonus. Far from the madding crowd but no so far to be any kind of inconvenience. It is true that most of the guests seem to be there on business but its no problem. Dont eat there if you dont want to hear suits talk turkey. Go out and enjoy the many fanatsic restaurants in San Fran instead. TIPS: Join the SelectGuest programme (a kind of clubcard membership) for free in adavnce and then you get a free paper and drink delivered to your room every morning at a time you specify. You also get the option of ordering light breakfast items at an extremely reasonbale rate. (cream cheese toatsted bage was about $3 or \u00a31.50). The gym is stocked with complimentary water and fresh(ish) fruit. 'Nuff said on that one! Free internet service in the lobby. If noise bothers you stay as high up as possible. (on the 5th you can hear the tram bells, on the 13th you can hear nothing). You can buy your MUNI passes from the fornt desk at their face value. If travelling without too much luggage do yourself a favour at SFO and use the BART rather than pay for a taxi. A jounrey on the BART is only $5.15 and the walk from Montgomery Station is less than 10 minutes. The BART was very safe and clean. ROOMS: Look nicer than they appear in the photos. They're quite dark which is why the photos dont do them justice. It's all very faux-Georgian but tastefully done. Bathrooms are classy too. Not enormous amounts of storage but enough. Avoid the mini-bar. SERVICE: Front-desk and doormen were superb. Extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Room service was extremely punctual with the selectguest drinks delivery. (you book a 15 minute slot and they there on the button every time). A Maitre D at Bobs steakhouse (attached to the Omni) was a bit stuffy but thats not their problem. Remember its mainly business people eating or using the bar there so I would avoid. LOCATION: You're in the business district but this does mean the area is well served by espresso bars, jamba juice and diners for workers. Also, a tram stops outide the hotel which is handy. You can walk most places very easily or use your MUNI pass for the transport.", "Date": "March 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Maria, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Great Hotel, Great Stay!\u201d", "Author": "JRSanchez", "ReviewID": "UR6918233", "Content": "We booked the Omni based on two factors: price for 2 rooms as given through Expedia and also reviews from Trip Advisor. This was a getaway weekend for me, 2 adult sisters, and our Mom to celebrate Mom's birthday. BACKGROUND: Each member of our gang is a very seasoned world traveler, and we have stayed in every type of accommodation around the world from the St. Regis and Four Seasons to camping in a tent on Kuaui, with many a \"hostel experience\" thrown in for good measure. We are also all veteran San Francisco travelers, with one sister having lived in the city at one time. We have stayed all over the city in all types of properties (large and small, cheap and luxury) and we ALL AGREE: The Omni gets our unanimous vote as our new San Francisco \"home away from home\"!!! From check in to check out, everything was smooth and wonderful and the staff, from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, could not have been nicer or more accommodating. FRONT DESK: We checked in on Friday and arrived quite early (10.30 a.m.) expecting to have to store our luggage until later in the day. Surprise! Two rooms were ready and waiting. However, upon getting up to the rooms, we discovered that we had one room with 2 doubles and one with 1 king. We wanted to have two rooms, both with doubles, connecting if possible. One call to the front desk, a thorough search of the computer, and VOILA: just what we wanted. Not only that, but the bellman brought up the keys to the new rooms so we did not even have to go downstairs again. The bellman made sure to get all of our luggage sorted out, gave us a run-down on the hotel's services, put himself at our complete disposal, and was just a friendly as he could be. It is clearly obvious that whomever is providing the customer service training for the staff is to be highly commended: not ONCE did we ever receive anything less that a gracious smile, a hello, and an offer to assist. We also requested a VERY late check out (3 p.m.) and were accommodated without a hitch. AMENITIES: the hotel has a great fitness center with lots of cardio options, headphones for the plasma screen individual TV units, and free bottled water. Also has reciprocity for the full scale fitness club located across the street. Guest rooms have blow dryers, good lighting in the bathroom and elsewhere in the room, full tub with shower, nice toiletries, robes, and an in-room safe. Lighted closet with lots of hangers, and minibar too. There is FREE high-speed interenet access in the room (hard wired) as well as a business center that offers free internet if you did not bring your own laptop. They will also print free pages for you if needed..... Also: the WINDOWS in the rooms open to allow for fresh air ventilation! We love this! The heating / ac unit if very quiet and powerful too. With the windows open there is some street noise (even at higher levels) but we didn't mind. BEDS: comfy, comfy, firm and soft at the same time, duvet comforters, with great pillow choice. Pillows are an issue with me & I usually travel everywhere with my own to avoid vacation-ruining neck pain, but I left mine behind in the interest of packing light. I was not disappointed! THE AREA: The location of the hotel is downtown near the financial center, near the end of the California cable car line and the Montgomery Street BART station. It is very convenient if you are doing business in the area during the week, and much quieter if you stay on the weeknd as we did. Many of the close-by cafes and coffee shops close over the weekend. However, there are PLENTY within easy walking distance (within 10 block radius) that are open all weekend. You can walk to Union Square in one direction and the Ferry Plaza Marketplace in the other direction and be in either location within 10 minutes. Also: this is a SAFE walk and you will not pass by too many homeless (a problem in any large city, sadly). TRANSPORTATION: If you are uncomfortable or unable to walk, the hotel has Guest Cars (town cars) that will happily take you anywhere in the city you would like to go (or back to the airport when you leave, crying). The doorman will let you know the cost BEFORE you get in the car, and the price is comprable to taking a cab, and much cleaner. The front desk staff can direct you to and make reservations for you at any of the terrific SF restaurants. EATING: This is a city that runs on it's stomach. For morning (or afternoon) lattes & cappucino, we would recommend a stroll through North Beach with a stop at \"CAFFE PUCCINI\" near the corner of Columbus & Vallejo (next to Tratoria Pinnochio). Also, \"MOLINARI'S ITALIAN DELI\" (on Columbus) for sandwiches & the Salami. They make their own & are famous for it. For dinner & lunch, we would happily recommend \"BOULEVARD\" (great location, fantastic food & service, very pricey) as well as \"YANK SING\" (dim sum, extended lunch hours only, including weekends, great food, traditional cart serving, moderately pricey depending on your appetite, delicious). In addition, if you go over the weekend, you MUST go to the Saturday Morning Farmer's Market at the Ferry Plaza. This is not to be missed, and go hungry, as you will be able to eat everything from pastries to tamales, with coffee bars, cheese, fruits & veggies. Definitely worth a stop an a beautiful weekend to get your picnic fixins on your way out to Angel Island, Alcatraz, or the Marina District or Golden Gate Park. Whew! Thanks for reading through to the end. I hope that if you stay at the Omni, you will be as pleased as we were.

I normally opt for affordablility over luxury, but sometimes you just want to be pampered and are willing to pay a little bit more. For those occasions, you can't go wrong with Omni. They understand the what a true luxury hotel experience is all about. At Omni, the customer is always right, and the customer's needs always come first. Case in point- my room key did not work upon check-in (they had given me a room that was still occupied, oops), and when I returned to the front desk, they upgraded me to a 2-room corner suite for my trouble, apologizing all the while. This was followed up with a personal note of apology from the front desk manager the next morning - and a fresh fruit basket in the afternoon, again gratis. The suite (room 920) was gorgeous, with a sitting room, 2 flat-screen TVs, and a DVD player. One of the nice things about staying in the Financial District is that it's very quiet at night - no sirens, ambulances, etc. I joined the Select Guest program several years ago. As others have noted, I highly recommended joining for the free perks. I enjoyed the complimentary beverages (choice of 2 - try the coffee and hot chocolate together!) and morning paper, and was pleasantly suprised to find that this Omni also offered Select Guests a range of reduced-price breakfast items along with the complimentary morning beverages. For $3.75 each, we ordered the breakfast burritos, which were hefty and delicious, served with fresh salsa. Imagine - a delicious room-service breakfast in SF for under $5!

Not to mention - the pillows sucked! The so called feather pillow must have been stuffed with ping pong balls! I am not some princessy woman, but it is ridiculous that a woman travelling alone should be expected to remove her own huge bag from the back of a cab when arriving at a hotel of the caliber of the Omni. Especially while the doorman stands there commenting how the driver isnt a nice guy for not removing the bag. Then the bellman standing at the bottom of the steps watches you carry your bags down them instead of asking to help (or pointing out that the ramp to nowhere does eventually lead to the lobby). But the worst - was when I asked the doorman to call a cab for my return trip to the airport and he suggested I take the house car \"for a couple of dollars more.\" Trusting the doorman at an Omni wouldnt scam me, I jumped in the house car.

I booked directly through the hotel website so that I could make a special request for a crib, as well as give them my Select Guest number. When we arrived, the crib was already set up and waiting in our room for us, together with a handwritten note addressing us by name and welcoming us to the Omni. There were a few baby toiletries tucked away into the crib, as well. I do recommend applying for a Select Guest number (you can do this online) beforehand, as it entitles you to a few amenities including late checkout. If you do it well ahead of time, I think they might send you a 50% off coupon and free room upgrade, too -- this happens either a few weeks after you apply or else a little after your first stay. (I'm not sure which, as we registered and made our booking at the last minute.) You can also buy these coupons on ebay, and they're fully transferable. (It says so on the coupon.) This might be very worth your while if you're staying for several days. If we had known about the Omni ahead of time, we would have planned ahead to get this. You also get free morning beverages in your room for all the people staying -- 2 beverages per person. We had 2 adults and our two children (ages 3 and 1) and got coffee for 4 and orange juice for 4 every morning, for example. You need to remember to put the little Select Guest hang tag, which they give you with your key, on your door ahead of time to receive this. You will also get a morning paper (you choose which paper), as well as a scone-like cookies and milk every evening with your turndown service. The room is fairly standard for a hotel room but quite comfortable. The bed linens are good quality, and the bathrooms are very roomy and marble. Everything is spotless. I was surprised the towels were not softer -- they're thin and not very comfortable, but they're serviceable and clean. We did request a room upgrade if they were available, and I was disappointed not to be upgraded for free (they said I could pay an extra $100 for a suite), but I certainly wasn't entitled to this so that's fine. That is the only disappointment of our Omni experience, and it is extremely minor. We had two small children with us, and the Omni is fantastic for families with children. The kids got a great goodie bag with crayons, activity books, playing cards, and even a small digital clock that they could hang from their coats or suitcases. My 3 year old was delighted with the bag, and she can be a tough customer! You can also request a \"Kids' Suitcase\" from the front desk, and this is literally a small rolling suitcase full of things like an Etch a Sketch, electronic games device, card games like Go Fish and Old Maid, and several classic books (Goodnight Moon, some kids' chapter books). We had a babysitter coming in one night (not associated with the hotel) and found this suitcase extremely handy for the night we were away from the kids. You also are given free kids' straw cups that you can take down to the restaurant to have filled for free. We filled up with milk for the kids every morning and night, and they were fast and gracious about it even though we weren't staying for dinner or breakfast or anything. All the service people were wonderful (with the exception of one woman who was just a bit brusque working the front desk at night. She wasn't rude though, just minimally helpful). The doormen were great. Bell service was instantaneous when we called for it. I had to ask for housekeeping to clean up a spill once, and they came to the room within minutes. The doormen refused our tips. Oh -- and I was wary because I had read that the parking fee was $45 a day. When we pulled up, the valets asked us whether we preferred the $45 hotel parking or wanted to park ourselves at the garage a half-block away, for $7. There was no pressure at all, and they were not at all condescending. You can park at St Mary's Garage at the intersection of California and Kearny for $7 per in/out on holidays and weekends. It's very convenient, and the hotel told us about it themselves.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cI love this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "sista_mills", "ReviewID": "UR5769664", "Content": "Just got back from a stay at the Omni.

There was always a staff member near the elevator to answer questions on your way out the door. A doorman was always present and even got us a car service back to the airport at a great price.

Positives: Location right on California Street provides a short trolley ride up to Chinatown. Actually, you can walk to just about anywhere in SF, so ride the $5 trolley only if you have to. The room was great, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was huge (upgraded room), and they had free high-speed internet. Negatives: The staff was a bit pretentious. I work in IT and at the time I didn't have to wear a suit and tie like most of the business travellers there. The bellmen would open the door for anyone walking up, but they would just look me up and down like I didn't belong. I learned to take the side entrance on Montgomery so I could skip that whole uncomfortable feeling. The onsite steakhouse is average at best. The glazed carrot that they serve with every steak oozed it's glazing onto my steak. Not the best taste combo. For weekend travel you might find a better place to stay. The Omni is in the Financial District, so a lot of stuff is closed during the weekend.

I decided to give a try for our family vacation, considering someone in the family is usually picky about hotels. The room was very clean and well equipped with everything, including bathrobes. The marble bathtub was sparkling and the bed was very comfy. The entire staff was very nice. The room was serviced twice a day, and a complimentary beverage was delivered in the morning - with our choice of beverages and delivery time. There were two computers in a small room at the hotel lobby for guests to use the Internet though the guest rooms also have free high-speed Internet. Overall, I had better experience at the Omni than I had in other 5 or 4-star hotels I\u2019ve stayed in SF, thanks to its personalized service. All the good things you read from the reviews are true. Besides service, another reason we picked the Omni is its location. It is in the middle of everything and right on the cable car line. It is two blocks from Chinatown \u2013 very convenient for getting fresh Chinese pastries in the mornings. A few advices if you decide to stay at the Omni: (1) Sign up for the Select Guest program before you make the reservation. You can read the benefits on omnihotels.com. (2) Take public transportation (BART/MUNI) instead of renting a car. If you have to rent a car, rent it in the city and try to return on the same day, since overnight parking can be pricy. I like the MUNI Passport (for 1, 3 or 7 days), it is convenient if you ride cable cars a lot (we had to do that to make our 3-yr-old happy). (3) The hotel is big on great guest services, not on impressive architecture (like the Atrium of the Hyatt Regency) or in-house amenities/activities (such as a swimming pool) which is not a problem since it is close to many attractions anyway.

The Omni was a top notch hotel, very elegant,comfortable, welcoming and fantastically friendly staff.

The cable cars run outside so you can use them and tick it off of the list of things you must do there. We had a late flight and asked if they could store our cases so we could do a bit of shopping but they insisted that we keep our room on until it was time to go at no extra charge.

So, i want to return the favor and put in my 2 cents since i was able to save a lot of $$$. First off, if you want to do a weekend getaway... I would suggest Sat, Sun and check out Mon..instead of Fri-Sun... the biggest money drain is the parking...$45/night...if you park at St. Mary's parking...it is $30/nite..M-F...but only $6.50 during weekends! So...by going on Sat, Sun..you save quite a bit. Ok..the good: Very nice, clean, and classy hotel...service and attitude were top notch...doormen were friendly and eager to help... ladies on the desk were knowledgable and efficient. The room is average size, but the bathroom was very classy. No motel quality here...the shower is tiled natural stone...(marble or granite)...sink was nice granite, and huge framed vanity mirror...fancy shower curtains and nice tiled floor. I hate cheap crappy plastic bathrooms... The bed was a double queen...it was pretty good as well...ive slept in better beds but this will do. Overall the room was very clean and well appointed. Signing up for the Omni select guest is worth it...you should do it well in advance so you get the additional coupons for upgrades and discounts. You must do this in advance to activate them... Location wise...it is very ideal...next to chinatown 2 blocks, 4 blocks to Union square and 4 blocks to Embarcadero center and 3 blocks to columbus ave bars.. china town is up the hill but if you can make it to st. mary's parking lot...you can make it to chinatown. Honestly though, I think getting a hotel by fishermans wharf wouldve been a better location...but then, you'd get a Motel quality place for a Hotel price tag... i chose the hotel...If you have a baby or kids... fisherman's wharf would be a better fit. But if you like bars..i think Omni would be great since Columbus ave bars is just next door...very cool place. Awesome chinese food (dimsum also) at Harbor village in the embarcadero. (order the nobleman's chicken $80..a day in advance. Its called Beggar's chicken in Hong Kong...absolutely amazing) RG lounge is also good chinese food that's walking distance... peking duck is good...but Harbor village takes all the awards. If you like steaks...and not afraid to drop $50+...Bob's chop house is awesome. I loooove steak... breakfasts/lunch is more reasonable.... but they have all the best cuts at night. Defintely worth going to. The BAD.. No swimming pool or spa... after walking up hills and blocks of concrete pavement... you'd want a spa to relax in. None. Bummer for kids. Hotel was sold out...so my select guest coupons and discounts were useless for upgrades...so call in advance. Parking is highway robbery.. they should have discounts for guests.. Overall... it is still a good experience. its no resort...its a business hotel, and maybe not a good pick if you have kids...but if you want a good place to sleep with your wife or girlfriend...close by to bars and great food.

I had researched several B&Bs and hotels through Trip Advisor and decided on the Omni. We got our room for $135 for night one and $140 for night two - woo hoo! I had concerns of hearing outside noise in our room, the location being far away from things we'd want to see (we had never been to San Francisco), and the price of the mini bar. Here is what we found: We never heard any outside noise in our room. I am a very light sleeper, and no outside noise could be heard. The location was excellent! We could get to the Wharf in 20 minutes walking. The front desk will tell you how to avoid the hills. We only rode the cable cars once to say that we did it. We also rode the bus once to Haight Ashbury (Golden Gate Park) which was a very interesting trip. Our favorite section was the Italian District, lots of great places to eat and cool little bars! A very easy walk to/from the Omni. Don't hesitate to ask the front desk how to get places. They are very helpful! The Omni is located in the Financial District, so on the weekends the sidewalks aren't crowded. Finally, we never even opened the mini bar because of some of the reviews that we had read. There is a Trader Joe's close by where we purchased some wine and snacks. From reading a past review I joined (free) the Select Guest Program. This is a must! Just go to --- and fill out a quick form. We signed up just days before our trip. Because I signed up late, I emailed the Omni our guest number just to make sure that they had it on file.

Check in took less than two minutes and upon arriving in our room, found a welcome note on the bed. The hotel was clean and even the smallest request was granted without asking. One example was when going out for our anniversary dinner, it was obvious we were dressed up for a special occasion. Instead of hailing us a cab as requested, he had a town car brought over to take us to dinner, complimentary. A very nice touch! My two recommendations to anyone staying here would be to sign up for \"Select Guest\" so at the very least you will bet a free juice and paper in the AM (and a big discount on a bagel/muffin). The other would be to verify your room size at check in. Traditionally, we have found corner rooms at the Omni to be of larger size so we try and request those. Here, it was an odd configuration (and a bit smaller) with part of a wall impeding the entry. Not a big deal since we probably only spent 4-5 hours in our room outside of sleeping but thought I would pass that along if. If you want a snack, there is a Subway across the street, a Mrs. Fields on the next block and a convenience store just around the corner. We bought drinks there and put them in the ice bucket; ready to drink when we got back from the day. They even added fresh ice when both when cleaning the room and at turndown. Location couldn't be better as we walked to Pier 39, Union Square and a very small hill (more of a grade) up to Grant Street and Chinatown. The bar was perfect for what we were looking for at the end of a long day, not a major party scene and not completely empty. We could carry on a conversation, hear the cable car as it went by and just enjoy the evening. Service was quick and the drinks were actually priced good for a hotel bar.

Two blocks away up on a steep hill is Chinatown located with its many restaurants. There is a Walgreens one block away on Montgomery Street and it is a MacDonalds two blocks away as well. One block away on Kearney Street is a good Thai Restaurant (Bangkoks best). One of the reviews I read about Omni San Francisco said that it was boring and another review says that they should not stay at Omni again because the bar at Omni was not lively enough. If you are in San Francisco and is looking for a hotel there you should party, Omni may not be your kind of hotel. However, if you are like me, that you appreciate a hotel with friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, 24 hours free internet and business service; big, clean and quite rooms, good location, and close to many restaurants, you should consider staying at the Omni San Francisco. I highly recommend Omni San Francisco.", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cA really great experience\u201d", "Author": "dalangdon", "ReviewID": "UR3654272", "Content": "Having worked in the hotel business for ten years in a previous career, I am pretty jaded by hotels and their marketing hype.

It's beautifully and centrally located, just above Union Square, lovely hotel, everything seemed very clean and neat, and the staff was quite friendly. However, there were, in my opinion, three minor strikes against our particular stay. They all felt like problems that wouldn't typically happen, but maybe because there was somebody new & inexperienced on staff or something like that. Nevertheless: 1) Reservations were under my friend's name. She called the day before to confirm. However, when she checked in, they told her that they had scheduled us to stay there on OCTOBER 11, not June 11. ??? Fortunately, she had the confirmation printout and they accommodated us immediately. 2) My friend is highly allergic to animal products, and while confirming, she requested that they remove any & all down products from the room--synthetic pillows & blankets only. Well, when we settled in for the night, she started wheezing, tearing up, sneezing. (She wasn't even in bed yet--we were just sitting around, chatting & watching TV.) Sure enough, they hadn't removed the down pillows or duvet. She called, told them she was unhappy and had to request another blanket, which they brought up immediately. 3) We ordered hot chocolate, and it came up to us extremely... lukewarm. So, the service seemed good, but... some of this stuff shouldn't have happened in the first place. I'd stay there again, but if I had any special requests, I would follow through immediately.
