The experience was awful. The hotel is extremely overpriced, and also has an \u2018unloved\u2019 feeling which is quite depressing. Our room was very ordinary and dated, and also unclean. In the bathroom the paint in ceiling was peeling away, the parquet floor worn, and the telephone and remote control looked like they had never been cleaned. I would perhaps expect this from a budget hotel, but not for the amount of money that we were paid. The first night we had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The waiters were greasy and rude, and we were charged extortionate prices for mediocre food. The complaints could go on and on! There is no way that the hotel is worth four-stars. I would have had a more enjoyable experience in an Ibis \u2013 at least they\u2019re clean and the staff polite. We would have had a better weekend at home, and also saved a small fortune!", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ipswich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAffordable luxury\u201d", "Author": "sammy1999", "ReviewID": "UR47135116", "Content": "We stayed here for 1 night and would have liked to stay longer. We had a junior suite which was excellent value. We had a super meal in the restaurant which was expensive, but then eating out anywhere is expensive now due to the strength of the Euro. The decor and furnishings have a quality feel and the spa facilities looked excellent. The only problem was that we had difficulty finding the entrance due to the one way system.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA little gem\u201d", "Author": "bumpnhustle", "ReviewID": "UR12626865", "Content": "As the title says this is a little gem of a hotel nestled in the small town of La Garriga. I stayed the week before Christmas to relax away from the crowds and this hotel is the perfect place to recharge the batteries. As some other reviewers have mentioned there is little English spoken at Blancafort but trying out the schoolgirl Spanish was part of the fun and was the source of much amusement for both me and the lovely staff. As a single traveller I had plenty to keep me amused, spending several hours in the spa each day. There are some wonderful treatments available and yes they are pricy but come on this is a 5 star hotel! There is also a well equiped gym and a relaxing lounge area. The breakfast was plentiful with lot's of healthy options such as a fresh fruit platter available. I never ventured to the restaurant choosing instead to dine in room. On each occasion the food was delicious and beautifully presented. On the one occasion I needed to report a problem this was sorted out very quickly resulting in a room upgrade. Overall everything I wanted in a spa break.....looking forward to return trip in the summer to make use of the gardens, outdoor pool and outdoor eating area.", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cAlmost great, but watch out for hidden charges (15Euro per day parking)\u201d", "Author": "mark0b", "ReviewID": "UR10032210", "Content": "Gorgeous hotel and surroundings bedecked with modern sculptures. The spa is top drawer, as was the breakfast, although some of the Spa treatments and their prices bordered on the ridiculous (190 euro 50 minute chocolate skin peel) for a 5 star hotel, there was very little english spoken, although the staff were friendly and accommodating.

The Hotel, which was renovated two or three years ago, now is an incredible five star hotel with lots of luxury. The deluxe room (in which I stayed) is very nice, and as I heard the junior suites are incredible! If you want a peaceful place, the thermal center of Balneario Blancafort is the best I have ever seen. The normal circuit lasts 3 hours and you really get very relaxed, swimmingpools and treatments are really great. Also, the hotel is very close to 4 golf courses, two of them opened this year, so If you like golf, or whatever else, this hotel is an excellent place to go.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cspectacular facilities, soso service\u201d", "Author": "Yodah", "ReviewID": "UR5596674", "Content": "We spend a romantic weekend in Hotel Blancafort. The hotel is truly amazing in terms of design and facilities. You smell luxury everywhere. The rooms were among the most stylish and complete I have ever seen. Nice but pricey variety of restaurants, ranging from Japanese to Italian to French. Spectacular outdoor chill-out restaurant. Too bad it's only open for dinner. Room service however took an hour and was cold. The Spa is fantastic and huge. You get lost easily and just trying all the different pools and showers takes you all morning. The outdoor pools and grounds are very well designed and kept. Overall, the hotel is an oasis of peace and has great potential. In general, serviceisn't up to par with the hotel 'hard ware' and needs improvement.

Their response to the lost reservation (which they eventually found) was at best surly and at worse aggressive. Our room was a junior suite which was very ordinary, the pool was dirty and the sun loungers were shabby, falling apart and surrounded by discarded cigarette ends. This must be the only hotel in Spain where you cannot eat lunch outdoors, instead we were directed to a subterranean cafe. The hotel is in Spain so perhaps it is unfair to expect their staff to speak at least some English, every other 5 star Grand Luxe rated hotel we have ever stayed in however, has not had language problems. The Spa tratments were actually quite good, but nothing else was. It proved difficult to order a drink in the hotel bar, firstly because of language problems but more so because the bar was poorly stocked and did not have the usual international drinks normally found in a hotel of this rating. In most luxury hotels when you order drinks they are accompanied by nuts, crisps, olives etc., not so here, I was stunned to be charged 4 euros for potato crisps to accompany my 18 euro drink. Their appeared to be an air of economy about the place, no flowers anywhere, no fruit in the room, a charge to park the car, a charge for internet use and an irritating invitation to leave a tip every time you signed for anything. The hotel looks great on their website but we found it to be dismal and depressing", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent spa & hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5410683", "Content": "I would like to recommend this hotel to everybody.
