The wear and tear underneath the \"renovated\" surface was quite noticeable. A/C though working was quite old. wall control was already broken. The bathroom was annoyingly small. It reminded me of dongga bathrooms at mine camps. There was so little space to put things near the sink. I'm not that tall, only 5'10, but I'm unable to bend over inside the shower without hitting any of the side walls. I'm also able to easily reach the ceiling when I try to raise my arm. The floor tile inside the shower also need some proper cleaning as the middle part was obviously full of mold looking stains. Plus side is they allowed us to check-in early as requested - 8AM. and the location is very accessible. A walk away from most tourist sites in Sydney. Overall, the stay was OK.

However this time things weren't quite as rosy. The main thing driving me mental is the shower, it's small, the soap tray is not good for the type of small round soaps provided because it slips through the grill so easily, and it is placed in about the worst place it could be and I was forever knocking into it with an arm (or shoulder when standing back up after picking up the soap!). It was also loose - no doubt because others keep knocking it as well. The fridge door had one arm basically broken - it stays shut OK, but when you open the door it basically slumps out and down. I noticed noise from other rooms, not really bad but a bit more than I'm used to. A couple of other little annoyances that I can't remember now. On the plus side, it's in a very good location, and it's the best value of the Accor hotels in Sydney. So it gets 3 out of 5 for being good value overall, but no more than that because of the annoyances.

At this point i was travelling with three mates and requested 4 single beds. Upon arriving into the hotel we checked in and the room had two queen size beds...clearly not what we wanted. Brought it to the duty managers attention and he advised he would arrange to have the beds split as we requested. We came back after 40 mins and noticed that only one of the queen size beds was split. Obviously second time around still couldnt get it right. I called reception again and advised we still have an issue, so the gentlemen decided to transfer us to level 2 where the \"room was ready\". Not the case, we had to wait another hour for our room to be ready. What gets me is that i have an email from the reservations department clearly stating we booked and paid for 4 single beds over 9 months ago...and the duty manager still insits they are not responsible. I asked for compensation for all the mucking around,,, and all that was offered was a lousy $20 breakfast on the house. I still dont recall even recieving an apology, my motto is if we pay something i expect to recieve it. What i have decided to do is make a complaint with consumer affairs as i believe the compensation that was provided dosent complement the inconvience we experienced. The only thing i enjoyed about the hotel was its great location smack bang in the heart of sydney. The rooms were okay...but the bathrooms are pathetic, everytime you take a shower you literally have a pool of water around you....whoever designed the bathroom needs to rethink design with logic.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whangarei", "Title": "\u201cIbis World Square\u201d", "Author": "Woolies Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122440503", "Content": "I booked this accommodation direct with the hotel.

The staff were very friendly and helpful (especially George) on our arrival. Check in was quick but no early check in was allowed. Our room was on 15th floor and it was pretty quiet. We didn't hear the lift or the traffic outside which we were greatly pleased. The only noise was coming from the room next door occupied by Chinese tourists. (They are always loud.) Unfortunately our room was very small and basic with average (scuffed and tired-looking) facilities in the room. Having said that our bed was comfortable and we had a good sleep. Our bathroom was big enough but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whoever designed the shower cabin had a Lilliputian in mind. It was almost impossible to turn around in it when inside the cabin. Claustrophobic! The other thing that was not really nice in the bathroom was the toilet seat. The seat was the wrong size for the toilet. Be careful not to pinch your bottom on it. The other thing to be aware of is if you are travelling with big suitcases the wardrobe is not big (not wider than 50 cm I think) with the iron board hidden inside. The iron also hangs on the wardrobe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal wall. There is definitely not enough space in the wardrobe. The walls and door would benefit from a fresh lick of paint as they are scuffed. As in the other hotels, complimentary coffee and tea are provided. But it looks like the Ibis management made sure to be economical and only allocated one tea bag per person per day and even less sugar. I do not think one sugar sachet per room is enough. It would be nice if the hotel provided more sugar and coffee and perhaps a tea selection, green tea, like other hotels do. Unfortunately there was another thing missing- a toothbrush. Most hotels usually provide a complimentary toothbrush. There were also not enough towels. Just two face washers and only 2 thin and shredded/ frayed towels were provided. I do not think that this is enough. The towels were so worn and thin that they were still wet when you wanted to have two showers during the day. To finalise the hotel don't provide free luggage storage for customers. If you are with big luggage and you have a late flight you have to pay $7 for a daily locker. Just as well we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it. Anyways, generally speaking the hotel was good and cheap for a Sydney CBD hotel with a great location. It is located almost in the heart of Sydney. Its location is perfect and you can readily explore Sydney from it. It is within walking distance to the main rail station and definitely in walking distance to the most visited tourist sites: Opera House less than 1 km, Queen Victoria Building approx. 500m, Pitt Street shopping mall about 1km, Hyde Park approx. 300m, The Rocks less than 1km, Chinatown approx. 800m, Darling Harbour about 1,5km, And there are plenty of food places around. We would stay here again just for the good location. PS. After checking out you should check your bank card account. The problem we experienced is that Ibis charged our card AUS $ 50.75 for deposit + bank fee (??). It is 5 days after our check out and this problem still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resolved. This amount is still showing.

The bed was comfortable and the linen clean, the bathroom was kept immaculate (some of the towels were a bit thread bare but that happens in any hotel) and functional. Desk was useful as we had to work as well - could do with some shelves for clothes rather than the wardrobe. The room was pretty quiet (we were on floor 8) - didn't hear the lift or the street/traffic outside which I was greatly and pleasantly surprised by. Occasionally heard the other room next to us but only the door closing and I think I was on a smoking floor but that is our fault for not requesting a non-smoking floor. Location is great - 2 minute walk to Monorail, 5 mins to Town Square station so you are perfectly placed to see all the sights and get around. Con- The internet was pretty expensive for a day AUD18.

However we decided to lug or bags around the city until our return that night - and I'm glad we did. 10pm we returned to our hotel and, just as suspected, we were in fact STILL NOT BOOKED into a room (reminding you again that it was a month ago that we booked and paid for the room!). Luckily there was a room spare - queen on a nonsmoking floor complete with mouldy shower base and feisty tiles (we wore our thongs in the shower to avoid contracting anything). Obviously I wouldn't say much for that room either. They gave us no towels and took our soap. The next morning while leaving our room and saw a condom wrapper in the hall. The day after that it was still there. Shows how thorough the cleaners are. I could go on and on about our stay at the Ibis Pitt St Sydney but I think this should be enough to prove my disappointment in this hotel. I would never stay here again and HotelClub have lost all credibility for booking me into this hotel. Just dont even stay here. Walls are so thin you can hear the cleaner changing the bin liner next door. Pay and extra 30-50bucks/night and stay at nice hotel further down pitt st. The area of this hotel isn't very nice (dirty streets + next door to hotel is a 1 hour hotel - its not classy)", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121170607", "Content": "Hi, A staff member entered my room in the middle of the night while i was watching t.v. simply said sorry thought this room was vacant then left and a $50 deposit was taken from my credit card on arrive but has not been returned yet. i have contacted reception but no response.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Darwin, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "lu123442", "ReviewID": "UR121014804", "Content": "After reading the mixed reviews on TA I was pleasantly surprised with our stay at Ibis.

I realized they had not charged me once but twice for the amount on top of the 50.00 deposit that was pending from the day I checked in. When I called back to ask them why I was double charged they explained to me that they charged my card the day prior as a pending amount to ensure they would get their payment. There were two issues with this... isn't this why you take a deposit number one... and number two even after the 111.00 posted to my account, the initial pending amount they deducted is still missing from my account 5 days later. They informed me it would take 5 to 10 business days. I was traveling to Sydney from the US and was on a fixed budget for each day...

Had more satisfactions and fewer complaints than other customers (luckily). I booked the room directly on website 2 months ahead, which offered promotional rate of average AU$134 per night. The hotel location is perfect for foreign visitors. Chinatown, Darling Harbor, major streets with their bus/rail stops, and free bus route are all within 5-15 min walking distance. The free bus (555) can take one to QVB shops, Circular Quay, and close enough to the Rocks, Opera House, Harbor Bridge and Botanical Garden. The World Square Mall is directly across the hotel, where daily shopping for food and meals can be done. Our room has a window that faces the closest street junction and some distant view of downtown. It is comfortably small and everything worked satisfactorily. We made fresh coffee from grounds we brought along, using the electric hot water jug in the room. It could be a bit innovative, by brewing the coffee in separate cups and waiting for the ground to settle down before consumption. It would be nice if a coffee maker or French press is provided. The mini-fridge was cold enough and quiet at sleeptime. The bathroom is brightly lit, with adequate shower stall. The toilet flush tank sometimes got stuck and cannot refill. But we learned quickly how to punch the button repeatly to make it work. The daily room cleanup was OK, except I noticed that the floor was not vacuumed daily. I did not complain since it is a minor thing and we habitually keep the room tidy. If there is a wish list, I would like to see more hanging tools around the room. We took the airport rail (AU$16 one way) to go downtown, and got off the Museum station in 15 min. Walking to the hotel for a few blocks took less than 10 min. But beware the Museum station has no elevator, only 2-3 flights of steps from the platform to street level. I decided not to take the shuttle bus (door to door, AU$14), since the commute time could be an hour or more, hence not practical for departure. The front desk staff was very helpful and courteous to everybody, to the extent that one may have to wait 5-10 min for their turn. After 6 days of visiting and having been familiar with Sydney, I would not pick another frugal hotel if we return in the future.

This stay was not a pleasant stay due to a number of reasons. First the shower floor was not clean and it had mould in the shower. Second the customer service that we received was not the best on the Monday of checking out we had the buffet breakfast I am pregnant and I could not eat the eggs because they where runny. I saw a sign that said that if we wanted different eggs to ask your friendly staff and they will make you different eggs, when I asked the chef said no. So much for your sign if you are not going to make different eggs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the sign up. Third as we were checking out of your hotel the lady that was serving us was not helpful at all she gave me a ticket so that I could get my car from the Word Square car park she said that all I need to do is to put my parking ticket in first then the ticket that she gave me in second. I did what she said and I had to pay $90.78 (but on check in she said that the parking was not going to be more than $35.00) When I got back from getting my car my husband said that I need to pay another $35.00 for parking at the hotel I told the lady that I have already payed $90.78 for parking and she said that she could not help me and that I still need to pay the $35.00 and if I want to try and get my money back I need to talk to the Work Square car park. So now I am out of pocket $90.78 and she was not willing to even help me get the money back after all it was her fault for not giving me enough tickets to clear my parking. I went to go and speak to the lady at the Word Square car park she said that she has issues with your staff all the time with this issue and that I will need to talk to the head office regarding this issue but she also said that I will most likely not get my money back from them either, so now I am trying to get my money back from the Word Square car park. If I cannot get my money back I think your hotel should pay me back after all it was your fault to start off with. So all in all staying at your hotel was a rip off and the worst customer service that I have ever received.

Other than that I can't fault the hotel. The staff were enthusiastic and friendly enough. We knew we weren't staying in the Shangri-La (by the way read my separate review for the Shangri-La), so we weren't expecting anything other than budget accommodation.

[Keep in mind I paid less than half the normal price for the most basic room due to an Accor sale.] The rooms are some of the smallest and barest I have ever stayed in (hence the low price) but when you're dealing with friendly, caring staff none of that seems to matter. Breakfast, which is available at a steep discount if you pre-pay, was simple in a do-it-yourself kind of way and the reminder that even a business man is able to toast their own bread is refreshing and appropriate for the location! It was nice watching families and small groups debate their day ahead, seeking input from dining room staff on buses, museums and everything in between - in many ways this property felt quite homely. Not to harp on about the quality of the rooms but they are literally 4 simple walls with a sturdy-but-old bed with slimline TV high on the wall opposite and a small window in which to judge the outside weather. The bathrooms are tiny and offer only the barest of amenities and the air-con at least 10 years old. However, the taps did not drip, the air-con did not groan and the doors kept all outside noise there, and mine in.

The area is not brilliant but not quite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd though there is an adult book shop a few doors away. It is on the edge of Chinatown. The hotel has a sign on the door saying that you have to use your room card to open the exterior door after 23.00 but at weekends they seem to lock it earlier (19.00). The rooms are small (typical Ibis) and dated but reasonably clean. The bathroom was likewise tired and need of a refurbishment and had a shower but no bath. The room has a fridge (very noisy) and kettle with good supplies (replenished daily) of tea and coffee. It has aircon but the controller was damaged so it was difficult to operate. The plumbing was also noisy and we could hear water gushing through our room in the middle of the night presumably from the toilet of a room above. We could also hear the lift \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ding dong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd although our room was about as far away from the lift as was possible. Yes you guessed it we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep too well here even though our room was on the 14th floor well away from the traffic noise which I think would be bad on lower floors. We booked this hotel on the internet and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book breakfast at $20 each. There was a sign in reception offering breakfast for $12 if you booked and paid the night before. We resisted this also and went to the large Coles supermarket in World Square and got fresh croissants etc and some orange juice and did our own breakfast in the room. On your departure day don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this hotel to store your luggage for free. They have electronic lockers in the basement and each box is $7 for 24 hours or part of. The lockers are not that big so we reckoned we would have required 3 for our luggage. Fortunately check out is 12.00 so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to use them. Wi Fi has to be paid for also. The hotel also has a sign on the desk advising that they charge 1.5% extra on your bill for the use of credit cards which was not made clear on the original booking. I paid my bill part in cash (to get rid of it before we left Australia) and part on my credit card and they still tried to charge me 1.5% for the cash as well. I would not use this hotel again as it was pretty poor and definitely not cheap. I would recommend that the manager of this Ibis takes a trip to Singapore (which was our next port of call) and stay there for a few nights to see how it should be done.

Was a bit worried as I had seen the mixed reviews, however at the special on offer the price was right so I decided to go and see for myself anyway. The hotel is located right in the CBD which makes it very convenient location-wise. Check in was fast, friendly and efficient (by a guy called Michael if I remember well), and even though I was around two hours before the official check-in time a room was available. The room was on the 16th floor and looked out at surrounding office and apartment towers (many of which are much higher than the hotel) and some bits of street below - this part of Sydney has many highrises so long-distance views are practically impossible. By now I was wondering why this hotel has such mixed reviews. My experience was not bad, however having stayed at a number of Ibis hotels both in Europe and in Brazil (but never before in Australia), my expectation of a \"typical Ibis\" in the way I am used to in Europe and Brazil was not met. Whilst the room size (room 1603) was similar to Ibis hotels elsewhere, the room lacked the standardisation and modernity of other Ibis hotels I stayed at. People from overseas who expect a \"typical Ibis\" may thus be disappointed. A few items in particular that caught my eye and that would be quite different in modern overseas Ibis hotels include the carpet, which in this hotel is of a colour and pattern on which every stain and blemish is visible; the tiles in the bathroom, which are typical of older Australian bathrooms with a lot of grout between them which was not sealed off so it tends to discolour over time in areas which are used, giving the impression of being dirty (darker grout where people walk, and lighter towards the edges; although from the smell and clear presence of detergent I am sure my bathroom floor was pretty clean); tiles which have a top surface that is probably for anti-slip purposes, but which can give a \"greasy\" sensation when soap or detergent is on it; bathroom lighting which was strange, in that the light near the mirror was halogen (which shows all skin blemishes and thus is \"unflattering\"), plus placed too far back from the mirror so shaving is a bit of a \"catch the light\" exercise; a shower head that is fixed in place and cannot be turned; toilet flush buttons that have to be pressed with force quite deeply and held there to flush the toilet. Other than those items which are essentially fairly major interior design flaws, I had no serious problems with my stay or the room. The bed was comfortable with crisp sheets, there was a working desk area (with the usual-for-Accor comparatively pricey Internet connection which I did not use), a cupboard to hang suit and shirts, a small fridge and a mid-size flat panel TV which however in my room did not work (I don't normally watch TV, tried to switch it on just to see what it was like, the red light on the TV was on and stayed on, the remote blinked a green light, but nothing happened). The air conditioning was weird with one heatpump-style outlet and one ducted-aircon style outlet. The heatpump-style one was old and not working but appeared to be switched on. The air came out of the ducted outlet. However despite setting the temperature to 16 degrees the room was never much cooler than around 22 degrees. Sufficient, but not really as it should be. Room service was OK, a Nepalese girl was very friendly and changed the towels and the bins when I saw her in the corridor and asked her to do this, even though it was not a room she was supposed to service. On the last day an hour before checkout time one male staff member barged into the room one second after knocking, surprised I was still there, apologised then did it again half an hour later. Staff training clearly needs to be improved in this area (knock, wait for people to answer before storming in). Overall conclusion: acceptable hotel, not a true Ibis in my view, staff are friendly. Some things (like the carpet and most items in the bathroom) appear to be less clean or are less functional than they should be due to bad choice, and age of, materials used. To make it a true Ibis they would need to do a full refurbishment, ripping out the bathrooms as well as most of the room interiors and replacing them with Ibis-standard materials which have a cleaner and more modern look, etc. I would stay here again for its location, but the if I can find a similar hotel down the road for less I would stay there - the hotel does not have any particular appeal (also because of its lack of Ibis brand qualities - image of smooth cleanliness, highly standardised design, modern - which is one of the reasons I normally choose to stay at Ibis hotels).", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAn average hotel for our trip to Sydney\u201d", "Author": "Park2010", "ReviewID": "UR59166545", "Content": "We travelled to sydney as part of our honeymoon for New Years. We've been to Oz before but as backpackers and thought it fitting to return for our honeymoon. When I booked the hotels across Oz in January 2009 I wasn't quite prepared for the astronomical prices that were to be charged in Sydney over New Years. But of course it is an extremley sought after destination around that time of year. If I knew then what I know now I would have done it differently. For example we arrived 30th December for 3 nights. Our charges were as follows: 30th December $239 31st December $479 1st January $149. The 1st January charge is generally the average cost for most nights accomodation. You can see how much it jumped up over New Years which was to be expected but my advice.....on New Years Eve day and night we were never in our room. The hotel did have a storage facilit y for luggage at something like $25 a day. What I would have done.....booked on the 30th and 1st January only. Put luggage in storage for the 31st and saved $420!!! You can easily stay up all night in Sydney on New's Years. Even if they charged more on New Years for luggage storage it would still be cheaper than what we paid. Aside from that rooms were ok. Small and basic but ok as a base. Its a good 25 minute walk at a fair pace to the harbour area so if don't like walking dont book that far out. There is a train stop reasonably close by as an alternative. The surrounding area has some nice Irish bars but not alot else. The hotel itself was reasonably quiet. The breakfast area which we only used once, wasn't the nicest but enabled you to eat.
