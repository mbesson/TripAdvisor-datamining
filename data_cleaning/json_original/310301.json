{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Small but can find good budget plan Stayed this hotel due to budget reasons for some time and some nights.This hotel is belonged to typical business hotel in Japanese English, so that room , bed, bath  toilet is definitely very narrow. You can find . If you are travelling alone with little baggage, it's quite okay , the hotel location is very convenient for many major railaway or bus access to go around in Tokyo. Example : You're arrived in Narita airport , and switch to JR (Narita Express) and arrive to Tokyo station, and switch to Yamanote line and 3 stations , you're already at Hamamatsu-cho station , you just walk 8 minutes to hotel ( or one meter taxi costs around JPY 700 - 800). Accessing to Haneda airport is also convenient with mono railway.Breakfast charge is excluded and fee is JPY 600, but you can find other food in convenience shop near by for saving money and time.Hotel staffs are very friendly and some of them can provide reasonable response but you can't expect them to have very fluent English communication. Anyway, their attitude is maintained very good level.Location of hotel is very convenient but there is not many hot point of sightseeing (only Tokyo Tower, etc.)", "Date": "Jun 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR491700686", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ken_Boon_Yam"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d310301-r16921229-Shiba_Daimon_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "310301", "Price": "$197"}}
