As for the smell - there are no words to describe it - a sewage smell was the closest we can get. The \"penthouse\" on the top floor was even worse. We could not bring ourselves to walk on the carpet it was that dirty and kept shoes/slippers on our feet at all times. The wallpaper was flithly and hanging off. The window was so dirty you could not see out of it and the handle to open and close the window was handing off, the second night it did break and we had to sleep with the window open. The shower/toilet was really small and again the wallpaper was hanging off. The toilet handle was hight above your head was again broken. The smell again was seeping under the door and we tried to spray perfume on the pillows at night to cover the continual smell. There were continuous banging of doors throughtout the night and we really got very little sleep over the 2 nights.

The room was very basic and the cleaning was still being done even though we did tell them what time we would be arriving. The only downside to the room is that they are not en-suite and we had to walk down a flight of stairs for a shower or the toilet and to be honest they were clean but could do with modernising. There is some storage space but not a lot however we were only there for just one night so didn't take a lot anyway.

I went back to the reception to let the man know I didn't want the room. He was on the phone for ages and totally ignored me. So I left the key on the counter and walked out.

It is in desperate need of renovation (it looks nothing like the pictures on the website). Our room (8) was dirty and shabby. The furniture was a mix of rickety old tables and a dirty desk. The tv didnt work properly and there was no remote control. The over bed light was a rusty desk lamp screwed to the wall. The sink in the bedroom was dirty and rusty and covered in fag burns. Our double bed was awful due to the fact it was made up of 2 doors which nicely stuck out from under the mattress! Now for the best bit, the shower room. It was filthy. The toilet would not flush, the bowl was black, as was the floor. The shower was no better, it was covered in mould. You had to lift the whole door up to get it to close ( that is if you were brave enough to get in it ). The window also would not shut and to stop people looking in, it was covered with newspaper. Unfortunately the breakfast wasn`t any better. It was run by 3 girls who could not speak very good english, and they didn`t think twice about arguing in front of the guests. The food was very poor, i could only recommend the toast. Overall i can not give this hotel more than 1 out of 10.
