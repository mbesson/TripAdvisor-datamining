{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not worth the money!! We thought we'd stay at the Ubud Village hotel over The Christmas period this year. The website was impressive and the rooms looked good. Because it was xmas we thought we'd splurge and pay for the super deluxe room with outdoor Balinese bathroom, private villa and breakfast thrown in. It has been a real disappointment. The room was only surface clean, the hotel has not looked after it well. It all looks a bit musty and run down. There is building work going on too, which starts at 8am even on Christmas morning!! The room has no charm to it. There are insects everywhere and no mosquito coils are provided for outside areas. Things regularly fell out of the roof onto our mosquito netting during the night. The bathrom had no hooks to hang our towels on and the towels wer small thin and greying badly. There was no shelf in the shower for shampoo etc and the shower head was partly blocked. The air con worked but was not nearly strong enough to cool the room down. The breakfast was poor quality, very little choice, reheated and terriblr stewed coffee or tea despite having an ILLY cofee machine which was never used. Overall it was a real let down and especially as our room was $189 a night, we satyed at the Intercontinental in Jakarta which was much superior, for less money!! Not really recommended, certainly not value for money.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR283649358", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JontiDenHaag"}, {"Content": "Great hotel and location Great location on Monkey Forest Road, close to good restaurants like Cafe Wayan and Lotus Lane.

This hotel has a great location. I stayed at this hotel last year and it was in much better condition. This year we really noticed it was run down. We stayed in one of the Villas both times we stayed at Ubud Village, this time for 3 nights. We bargained down the price to $120 from $150 (USD) per night. And we are glad we did! The Villas are much nicer than the regular rooms since they have the traditional style outside bathrooms and beds with the canopy etc. The room comes with the optional use of 2 robes they provide hanging in the closets. They smelled like mold, so we didn't use them. I also had huge puffy eyes the whole time i stayed here. I think i may have been allergic to all the mold. Anyway, the hotel seems to not have enough pool towels, and the chairs outside are falling apart. There is no staff working the pool bar, massage tables, and no staff working the pool at all. I know it is the low season, so maybe that is why. The free breakfast is ok, but we did leave and eat at another excellent restaurant (Wyan's cafe) next door one morning. Also, the breakfast staff seem extremely unhappy to be working there! They seem unhelpful and annoyed when you ask for things or help.", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR410518581", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "advisor22SanDiego"}, {"Content": "Hotel Hell Booked this trip through Sayang Holidays. Bali is great, but Ubud, not so much. This is our saga while in Ubud:1st night, no sleep because villa next door played music all night. Roof is grass, music came right in. Next day we were moved to another room.2nd night, no sleep because AC was loud and bugs fells on our chests while in bed including a 6 long snake/worm from the rotting ceiling above.3rd night, ants fell on us from the ceiling at several times throughout the night. Moved to another room the next morning.4th night, moved to a room up out of the ravine and on flat land. Went to bed, but reggae music immediately started from the bar down the street. Front desk reports this has happened for the last several years and they can't do anything about it. Demand to be moved out of the hotel. They move us to the Ubud Village RESORT, outside of town. Slept for the first time in 3+ days.

As per the previous review we stayed here as part of our honeymoon and in comparison to other hotels (that on average were all 3-star rating)it was dismal.We also had the delightful honeymoon suite of two single beds in the dingiest room in the corner of the property with delightful view of the satellite dish beautifully illuminated by stark flourescent lighting.What was most upsetting was the absolute lack of care from staff to the situation or offer of any options. Only after I became extremely angry were we offered a different room the next day but I hated the fact that I had to act like that to achieve any response.The alternative room was only marginally better- very dim and dank.We spent most our time away from the hotel exploring ubud which is such a fantastic place.This holiday was booked and paid for far in advance and clearly stated we were on our honeymoon.Having returned many times to Bali I would recommend Komaneka accross the road which is more expensive but an exceptional hotel in the heart of ubud.

Anyway, at the Ubud Village Hotel, I stayed in superior room. A few problems I noted were:1. The grubby appearance of the room.It looked great in the picture, but less so in reality. My feet were black with dust after half an hour of walking around, unpacking my clothes. I don't think the floor had seen a mop in weeks. The bathroom towels were ones I would not use in my own home, let alone a hotel. They were faded and frayed from years of use. The bedding smelled musty and the floor mats had clearly seen better days. The toilet smelled of, well, pee. There were two batik-style robes hanging in the wardrobe, but I didn't dare wear them for fear that they hadn't been washed in a while. Also, only 3 coathangers? At US$80 a night, this hotel can afford a few extra.2. The breakfast areaIt's next to the road - which is great, if you don't mind the smell of diesel and the sound of roaring traffic and motorbikes with your tea and toast. On the subject of food, I only ate scrambled eggs. Why? Because the rest of the breakfast food (a minimal selection of three or four items, like overcooked bacon and hash browns) was left uncovered and had flies buzzing around it. The bread (only brown and white slices) was luckily covered. The staff on duty were, in my opinion, too young, untrained and unmotivated. Everything was an effort for them. I arrived one day for breakfast at 7-30am to find that the milk had run out and no-one had bothered to buy any more. When pressed by another guest, a staff member went out to a nearby supermarket and bought some. Come on, it's 7-30am and there's no milk?? 3. Middle of Monkey Forest RoadDon't be fooled. It's a long, long walk to Jalan Raya Ubud - the main street with the best restaurants. The Bali Spirit might be further out, but it provides regular free transport right to the centre of town and back again. The location of the Ubud Village Hotel is definitely not worth US$80 a night.Conclusion: I have no idea what justifies the US$80 a night price tag when other hotels provide a lot more for a lot less. A little investment in towels, bedding, mats, cleaning materials and breakfast equipment would not go amiss.I wouldn't stay at the Ubud Village Hotel again - not unless it gets its act together.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR360553688", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great hotel in Central Ubud We stayed at this hotel in February 2005. The Ubud Village Hotel is a great place to stay if you want luxury hotel features (which in Bali means things like air-conditioning) while being near the center of town, rather than staying out in one of the more isolated destination resorts (like the Four Seasons at Sayan). Many/most of the luxury hotels are outside of Ubud village center -- places like the Four Seasons at Sayan (a 10 min drive away). The Ubud Village Hotel is on Monkey Forest Road about a 5 min walk from Ubud Center (the Ubud Palace) so it's very centrally located. Price is also better than the other full luxury resorts; we paid US$80/night for two, which included breakfast and taxes. The hotel itself is a beautifully designed, small tropical resort (this is an intimate place, not one of those enormous resorts with hundreds of guests). Rooms are large and spacious with air conditioning, cable TV, minibar, etc. The bathroom is outside in its own private little patio -- half open to the sky but very private. Rooms are accessed through outdoor walkways and individual courtyards. Rooms are far enough back from the road to be very quiet. Construction is a modern interpretation of traditional Bali materials -- wood and stonework. The landscaping is beautiful, with an interior courtyard with fountain and a lovely swimming pool. The hotel has several pleasant covered bar/seating areas. The hotel serves breakfast but I don't know if it serves lunch/dinner. Laundry service and some spa services are available. Outside of the hotel -- you are steps from several nice bars / restaurants right next to the hotel (Bali Pesto, etc. -- see www.balieats.com for restaurant recommendations). If you're willing to walk 5-10 minutes, you have access to literally dozens of shops and restaurants of all types in Ubud. There are always several performances in Ubud at night (Balinese dance, puppet show etc) and you can walk to the venues from the hotel. A short taxi ride (there are always drivers hanging about, asking if you want transport) will get you to any of the locations that are too far to easily walk (including the museums, Elephant Cave/temple, and other shops/restaurants/resorts in the greater Ubud area). The only potential downside to this hotel was the outside bathroom, especially at night. This is the tropics, and sometimes when we went out into the bathroom, we found a caterpillar or a few ants or a flying bug or something in the bathroom. This wasn't a big problem for us, but if you're the type of person who can't stand bugs at all, then you might want to go for a hotel with an interior bathroom. Also, this doesn't seem like a great hotel for families with small children -- there's not much for kids to do, other than play in the swimming pool. This is more of a hotel for adults looking for a quiet restful place.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR406625110", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "hibachi"}, {"Content": "Decu de n avoir pas ete au courant       Le restaurant", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR880632066", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "christseilh"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5110\u9289\u7b3a\u5062\u68f0\u3123\u4f04\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\ue0a0\u5120\u9289\ue0fe\u5142\u9289\u5908\u5136\u9289\u7b3a\u4efe\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120       \u9289\ue0fe\u5066\u9289\u693c\u5061\u9289\u0441\u5142", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR874079685", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "youhin"}, {"Content": "\u5bf0\u6393\ue122\u9287\u0443\u7af6\u9350\u546e\u668e\u7edb\u6825\u4eda\u9288\u5b28\u4f04\u9287\ue0a6\u4efc\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u7ed4\u5b2a\u6e74   showReview(19955729, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR192830926", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u936b\u5b58\u588d\u9287\ue218\u4e9c\u9287\u52e9\u4ebc\u9287\u253f\u20ac\u4f75\u20ac\u4f75\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19955617, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR347900310", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bien localizado, pero...   showReview(12730615, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR611733311", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ISAYJAVI"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d552948-r22990870-Ubud_Village_Hotel-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "552948", "Price": "$75"}}
