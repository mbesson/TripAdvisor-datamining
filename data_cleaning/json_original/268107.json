Although I found our room to be recently renovated and essentially clean (aside from a few stains on the carpet), my experience booking the room was so off-putting that I will never return to this property. I called the hotel directly and was connected to a front-desk clerk named \"Julia\" who took my reservation. From the outset, Julia was abrasive. When giving her my address, I tried to tell her the city I lived in, after providing my street name and number. But she wouldn't take it, instead snapping at me that she only needed my \"postal code\", if she had that, my city information would automatically appear on her screen. (OK, but say it politely...) We had the same interaction about my AAA membership number. I asked if she needed the entire number, or my individual membership number only (which is all I usually need to give down here in the old US of A). Again she responded in an impatient, unpleasant tone. Finally we got to my credit card information. I read the number out to her, and as she heard each digit, she repeated it out loud. I asked her not to do this, as someone might be in within earshot, and it's not inconceivable that my number could be copied down and used illegally,. ( In my recent experience in Boston, merchants *never* repeat a card number aloud, as a protection against identity theft.) But Julia would have none of it..instead of responding to my request she told me that \"no one was in the lobby\" so it was all right for her to repeat my card numbers out loud! At that point I told her that I thought she should treat me with greater politeness and consideration, given that I would be spending close to $300 at the Quality Inn in the upcoming weekend. Her response was to tell me that \"she was giving me to somebody else\" and to leave me hanging on the telephone for five minutes! I subsequently called back and needed to rebook all over again, with another clerk. Upon reading a number of other reviews, I note that many other travelers had concerns about the customer service they received at this property. Although the general manager, Mr. Sammy Basaran, listened kindly to my concerns when I contacted him, I would hope he'd invest in customer relations and sensitivity training for his front desk people. Things are hard enough all around without having to be subjected to abuse..as a paying customer.. on a holiday weekend !", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a 5 star, but good value for the money\u201d", "Author": "ThePianoManII", "ReviewID": "UR126161777", "Content": "Pros: If you're looking for a kosher breakfast included with a kosher restaurant in the hotel, you won't find it anywhere, as far as I know, in all of North America except at Passover. Renovations include the front area--looking very nice. Beds: Comfortable! Staff: For the most part, very friendly and helpful. We needed 2 \"pack 'n plays\" for the kids to sleep in--they were brought up within minutes. We asked for more towels to be brought to the pool. Done. Rooms: Clean. Quiet too. Value: We stayed using points so the trip was free, but for just over $100 per night normally, and that kosher breakfast, it has been worth it when we've paid. Nearby: synagogues--2 within 2 blocks, including one with a minyan factory (if you're Jewish, you'll understand), and another kosher restaurant, this one not in, but beside the hotel with excellent fast-ish food (Pizza Pita). Subway (in french, metro) is a few minutes walk away and the subway system in Montreal is excellent. Bus stop nearby to take you there too. The Pool: warm, very kid-friendly (no deep end). Cons: Well, not so much, not if you know you're not getting a 5 star hotel here. 3rd floor hallway could smell better. Wifi did not work on the 3rd floor while we were there and they were not able to repair the problem during that period--if that matters, get a room on a lower level. They DO offer a wire to connect through ethernet connection in the room. Bathrooms: while clean and well functioning, could use a reno. Lack of variety in rooms: No suites available so if you are travelling with kids and don't want to spring for connecting rooms, you're looking at going to bed early at the same time as very young 'uns, hangin' in the hallway or cozying up to your own personal DVD player to watch movies on a small screen with your better half.

Just Don't.\u201d", "Author": "T W", "ReviewID": "UR117684225", "Content": "So, I admit, I do give the benefit of the doubt, and having read mixed reviews about this place, we decided to go ahead and try it. If you are in that position now, please don't do it. I do have some basic standards. Functional bed. Clean towels. No old food on the floor. Five rooms later, this hotel barely met them, and only out of desperation. Please, for the price of a room here, you deserve so much better! (And don't book on a third party website (i.e. hotels.com), because getting a refund or financial compensation is a huge run around.) These were my experiences the ONE night (we originally booked for two) I stayed here. Usually, if the hall smells, and then the room smells the way this room smelled when we walked in the door, I walk right back out. But it was a busy weekend, the hour was late, and I was tired and new to Montreal. I found at first glance the place was maybe OK if we opened the windows and aired out the room, but just wait: 1.) The room smelled moldy. I later found out from the maintenance guy that this is because if the housekeepers \"run out of time\" turning over the rooms, they just leave them. Think wet towels piled up on the bathroom floor. 2.) The windows didn't open. A maintenance guy did come remove the winter-proofing (it was SEPTEMBER!) so that they could be opened. 3.) Because I am concerned about bed bugs, I automatically do the \"luggage-in-the-bath-tub-bed-bug-check\" and while no bugs turned up, layers of dust, a wad of hair, corn chips, a toothpick, fingernail/toenail clippings, one Canadian penny and one US penny, a torn/broken box spring cover, busted bed frame wheel (like, so the bed sank dangerously when I sat upon it. Photos to come.)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and the TV remote did. (Also, the fitted sheet was inside out, minor, I know, but who does that?) The reviewer who mentioned the stains was on point--wallpaper stained and torn in many places, and the grout in the bathtub tiles was stained with mildew--also likely contributing to the moldy smell upon entry. (Bleach? It works.)The staff seemed nice enough, but had that \"I know, but that's how it is here\" look in their eyes. There is only so much they can do. And there is SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. And their computer system was \"not working.\" (I get the sense, in retrospect, it is never working.) As I mentioned before, room one, our bed broke/was broken. (No we were not even doing anything exciting.) And so, we went down and asked for another room. The woman apologized and gave us key cards for a new room that, you guessed it, had not been turned over in I don't know how long! Read: UNMADE BEDS, DIRTY TOWELS ON FLOOR OF BATHROOM, SMELLS LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS' LOCKER ROOM! Room three, third time's a charm, right? Nope. Third room was unclean and had what, to my eye, could have been vomit stains on the wall behind bed (photos to come.) Room four, this time staff goes with us to pick out a room. Room four had missing outlet covers and a BED FRAME THAT DID NOT FIT THE BROKEN BOX SPRING WHICH WAS COVERED UP WITH A SHEET OF PLYWOOD!!!!!!! I started laughing, because if I didn't, I would cry. I cannot make this up. Photos to come. Room five, midnight, enough already, super dusty behind beds, but no fingernails or corn chips and I really was done with the place but was exhausted. Good thing the traffic noise from the highway outside my window was there to lull me to sleep. Also, the elevator stopped working during our stay. The free wi-fi was worse than dial-up, it crashed/weak signal/ just didn't work. And other guests were overheard complaining about having to find parking on the street, as the lot was full and does not have enough spaces for all the guests if they are full--which, by the way, they said they were, and yet they kept showing us empty but unclean room after unacceptable room. And, are you ready for the best part? At 4:10am we were awakened, after finally having fallen asleep on the really old mattress, by someone else opening the door to our room and banging the metal inside lock again and again and speaking very loudly and agitatedly in French. That's right. THEY DEACTIVATED OUR KEY CARDS AND CHECKED SOMEONE ELSE INTO OUR ROOM AFTER HAVING PICKED OUT THE ROOM WITH US! When I called the front desk and asked in a tone of contained rage, \"Who please has keys to my room and is trying to enter at 4:10am?\" it was 4 or 5 sentences into the excuse making before the guy even apologized. Don't stay here. Just don't. Three point 5 stars, they are certainly not. What they are is DIRTY, disorganized and outrageously cheap without being inexpensive. I'm sure some manager will respond with damage control comments instead of actually taking care of the problems at their establishment. Just ignore.
