The location was great (although the hotel itself was somewhat difficult to find at night- just keep following the signs!). The rooms were nice, if dated. There didn't seem to be too many guests when we stayed, which was probably a good thing, because the walls seemed paper thin (we heard EVERY noise in the hallway and adjacent rooms). But, it also meant great parking spots in the attached garage. It might also have affected the hot water, because it needed to run for quite awhile before it got hot enough to shower each morning. The worst part of the room, for us, was the Sleep Number bed. We were very uncomfortable and barely slept during the two nights we stayed. This is most definitely a personal thing, but I will be making an effort to stay away from Radissons because of the beds! The front desk staff was courteous and friendly. The housekeeping staff member who took care of our room was very pleasant- although she didn't leave new towels in my mother-in-law's room after cleaning it. She needed to call down to the front desk to have them delivered when we returned to the hotel that evening. All in all, it was a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay (despite the no sleeping!).

When I arrived directly to the Lord Baltimore they had no knowledge of the shuttle between the properties. I ended up taking 2-$30 cab rides each day between the Lord Baltimore and the Cross Keys. When I arrived at the Cross Keys the front desk said they did have a shuttle but it run a couple time per day to the hospitals and inner harbor on a set schedule. The morning runs are to the hospitals and the first service to the inner harbor area does not leave the Cross Keys until 9:30 am so I took cabs for 3 days. My room was spacious, parking is free and there is a connected shopping center for browzing (Chicos, William Sonoma, a cafe etc). I received an email survey after check out and commented that although my room was fine I would not have booked at the Cross Keys while I had downtown meeting without having a rental car and only did it because central reservations assured me that there was a free shuttle. Although at check in and check out I was only given an verbal apology, I was pleasantly surprised to have the hotel manager issue a credit to my hotel bill for the cost of the cabs ($ 140) in response to the email survey. So overall the room was good and if you have a car and do not need to stay in town the hotel is fine and the follow up customer service was great.

Got in late and the signs to the hotel aren't well lit. The hotel is in a shopping center, so it took a bit of wandering through the parking lot to find the door. After checking in, we were met at the elevator by a manager from the bar who took us around to the freight elevator, telling us that the regular elevators were all broken. Got in the room and it was late, so went to bed. Next morning I realized the heat had been broken all night (it was freezing), the fan in the bathroom was broken and the light attached to it was falling out of the ceiling. The wireless is technically free, but throttled unless you pay to have a faster connection. On the positive side, the sleep number bed was nice. We had reserved a king room but were put in a two doubles room. We were pretty tired at check in so we didn't bother switching, but I'd imagine the sleep number would be even better if the bed were bigger.

The hotel is average and, as other reviewers have noted, in need of a update.

Not only does it seem dated, but it looks like it hasn't been kept up properly - it's not just an issue of styling, it's dilapidated as well. Altogether, it makes it very dreary. Two things that are not helping: 1)there's a musty smell (especially in the rooms, and 2)the elevators (which inexplicably look far older than the rest of the building) are iffy, having been sllloooow when we first checked in, and completely nonfunctional later in the trip. The rooms are a bit odd. Pretty spacious, but decorated with a strange timber/wood motif that seems totally out of place in Baltimore. The bathrooms are small, and the shower was very, very dark. The construction must not be great, because we could hear people in the halls and other rooms much more clearly than in most hotels. Also, there was not individual heat/AC control; while we could pick a temperature, we could not opt to switch from heat to AC or vice versa, because the units are not in each room. It was strange, and not really a problem for us, but it's just another thing that needs to be renovated and could be frustrating in certain times of the year. We discovered that our room/linens had not been cleaned before our arrival (which, alone, is enough for me to say with certainty that I would not recommend this place, nor stay there again), and getting it fixed late at night was a bit of a fiasco. Customer service was hit-or-miss, and we were given many false promises about rectifying the situation. It is in a nice little tree-filled area with good restaurants (Donna's and the Village Square Cafe were both delicious), and the parking is free.

The hotel benefits from free parking, and free shuttle to the inner harbour which is a big bonus. Down to the hotel, the bar is totally inadequate althought the staff especially Corey is great. There are no draught beers, and it is pricey. The net result is that its void of atmosphere and customers.. The food at the bar and restaurant is very good, especially the new york strip steak which is a good as youll get in Baltimore. The hotel reception , bar and restaurant, and all public areas, are stuck in the early 90's, it is dreary, and tired, and way overdue for a refurb. The rooms are sizeable, and the sleep by number beds are very comfortable. The decor is again stuck in the 80's / 90's and is tired and dreary. The baths do not drain properly. Things are being maintained, for example in our room the TV didnt work, (but was replaced) im sure the TV's are worth more as antiques. The telephone didnt work. On our floor, the ice machine, and vending machine didnt work. At the end of the corridor was a bucket holding water from a leaky roof, although I know from last years visit that it was re roofed. There is free wifi which works well. The bathrooms although some have been retiled, still look tired , dreary, and old fashioned. Im told that the hotel is in line for a 7 million dollar re fit, this is well overdue. Customer service. In previous visits I had no complaint, but standards have definitely slipped, especially at the desk. In previous visits they couldnt do enough for you, now they are inflexible and some are quite rude, others are great. The day before the end of my visit i received a bill stating I was leaving on that day, I contacted the desk, by phone, and they stated categorically that I was leaving today, but they would match the rate given by my booking agent opodo. The receptionist even had the audacity to tell me to check my flights in case id made a mistake there too. My travel document clearly stated my check out date. Later I visited the desk to query this further, and asked them to check their records and showed them travel documents. They refused and I wasted a further 45 minutes in an arguments. In the end the inflexible receptionist (female, late 20's, slim-same person I spoke to on the phone) re checked their system and discovered an error by the check in clerk. I received no apology even though we missed a day trip to Washington as a result, I contacted Radisson customer service twice by email, but have still to receive an apology or even any response.
