It is also very near to the 'pier' (the boats park there) where you can board to Nusa Lembongan.The bathroom is not so good. After i took a shower, the floor of the bathroom were wet.

This is a boutique hotel only 24 rooms in all. We had a fabulous time there. This hotel has friendly staff that always had a smile from the manager to the man who tends the garden. We loved this place because it was not a large hotel and was situated away from the main part of Sanur(5 minutes cab drive). It is only a 10 minute walk to the beach either by the road or by strolling through the grounds of the Inna Grand which saves you the constant questions about \u9225\u6e18eed transport\u9225? Their breakfasts are very limited and due to being part of the over all cost of the room we tended to eat there in the mornings but on reflection wished we had tried places outside of Sri Phala. The evening meals are very nice and they do a nice nasi goreng. Their cocktails list is great however while we were there they ran out of most spirits so it became rather limited at that stage. We spent the first 5 nights in a garden villa and then transferred to the spa pool villa. The pool attached to the villa is not big enough to swim in as such but to just float about in\u9225?very enjoyable, the only downside to the poolside villa was the fact there must have been a club near by and you could just hear the boom boom boom at 2am not enough to keep you awake though. We loved the fact that the main swimming pool was not large and very private. We often walked past the hotels with larger pools by the sea and were glad we did not stay there as the pool is open for all to see and we are rather private people. To our delight the Sri Phala had frogs in the ponds and fruit bats on the second floor of the pool side villa\u9225?all of this just added to the charm for us. There is a very nice resturuant around the corner from the Sri Phala called the Oasis and its got great food, great cocktails and great prices. There is an ATM right outside the front gates (to the left) of the hotel which made life very easy indeed.This hotel will suit those that don't want large hotel. The only things I can say that could have made it better are the rooms are dark, the mini bar is lacking alcohol (but then there is always duty free!) and the TV is very limited but then there is always books and being romantic! We would go back to Sri Phala.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR259778005", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dinzie"}, {"Content": "Peaceful experience       looking down from deluxe room", "Date": "Sep 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR153265559", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ellen4"}, {"Content": "Sri Phala offers very good quality        swimming pool", "Date": "Aug 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR154306516", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JohanR"}, {"Content": "Less than ideal location The resort is located in north sanur, 8-10 min walk from the beach but 30 min away from the art market and more than 40 min away from prime beachfront diningResort is densely landscaped with plants, some problems with mosquitoes in the room at night even with the room 'sealed'Room is comfortably spacious, slight problem with non-working lamps which the staff fixedBathtub stopper was not working well but we lived with thatOnly one english television channel in HBOStaff service can be inconsistent, food was averageNote: hotel charges 3% surcharge for using credit cards", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR335420149", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Polaroid"}, {"Content": "Loved every minute Just arrived back from the Sri Phala resort after having a wonderful holiday there. Having previously visited Bali five times before we were looking forward to staying somewhere different. We stayed in a a two bedroom villa which was fantastic. The roo was perfectley attended and the staff were superb. Th resort is small and about a 5/10 minute walk to the beach, this should not deter anyone though. Upon arrival we were presented with refreshing welcome drinks and a Birthday cake was awaiting us in the room as it was one of our birthdays. The pool was small though it was more than adequate as we were the only ones at it most days. Saying that though the hotel was not empty. Breakfast is included is you stay here and the selection is good though the toast was more like bread.All in all nothing at all to complain about, had a fantastic time and will return in the future.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR281634749", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bali_babe"}, {"Content": "secret paradise in sanur hi everyone, just back from two lovely weeks at the sri phala resort and spa,the rooms are huge with a huge bed as well, plenty of clothes space, a large enough bathroom+shower.the food in the restaurant is freshly made while you wait wether breakfast or dinner.better than a tepid buffet. the pool is small but adequate, all the employees from manager to the gardener are very friendly and cant do enough for you. the beach is a steady ten minutes from the hotel. from there, there is a walkway the whole length of the bay. there are a few restaurants nearby. we would go back to sri phala if we go to bali again", "Date": "Jun 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR513397961", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "garreen"}, {"Content": "Sri Phala - Peaceful, welcoming, relaxing.
