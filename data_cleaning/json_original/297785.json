We were assigned room 518 with a view towards the parking lot. But who cares? The main attractions of this hotel are the pools that include a \"river pool\" and a \"kiddie pool\". These are well kept. But food at the pool bar is expensive. Since my sense of smell is not very good, I did not notice at first, that the room smelled of mildew. This room has glass windows that do not open and does not have a balcony. Rooms on this side of the hotel do not have balconies so it is impossible to \"air out\" the room. I checked-in while my wife and granddaughter were in the pool (they let me check-in at 1:00 pm instead of the usual 3:00 pm) and after putting away our stuff went to the pool. Later, when my wife went into the room she noticed the smell but we decided not to change rooms so we did not have the hassle of changing our stuff to another room. Bad mistake. I spent the night with a runny nose and my allergy was acting up. At night we had dinner at the local Applebee's which was very nice and more economical than eating at the hotel's El Castillo Restaurant. I say it's declining because on previous occasions the rooms we had smelled fresh and everything was very clean. In this room (518) the bed spreads were stained with what seemed like chewing gum. Also, the wool (?) blankets had little holes in them. The curtains covering the glass windows did not close properly and early morning sunshine woke us up way too early. For our breakfast we did not go to the hotel's restaurant but went to the local El Meson sandwich shop at a nearby shopping mall. We had very good breakfast for a fraction of what it would cost us at the hotel. In all, we found the hotel average and it is a pity because the pools are very good but the room we had was way below average.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "MAYAGUEZ", "Title": "\u201cReally Bad Service at \"El Castillo Restaurant\"\u201d", "Author": "ROMAMAYAGUEZ", "ReviewID": "UR127407247", "Content": "My ex husband and I used to stay in this hotel and every time we visited Puerto Rico used to go almost every day to their restaurant \"El Castillo Restaurant\". I was born and raised in Mayaguez (now live permanently) and I do not know what happened with this restaurant !!! Yesterday, (Good Friday) my cousin's family and I decided to go to \"El Castillo Restaurant\" but the service and food was the worst experience you can have. First of all the person who is in charge to open the door and I guest \"host\" did not greet us. Then, the waiter decided where we are going to sit, he did not welcome us or asked us where we wanted to sit. So, when I told him where we prefer to sit (near the window) he made a comment about is going to be far from the buffet bar !!! ??? The incredible thing was that only a couple was eating there, and the entirely restaurant was empty (1:05 PM) with dead flowers arrangement. No wonder !!! When the waiter asked us what we want to drink (I told him I want a bottle of \"Perrier\" with lemon inside) and I could not believe when he suggested us to get a big bottle of water and forget to order a \"Perrier\", because for him that was a much better choice ! ??? When he came to get the used plates from our table (and believe me, took forever to come), he did not ask if he may removed them, so he started inmediately crossing his arms in between us while we were eating, to pick up the dirty plates ! My cousin and I were talking and this waiter decided to be part of our conversation, so he started to make comments. One of his comments was that if my cousin's son did not study hard enough, he will see him soon washing dishes in that restaurant kitchen ! As soon as another customer came with his daughter, this waiter decided to ignore us and when I asked for the check, I was ignored and had to get up to the front desk, because he was again to busy getting in the conversation with this other customer. My cousin's wife want some coffee and we were waiting 4ever for him to come to the table, while they had in the kitchen three more waiters, talking with a waitress and of course no manager around ! At that point, I got up and decided to pay my bill and forget about that \"as..ole\" ! What is wrong with the people who is suppose to train the employees at this hotel and where is the manager ? What is going on inside the kitchen, while the customers are waiting and waiting for service? Two out of three plates were greasy/filthy. And ... waht a small choice in the buffet bar, so so taste of the food (except for the flan that was good.)

We came from Ponce and therefore missed it. Enquiry got as there eventually. The first impression of the hotel is very good. The lobby is stylishly modern, registration was friendly and efficient. The room was not generous, but adequate. It showed its age by wiring along the baseboard, but it was clean, and so was the bathroom. The room did not have drapes shutting out the sunlight, which proved more of a problem for viewing the screen of my laptop than sleeping in in the morning. Meals in the restaurant were OK, but no better. I would not come here just to eat. I would not come here for the free internet access either. Although the hotel devotes a whole page of its website in applause of its technology, the actual experience is one of mediocrity. Molasses has been seen to run faster than the hotel's data stream. Forget about a video clip to finish before you have to check out. Our room looked out onto the pool system. If we were forty years younger and had brought our kids, we would have had a grand time. As it was, we just enjoyed the view. Unfortunately, that also included a view of PR2 a little further on, which meant that the room was not all that quiet, even with the single-paned windows closed.

We chose this resort because there were rooms blocked off for a wedding that we were attending in Mayaguez. Upon arrival, we were immediately helped by a bellhop, and received fairly polite service at the check in desk. However, from the time we reached our room until checkout our stay was absolutely terrible. We were sharing a room with our two friends (which costs you an extra $50 per night) but the room had only two towels, and only two pillows per bed. The pillows were flat as pancakes. We opted to walk to the front desk on our way to the restaurant. We requested additional towels and 4 additional pillows. After spending two hours at the buffet (which was phenomenal Puerto Rican food, but severely overpriced) we returned to our room to find that we had not yet received our towels or pillows. Finally, around 11 p.m. we received... two towels and two pillows. The maid told us that the resort was full and they didn't have enough pillows to give us four. After falling asleep despite an extremely loud air conditioner, we woke up the next morning and went down to breakfast. Apparently, (if you're in the know) you can get tickets for free breakfast. We paid for ours, despite terrible service and a language barrier issue when we attempted to explain that we were overcharged $5 for our meal. The river pool is absolutely fantastic, but paying $5.35 per tube seems excessive, considering you are already forced to pay a $9 per day \"resort\" fee, not to mention $4.50 for the privilege to park in the cramped parking lot. The free towels poolside are very helpful, and the attendant was the friendliest employee we encountered our entire stay. While at the poolside bar, we ordered a round of daiquiris which apparently are $3 for virgin, and $5 with rum. Ours had no rum in them and we were charged the $5 rate. Unfortunately we did not discover this until much later, as the bar menu conveniently lacked prices. Ordering lunch at the poolside grill was tedious at best, as the cooks repeatedly gave food that we had ordered to people who had waited less time than us, simply because they were yelling at them in very rapid Spanish. Overall, I strongly suggest avoiding this resort, especially if you speak very little Spanish.

After reading Trip Advisor reviews of other hotels in the area, the Mayaguez Resort seemed like our best bet.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend arriving after dark unless you want to drive around in the less interesting parts of Mayaguez wondering if sleeping in the car is a viable option. Parking is not easy at the hotel and self-park is $4.50/day. The hotel looks like a 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vintage establishment that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been renovated over the years. Our room had been updated with new window curtains, bedspread, shower curtains, etc., but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen cotton gauze that had more thread count then the sheets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were terrible. The comfort of the bed was okay and the carpet could stand to be replaced. As with many older hotels, watch out in the shower for flashes of very hot water sporadically and the only electrical outlet in the bathroom was on the wall with the hair dryer plugged into one of the two outlets which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t conducive to charging an electric toothbrush or shaver since they would have to hang from their cords. Outlets were not conveniently located or abundant. We ended up plugging a laptop in the one available outlet behind the desk and the Blackberry in one behind the TV and alternating with everything else that needed to be charged. The AC was very noisy and would keep a light sleeper awake unless the person had been driving around half the night looking for the hotel. The best part about our hotel stay was the Veranda, which offered good sandwiches and local beer and the main restaurant, which offered nice buffet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on some nights. The service was great in both areas. The relatively new lazy river type pool was interesting too and wifi was available there as well.

Do not miss out on the oatmeal which is superior to any other (and I am not even an oatmeal fan) or the white cheese, guava paste and wide assortment of tropical fruits. The breakfast buffet is a great lead-in into the cons. Cons: Our first day at breakfast was August 3, 2009. The ma\u00c3\u00aetre de who seated us was very polite. However, we had a younger, tall gentleman who was going around the room serving coffee. First, trying to get his attention was impossible. Second, when he did come to serve coffee and we asked for separate milk, not realizing that it was Spanish coffee that required hot milk to be poured in by him, he stormed off and literally almost threw the cold mike on the table. From the beginning he never uttered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after we repeatedly said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It became a game to us to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and wait for his response. On the second day he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nice when he was given a tip which was only given to solicit a response from the otherwise stone-faced waiter. Notably, he was very friendly to Puerto Ricans who were speaking Spanish, which I speak and understand. Thankfully, it must have been his days off for the remainder of our four-day stay. Unfortunately, this waiter was only continuing the not-so-friendly behavior of those at the front desk. I am not certain what the criteria for a resort is but this is just a hotel with a pool, restaurant and casino. The front-desk staff, depending on who was there always had a different answer to the question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do I need to keep the wrist-band on?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They will tag you with a neon colored wrist band for entrance to the pool when you check in or does it have to be on at all times? Who knows, they each have a different answer. We did not want to tour the island with the neon colored band. This is not a Disney resort. Everyone was very nasty. Even when you went to the front desk to have it removed, they did not keep track of it or write down what room you were staying in. However, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to stay in the reception desk area because the hallways, including the veranda are open air in the sweltering heat and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll sweat to death by the time you get to your car! The west needs to head to San Juan and take some lessons in customer service. To top it off, the rooms need to be updated. Were they expecting little people? The height of the sinks in the bathrooms are abnormally low. Our room was never vacuumed the entire time. To top it off, we saw and killed a roach in the bathroom! These rooms need a makeover. While they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at it, hire a contractor who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paint on the mirror in the bathroom. Whoever painted last was super sloppy.

The Gereral Manager Mr. Louis Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz has also made us feel at home, I thank him and his staff for a great stay...", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "g2b_raven", "Title": "\u201cworst place on the island unless you only pay 65 a night\u201d", "Author": "g2b_raven", "ReviewID": "UR11545013", "Content": "not the best in the west as they say! paid lots of cash for a bestwestern. say some where close to the beach you will thank me. i was down there for some time. this is not a real resort the room are small no view. the motel just dosnt have much to offer.

Even though the main attraction is the casino, the restaurant was excellent with international and caribbean fares. The wine list was exceptional an has won the \"Award of Excellence\" from The Wine Spectator eight years ina row. The service, was excellent. The Veranda Terrace Bar was a nice place to enjoy a cocktail and a cigar that is made by the owner of the hotel. I will definately stay here again. I felt comfortable and everybody made me feel that I was at home. My home in Mayaguez and Puerto Rico is the Mayaguez Resort & Casino. As for the rooms, they invested over a million (they told me) and it really shows. New bed heads, conforters, shades, furniture and refrigerators. The Room Srvice operates until 3 am. They have wireless internet and altogether the ambiance is very nice. I will always stay here in what the locals call Porta del Sol.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSelect a different place.\u201d", "Author": "1putt", "ReviewID": "UR5557905", "Content": "The rooms were drab & uninviting; a long way from \"luxury.\" Prices quoted for accommodations changed with each different individual at the front desk.

It was rectangular, with good variation in depth from the shallow to deep end. The restaurant had excellent food, but they wouldn't allow any shorts. Other resorts we have stayed at always allow nice shorts, some restrict cutoffs. They had no business center to check email. The casino was nice, lots of nickel machines, so many elderly locals were there. Staff was very friendly.
