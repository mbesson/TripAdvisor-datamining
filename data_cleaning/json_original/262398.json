I find good value in the SpringHill brand and this property did not disappoint. I find the SpringHill accommodations are really not suites, but large rooms and this property would be the same. When I think of a suite I think of the dictionary definition - \" a connected series of rooms to be used together\" but in the SpringHill's I find they are usually one big room laid out in sections - this was not any different. Having said that it was a large comfortable room and the \"suite\" with sink, fridge and microwave is very functional for an extended stay. What really impressed me were the Customer Service skills of the staff. All (and I mean all) greeted you with a good morning or a good evening and always a smile. It was close to Fairmont quality Customer Service and that for me, says a lot. There were very attentive to any needs and the breakfast area was always spotless. They were always replacing offerings and constantly cleaning. Even the manager got in the act when the place was busy. My benchmark is the cleanliness of the liquid waffle machine ( a gooey concoction found these days in most complimentary breakfast offerings) - normally a mess at most hotels. This was consistently the cleanest and most attractive ever experienced. The hotel is close to the Metro Mall and it offers a wide variety of places to eat in the evening. I had no issues at all with noise despite the proximity to Interstate 17.

Rooms have a clothes rack vs. an actual closet and there is a single drawer bureau that doubles as a TV stand. Rooms have a strange shape, which breaks up the room nicely, but also makes it difficult where to put suitcases etc. if you have multiply travelers in your room. The lobby area is going through a remodel which has relocated the breakfast area and business center. No big deal but I believe that hotels should be required to disclose this information to anyone making a reservation.

We got a supposedly group rate, but the rate on the web site was the same as the one we got. It was a good rate, but this was a case pretty much of \"you get what you pay for.\" We do not normally stay in Marriott Hotels, but decided to go with what the group was doing. All in all, it wasn't too bad. We arrived after 3:00 which is supposed to be check-in time, but our room wasn't ready so we had to wait for a bit. They are redoing the lobby, so that area is boarded up. The boarded up area also includes the breakfast area. It seems as though the remodel is to last until December. Seems like a long time for a remodel so it is possible it will be finished before then. Check their web site for information on this if you plan to stay here. The rooms were fine, nothing special but not bad either. They had really decent pillows, which is usually not the case. They appeared to have been updated recently. The breakfast was not worth much in my opinion. They had sausage, what I call \"plastic\" scrambled eggs, waffles and assorted juices, cereal, bagels, english muffins and a sweet roll. Because of the lobby and breakfast area being remodeled, they had the breakfast set up in what used to be the fitness center. So, no fitness center. Also, the waffles were in a separate room which was not very convenient. They have converted two rooms into rooms for eating breakfast and one of these rooms holds what they call the business center--a computer and printer. All in all, it was not a bad experience. I would recommend this hotel to friends, if breakfast was not important. For the price you could probably eat breakfast elsewhere.

There are several nice chain restaurants real close by and it is only about 10 mintues from downtown.", "Date": "November 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "SpringHill Suites Phoenix Metrocenter Mall/I-17", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d262398-Reviews-SpringHill_Suites_Phoenix_Metrocenter_Mall_I_17-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$91 - $128*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9425 North Black Canyon Freeway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85021</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "262398", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/76/0d/760d0ef3f1db4f2dc318bdd402f2bc336large.jpg"}}
