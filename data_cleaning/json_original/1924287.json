The hotel had been in need of a facelift for many years and this has been done 6 months ago. The result is very good. The lobby's new design is very chic and inviting. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic. While on the subject of food, the super-hip Istanbul eatery chain Kitchenette operates almost as part of the hotel and is a great place for people watching. However if there is one thing that this hotel has that any other hotel is Istanbul doesn't... it's the mind boggling view from its sea-view rooms.

It turned out that although I told the receptionist that I was going to stay the night after my check-out, they still sent a guy to my room to check the minibar! 2. I was with a foreign mission in Istanbul and the members of the mission had to change rooms at midnight because of some strange smoke coming out of the air conditioner!

We arrived around 2pm to the hotel and waited in the lobby approximately 3 hours for a room (while waiting we weren't offered drinks or any kind of attention). The room that was being prepared for us is on the 7th floor. While waiting we were the ones who had to follow up with the reception! Not to mention that 2 girls arrived after us and sat next to us waiting for a room as well. They were young russians. They came after us and took a room before us. One of the girls went to the receptionist (short guy with well combed hair) and they started smiling and talking until she came back with a key calling her friend to join her. After that scene, we went again to argue with the receptionist, he made us wait an additional half an hour and then gave us a corner room on the 11th floor instead of the one on the 7th floor stating that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel (Corner rooms are half size normal rooms - we know that because we saw our friends room whom we met in Istanbul by surprise). My guess is that the room on the 7th floor which was supposed to be ours was given to the russians instead. That said, the receptionist was not only a liar but rude as well. Added to all the above, we booked a 5 night stay with Marmara Taksim Hotel INCLUDING breakfast via expedia. Despite that statement clear on the vouchers, the receptionist and the manager (via phone call) insisted that breakfast was not to be offered because it wasn't showing in their system. We argued again for nothing, again waste of time and manners. We ended up paying breakfast 2 times!! (20 Euros per person = 200 Euros for the whole trip). The Marmara Taksim Hotel was lucky because the package that i booked via expedia was non-refundable or else i would have simply left the hotel and booked another one. As for breakfast (which is a bit poor), we are supposed to be present before 10am (or 11am, pardon me for not remembering exactly), but when that hour comes, they remove all the food on the buffet!! even while people are still having breakfast.

While waiting in the reception area, I happened to look out the windows (during daytime) when I saw two men get into an altercation, then one of them ran to his vendor cart, grabbed a pair of scissors, ran back and tried to stab the first guy. He was pulled away, the police were called, and I'll leave it at that. The second concerns the sheer amount of scammers in the area. FOUR different times, over two nights, young men approached me, friendly-wise but soon got to inviting me to go to a bar for a quick drink. DONT FALL FOR THIS. Its a scam, you get charged outrageous prices and are forced to pay them by being strong-armed to a nearby ATM. The police will side with you, if you have the guts to report it, and make them give the money back but who wants to go through this?

We had a suite on the 14th floor, facing the sea. The views are spectacular - requesting a high floor room is particularly important here. The living room had views of old town and the Sea of Marmara, and the bedroom views of the Bosphorus. Too bad there's so much to do and see in Istanbul, because we could have just sat in the room and looked at the view! The suites give you access to the club lounge on the 18th floor, where you can have breakfast (smaller selection than the main breakfast area, but still very good and much more serene atmosphere), or afternoon snack and drinks, again with amazing views. The price for the very spacious and well-laid out suite (2 separate rooms - a big plus with a baby) was a great value compared to international chains. Positives: The views - WOW !!! You even have a view from the shower. Location is good, many restaurants nearby, short taxi ride to most sightseeing, though it can take a while to get to Sultanahmet in traffic. The room was very nicely decorated and immaculately clean, elegant bathroom. Friendly service throughout our stay. Room service, though very pricey, arrived quickly. Breakfast was fantastic. Negatives: The pool is unheated and was a bit on the cold side, also not protected from wind, and for some reason they were blasting club music in the pool area...not to my taste for relaxation. Still it's a good sized and very clean pool. Check-in was a little slow, and we were at first given a smoking room, though they were accomodating in moving us a few hours later once a room became available. It also took a long time and repeated requests to get the baby cot sent up. As someone mentioned below, the bar prices are ridiculous. One of the elevators was out of service, and the waits could get a bit long. Still we would stay here again in a heartbeat, and loved our time in Istanbul.

What was the surprise at check-in: the breakfast is not included. Fortunately, I was holding all the communication. Finally, the hotel management has considered as breakfast included on the next morning only. We arrived late at the night and were upgraded to Bosphorus view corner room on 12 floor. Once we entered to this room my first impression was that we should get out of there on the next day. In general the hotel is really outdated. The room size was one of the smallest that I had ever seen in hotels: not more 14sq/m. There is only 1 small closet in narrow walking hall. The bathroom was one the simplest and dirtiest that I ever seen in so called 4 or 5 star hotel: you may see some pictures taken in that bathroom. The breakfast was not so good: nothing special, it might be richer... We did not use other facilities in this hotel, such as restorant, pool, etc... Some positive points: 1. Good location for public transportation use, 2. Relaible wireless internet access for free and LCD TV in room, 3. really nice views for Bosphorus oriented rooms. Negative poins: 1. Overpriced, I would consoder as maximum 3 star hotel, no more. 2. Really small rooms which are outadated, not comfortable furnishing and lighting, 3. Non-clean bathrooms.. My recommendation: do not stay at this hotel if you expect 4 or 5 stars especially for the rates mentioned.

The hotel has one of the best locations in Istanbul, just at the top of Istiklal Caddesi and right next to the metro and the new funicular railway, which links with the tram system at Kabatas (this takes you to Sultanahmet and on to the airport). The Havas airport bus stop is just across the road. The staff were very helpful, particularly Dunya, on the guest relations desk, who made sure we were looked after. We only had breakfast on one day of our stay, and this was delicious with a good range of choices. If you don't want a full breakfast, there is a Starbucks just outside the hotel and several other good patisseries and cafes in close striking distance. Tips: beware the taxi drivers around Taksim Square. Much to the disgust of most of the taxi drivers, there are a few who are just out to rip you off, and staying at the big five star hotels singles you out as being a good bet. Hold on to your note until the taxi driver has produced the right change and make sure the meter is on day rate (it should show either Gunduz or '1' on the meter). They can only charge 'gece' or '2' after midnight. Nice tip: If you want a nice fish dinner without heading to the tourist traps of Nevizade or Kumpapi, head up to the Bosphorous village or Ortakoy (only about ten minutes/10 lira in a cab). There are lots of nice restaurants - Cinar is particularly good. Other good bets close to the hotel are Changa (delicious fusion menu) and Cok Cok about ten minutes walk away near the Pera Palas Hotel - a great Thai restaurant.

Overall excellent value for money and I would stay there again", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cComprehensive review by an Events Manager\u201d", "Author": "MrBlahBlahWhatever", "ReviewID": "UR20255621", "Content": "In February 2008, I took 350 people to this hotel on an incentive trip, in my capacity as Events Manager within a Dubai-based regional office of a multinational institution. Prior to this, I also pre-scoped the hotel in December '07. In December, I stayed in a standard room, and in Feb, I stayed in a Club room. I stayed at Marmara a total of 8 days, and inspected every room-type. Impressions: The location: CANNOT be beaten; you exit the hotel, turn left and you are a minute away from a very Bohemian-like street called Istiklal Street, which is full of great little street eateries and strolling locals and tourists - a very atmospheric place. You are also reasonably close to the main tourist attractions such as the Sultan Ahmet Mosque; the Hippodrome; Aya (Hagia) Sofia and the Palace Museum. Be warned tough, that the airport is at least 40 minutes away. Rooms: The standard room was adequate and pleasant - probably mid-way between a 3 and 4 star. It was clean, and everything worked. The decor was pleasing enough. Refer to my pics please. Club room is a better proposition. Difference is that you get a flat screen TV, and a few extra little niceties. Do yourself a favour and go for Club. The suits are really good, and are quite adequate for a CEO to stay in, as mine did. They're large, clean, and contain business amenities such as a fax machine; shredder- and the like. Whatever class of room you choose, my advice is to ask for a Bosphorus view room - the view is really worth the extra small charge. Please be warned that if you try to open the windows in the same way that one would open a door, then you're in for a night of open air, as you'll not be able to close them again: the windows do not swing open more than a couple of inches, even though they LOOK as if they swing wide open. Try to yank the window way open, and you'll have a problem. In addition, when you enter your room, check that the a/c is working, as they apparently switch off the chiller at a certain time of year, and you'll just have the a/c fan working. They cannot switch the chiller back on in a hurry either, as it involves some long-winded procedure to be undertaken by the hotel engineer. Bathrooms had marble-top counters; modern amenities in good repair, and were clean. (See my pics). Corridors were painted in a curious bright blue colour that throws out the otherwise nice decor. They need to reconsider this scheme. It struck me as being too \"loud\" and an eyesore. The lobby is nice and atmospheric- it has a regal look about it, and the decor is Turkish. Lighting is nice and relaxing. Lounge is good, and the bar service good too. The hotel contains a pleasant bar -the Tepe Lounge- that overlooks the city lights - I do not recall which floor it is on, but it has a \"Manhattan cocktail lounge\" feel to it - intimate and relaxing. Breakfast buffet is quite ok. Clean restaurant. Food quality fine, but leave the tastless rubber chicken franks alone. Not sure about dinner, as I had roomservice burgers and my dutyfree Jack D. for dessert every night, due to being too busy ;-) Room service food quality is good, and portions pretty big. Average wait time is about 20 to 30 minutes. Reception staff are agile; pleasant and professional. The hotel also has a spa, and although I did not use it, it looked clean and professional, and reports that came back to me were positive. Conference / congress facilities: good conference room. Easily fits 350 pax in cabaret style setup. Projectors and sound good. Modern amenities. Service ethic overall: no complaints. Staff seemed interested; friendly; professional and reasonably prompt. In my subjective view, I like Marmara because its has character, and is atmospheric. I chose it, as I wanted my delegates to have a more \"Turkish\" experience, as opposed to booking them into another \"photocopy\" standard Western-style hotel, to which them and I are all accustomed to. I would like to stay at Marmara again. I rate it overall, as around a four star, but not a \"4-plus\"; probably a \"4-minus\". However, the character makes up for it, I reckon.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest Spot In The City!\u201d", "Author": "TravelingGal62", "ReviewID": "UR20176021", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights in early August.
