We were a bit cautious, so we booked a suite for about 100E more and were not disappointed. While the amennities are limited the free wireless was wonderful, and the morning breakfast delicious and served to room until noon. There is some construction going on next door which starts up around 9am weekdays, but the windows seal out the noise and were on 2nd floor. Henri at reception organized transport to CDG and had many suggestions. We often visit Paris and expecially loved being able to have great English speakers at reception and in management. We found this most valuable. The area speaks for itself. Louvre, Norte Dame, Quai d'Orsay, etc. all a simple walk and the dining within 2 blocks offering evertying from Michelin 2 star to Creperie take-outs.

Very friendly hotel, the people speak English well and are really very happy to help with advice, a taxi, ideas on itinerary, dining reservations and shopping.....anything. \u00a0The staff are just as friendly as many travelers on these TA reviews claim.\u00a0 I had a suite, wonderful windows, two I could open wide up and let fresh air into. All their rooms have windows that open up beautifully, just like the windows in old French movies. The rooms are very clean and fresh. The TVs are modern flat-screens (I found CNN which is in Emglish). There was no dvd player. \u00a0Toiletries are provided, a minibar with the basics, and a safe. \u00a0 The furniture is clean and beautiful. \u00a0 Appoline at the front desk is an absolute delight, as helpful as she is beautiful, with perfect English. Lena is also very lovely and helpful, and it was so very nice to have met her. \u00a0She even made me a coffee late one night. Bathrooms are modern - \u00a0my suite had a long spa bath that could fit two in but is ideally for one.\u00a0 There is a double wardrobe with hangers provided in the suite lounge area and a shelf. There was also a good chest of draws in the bedroom. The back of door to the suite has two lovely hooks to hang jackets on which was very handy. My son had a single room and it was clean and good and fresh with a single wardrobe and a very modern small bathroom, and a lovely window too. If two people sleep in the suite, the person sleeping near the wall would need to bend under/around the TV to get out to go the toilet. In other words, you can walk around easily to get in at one side of the bed but not the other. This is not a problem for people with good mobility. Unfortunately during my stay the building next door was being renovated and I woke to the sound of drilling, electric saws and hammering. This was a disappointment as most of you can imagine, but certainly not the hotel's fault. These things happen. My suite did not have mobile phone reception which was a huge disappointment for me, due to the time difference with my husband in Australia. Our preferred mode of communication together while I was in Paris was lots of text messages and calls. \u00a0We just made the best of it. If mobile reception is important to you, make sure you have a room that does not face the interior courtyard. The free wifi worked perfectly. Attention to finer details is not consistent at this hotel, but this may not be a concern to you. For example, I had no information in my room on how to connect to the Internet, nothing on how/when laundry was collected, or on how to use the phone to call reception. But I just had to ask and I was very nicely told all I needed to know. I personally just prefer to have information available to me in my room and not to have to ask.\u00a0 The maid cleaned very well but left no laundry bag in my room, neither in my son's room. The first day she left one clean bath towel instead of two. \u00a0She (there were two different maids during my stay) left no spare toilet roll on the second and neither on the third or fourth day. If I ran a hotel I'd like my guests not to have to worry (and hope) that they won't run out of toilet paper at an inconvenient time. Again, I only had to ask for a second roll and I got one. I ran out of tissues but just used toilet paper. So no big deal but for the price of my suite, I did not expect to experience these small issues. The hotel is very well located, central to everything....2 minutes from the metro, 5 minutes to the Notre Dame, 1 minute to the Siene, 1 minute to delicious \u00a0crepes - just go to endnof the street moving away from the river, go left at the Irish pub and after 50 metres on the left you come to a street corner with a friendly guy who makes nice crepes.....ask them to put only a little nutella on otherwise they load it on, 5 minutes to the Shakespeare English Bookshop, 10 minutes walk to Ludaree, & Paul's Bakery, 3 minutes to St Germaine des Pres Blvd and probably just a 10 minute walk to the Louve, oh and just 4 minutes to the post office which is very helpful and they are friendly providing you with a box if you need to send things home due to shopping too much :).\u00a0 The main not-so-good was that my room door was opened with a key without a knock on the door, twice. Once by the owner with a maintenance man and once by a older maid the next day. At this hotel you have to hand in your key when you leave, so the hotel staff know very well when you are in and when you are out .....IF they take the time to check. The owner also opened my sons room door while he was sick and had just fallen asleep. \u00a0Same thing happened with a older maid the next day to both of us. My son and I were in different rooms on different floors. For this reason, I feel it was not an accident, it was simply not bothering (or caring) to check with reception about who was in and who was out. For me personally this was an invasion of privacy that I really didn't like and for that reason alone I persoanlly would not stay again. It would be a good idea for the hotel to implement a \u00a0'Do Not Disturb' sign available to guests. The bed was not very comfortable and that was the second deal breaker for me. The covers are wonderful, but the mattress was not comfortable. \u00a0 \u00a0 If\u00a0you like home style service, really friendly personal service, a clean and unique hotel with much character in a great location, and if the little things I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, \u00a0then you will probably enjoy staying in this hotel.\u00a0It certainly does have a personal family feel about it and it's very clean and unique.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Geoff D", "ReviewID": "UR122900155", "Content": "We stayed at Vieux Paris for 4 nights and met friends who were also staying.Wonderful location to visit the left bank attractions and very close to St Michel metro stop.

The staff are very very helpful - just ask and they will accomodate to the best of their means. This 15th Century hotel has what modern 5 star hotels don't - a feel of familiarity, comfort and style. The beat generation poets used this site as their base and home in days gone by, in the coolest shiek area in Paris. You can still feel the cool vibe. Don't expect perfect 5 star amenities in a building that was erected in 1480. Everything here is way better than 5 star - and charming to boot. Room was super comfy, loved the fabric wall papers, the exposed beams, and the size of the room. Breakfast is a must - although french breakfasts are not over the top with eggs and meats, this will start you up for a great day of seeing the parisian sites, or meandering through st germain or the latin quarter taking it all in. We found that any breakfasts outside the hotel were of inferior quality and at least the same price or more. And of course, the best thing about breakfast is having a good chat to Madame Odillard who loves her hotel, and has the best stories and insights into the world. You can't pay for that at an outside cafe; and certainly not for only 13 euro! Also - if you hang downstairs inthe lobby you'll be sure to see some very interesting people - and some very famous guests. You can't beat the great vibe of people and culture.

Remy was the man on duty behind the desk. My French was a little bit broken since I am from the US and I could tell that this annoyed him. I told him that we were looking to book the hotel for several rooms in April. Remy said that all the rooms were booked which is understandable. And of course we wouldn't want to disturb anyone. So, since I had my mother with me in a wheel chair and we couldn't see any rooms I asked him where the best place was to pick up a taxi to take us out to dinner. He then got very upset. Said that we should not have made up a story to see the hotel and wasted his time. My mother left the lobby in tears. He still called the taxi. On the way out I told him that we had come all the way from Chicago to see this hotel. I have a friend who stayed here and had a very positive expieriance. I told Remy that he upset my Mother who is a senior citizen . He yelled at me said that I was obnoixious I am not proud of this but I said he was acting like a cochon and left immediatly.

The room was small (OK, it's Paris; most rooms are small). However, the bedspread was faded and had tattered holes in it. I assume they dared not change it because then it wouldn't match the fabric walls. But come on, when I pay this much per night I expect clean looking linens. My suggestion, go with the white duvet covers that all the boutique hotels use now. It will still match the walls and won't be a gross out. The carpeting was also tired looking and needs to be changed. The towels were large but not white and fluffy. The very small bathroom was clean and updated, but the toilet paper holder was broken and the roll would fly off each time you pulled on it. There was also some dirty grout in the shower. Breakfast was the ubiquitous croissant, coffee and yogurt served in a charming room. The price was a little steep for what we got.

We are 29 year-old working professionals from Atlanta. We like high quality nice things for a good price. We are not overly outdoorsy, but active. We used this trip to get out of our comfort zone. We took trains in between the Italian cities and carried backpacks. It was a wonderful adventure and experience. We visited Paris, Venice, Florence, Chianti Region, Pisa, Lucca, Cinque Terre, Siena, and Rome. We stayed overnight at hotels or B&B\u2019s in Paris, Venice, Florence, Cinque Terre, Siena, Rome. We used the Rick Steve\u2019s guide book series to plan our trip and tried to keep to the suggested trip budget therefore we controlled our cost by staying in affordable accommodations in some cities, but we did splurge in a couple. We also used tripadvior for selecting many of our accommodations. Where we stayed and what we paid: Paris - Relais Hotel Vieux Paris \u2013 206 Euro a night on a special internet deal Venice \u2013 3C B&B \u2013 170 Euro a night w/breakfast Florence - Le Stanze dei Medici B&B\u2013 70 Euro a night w/breakfast Cinque Terre - Manuel's Guesthouse \u2013 80 Euro a night Siena - Pensione Palazzo Ravizza\u2013 170 Euro a night w/breakfast Rome - Roman Residence\u2013 130 Euro a night w/ breakfast & open mini bar & bottle of wine General observations: \u2022 It seems everywhere had a little more noise than I\u2019m used to, but there are many factors for that. First, I am not used to living in a city and we wanted to be close to all the sights and second most of the flooring at the places we stayed had tile or wood therefore sound carried more than if there was carpet. I would not let that deter you for any of these places. \u2022 At hotels you get full service, people to ask questions to all the time because there is someone at the front desk 24/7, but at many B&B\u2019s there is only someone there for a limited time so you must get your questions and dinner reservations in when you check in or first thing in the morning if you would like assistance. \u2022 I\u2019m bias because I spent many hours researching where to stay for our trip, but ultimately felt each place was wonderful in its own way and the most bang-for-the-buck. Paris - Relais Hotel Vieux Paris Location: Wonderful! I would stay there again in a heartbeat! The hotel is nestled on a quiet little street in between all the action of the Latin quarter and St. Germain district. It\u2019s on the left bank extremely close to Notre Dame (night right across, but almost). The hotel is in the old district so there are a lot of cute small streets with shops. I think this hotel and location is why Paris was my favorite city we visited! Room: We were upgraded to the red suite which had a sitting room in it. We had tons of room in our bedroom and in our sitting room. We also had a tub/shower combo in the bathroom which was a huge plus. All the walls were covered in fabric, so this was probably our quietist place for sleep. Service: Was wonderful, everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful! They suggested a wonderful restaurant for us to have a romantic dinner at called \u201cChristie\u201d. The place was modern and classy and fit our personalities perfectly and the food was amazing. Food: We can\u2019t comment on the food b/c we took the advice of previous reviews and didn\u2019t take part in the hotel breakfast Please look at the other places we stayed for my reviews on them.

I can't say enough about how well we were treated and cared for in those two short days. We can't wait to return to Paris and will definitely stay here again. The only suggestion would be to be sure to ask for a room on an upper floor or one that does not face the street.

The location, amenities, and friendly staff of the hotel helped us combine business with a romantic getaway. One of us had to work, during the day, but we both got to enjoy evenings in Paris for a week. Each room in this small hotel (just 19 rooms) is unique. Exposed beams and the occasional wall or pillar of creamy stone reveal the 15th century origins of the building. Our two-room suite with elegant fabric covered walls had all the modern comforts and conveniences, including a small \"garden\" of potted plants outside our window. (Attention history buffs. In an earlier day this was where the \"Beat\" writers like Ginsberg hung out in th fifties.) The suite arrangement worked well when one of us needed to work or read and the other wanted to rest.

To get to work in the suburbs, my friend caught the RER just around the conrner and communted with the rest of the Parisians.

Withing easy strolling distance (about four blocks), we heard a chamber music concert at St. Julian de Pauvre, a jazz pianist to Le Petit Pont, and stopped by the famous English language Shakespeare's Used Books where writers like James Joyce used to work and read.. I can't say enough about the staff, especially its charming owners. Everyone is multi-lingual, and they were helpful with advice about everything from where to get your hair done to recommending and arranging reservations for both business dinners and our own romantic evenings.
