The \"kitchenette\" (a hotplate, kettle, barfridge) had four dinner plates and one breadknife - no cooking utensils, bowls, cups/glasses, cutlery, pots... The master bed was two singles pushed together - no queen/king mattress on top. Very uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi did not work the first day (paying service) On our second day we happened to move the coffee table and discovered old bread/toast under the table. The floor looked like it was only ever swept and not mopped/wet cleaned. For a non-smoking room it stunk of stale cigarette smoke. We asked to borrow a multi-adaptor plug, and despite paying aed10 it didn't even fit the electrical outlets in the room. On our departure we again reiterated to hotel staff about our disastisfaction and were told it was because we \"booked through Expedia\" that we got a lower standard room.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSachin bafna 09422038631\u201d", "Author": "sachinbafna", "ReviewID": "UR114878625", "Content": "Perfect stay for vegetarians,best location-in market,good shopping surrounding. very good breakfast kamat restaurant in hotel,good veg restaurant shivsagar near by.good hotel for family.executive rooms r good.I enjoyed my stay.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNot clean and very basic\u201d", "Author": "maleehah", "ReviewID": "UR111668873", "Content": "Was awlful and not clean the only good thing was it was quite large we stayed in a two bed apartment", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDont go back !\u201d", "Author": "mc2711", "ReviewID": "UR102093532", "Content": "This was one of the worst hotel stays i have had.

I had been there with my in-laws (who are old), and my husband was unable to come along, so it turned out to be a good choice as the staff was great. The breakfast was good, but the selling point for us was the Kamat restaurant right below. My in-laws usually suffer a lot from lack of food alternatives, so this was great. And the food was good to boot, Barjuman was a 10 min away, and the location was not bad, if not great either. Another guest was complaining that the swimming pool on the top floor was dirty, though I cannot confirm this as I wasn't able to go there. There were certain issues such as safe not working (not solved), and delayed room service, but having travelled enough, my husband and I look more at hotels'response to complaints than to the problems themselves. In proactivity, the service came out tops, but they were a little sluggish to react.

Its was arranged by Hari Om Travel and it was one of the best holidays i have been on. The hotel is located on the corener of Mina Bazar, and it was great for 5 gilrs all wanting to do shopping!!!! We had some indian suits made at Dream Girl and were charged around 9 pounds for stiching. you can by some really lovely ready made suits too. My sisters are real pros at haggling so do not be afraid it is expected!!!!!! The hotel was clean and the staff freindly, becuse we went away as a family we wanted to stay on one floor which the staff helped us to do until we were all happy. My Mum and Dad are elderly and they were well looked after and respected at the hotel and in all the shops and resturants we went to. the pool at the doplhine was lovely and a must, go upstairs and chill on the roof top. Mum and Dad both enjoed sitting on the roof terrace too. The best jewlers in Dubai is Kanz at the gold souk. (dont bother with any others!!!!!!) They were fab and we were in there so long they ordered lunch for us!!. Take your old gold and trade it there. We ate at Rongali most night which is a pure indian vegetarian resturant and they had an amazing choice of food. The buffet is a good deal. Again staff very helpul to Mum and Dad. I think if you are Asain and a girl this is a great hotel, and we had a fun time shopping. although thigs are the same price as U.k it was fun to shop. We went on the night cruise and this was great fun, again Mum and Dad looked after, and vegetarain food was lovely. The jeep safari was a blast and we had a giggle the whole time althoughtMum and Dad did not come. You must try the river boats they are cheap and fun. The weather in April was lovely and just right.

For the price the room is well furnished which also includes hot plate, fridge, sink, iron box, locker, provisions of coffee/tea/sugar. About the TV....not good. The reception is relatively small and always crowded. Majority of the crowd is Asian (Indians in particular). The staff at reception barring few could have been more professional. The breakfast is extremly good if you like strict vegitarian Indian food. Catering is done by a group related to a famous South Indian restaurant chain called Kamath Hotel. The location of the hotel is very good if you are looking for quick and easy access to all important parts of UAE. From airport you can catch any bus which reaches Al Gubia bus stand which is very near to hotel by paying 2 AED. Other bus routes to hotel from airport are C1 and C2. A small walk will take you to the creek and by paying 1 AED you can reach Gold/Spice Souk (Diera) by boat within 5 Minutes. Dubai museum (good) is 5 minutes walk and is next to creek. Burjuman Mall (good) is 10 minutes walk away and Careefour (Super market) is next to bus stand. We can reach Abu dhabhi (15 AED), Sharjah (5AED) and all other local places like Jumeira area, Sheik Zyad Road and other malls etc., (flat 2 AED for local travel within Dubai) from the Al Gubia bus stand which is 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

Hotel has studio rooms(ie one bedroom),two room apartments with separate kitchenette & dinning area.Hotel rooms are equipped with fridge,small kitchenette,locker apart from TV & airconditioner. Rooms are reasonable in size.Each room has a window facing the main roads of the area. The hotel has Kamat Restaurant (Very popular south Indian food chain of restaurants). Small swimming pool on terrace & a health club are the additional features of the hotel. Major advantage of the hotel is it is in the centre of Dubai so very convenient to travel around.As it is in little India(known as Mina Bazaar) you will fill like you are in India. At least 10-12 Indian restaurants,majority of Indian brand shops like Raymond,Liberty,Bata, Parthas,Nalli etc.Apart from that it is very near from creek,major bus stand,electronics market,Dubai museum etc. As the hotel is a family hotel & does not have pub,discotheque & theme restaurants it does not have nuisance of prostitutes(it is very common in most of the hotels in Dubai). The hotel is managed by south Indiann so it has typical Indian touch.Majority of staff is Indian & you can so talk in Hindi & rupees as the currency. Problems at Dolphin. Requires maintenance & upgradation of the venue. Noise of the vehicles. Lifts are terribly slow. The kitchenette is basic,while safe lockers does not work. Breakfast is typical south Indian one. Few more continental varieties will give good change in the menu.No eggs are served,so no question of non vegetarian items. Restaurant has very few waiters to serve you & clean the tables.Compared to the occupancy the restaurant is small. Check in time of 12 noon is also problematic as all the flights usually coming from India come in the morning(Nearly 100% guests were Indians,In our case they had given us temporary room to freshen up but got the final room in the evening only).
