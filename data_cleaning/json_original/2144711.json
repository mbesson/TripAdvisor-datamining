The room is pretty but the service is so bad and when we come we ask in reception were we can buy the roma pass and they didnt know even if there was a near tourist office.The only good thing is the place, because is near the underground and the colusseum.

A few minor negatives as summed up below, but in general great value for money!! Positives: * Lovely, modern room with very large bed, good furniture and surprisingly spacious * Unexpectedly we got our own private balcony! * Large modern bathroom * Awesome location! * Staff on reception and at breakfast were faultless Negatives: * Our bathroom had a shower that had no head- height shower attachment, meaning you had to hold the shower head throughout the shower * Breakfast wasnt great (but certainly would be unfair to describe it as bad), as reviewer below some fresh fruit would have been good.

The hotel is clean, smartly decorated and in a perfect location right in the centre of Rome. Our room was a little bit tight but with it being a city centre hotel we hadn't been expecting it to be really spacious. Our room was smartly decorated, had a flat screen tv, a safe and free wifi as well as a very comfy bed. The breakfasts were a standard continental breakfast (I enjoyed them but I've seen from some other reviews that they haven't been to everybody's tastes). However if you wanted, the chef would cook up a huge plate of bacon and eggs to set you up for the day. During our time there, all of the staff that we met or spoke to were helpful, friendly and genuinly wanted us to get the best from our time there.

This was the best so far. Excellent location - close to train station and main attractions, wonderfully decorated inside, free internet, good breakfast by Italian standards, very helpful and polite service. Our room was quiet and had an excellent view on the roofs. It was painted immaculate white and we felt very, very comfortable there. It is such a top-notch hotel in comparison with the 3-star hotels we stayed afterwards - what is funny - since we booked rooms in advance, we ended up paying the same price for the this hotel as we did for the 3-star counterparts. Please do not forget to go to the top floor and get to the roof from there - I think most people don't know about the option - the view on the city from there is very nice.

Not all rooms have that facility Hotel was spotless and had pleasant helpful staff. Typical continental breakfast but there was scrambled eggs and bacon as well. Negative side though, there are no drink facilities in the room so after a hard days sightseeing you cant make a cup of coffee. The bar shuts from 2-5 as well but in 4 days there I never saw anyone using it anyway, probably because it is downstairs and was far too warm to sit for a drink and there are plenty of bars nearby Also no alarm clock in room so take your own or remember to book a wake up call.

The metro station is right next door, and there are lots of nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. The walk from the Spanish Steps took us about half an hour and was perfectly manageable. The Colliseum is 5 minutes away. The rooms were very nice in terms of decor and facilities, however I expected higher quality breakfast - it just seemed like they picked the cheapest possible yogurts and juices, the breakfast just didn't seem well thought through (e.g. the cereal bowls were absolutely tiny, more like jam dishes, and no egg cups for the boiled eggs). On the plus side, they served scrambled eggs and bacon - which is very rare in Italy from my experience! As with the previous review, the aircon did not work for the 2 days we were there, but as the room faced the backstreets, noise wasn't a problem.
