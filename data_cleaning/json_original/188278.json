The floor is so creeky. Very loud. The door handle from the inside is basically falling off. The washroom faucet is not even tighten. The beds are very worn out, does not have the fluff to it anymore. We thought the room was clean until near the end of our stay, we found a used condom behind the bed, but other than that. customer service was great. Very friendly and when we asked for extra towels, it was brought up to us right away. Asked if we wanted to move rooms, for the other concerns, but we were already settled in.

I read reviews of this place and was very weary of my stay, Nonetheless stayed here the Jan 2012 visit. Its quite far out from city attractions but its a good walk..Outside of the hotel looks nice. When i came inside was very small but warm reception area. Was quickly served and the lounge was very nice with Flat LCD TVs hanging around, a small business centre that i couldn't access with my key card but was in a rush so didn't get a chance to access.. Checking in was a breeze, BUT i was not happy with the $100 deposit fee which took a week to credit back on my card.. The elevator area is right behind reception area and its very small elevators, maybe 5 people can fit into one elevator and it takes quite awhile for one to come down. Theres only 2 elevators! Upon coming off to my room which is the 7th floor theres only 10 floors i think for this hotel. The elevator opened up to a dark yet lit hallway which is nice. The key card entry to my room was nice, when i opened to my room i was very SURPRISED the room was very very spacious! Two queen beds very comfy good sleep. Sitting area with coffee table was great for any guests or a drink. The Closet space was very spacious! I was very impressed with the wash room although it was small it was a walk in shower with glass window open-close type. (Watch your step coming in and out as theres a block height) The soaps,lotions, shampoo had this great scent i couldn't stop smelling them! Very impressed good lighting and also they had this fan in there as well where it sucks up odors which is great, The counter space is very tight n small so be aware of that. Overall the room was spacious and great stay for the night may even stay here during a long weekend i was very impressed!! Free wifi internet access and reliable fast speeds as well is a good amenity. Back to the reception area has a neat little Waterfall window thing which was nice to look at. The access area to the pool was a good walk and the pool was very nice. Wasnt impressed with the changing area tho its old needs renovation. I was surprised to see both a steamroom and sauna in one here! They had a great exercise room with all equipment. Some cons were the carpet was very stained!! needed a super scrub or clean.. They just needed to go!! The desk chair was stained and it looked old needs replacement, Need new pillows although i slept well, the pillows were losing the cotton-feathers or something they were worn out??? Elevators being small and taking long to come around. My key card didnt work to access Business Center the line up at reception was long so i didn't bother to ask. I would definetly rate this hotel Superior if they did something about the carpets and pillows, but overall had a great stay.

It was the cheapest 3-star hotel, so we decided to book it. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in the hotel and even more surprised when we walked into the room. Everything in our room was practically brand new. We had a room with 2 beds and there was also room for a couch, chair, coffee table, desk, tv, etc... The bathroom was very nice and updated too. One thing about this hotel is the location. In the day time, it is a great spot. It is right around the corner from the old Maple Leaf Gardens and not too far from Dundas Square. As soon as the sun goes down though, it gets sketchy. I saw homeless people sleeping nearby at 8:00 at night and just some scary looking people wandering around. At 5:00am we called a cab and when it pulled up, my wife and 2 kids went outside. In the 3 minutes it took to get into the cab with our bags, we saw 3 hookers. Not suspected hookers, but full out 100% hookers. No doubt about it. So if you're going to be out late (or up very early) with your family, be careful, but if you're a young guy looking for some girls to waste money on, this is the spot!

If there is one slightly moot point, I would say that they could do with an bigger business centre (basically a room where you can access the net and print out your docs etc)--the present space only has 1 PC and if it is being used when you come down, you have to wait your turn). I could have avoided the wait by bringing my own laptop but couldnt be bothered to lug it around! Another bad point is the restaurant--the menu is spartan and has a knocked-together-last-night feel and the waiting Staff of 1 is not really adequate, but we were the only ones there anyway! We ate at other restaurants nearby, within walking distance again. Being from Europe, my credit card failed to go through their system, which had me almost peeing my pants with worry, but the Staff were very cool about it and said I could pay in cash, which is rarelt done at hotels I've been to.

We arrived at midnight, and were very pleasantly greeted with news that we would be upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite! The service was great (though you do have to ask for a luggage cart and roll it out the back ramp yourself. The main entrances are all stairs.), and the room, though itself bit old, was spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable!! And the decor was very nice and modern. Bathroom of the suite was a nice size, and even the sofa bed was okay. I do have on complaint, and that was it was very easy to hear the people next door and people slamming the stariwell doors because we were right next to the stairs. The people next door were being very loud, and it was very easy to hear exactly what they were saying in on the of suite bedrooms... What I found was that this area is not somewhere I would feel comfortable to walk around by myself at night. However, during the day, we had no problem whatsoever walking to and from Yonge Street (very short walk), and walking right down the street to Tim Hortons. Yes, there are some homeless people occasionally approaching you and yes, we did see one prostitute near the hotel when we first arrived, but that in no way spoiled our trip. We felt very very safe within the hotel, and again during the day, there was no problem at all. If location is one thing keeping you from booking this hotel, I would tell you to book it for its proximity to downtown attractions and its value. (Be advised: they lock the underground parking garage at 12AM until 6AM, so you will need to wait for a worker to open the door if you plan on getting to your car during those hours. Safe, but for night owls, inconvenient.) The Ramada was located just a few blocks from Yonge Street, and we walked there 3 of the 6 days we stayed, and were able to walk all the way up to Bloor, to and down Queens (amazing and unique little stores), and Chinatown was within walking distance. St. Lawrence Market was also right down Jarvis Street, and I highly suggest you plan a day to visit it (so much fresh and unique food!!). This hotel is a GREAT location if you want to be close to the action, but not pay too much for being right on Yonge or smack dab in the middle of that area.

We were in Toronto on a four-day weekend to enjoy a Raptors basketball game. Overall, the Ramada Plaza was a great value for the money and I would stay there again. Here are some comments I have about our stay: - We asked for and got one of the recently renovated rooms. This meant new carpet and furniture in the main room, with a clean modern feel (and firm but comfortable king size bed). Don't expect perfection here, but for the money it was a nice change from outdated, faded and worn furnishings that you'll see in most other downtown hotels with that price range. - As mentioned in other reviews, the bathroom only received a minor upgrade and still shows its age (e.g., older walpaper, dirty tiles, old baseboard heater). That said, everything functioned well and aside from aesthetics, the bathroom was fine. Of course, one has to keep in mind that the hotel is over 75 years old. - We never had a problem waiting for either of the two elevators. - Front desk staff, which rotated throughout our stay) ranged from bearable to excellent. As an example, when we checked in the staff processed us quickly but without much interest. In stark contrast, the next day, we where served wtih a big smile and keen interest by another staff member when we had to report a minor problem...which brings me to my next comment. - Given the age of the building, the floors creak a bit (no problem there - gives it some character), but the walls are also quite thin. Our room was next to the Housekeeping closet, so we frequently heard cleaning carts crashing about (although the cleaning staff were very nice). More importantly, there was a large group of female students (about 19 years old) staying in a group of rooms on our floor and other floors in the hotel. The only problem was that they girls were yelling, laughing and even crying in the hallways until after 1am and starting again at 7am. As I mentioned, the front desk handled this well and things improved, but we realized there will always be a fair amount of noise that you can hear in your room through the hallway walls, etc. I was glad I had packed some earplugs! I've stayed in a fair number of hotels and haven't had this problem before to this extent. (BTW, we found out later that the girls were were on a school trip to Toronto for the weekend to learn \"responsibility\" lol) - Parking is very convenient, but a little expensive. - It was easy to get to the College subway station about a five to ten minute walk west on Carlton St. to Yonge St. On Saturday and Sunday you can use a Day Pass for $9, good for 2 adults, on the subway, street cars, buses, etc. - There's a Golden Griddle 24 hour restaurant closeby on Carleton St. near Yonge St., which we took advantage of since breakfast was not included with our room. - Allan Gardens are directly across Jarvis St. from the hotel. This classically proportioned Victorian park features a beautiful old 1909 glass-domed greenhouse and some interesting varieties of plants from cacti to tropical plants to rare types of tulips, etc. Plus, it's free! - We didn't see any prostitutes or homless people during our stay. as other people have said in their reviews. However, we were usually back in the hotel fairly early (e.g, 11pm). - The hotel has very good rates for a downtown hotel. If you can take advantage of their \"government rates\" then you'll save even more. - We have stayed before at the Days Inn hotel on Carleton St., not far from the Ramada. I liked the Ramada better because of its lower room rates, newer furnishings, smaller size, plus the age of the building gives it a bit more character. - Note that renovations are still ongoing at the hotel. We saw some brickwork being cleaned up on the front of the hotel, and we saw a shipment of new window and floor furnishings arriving when we checked out. I don't think either of these renovations should be disruptive to guests. So, despite the noise problem, we liked our stay at the Ramada Plaza and plan to return for our next trip to Toronto.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cProfessionnal\u201d", "Author": "Audan", "ReviewID": "UR13805085", "Content": "We loved it; Very good service.

We had problems of an embarassing nature with the bathroom, which were sorted out, and then realised we didn't have enough towels or crockery for us all. The room itself was a suite, and from the floorplan, the largest room in the hotel. 2 large bedrooms, with a lounge and bathroom. Plenty of space for luggage and clothes.

The bathroom was small and old, and once the issues were resolved was OK, but could do with a refit.

I took the negative ones with a pinch of salt. When I arrived at the hotel, I realised I made a HUGE mistake not taking heed of the negative feedback which have proven to be true. First impression of the hotel is, the frontdesk staff were very indifferent to me - their guest. I commented that as there are so many steps leading up the main door and exit of the hotel, they need to have a staff to assist guests with heavy luggages. They plainly told me Ramada Plaza do not have any staff like that or any bell boys. When I stepped into the room at the 2nd level allotted to me I was terribly disappointed at the old and aged state of the rooms, and the small space of the toilets. the toilet sits very close to the bathtub (2 inches away), and the window beside the bathtub is about the size of a 15inch laptop. Upon request to change to another room on the higher level, once again, I was shocked to find that the drainage of the sink and the bathtub were not working. I found a pool of water collecting at my feet up to my calves while showering. The water in the sink did not drain quickly, but seeped down slowly. The space was small. I do not know about the other good reviews about how spacious the suites can be, but my room was definitely not conveniently laid out. I felt that they should just remove the tv area, and expand it to a one bedroom space. I saw and experience these in a room that was newly renovated (as conveyed to me by the frontdesk when I told them what I experienced). My goodness - they do need another round of renovation. The hotel housekeeping were nice, but I would not say that of the attitude of the frontdesk staff on duty then. My advice, you can find much better hotels than this at similar rates. If you are looking for comfort to stay at this hotel for more than 2 days... forget it. If you are there to stay on a tight budget for 1 or 2 days... it is still bearable. Please reconsider this hotel. Too bad, I was too distraught to take any photos of the hotel rooms at this hotel.

To begin with, I was impressed with the kindness of the desk staff, particularly Abdul, who was always happy to call a cab for me, because I found it difficult to get one on the street. He was friendly and helpful. Most importantly, I was AMAZED by the HONESTY, KINDNESS, AND HONORABLE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF. There are two people I need to mention first: PAULETTE BOWERBANK AND MARIO who went beyond the call of duty. Paulette found my cosmetic bag, which had a very valuable piece of jewelry and immediately brought it to housekeeping, where it remained until I called. In the past, when I or others have left something of value in a hotel, it disappeared or was reported lost. This piece of jewelry (an antique anniversary ring) is one of my most valuable pieces, so I wasn't hopeful (I told my husband that there would be a 1% chance for me to recover my ring, so you can imagine my surprise when Paulette told me they had the ring). I actually cried when she told me that she had the ring. I was so touched by her honesty and ethics. I rarely experience this kind of goodness --- and have never experienced it at a hotel. I also have to say that everyone on staff was friendly, helpful, hard working, and respectful. I also want to thank JILL CHICO, a manager at the hotel, who is going out of her way to mail me my jewelry. I am so deeply touched by the kindness of these people to whom I am forever indebted.

Well, when we called to see if we would be eligble for the 3rd night, they said that it really wasn't free, it just changed the price. NO WHERE ON THE SITE DID IT INDICATE THIS. Anyway, after a 4 hour long drive to Toronto, we get to the Ramada to be greeted with unfriendly service. Not only did we wait in a line for awhile only for the front desk to take another woman behind us first, the man was very rude and rushed with us. He seemed angry to serve young adults as he was pleasant with the older couple who were ahead of us. We had a junior suite on the 10th floor which was pretty nice. Later, when I asked for directions to the Eaton Centre, the same man at the front desk rolled his eyes and provided me with quick directions. The other staff at the desk were also rude and very unhelpful. The hotel have 2 elevators that are tiny and slow. After our first night, we went down to the hotel's restaurant, Shade, for our complimentary breakfast. There were 2 employees working the floor; one girl who only washed down the tables and a man who waitored. The man was very unfriendly with us and never refilled our so-called 'bottomless coffee' once. The food was not bad. Anyway, after the blue jays game, we returned to our room after the maid had cleaned. Everything appeared fine until I went into the bathroom. The toilet had an odd red ring inside of it and they had sprayed my expensive perfume in the bathroom. When we had first arrived, we noticed our ironing board was broken and thought it would have been replaced; it wasn't. We went down to the front desk to ask for one and the other man working rudely said we should have one in our room. We said we did but it was taken away because it was broken and he gave us a weird look and went to the computer and said it would be fixed. The ice box for the ENTIRE hotel was located on the lower level as opposed to every second level. Another thing, our windows in our hotel room were FILTHY and not properly cleaned. Lastly, upon check-out, the lady working the front desk that day was also unfriendly and gave us incorrect information which screwed up the ending of our trip.

I said, \" Are we sure, this is a Ramada?\" We had driven up from Illinois by van and were able to park it on premises and inside for $18 a day w/free in and out privileges. There was an onsite gym and pool that was just what my husband and I were looking for. The only downside of the stay was the restaurant - we never saw any patrons in there and when it was open (6-10AM and 6-10PM only) there was a funny odor when we stuck our heads in there to look around. No problem though - there were plenty of restaurants around the area as the location was ideal.
