On the plus side, there was free parking and free internet, a decent supermarket within about 100m walk, and a metro station nearby. The bedrooms were quite small but as we had a living area downstairs and the bedrooms were only for sleeping the size was of no consequence. The staff were friendly enough, and the bed linen was good quality. On the negative side, the suite was positively dangerous for our kids: glass stair guard and no stair-gate available, low rail on the balcony outside, filthy rugs and sofas. Housekeeping was a joke. The suite was cleaned only twice per week (policy) but towels and sheets were changed daily, in spite of me asking regularly for them to leave the linen and just empty bins and clean the WCs and kitchen floor instead. In 6 weeks we only managed to get them to clean the balcony twice. The \"fully equipped kitchen\" was also very poorly equipped for anyone wanting to do more than drink coffee or \"cook\" microwave popcorn. The equipment was: microwave, small fridge/freezer, small 2-ring elec hob, kettle, toaster, token cutlery, and 2 pans far too large for the hob. We had to buy our own mugs, frying pan, cutlery, grater, wooden spoon, etc.. In the event that you couldn't sleep due to party noise or traffic noise from Sheikh Zayed Rd and nearby construction sites, watching TV or surfing the web might be tricky. The internet needed regular and frequent re-setting, remotes often failed to work (duff batteries supplied and re-supplied). Very frustrating. Oh, and don't head down to the cafe for a quick snack either. The only occasion on which we ate there, the food (for 4 of us), arrived cold at the table one plate at a time over a 90 minute period. Yuk. One final gripe: the penthouse pool. Access is by lift to the floor below, and then by concrete staircase to the top. For most of our stay, 2 of the windows surrounding this staircase were broken, and the stair rail was loose. Not ideal with a toddler. More often than not, the pool room was like a sauna, and water temperature bath-like. Usually we had to pick up our own towels as there was no attendant, occasionally there were just no towels. Our final swim came about half way through our stay when the chlorine bleached all our swimsuits. When I brought it to the manager's attention he apologised but was unable to compensate us for the swimsuits. We didn't swim again. Overall, I'm trying to rate this place bearing in mind that 6 weeks in ANY hotel with 2 kids would have been a nightmare. I imagine that a much, much shorter stay would have been more enjoyable, given the shortcomings. Perhaps it would also be ok for singles on business. For us, the whole experience was unfortunate and unenjoyable, and although the price we paid for a long-term stay was reasonable by Dubai hotel standards, I couldn't really say it was good value, even for what we paid.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCan get much better in area\u201d", "Author": "sdr1980", "ReviewID": "UR123265272", "Content": "Not bad however 2 things are badly wrong, the first being that they have a terrible terrible band belting out the same awful awful songs keeping the whole place awake all night (till 3am) everynight, quite frankly its not the loud music as much as the woeful standard of \"the band\".

The hotel staff are very helpful and they go out of their way to assist. They still have a lot of construction going on and of course the workers would start very early in the morning, but that can be overlooked as they continue to improve the facilities. About the only complaint I really have is their room service is dependent on food brought in and quite a bit of what is on their menu is unavailable to order. The rooms are immaculate and set up quite nicely. I stayed in the executive studio, and had plenty of room; with a refrigerator and a cook top. There were no plates or silverware available, but didn't really need them as we ate out or had room service. The hotel is close by to the Metro, about a 3 min walk. Quite a few taxi drivers/tour drivers do not know their way to the Mazoon, so it is better if you explain to them that it is across the street from the Byblos Hotel or on the same street as the Layia Oak Hotel as those are more established. I went through an online booking agency, so the breakfast and the internet were not included in the total price. The internet is a bit pricey and not all that great...slow to the point of losing your webpages. As far as needing a rental car, I don't see the need with the closeness of the Metro as well as buses available. The hotel does offer limited shuttle service to the Mall of the Emirates and to Jumeira Beach. The pool is quite small, but the jacuzzi is nice. Overall, if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but have good access to it, the Mazoon is a cheaper option.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cnot as advertised\u201d", "Author": "lilpuddleduck", "ReviewID": "UR118703850", "Content": "I arrived at the hotel about 8am,and was given my room immediately,the staff were so nice especially the cleaning staff,my room was spotless ,the metro is right next to it which is so easy to use,and a little supermarket across the road which also has lovely staff.the downside the hotel was supposed to face the palm,well maybe it did but there is no way you could see it unless you sat on top of the building.we did not have a balcony and did have a problem with the eletrics and plumbing but things were quickly resolved.I would probably go again.the metro is so clean and the a/c works.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha", "Title": "\u201cNothing really wrong, but there are better options\u201d", "Author": "DohaShredder", "ReviewID": "UR115431119", "Content": "The Mazoon had some plusses.

On arrival at around 23 hours ,there was no toilet paper,(which we sent for-did not arrive for 30mins) .The 'room service from the restaurant, meant that we could order,from a local take away, epicurian delights such as Pizza hut and burger king but we had to be quick because it closed by 12am .On ordering we waited an hour for the delivery. Despite being advertised , there was no restaurant, only a basic starbucks,coffee shop. The pool had been closed for all but 1 day of our stay, and no massag facilities that had been advertised were offered. The 3 major reasons for choosing the hotel were not available. The veneer on the bathroom cupboards was peeling off ,the curtain was hanging off the rails,all of which we mentioned but was not address for the whole 11 days of our stay. On 6 occasions we arrived at the hotel around 11pm to find that our rooms, had not been cleaned. On requesting the cleaning we had to wait on each occasion for a mininum of 2 hrs,and many calls later to the reception to have our request carried out. On 3 occasions the bed linen and towels had not been replaced or changed. If any cups & saucers were unwashed they remained unwashed upon our return. The floors were generally not cleaned each day, the safe needed attention from a technician on 2 occasions.

We have contributed on each of our visits to her magazine and it can be said that this time will be the first where the hotel/apartment,has been so abhorrant. It is safe to say that we will never recommed anyone to use the Mazoon, it is shabby,needs someone to act as quality control, and inspire a strong work ethic none of which were apparent during our visit. Without exception, all staff we met in the other hotels,were cheerful, and seemed to love their work and went out of their way to be helpful.

The hotel itself is new, very clean and has the necessary features. It has no restaurant, but offers 24h room service and there is a Starbucks cafe in the lobby of the hotel. The staff where very accommodating and helpful! We chose the Executive Suite as it offered more space and fully equipped kitchen. The only thing missing was an oven. The studio was spacious with a large 4 door closet, big and Comfortable bed, living area, a small dining table, desk, LCD TV with cable etc. The hotel is situated not far from Mall of Emirates in a new neighborhood, Tecom, which is still being built. This has several consequences. A lot of taxi drivers don't know the area but only 1-2 of the major hotels, so you need to guide them. It can be noisy or dusty (no problem with the windows closed). There isn't much happening just around the corner and you have to take a cab anywhere you go. That said, the metro station a few hundred meters away is supposed to open beginning of 2010, so is a small Carrefour supermarket. Once opened it will change the access to the hotel incredibly.
