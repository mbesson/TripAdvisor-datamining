Ancient fixtures, rusty stove, and tacky decorations. While some of this is excusable, the fact that the furniture and drapes were dirty and dusty make staying here an oddysey.

Smaller rooms assigned to other family members were somewhat better, but the risk of being assigned one of the bad rooms makes this a dubious hotel choice.

I was pretty nervous obviously but need not have worried. Yes it is a bit basic but not a disgusting hole as some of the reviews say. Because other travelers have mentioned dirty carpets I have a feeling the apartments are already being upgraded since mine had a newish fake wood laminate hard floor. Pros: nice area (Goya) one of Madrid's better locations; close to everything such as shops and metro; CHEAP as 4 people can stay for 80-ish Euros a night I mean come on. Solid building with nice elevators, lovely marble corridors, and pretty secure with multiple locks and bolts on your door. Cons: mine was noisy due to facing onto busy main street, although double glazing works surprisingly well. Less well cleaned than typical hotel room. NB not implying it was filthy just a little bit tacky here and there. Internet access hopeless at 15 Euros per 24 hours who would pay that. It's true that the reception staff don't seem to speak English and don't bother with you much. This is not because they don't care it is because that's the way things are in Spain and they generally don't speak English much anywhere. The desk people are regular guys not the usual international \"have-a-nice-day\" customer service droids so you just have to go along with the concept that as you are in in the capital of Spain you might have to cope with a bit of Spanish. My stuttering phrasebook stuff was only one step above sign language but seemed to get me in OK. I am not the sort to put up with staying anywhere dodgy but I spent four days here and I was fine. The kitchen is good enough for simple meals and making coffee and the place is generally fairly cosy. I slept on the convertible sofa-bed (see photo) and both this and the real beds were comfortable if a little on the hard side. Apartamentos Goya is not a luxury hotel but it is a simple basic place to stay.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cone of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "capncapncapn", "ReviewID": "UR18033424", "Content": "I'd been warned that this was a budget establishment, but nothing could have prepared me for the uncleanliness of the rooms and the poor manners of the staff.

The hot water was non-existent, when we tried to complain, the concierge smiled and spoke in Spanish only. Seriously rude and only when I slammed my hand down on the counter was a phone call offered to their bookings service. Partial refund offered by them, but the final straw had to be a cockroach walking across our room when we returned that night.

This place was a complete dive. The reception people were cold at best and the room was boiling hot!! The furniture was old, the carpet was filthy and the \"kitchen\" (I use the term loosely) was dirty. Sheets were clean upon arrival but never changed although the towels were replaced daily. The room was dark and grungy and looked out into a court yard that resembled a prison's yard for prisoner's in segregation. Never again!!!! Do not stay here if you can help it. The location is okay (if not a little shady) but it in no way made up for the other downfalls. I would give this place a zero rating if it was available. I am aware that you get what you pay for but this was taking it to the extreme!!!", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Complete Dive!\u201d", "Author": "roeshan", "ReviewID": "UR5017917", "Content": "If I could give this zero dots, I would. I find it hard to believe anyone could review this place in a positive light, and therefore come to the conclusion that the apartments here must vary greatly! The place was a total dive in the worst sense. And it's clear the recpeption could care less. They hardly smile at you coming and going. I'm not sure how things work, if each apartment is let by separate owners and that's the reason for the lack of concern overall, or what, but our place was unbelievably disgusting! The whole apartment was just filthy! The first time we took our shoes off our feet were sticking to the nasty car dealership type \"carpet.\" So sick. And just after a few minutes sockless in the place, our feet were black! So we had a shoes-on policy for the rest of our stay. The baseboards, the kitchenette, the glassware (didn't dare use anything in the kitchenette), the cupboards--it was all pretty grimey. The sheets and towels were at least clean, but that was it. The bathroom was barely acceptable. In addition to the sheer dirtiness of the place it was quite noisy. The walls/floors/celiings are SO thin. And the street noise is pretty bad too (but I suppose that's par for the course anywhere in Madrid)--to say the least we did not sleep well here. On top of all of this the heat was stuck on high and it was hot as hades in there at night. The reception said there was nothing they could do about it--the concern in their face was tear-jerking. The heating unit was also leaking, and the reception only seemed conerned about our not letting that get out of hand--give me a break! Plus there were these random pits under certain places in the \"carpet\" where your foot would sink into--that is not right! It's no wonder they require full payment upon checking in BEFORE you see the apartment. Do not stay here under any circumstance!!! Despite our crummy stay, Madrid was lovely!", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Apartamentos Goya 75", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d312318-Reviews-Apartamentos_Goya_75-Madrid.html", "Price": "$56 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">General Pardinas 13</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "312318", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/97/91/97913a9ad3fc37a8d73397d7063e8aca9large.jpg"}}
