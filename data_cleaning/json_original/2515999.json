The Courtyard Century Boulevard has a nice lobby,free wi-fi, large rooms, 24 hour shuttle and friendly staff. Our request for a late checkout was granted as our flight did not arrive until midnight. We booked the Stay for Breakfast package and were a little concerned when we discovered that there was no full service restaurant.

The room we stayed in was a double queen and bigger than alot of rooms I have stayed in. The only issues were a stain on the carpet that looked gross, they should really clean that asap. I did not like the placement of the bathroom. It felt like the toilet was next to the bed and I don't want to hear whats going on in there. Also, you have to touch the bathroom door handle to get to the sink to wash your hands. I would bet that door handle does not get cleaned. So be aware of the germs. There isn't an exhaust fan in the bathroom either. So ladies make your husband open a window before he goes in there, if you get what I'm saying. The bed could be better and the pillows are no good.

When it comes to service though, the rudest experience I've ever had, from almost everyone I encountered. The shuttles don't come regularly (don't believe for a moment the claim that it's one every 15 minutes). The guy at the valet is rude. Seems to be on his cell phone chatting (at least the three times that I tried to interact with him). The check-in staff are awful. Slow, incompetent, not at all pleasant. The managers are surly, and when I tried to make a complaint about the rest of the experience, were just plain nasty. I can accept a lot of things in order to have simplicity and proximity.

On both occasions, we waited at the curb for a very long time before the shuttle arrived. Other hotels' shuttle busses passed two or three times before our shuttle bus came. Since it happened twice, I don't view this as an isolated instance. Also, when the shuttle finally came, it said it is shared by the Sheraton, Embassy Suites, and Courtyard in order to be kinder to the environment. Our first stop was the Sheraton. To add insult to injury, after we left the Sheraton, the shuttle drove right by the Courtyard hotel and drove several blocks to the Embassy Suites before then circling back to the Courtyard.

Overall, very friendly staff, who will go out of their way to help you out, especially with bags, but then again I guess that gives them a reason to earn a tip from people.

Just find it strange as a typical American hotel having the basin in the room and not in the bathroom, but still, wasn't a problem. Excellent and comfortable bed, had a really nice sleep, short as it was, and they also gave us late check-out till 3.00pm which you usually have to move heaven and earth to get a midday check-out anywhere else!! Had their buffet breaky the next morning, usual and typical hotel breakfast, was filling and didn't make you feel sick like most places.

If you hop on the airport shuttle, make sure you know which one you are going to. I said \"Marriott\" when the driver asked where we were headed, and he took us to the Marriott. Unfortunately, it was the wrong one. Luckily, the other is literally just down the street and our driver was very kind enough to drop us there - I imagine he gets this ALL the time, especially when travellers arrive in the middle of the night. The friendly staff provided our room quickly and we were amazed at how quiet it was inside the lobby, given that the hotel is right beside one of the busiest airports in the USA. When the thick glass sliding doors of the lobby close, the noise stays out - impressive. The next morning, we had a reasonable breakfast for a reasonable price. A chef prepares made-to-order omelettes, which were fresh and flavourful. The rest of the breakfast buffet selections consisted of so-so canteloupe, nice honeydew, and bananas, though I had to ask for some that weren't bruised. The kitchen staff were very happy to get some without hesitation. Again, very impressed. The rest of the breakfast selections were bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and you-make waffles, cereals, oatmeal, bagels, muffins and toast. There was a menu to order from as well. The room was very clean and fresh smelling. The vanity is outside of the bathroom - handy when you don't want a foggy mirror; not so handy when you want to the keep the room light off while others are still sleeping. What is it with hotel showerheads? Do they HAVE to be at chest level?? I'm 6'1\", so I'm not exactly a giant. Though the bathroom has a 8' ceiling, why can't they raise the showerhead up so I don't have to duck awkwardly to shower. The hot water may be generated by an instant-on system. Periodically throughout every shower we had, the water would become scaldingly hot for 3 seconds, then return to normal. It wasn't someone in an adjoining room using the water because it was very regular in the way it happened. It was easy enough to step out of the stream of water for the few seconds it took to return to normal, but the first time it happened was a shock. The business center was accessible and easy to use - and they didn't charge $1.00 per sheet of printer paper, like another hotel I stayed at that week. The exercise room was small, but very clean and well equipped - three treadmills, a recumbant, and an elliptical - all with TVs attached, along with a free weight rack and lots of towels and free water bottles. The room could use better air movement or some fans. My daughter and I made good use of the treadmills and we were pouring buckets by the end of our run. Staff throughout were very friendly and helpful. Front desk staff provided directions to various locations and recommended the trolley / shuttle to Manhatten Beach. For $3.00 (I think), the shuttle will take you to a nice beach, and pick you up later. You can also get dropped off at two small popular malls - all on the same ticket! Great deal!! After our two nights in LA, we were going to Pasadena to see a big soccer match. To reduce travel time late at night after the match, we stayed in Pasadena. Although we had checked out of the Marriott, we came back the following day when we dropped off our rental car next door. We still had several hours before our flight left, and we asked the front desk staff if we could leave our bags in the Bell room. The very friendly staff allowed us to store our luggage and sit in the restaurant/lobby to relax. We had some snacks, hot chocolate, tea, and caught a little ESPN while we prepared to leave LA.

I rely heavily upon your honest reviews in making my hotel selections, and it really pays off. Thank you! I went to Los Angeles just because I wanted to get out of town for my birthday. I stayed at the Courtyard November 11th through the 13th. I love Marriott hotels, and the Courtyard definitely lives up to Marriott's standards. I booked a standard room through a major online merchant's travel service for a mere $108 per night, compared to the regular rate of $199 per night. I love a good bargain! Lynnette at the front desk was very helpful. After I had made my reservation with an online service, there was a long delay (almost two weeks) in the hotel receiving my reservation information, and Lynnette called me when my reservation was entered into their computer system. I had read negative stories about the Courtyard's airport shuttle service, but I figured I could endure that in exchange for staying at the Courtyard. It turns out that those stories were true. When I arrived at LAX at 10:20 a.m., I called the Courtyard and Veronica told me where to stand next to the airport to wait for the shuttle and that it would arrive within 15 minutes. So I waited where she told me to wait, and a few minutes later I saw a Courtyard shuttle whiz by out on the street, not even coming into the airport area to pick up passengers. I called Veronica and told her what happened, and she apologized and said she would send another shuttle. Believe it or not, the same thing happened! The second shuttle whizzed by out on the street without coming into the passenger area. By this time, I had waited almost 45 minutes for a shuttle. I called Veronica again, and she said to take a taxi and she would reimburse me when I got to the hotel, which she did without hesitation once I got there. During check-in, she apologized once again for the shuttle problems, and then offered me an upgrade to a suite on the sixth floor! Believe me, when I opened the door to my beautiful suite, the shuttle problems were worth the trouble! Everything looked like it was new. The carpet and all the furnishings were in excellent condition. It was more like a one-bedroom apartment than a suite. I loved it! It was my home away from home. The king size bed was so comfortable. I enjoyed the flat screen TV in the bedroom. The spacious bathroom was very clean. The suites are $259 per night, so getting it for just $108 was a steal! One really good benefit of staying at the Courtyard is that it is on the route of the free Ocean Express trolley service that the City of Los Angeles operates to take hotel guests to Manhattan Beach Pier and Manhattan Village Mall. Just walk about half a block from the hotel to the corner and stand in front of the Radisson hotel at the Ocean Express sign, and the trolley will pick up there. It's a free ride, but the drivers welcome tips from riders. It's a fun way to see L.A. and enjoy beautiful ocean scenery. You can get a schedule from the front desk at the Courtyard. Meals at the Courtyard are delicious. It always smells so good throughout the hotel. The breakfast buffet has a good selection of foods. I had three different food servers while I was there. Ellvira was my waitress on Monday morning. She was very nice. She told me she has been working there for a year and a half and likes the Courtyard better than any other hotel restaurant she has worked at in the past. On Monday I went on a sightseeing tour of places like Marina del Rey, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive. By the time I got back to the hotel, I just wanted to go to my room and relax, but my electronic key card wouldn't let me in. I called the front desk, and a manager came with a new key for me. This actually happened three times while I was there, but it was taken care of quickly. On Monday night, Francisco was my waiter. What a guy! Great smile and great service. On Tuesday morning, Monique was my waitress. What a difference between her and the other two wait staff. Her attitude wasn't the greatest. I left her a tip, even though she didn't deserve it. Checking out was as quick and easy as checking in had been. Fortunately, the shuttle going to the airport is much more reliable than the shuttle from the airport! I would gladly stay at the Courtyard again, and I highly recommend it to anyone else staying in Los Angeles.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CO", "Title": "\u201cNot the room I confirmed\u201d", "Author": "proudftd", "ReviewID": "UR8502481", "Content": "I had a king bed confirmed, but when I got to my room there were two doubles.

The reason for my short stay was an early morning flight out of LAX. I arrived at the hotel and the valet immediately took my car. Valet parking is only $13.00 per day which is very reasonable for the LAX area. Check in was fast and efficient. I received my preferred room type, a king non-smoking room. The only reason check-in took more that 60 seconds was that I wanted to prepay the four day parking charges. My room was #526, facing the airport to the west. I was a little concerned that it might be noisy, but the rooms are very well insulated. It was a very quiet room. As expected from a Marriott property, the room was spotless and smelled fresh. The room was excellent! It had a layout that I have never seen before. It was quite large with a wardrobe unit dividing the room into a work area and sleep area. The desk was excellent with a good office style chair, complimentary HS internet connection, and a good work light. The only thing missing was easy to reach electrical outlets (they were under the desk). The bath vanity was well lit and had a granite top and a small refrigerator under it. The bathroom had a large tub-shower combination and a great and unique shower head. There were plenty of towels. The king bed was comfortable, but was not one of the new super comfortable Marriott beds. There were five foam pillows in my room rather than the typical Courtyard mix of feather and foam pillows. The bedding was the new style that is changed with each guest. The entire wall next to the bed was windowed. Across from the king bed was a sofa, the bureau, and TV. The TV had the expected cable channels as well as PPV movies. Lighting in the room was excellent. The only thing that I missed was easy to reach electrical outlets. I think this hotel was built just before Marriott started installing lamps and lighting fixtures with electrical outlets in them. I wanted some milk to drink before retiring for the night. I went down to the lobby bar and the when I asked the associate if he said he would be glad to get me either 2% or fat free. While waiting for my milk I noticed several people eating at the bar which makes me think that food is served around the clock at this hotel. Also in the lobby area is a business center and The Market with snacks, soft drinks, beer, wine, and ice cream. I asked for a 4:00 AM wake up call and it came on-time. The bill for my stay had been slid under the door and was correct, including my prepaid parking. Exiting the hotel the valet asked if I needed a ride to the airport and he immediately brought the van around. I was through security at the American Airlines terminal 45 minutes after my wake up call. This is a great hotel if you have an early flight!
