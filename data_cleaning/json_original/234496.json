The area is well lit at night, I was traveling alone and always felt safe. There is a grocery store as well as a pharmacy right accross the street. The rooms are clean, the beds are firm but I found that to be the same in all the hotels I stayed in Italy (4 of them) The shower is very small even for a petite person like me 5.3. The breakfast is good enough, they have 2 different kinds of cold meats, also breads, fruit spreads, cereal, coffee, milk, juices, teas, hot scrambled eggs. What I like about this hotel is the location, cleanliness and price. I stayed there twice because of the convenience. I realized I can find better hotels but that means I need to be prepare to pay a lot more. The staff at the front desk were not very helpful but then I had done my own research prior to getting there so I didn't need to ask for their help, but don't think you can depend on their information to get around the city.

Our room was cleaned well and, even though we were at the front of the hotel, it was not noisy and we got a good night's sleep. yes, there are beggars who sleep just outside the Termini station across the road, and start to make their cardboard beds around midnight, and it was quite upsetting to see but they caused us no trouble, and were gone by the time we had risen. Just a word of warning, the walls were paper thin and we could here next door having a conversation quite clearly! Although my cough probably annoyed them even more! Oops!

Enjoyed my stay thoroughly and loved Rome. Hotel was in an outstanding location - literally directly opposite one of the exits from Termini train station, but not on the seedy side of Termini, or the spot where all the homeless people sleep. A handful of late night trattoria/caf\u00e9/takeaways right next door - one of which we frequently stopped off at for a delicious late night slice of pizza on the way home (can't remember the name - it's the one next to the kebab shop). The included hotel breakfast was poor, but not a concern due to all the excellent and great value caf\u00e9s and trattoria's throughout Rome. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful. Very handy pad of maps at reception too - just tear a sheet off. Rooms were clean (enough), with nice wood floors. Bathroom was a bit small (though nicely decorated with mosaic tiles), especially the shower, but not so much it bothered us. They forgot to leave any soap, and after requesting they never remembered during the entire trip (5 nights) - didn't bother asking again and just used out own shower gel. Shower had a minor drainage problem - we asked them to fix it, and I think they attempted but unsuccessfully - again we didn't repeat the request. Standard double room (on 3rd floor) itself was nice and spacious, although we heard one of our friends who also stayed here, in a single room on the 1st floor, had a very small cramped room. Bed was comfortable enough, but was two single beds pushed together, so not ideal. Excellent value and if it was marked as 3 star it'd match all my expectations. To qualify as 4 star I'd expect it to be a bit cleaner, not have any maintenance issues with the shower, not have basic amenities like soap forgotten - especially after being requested, have services like room service and a restaurant, and a better quality breakfast, and the decor to be generally a bit more well maintained.

Breakfast is served on the 5th floor, there is also a balcony where you can eat outside if you wish. A continental breakfast also, ham cheese, boiled eggs, cereal, fresh fruit daily. Italians do love a lot of sweet things (so there is also a variety of cakes and breads) for me the breakfast was sufficient - but if you're expecting a full English that's not going to happen. To be honest it's was so hot (40 degrees!!) something light was all you needed. My partner who is a big eater also enjoyed it. The room was cleaned daily, with fresh towels - good size shower if your of average size. I can understand why some of the reviews say that it's too small - if you're a large person you may have problems. If you're comparing european hotels with British hotels you may be disappointed - as there is no tea-making facilities (but there's MacDonald's across the road - my partner when out at night to get me my daily night cuppa!! lovely!! You have to remember that it's a small city with lots of buildings and hotels - so you will not get the space that we are use to, for example we stayed in the Travelodge at Gatwick and the room there was far bigger with tea-making facilities and a sofa. There just isn't room for that in Rome. Think about it - how much time do you spend in the room - as long as it's clean and comfortable YOU'RE A WINNER!! We enjoyed it and would come back - actually planning on taking my ex-mother in-law and will stay here again!", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here-Not suitable for families\u201d", "Author": "oscar234", "ReviewID": "UR115046343", "Content": "This was my third trip to Rome and I have stayed at different hotels each time and this was by far the worst.

I want to get you to the top ten on trip advisor!!! Your rates are reasonable, and you include a great deal for your guests as well: Free internet! This is rare in rome! And believe me it\u2019s necessary to stay connected with pre-purchasing tickets to museums and avoiding expensive long distance calls which can start at 40.00 a phonecall. You get a mini bar (of pops and juices in your fridge 2 euros a piece) that is less expensive than going to a street vendor. Good job!!!! Located directly across from the station, main attractions are an easy straight 2 stops away from you via subway, or a 10 euro cab. (or 25 min walk) staff also provide great direction (more on that later) The breakfeast area is quite nice, located in the upper part of this building, is filled with sunshine and views of a pretty arched portion of the train station. The breakfeast is always filled with fresh products and is maintained exceptionally. The rooms are cleaned crisply every day, and I walked in from leaving piles everywhere, to having folded clothes and tidied belongings. The esthetic is also fresh. Marble floors, a surprisingly large hotel that hides its space when you walk into it, Do not be fooled! This hotel is big once you get in an elevator onto the accomodation floors. Bathrooms that are modern also add to this hotel. Colorful mosaic tiled showers that have phenomenal water pressure. A green hotel through and through that saves energy. Motion detecting lights save power as you walk through the halls. This is my favorite part: YOUR STAFF!!!! Not only is your staff fluent in English, they are phenomenal, informative and approachable. I really took advantage of this (being my first time in Europe) I found that the staff was always willing to give a helping hand even when I thought I was asking stupid questions, I never felt intimidated ( like some hotels make you feel) and they offer many tours and services without feeling pressured into doing them. My favorite staff member was a lady working in the mornings. She was really funny and I enjoyed speaking with her I know that there was a female complaining that this was a sketchy area. i must say that almost every area in a big city will have these, even if you are staying at a 5 star hotel. i *do* recommend solo travelers here. be aware of your surroundings and communicate with your conceirge if you are feeling unsafe. .

An old building on the Via Marsala has been updated with simple modern comforts at a good price for Rome. The floors are blond engineered hardwood with matching blond wood trim and wardrobes. The walls are white with little modern hangings and wall lamps. Not \"historic\" in any way but sleek and spotlessly clean. The elevator holds five persons comfortably - a record I think in my experience of small Roman hotels. The bathroom was small but well equiped and sported glass shower doors. Hot water was plentiful and pressure was good, good quality towels provided. Beds were narrow and firm in the Italian tradition but comfortable with good linen. The day staff on the front desk were efficient and experienced and spoke reasonable English. The night staff spoke little English but were warmhearted and all smiles. A reasonable breakfast spread is included in the room rates and served in a 5th floor room with a small attached outdoor terrace providing flowers and a breeze but no view. Rooms on floors 2 thru 4 have good fitting windows and individual A/C and heat so traffic noise is kept down and didn't bother us. 1st floor rooms are probably noisier. If you are arriving by train it is great to just turn right and walk out of the station to your hotel. The junction of Metro lines A and B is right there as is the central station for city buses. The area is one of government offices and apartments and a cluster of hotels. The so called \"seedy\" characters I see around Termini I also see throughout Rome these days and are nothing compared with those we routinely see in downtown American and Canadian cities. I have never heard of anybody being mugged, raped or assaulted. Pickpockets are about (but not as plentiful as at St. Peter's) and wolf whistes and sexist remarks are a latin curse.

The rooms were extremely small, as were the shower stalls. After checking out for our first night (we were going to stay in Florence for the following two nights, before heading back to Aphrodite Hotel for the remainder of our trip), the front desk staff told us that their credit card machine was out of order, and that we would have to pay in Euros. Luckily, we had Euros, but the front desk didn't even have change to give us, because you know, not having cash in register when your credit card machine doesn't work makes perfect sense. Rather than being helpful, the front desk suggested that we go to a nearby ATM and get change (which meant us going out of our way to get change that the hotel didn't have, ATM fees, etc. for us). Definitely no help, whatsoever. After a pleasant hotel experience in Florence, we came back to Aphrodite for the remainder of our trip. Not only was the staff extremely rude and unhelpful, but the hallways reeked of urine. No joke. And our hotel stay at Florence for the same amount of rooms and for 2 nights in a nice, central location was waaaay cheaper than just one night at Aphrodite. When we were checking out for the final time, the front desk staff wouldn't allow us to charge the bill on 5 different cards (for 2 rooms). Rather than apologizing for the inconvenience, the staff member was extremely rude and condescending, telling us that a big city like Rome doesn't allow bills to be split on multiple credit cards (mind you, my friends and I are from New York City). The fact that he refused to be courteous (even though in our outrage, we told him we weren't mad at him, but rather at the situation) really was off-putting.

Very dirty, drunk/homeless people sleeping on the street and causing problems. Upon our arrival our room was not ready so we had to wait over 2 hours in a cold and damp reception area. There was no bar, tv nor wireless interenet connection(as they say on their website) so we had to just sit around doing nothing. The receptionist is anything but nice or hospitable. It seemed like it was our fault for arriving at the hotel on time. When the room was finally ready, what a surprise!!!! Beside it being very small, the fake parquet floor was coming apart. Instead of replacing the broken pieces they tape it down. Went to the window to catch a \"breather\" and was literally looking at an old buildings dirty wall, 4 meters away, which no sun was able to come in. Now lets move into the bathroom, its amazing how they can fit a sink, toilet, bidet and shower into one place with a max of 2 sqm. I am a small girl (1,50m - 55kilos) and still had difficulty taking a shower. My boyfriend practically broke the shower doors with his elbows!!! There is no consistency with the temperature of water, its either freezing or scolding hot. After cleaning up and relaxing a bit we decided to go down to reception and book tours for the next day. It was refreshing to have another receptionist, which was very nice and helpful. I think her name is Julianne. She assisted us in booking tours and answered all our questions. The breakfast was minimal at best. Cold coffee, orange juice and cornflakes. Sliced bread (no toaster), hard butter/jam...no fruit, eggs, sausage, bacon etc. The only good point for the hotel is that the interior is clean. I suggest booking tours ahead and buying a ticket for the get on and off tourist busses. Its a must!!! We bought it for 48 hours and was probably the cheapiest thing we bought. We booked to see the Vatican & Colosseum with \"Enjoy Rome\" touring company. Our guide was Jannette from Florida. She was great and very knowledgable. The transfers from the airport to the hotel and vice versa is better through the shuttle bus or shuttle taxi with a fixed rate at \u20ac45 for two people - do not take the regular taxi. Overall we enjoyed our trip to Rome and would tell everyone to go and see it one time. Its a very historical city, alot of ancient architecture which is worth seeing. A last note, be prepared to spend money. As Rome is one of the most expensive cities in the world with the poorest service. The only good service we received was when being served by foreigners.

I stayed 2 nights and was totally miserable there. The receptionist who checked me in was unfriendly and indifferent. When I asked about the bus to airport being advised in the lobby, all I got was a \"I don't know, ask at the station\" (and believe me, it was not the result of a language barrier). I found out later that this was the standard reply to any question in general (from different receptionists). The 100 euros per night for a single room OBVIOUSLY has not been invested in staff training on how to make guests \"feel at home\". Since I mentioned the price, I have to say the other peculiar thing was that the TV came without a remote control- and could not be switched on without it. You need to inquire for it at the reception counter (and they don't tell you that when you check in) AND PAY a deposit of 10 euros to use it. The room itself was just so-so. It was clean at least. The verdict is this: stay here if you are just going to be in Rome for a VERY short time and you want to be able to get the airport train/trains to other cities very easily.

Overall, this was a good hotel. I booked it on Priceline for an INSANE rate so I really had low expectations. I was not disappointed and would likely stay here again. Here's why: It is directly across the street from the Termini. You can take a train from the airport to the Termini and walk across the street to the hotel. It's that simple. There's no worrying about getting a taxi to the hotel or walking around major tourist areas while wheeling luggage. (Note that the hotel is rather removed from the major attractions but they are all easily accessible via the subway.) There are also rental cars in the Termini and it is fairly easy to get out of town from this location if you're driving. Tour companies that operate buses down to Naples and Pompeii are a few blocks away. The hotel can book these reservations for you. There are a few good restaurants near the hotel - one next door (from what I remember) and several behind the hotel.

The air conditioning worked great and the room had high ceilings. I heard that breakfast was OK, but we never woke up early enough to try it. I think they ended fairly early. The staff are not the nicest but certainly no worse than any other place I've stayed. I would suggest paying in cash or pre-paying in advance through an online site.

Upon getting into our room (#207), we noticed that the decor wasn't quite as nice as the hallways or the pictures I had seen on their website. The room was fairly small but livable. The air conditioner was unfortunately \"underpowered\". It had been turned off prior to our arrival and does not have fan speed control. You set the temp to the lowest setting and hope it cools the room down. Although it did cool down to a \"decent\" level, it was not as comfortable as some of the other hotels we had stayed in Italy. Checking out our room further, we found our mini-bar fridge broken. Despite multiple calls to the front desk, it was never repaired during our 4 days and hence we never had anything we could keep cool. Our hairblower was also not functional as someone had pulled the hose out from it's socket. It too was never fixed during our stay. The bathroom itself was quite small. The shower stall could barely fit one person. I had to turn the shower off while in it just to shampoo or soap myself. My wife couldn't even shave her legs! Leaving the bathroom and going back to the bedroom, our \"queen\" bed was actually two twins put together with a headboard lamp hanging right over our pillows...we fortunately didn't electricute our heads despite banging into it a few times. The mattress was quite old as we could feel the metal springs digging into us. In the middle of the night, people can be heard in the hallways and I'm sure they could hear us. This was not a big problem overall. In the morning, there is a breakfast of mostly breads/cereal/ham/cheese and a few juices...nothing fancy. Lastly, there is no internet access at Hotel Aphrodite despite what is sometimes advertised. Despite the shortcomings of Hotel Aphrodite, it is located in a prime location next to the Train Station and bus stop giving it a few positives. On my next trip to Rome, however, I probably would consider staying elsewhere.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean but small\u201d", "Author": "suspend6", "ReviewID": "UR7754416", "Content": "This hotel is literally directly across the road from the main rail station in the heart of Rome (Rome Termini).

Everything leaves from the termini, trains, subway, buses and taxi's. You cannot go wrong! This is not a fancy hotel nice and basic small rooms with the essentials. The rooms -The bed was comfy enough with extra pillows and blankets. Our safe worked fine, though we had some friends on the 1st floor with a safe they could not get open. The cleaning people seemed professional and trustworthy and did a great job making up the room each day. It was always immaculate. Showers are small...I am a large guy 6'4 and 300 pounds and had no trouble using the small shower or the toilet etc... The shower does drain slow if you have the pressure on full we figured this out the first day and ran a little lower water pressure in the shower...still more than enough to shower comfortably. The queen beds were sufficiently big too and the sheets wer not scratchy. We kept our Termini Station view window open every night and enjoyed sleeping to the city sounds from the street. We were on the second level. The remodel is still evident tile and floors, and furniture are nice. The tv is small and you do need to leave a ten euro deposit for the remote...not many channels available all in Italian...fun. The room felt plenty big enough for us to move around in and have our luggage out etc...We were not in Rome to stay in our room we saw everything and we were exhausted at night. We did use the room phone and a calling card to make calls back home and had no extra charges from the hotel. All in all no surprises everything was great. You cannot beat this location and price! Our wives were really pleased with the cleanliness too! Breakfast was decent with breads - rolls danishes etc..., drinks - coffee, milk, yogurt and juice. Fruits and spreads even some ham and cheese. Ceral too. Everything tasted great and the area was neat and clean with a gal that was running her backside off. Service overall was very good! The elevator was workin fine to all 5 floors. We stayed at the Hotel Aphrodite fromt the 17th-24th of March. We had read many of the reviews and decided that it would work for us. We are medium budget travellers always looking for a good deal. We mainly booked this hotel because of it's location near the Termini. This was our first time to Rome and we could see that being near the Termini would be an advantage and it was extremily helpful! We also read that it would be good to carry our luggage on rather than to check it - this saved us time, and we were literaly at the hotel in our room less than 45 minutes after we landed. The express train from the airport is great you step off it at the termini walk to the opposite side of the station out on to Marsala and look to the right to see the Aphrodite. Too Easy! Everything leaves from the Termini station...it is the central hub of Rome! We found it to be so convenient. We also found it to be much safer than expected. The area did not seem at all dangerous and after a few days we felt right at home. Seriously I felt less safe in Hawaii. We ate at many different pizza places all were great...Florians was a stand out. For a great guide to the vatican or ancient Rome try Rich Brunn at rome-day-tours.com He is worth the money.

Read the previous review stating that the shower was a little on the small side, they must vary from room to room because ours was huge! One thing i would say for the ladies though is don't rely on the hairdryer in the room, it is not very powerful and takes forever to dry your hair! Breakfast was ok, the usual cheese, ham, cereals pastries. Was a bit dissapointed there was no bar as we usually travel with a group of friends and it's nice to start or end the night in the hotel. Having said that there are a few cafe/bars just up the road from the hotel which stay open really late and are very nice for a coffee and pastry in the morning. Hotel is a fantastic location, right opposite the termini. If you have the weather it's nice to walk around and see the sights. We took the map from reception which is very easy to follow. Some of our group thought it's a little too far to walk but the thing is if you get tired there are so many little cafes you can stop off at to top up the energy levels! We had lunch in the Piazza at the Pantheon one day, weather was stunning so we sat and people watched while enjoying good italian food and 2 bottles of wine. watch out for the hide and seek game played by the street vendors and the police (very amusing!) If you don't get the weather or don't fancy the walk, the metro is very easy and cheap to use. Doesn't take you right to the sights but will cut the walking to a minimum. Both routes blue and red our shown on the map from reception. We also did the 110 red tourist bus. It stops near all the main attractions and you can hop off and get back on as many times as you like. Overall had a fantastic trip and will definately use this hotel again.

When looking through the different websites for suitable accommodation I was disappointed to see that a lot of the affordable hotels in Rome seem to be quite shabby and old looking. Fortunately, we came across this small hotel next to the Termini Railway Station which claimed to have been recently renovated and judging from the pictures looked appealing. Despite some of the previous reviews stating that the rooms could hardly fit a bed, we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised at the condition and decor of the hotel in general. The room was a comfortable size for two people, and very bright, although the window had to be kept closed if you didn't want to hear the noise of the busy street. The location is very practical as you can either walk to many of the sites, like the Colosseum, Fountain of Trevi, Spanish Steps etc (all about 15 min walk) or alternatively use the underground from the station or buses to all areas just in front of the station. The airport transfer bus run by Ryanair (Terravision) also stops right by the hotel (under 100 yards away). However, as many other areas next to stations, the streets nearby may seem a bit on the seedy side but otherwise safe as in Rome in general. Breakfast is served in a glazed sunroom at the top of the building and consists of tea/coffee, cereals, yoghurt, bread and spreads and a variety of pastries, which was adequate. The breakfast is served between 7.30am and 10am. If I have to find something with room for improvement, it would probably be the size of the shower cubicles. Although just adequate for us, a large person would probably find it uncomfortable, as it was just about 2ft x 2ft (a bit on the tight side!).

She was unable to offer any sort of solution so after much debate, we moved to another hotel. We returned to the hotel in the morning to complain to the manager and to ensure that we would not be charged for the night. The manager accused us of lying and argued with us for a full one hour before agreeing not to charge us for such appalling service! She accused me of being a \"terrible person\"! Worst customer service skills I have ever encountered, clearly the manager is only interested in lining her pocket, regardless of the quality she offers to her clients. Her closing line as she agreed not to charge us was \"well, fine, you are unacceptable but you won't make me poor!\"", "Date": "March 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3231701", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Aphrodite form 20 to 25th Feb 2005 it is in a good location for getting around, my wife and I stayed in a double room which was very small even though it had a extra single bed in an annexe. The bathroom was clean and modern shower was excellent. The cleaning was very good. We had a small problem that the plug was missing from the sink despite asking countless times they seemed unable or unwilling to replace it, which was very unprofessional. The staff at the desk are polite but very dismissive do not think they are very keen on English people. The brekfast was very poor very little choice worst ever for an inclusive breakfast no meat of any sort cramped room to eat in inedible yoghurt, cornflakes, as for the musli i had to look at the bag to be sure it did not say Rabbit food Please do not follow the recommendation of where to eat we eat next door which they said was excellent, the food was inedible the service non existent they invent things to put on the bill. much better a few doors on an excellent restaraunt serving teriffic food cheaply, pizzas are best ever tasted. Beware the area around the station is full of low life beggars everyone hassling you for money and very unsafe in my opinion. The friends that we went with had her bag and purse snatched losing several hundreds of pounds in euros and sterling which made us very nervous walking around and only did so as a group.", "Date": "February 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice accomodation, Great location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2947721", "Content": "One thing you can't overlook, is the location of this Hotel, across the street from the Roma Termini train station is absolutely fantastic, esspecially if you are travelling by train through Italy. The Leonardo express from the airport stops there. But the room is small, it's just enough space to breathe. We got a rate of 90Euro per double room 3rd to 5th December, which is reasonable. The a/c cannot be adjusted, the only way to get air in, is to open the window, we got a room facing the next building not the street, so at least it wasn't noisy when we had the window open. The bathroom is beautiful, but the shower cubicle is damn small, I had trouble just turning around in it, and I'm an average size guy. The bed is comfortable though. Breakfast is adequate, continental type. There is a free internet station available from 12PM, eventhough the sign says 12AM. Staff are reasonably helpful but not overly friendly. Overall, a great place to base yourself if you intend to be out most of the day sigtseeing.", "Date": "December 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cRecommended hotel\u201d", "Author": "risingstar", "ReviewID": "UR2871334", "Content": "I, along with 2 friends, stayed in a triple room at the Hotel Aphrodite in Rome in November 2004. I recommend the hotel because it is a good value (110 euros for a triple room) and in an excellent location. It is directly across the street from Termini, allowing easy access to all public transportation. The staff is very friendly. There are not a lot of amenities at this hotel, although they do serve a decent breakfast. The hotel was remodeled in 2003 and is in excellent shape and very clean. My only criticisms are the rooms, even a triple, are very small. There is very little room to move around. If you are sharing a room, be sure it is someone you don't mind being in very close quarters with. Also, the shower is small beyond belief. It is smaller than a telephone booth and there is no room to even move your arms. They should remove the bidets and make the shower big enough so that you can use your arms to bath without banging on the glass. Lastly, there is no individual climate control in each room. There is a thermostat, but it does not appear to controlable by the rooms' occupants. We kept our window open, eventhough it was 50 degrees outside, just to keep the room bearably cool. The drawback to that was that we had to listen to all of the street activity, which is considerable, going on at Termini all night long. All in all, this is a great property for the price. It is very clean and the staff is pleasant. If you will not be spending a lot of time in your room, it is highly recommended.", "Date": "December 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOK place\u201d", "Author": "Ramblin_on_4ever", "ReviewID": "UR2586435", "Content": "This is well placed hotel, a few meters from the main Termini station (good transport links to attractions).

The hotel staff was excellent and they provided a continental breakfast in a small breakfast room.
