The hotel staff is very polite and informative and the rooms while small were clean and well appointed. The bed and pillows were hard for our tastes but after a full day of walking around the city you will barely notice. What you will notice are the lights that flickered all night in our room. The high ceiling is curved and on two of the wall there are recessed fluorescent lights that you can't see but light up the ceiling. At night these flickered dimly like a cheap aurora borealis and it was quite annoying. The bathroom is nicely appointed but the awkward tub/shower combination can be a bit difficult especially if you are a bigger person. The complimentary breakfast was nicer than most we had in Italy with a good selection of food, good coffee and courteous staff. The biggest problem we encountered with the Crosti Hotel is the location. It is right near the train station which is convenient when coming to or leaving Rome but not close to the sites. My wife and I are young and in decent shape and even we dreaded having to walk all the way back to the hotel after a full day of walking to the Coliseum, Vatican City, etc. There is also not too much around the hotel which mean slim pickings for dinner at the end of the day. Overall however we were satisfied with the hotel and would recommend it to people staying a couple days in Rome, however if you plan to walk around the city stay somewhere more centrally located.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gurgaon", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "debina s", "ReviewID": "UR128174008", "Content": "9/10.

The room was good side and always clean. The bathroom was comfortable and hot water was not an issue. The Hotel is very close to train and bus stations about a 5 to 10 minute walk not an issue even with suitcases. We arrived in Rome by plane and had arranged our pick up in advance with the Hotel. Best decision we made! After traveling for 14 hours, the last thing we wanted to do was had to find a taxi. As soon as we walked out of the baggage claim area there was a person with our name that directed us to the driver of a large A/C van with plenty of room, specially since there was only 3 of us. The best part it was only 37 Euros, plus tip. We arrived at 8am so our room was not ready, but we were able to leave our baggage, brushed or teeth, and were advise on places to go \"Rome-ing\" around. Tip: is you plan to use buses and train, buy the Roma pass, you can get it from the hotel lobby and it will end up saving you some money. It also includes 2 museums. Our room has 3 single beds with plenty of room to walk around. The beds were comfortable and there is one huge window you can open and get fresh air. We were in room 103 which is at the end of the hall on top of the breakfast area, so if you are a light sleeper you might want to have a room higher up, you can hear noise early in the morning. Breakfast was great! Eggs, bread, pastries, juices, milk and of course lots of coffee. The girl that helps in the breakfast room is super nice and make great coffee. The receptionist were all nice and friendly. Specially the older gentlemen at night, he was SUPER friendly! The one in the morning, would help you and answer questions, but didn't look like he really like his job. He wasn't mean. The hotel own a restaurant, it was ok, but you can find a lot better options if you go wonder around. just up the street you can find at least 10 more. So overall a great place to stay for the money! also, we did all of our booking through Europeandestinations.com and didn't have any problems, everything we bought we got :O)", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery good value city hotel\u201d", "Author": "WhiteBear21", "ReviewID": "UR127455946", "Content": "Convenient location about 10 mins walk from Termini station and near to another Metro station.

In the same common stair were \"Hotel Sandra\" and what appeared to be locals' homes. The first suite we were shown (apartment 12) smelled unpleasant so we asked to move and were put in apartment 18, which also smelled, but to a much lesser degree. We asked if we could stay in the hotel, but it was full. The smell went away when the windows were opened, but came back on average once or twice a day - a problem with the drains/plumbing possibly. There was a washing machine in the bathroom, a few inches from your knees, and a microwave in the sitting area, where you might expect a TV. The shower was one of the ones where it randomly went hot and cold. So much for the negatives, although I wasn't that bothered by them. My girlfriend hated it at first but after a few days she didn't mind so much. The positives are that it overlooked a courtyard and was quiet, the bed was comfortable, it was very clean, the building was nice, it had a lift, it was relatively cheap, the staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was varied and tasty and you could eat as much as you wanted.

We booked our trip with european destinations, and this was the recommended hotel. The staff was so friendly, particularly the gentleman working the desk in the evenings. I emailed them and they arranged to have a driver pick us up at the airport, which was great. The room was clean, large, and modern, with a mini fridge to store some drinks in. We found the hair dryer when we were packing to leave. There is also a small safe. The highlight of our stay was the breakfast each morning. This was no common continental breakfast. As you walk in, the lady working the room asks you for your coffee order. The cappuccino was amazing! How will I ever be able to drink american coffee again after that? If you order regular coffee, they bring you a carafe and cream. It is the best coffee I've ever had. The buffet has wonderful prosciutto, meats and cheese, pastries, breads, eggs, fresh fruit salad, and delicious pears that taste like they are sweetened with honey, just to name a few things Everything was so tasty. Crosti is a 5 minute or less walk from 3 metro stops and the Termini. This is handy since none of the major attractions are very close. We found it convenient enough to return to our room for a bit each afternoon. There is a small elevator, which is nice when you are too worn out from walking to climb the stairs. We discovered a great grocery mart just down the street. Head down Castelfidardo towards the Termini. Just before you hit the first major intersection, turn right and about a half a block down, near the taxi stop, you will see Conad on the right. We couldn't believe the price of drinks there! When you pay 3.50 euros for a Coke at a restaurant, it is nice to be able to buy some for the hotel for 50 cents. They also have a great and cheap wine and beer selection. The mini fridge came in very handy! We highly recommend the hotel, and always felt so welcome walking through the door. There are plenty of places to eat or get a snack right on the street, and the metro is a few minutes away.

Termini station is only 10 min away. The only problem we experienced during our stay was noisy room because of the proximity to the hotel's reception and street outside our window. We had a ground floor room and the reception desk and breakfast area were only a few yards away from our door. This obviously generated a lot of noisy traffic. A particular \"lowlight\" was that hotel cleaners had their morning chat every day right in front of our room door. Our room was also right above a large television set in the basement breakfast area and one night there was a broadcast of a football match. I had to go and ask people who were watching the match to turn the volume down because it was so loud that we could not sleep.

The only thing that put me off was that one of the walls was terribly dirty as if someone had been lying across the bed pressing their shoed feet against it but I decided to take it easy. The bathroom with a shower cabin was very clean though. The climate control in the room worked perfectly. There is wi-fi in all the rooms - it is not free but you only pay 5 euros for your entire stay, which is next to nothing. Breakfast was served in the breakfast room downstairs and was the usual kind of Italian breakfast - a selection of cheese and sausage, muesli, hard- boiled eggs, and some pastry (no hot options). The breakfast room was never crowded - in fact, as I always came early, I hardly saw anyone there. The reception staff were all very nice and the grey-haired man who checked me in (I am sorry I did not find out what his name is) was a real gem - very friendly and super helpful. He gave me some good advice, explained where everything is and how to get there, helped me carry my bag a few steps up to the elevator, and supplied me with an adaptor.

Room good size, basic but clean, was always out anyway. Didn't have any issues with the bed really, was so tired from walking around all day it didn't matter too much. Tv with cable but mostly italian, no coffee/tea making facilities but fridge so we bought bottles of coke and kept them in there. One thing we realised - very expensive to buy small bottles when out and about, so got ours from super market which is near buy or bought local drinks such as cappucino when out as they are cheap! Breakfast was nice with good continental selection, meats, cheeses, pastries, youghurts, fruit etc. And staff made the coffee of your choice for you in the morning. Some say that the area is dodgy, I didn't think it was. Never felt in danger when walking around, although there was one time when we got off at termini station at night and walked back when there were some people hanging around which was a little intimidating (although they didn't bother us), but we got off at castro pratorio most other times which is nearer to the hotel, and is one stop from termini, so we just changed as the metro is very easy to use and you can travel for 70 mins on 1 euro. The hotel was in a good location for us personally, as it was a little bit out of the way, but still close enough to everything. It didn't take very long to get anywhere at all. And maybe made it a bit more of a novelty when we did go out, as opposed to walking out of a hotel directly in front of the trevi fountain for example. Although some people may prefer somewhere closer and more convenient so bare that in mind. We would stay here again upon returning to Rome which we hope to do at some point, staff were nice rooms were adequate, location just fine for us.

There were a couple reasons we didn't love it compared to the others. First of all, we were given a room directly above the breakfast area and it was unbelievably loud in the early, early morning hours. It was really frustrating for us because we couldn't sleep through it (we're talking about 4 am- 5 am). I'm assuming others rooms have a better situation and maybe we just got unlucky there. The hotel staff wasn't very friendly (again, this isn't according to American standards\u2013 this is compared to the other hotels we stayed in during our Italy trip). They weren't rude, but they weren't nice either. The room is plain and functional. The shower is very tiny, and it's the only room we stayed in that didn't have a bathtub. Each other hotel also had a hair dryer, but this one did not. The bed was really firm, but we found that to be true of all the hotels we stayed in. Italians like a firm bed and thin pillows! The breakfast was OK. Again, it was our least favorite of the three hotels we stayed in. It's totally great that it was free, but we couldn't find many things that we liked. We ended up eating hard boiled eggs and bananas.

You could try some of the bars in the area.\u201d My husband and I subsequently went looking and asked at a caf\u00e9 where we were told that the Railway Station (which is not very far away), has plenty of shops open on Sundays! We were not the only people he was rude to \u2013 I heard him on the phone one day being rude to someone else.

We paid for the tours (Vatican & Colosseum / Forum) which avoided the long queues & we learnt much more!.

We found it somewhat strange that both toilets were off the same room, with no toilet in the \"master bedroom\" but this wasn't really a problem. The furnishings were somewhat spartan, but we had everything we needed. There was a locked door between the hallway and the group of three or four rooms our room was in and of course a lock to our door as well, so we felt quite secure. The hotel was quiet despite being right on the street because we closed the wooden louvered shutters and windows; if you want to sleep with the windows open, you might find the street noise bothersome. We were there in late October and the management decided that we would need heat instead of air conditioning. Our room was a little warm for us, so they turned off the heat but could not turn on the air conditioner. We cooled the room down by opening the windows before bed and it was comfortable enough. The staff was helpful and efficient. A nice breakfast buffet was included and we got 24 hours of internet for three Euro. We had our own computer ... no computers were available at the hotel, but there is a very inexpensive internet cafe between the hotel and train station. We had heard people recommend not staying by the train starion, but we had no problems and liked the convenience since we took the train to and from the cruise port and used the metro a lot. Overall this was an enjoyable stay.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derbyshire, England", "Title": "\u201cIdeal moderately priced hotel for the Rome tourist\u201d", "Author": "Woodbine13", "ReviewID": "UR85471920", "Content": "We arrived at Rome's Ciampino airport and used the efficient pre-booked Terravision bus to Rome Termini.

He also recommended a lovely restaurant at the end of the road that the hotel was on that the hotel also ran. We decided to go to the restaurant on our first evening and the food was superb. My partner had the steak and I had a pasta dish but the full menu looked lovely. The hotel room itself was very modern with a flat screen TV on the wall and bright and airy with high ceilings. I feel in love with the windows which opened fully and had shutters which drowned out almost all of the noise from the street in the evening and made the room very dark to enable a good nights sleep. The breakfast was continental with the usual bread, cereal, pastries, fruit, yogurt etc which was nice but you can't beat a hot breakfast i.e eggs on toast. Obviously you would be able to visit a cafe nearby that had more options but the breakfast at the hotel was adequate. The hotel staff were very friendly and even loaned is an adaptor for the plugs (as I had brough the wrong one!). Overall I would recommend the Crosti for people of all ages whether a couple or a family with young children as it is within a 5/7 minute walking distance to the Termini (central) Station and a 15 minute walk to Trevi Fountain as well as being clean and modern with helpful staff. p.s.

To wash it down there were freshly squeezed juices, coffee(including cappucino) or tea. Crosti is situated close to Termini railway station with metro and bus links into central Rome. We used these but also found it to be comfortable walking distance from most of the key tourist sites. Despite what you read Termini and its environs were lively but not threatening. There are the usual problems that you expect to find at any large railway station but we never felt in danger and liked the atmosphere here more than some of the more rarified areas. The surrounding roads were noisy - this includes throughout the night with revellers, rubbish carts, delivery trucks and irrascible scooterists. This is a problem throughout Rome and much of the noise can be reduced by use of the shutters and double glazed windows although we prefer to let the night air (and sounds) pervade our room.

But, we can see the lower breakfast area that soon will feature a good breakfast for us in the morning. One that features eggs, processed meats (not my favourite), cereals and sweets. Going into the room, we have a regular card-key that gets scanned to let us in. The room features a large armoir, drawer space and the safe. The window can open and we can see outside, but would rather not. The view is of the back alley and nothing more. The washroom is of a good size, especially considering that European bathrooms are considerably small usually. A great shower with strong water pressure and a heated rack to hang our towels. This was a great 'old school' add-on. The bed was the highlight, it was firm and comfortable. Going to sleep on the other hand was interesting. Upon closing the lights, we realize that the card slot (where the room card is placed when entering to turn on the electricity) emits these blue lights that are so strong when closing the lights. It turned into a strange club 54 atmosphere. I needed a sock to put over the card to hide these lights. They were incredibly bright. The location was what drew us to the Crosti, it is close to the train station. Surprisingly enough, the Crosti provides a great end point when done sight-seeing. Starting from the Colosseum, one can walk to all the main sights in almost a straight line and walk all the way back to the hotel. We caught all of the sights at night this time and really enjoyed the walks back, it felt comfortable and safe. There is a supermarket close, but we never utilized it. Other than that, restaurants are available in the entire city, seemingly within ten steps of each other. Nothing of major note is really around the hotel other than that.

The saving grace was that there are two subway stations nearby. The bad news is that Rome has a exceptionally lousy subway system in terms of convenience.

The challenge when staying by the station is that you're by the station: it's hard to find good food, and when you've been out all day sightseeing and you return home tired but need some dinner, you might not want to trek back into town to find a cute little trattoria. But, you also don't want the equivalent of diner/tourist food when you're in one of the food meccas of the world. So, don't eat at the restaurant across the street -- \"Salvatore's\" -- it's nasty and the service was dismal. Instead, go diagonally across the street on the next block to Monte Arci -- their pasta was good, the service was cheerful, and there were little touches that make a difference -- they served the bill on top of a few rose petals, with some biscotti, for instance. Or, try La Familgia -- about 3-4 blocks away, perpendicular to Castelfidardo and towards town. As for the hotel, I agree with the other reviews: very clean, well-positioned in terms of convenience to touring around, and the staff is pleasant -- especially the breakfast staff.

It did have an elevator that required a key and a couple steps up before you get to it, but that was no issue for us.

We used the Terravision Ciampino airport to Rome transfer bus which stops at Termini \u2013 a good bet and only 8 Euro return. Although we used the Metro for getting to some of the sights it doesn\u2019t generally cater for the main sights. From the hotel my suggestion would be to walk 5 minutes to Via 20 Settembre and catch the number 492 bus ( it goes from the central reservation in the road). This bus takes you very near the Pantheon and Ponte Umberto areas \u2013 a far better option than using the depressing, crowded, graffiti ridden sights of the Metro. There are several Trattoria/Pizzeria along from the Crosti including one recommended by the hotel.

The only caveat I would have about recommending this hotel, is to say that you need to be the kind of traveler who doesn't mind using public transportation. While there are good restuarants in the area, evening activity is around Piazza Navona or Popolo. Both are short cab rides or Metro rides away, and the location was not a problem for us. We felt the cost savings was worth the slight inconvenience. BTW with respect to the review about graffiti in the neighborhoods.

On arrival we were given a huge two bedroomed room, despite there only being two of us. The two bedroomed room had a bathroom and an additional separate toilet, which I think would have been quite handy had there have been four of us in the one room. The room itself was squeaky clean, and although I had looked at other travellers pictures on trip advisor before I left, I thought it looked much more modern and much larger in the flesh. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is located near the termini station (10 minutes walk) which is very handy if you are flying to Rome, as coach transfers from both Rome Fiumicino and Rome Ciampino go to the termini station. The hotel is also close to two metro stations, which we used for getting around the city as we wanted to see as much as possible during our short stay. Tickets for the metro can be bought from the station, you can pay 1 euro for a metro ticket which lets you do as many journeys as you like in 75minutes or 4 euros for an all day ticket (these tickets can be used both on the metro and the bus). The street which Crosti is situated on has other hotels all along it, and a fair few family run restaurants. When we arrived at the hotel the man who welcomed us gave us a map and pointed out the best way to get to the main attractions, as well as a run down on the local restaurants. We also went to Da Vincenzo's - the hotels own restaurant which was down the street and thought it was very nice. The reason that I have given the hotel 4 out of 5 for location is that whilst the location is excellent in a practical sense, for me it lacked the wow factor as in it did not have fantastic views, fantastic boutiques or bars nearby. Breakfast was fantastic at Crosti Hotel, as mentioned in other reviews there is a continental buffet breakfast featuring, toast, meats, cheeses, eggs, cereals, fruit, cakes and fresh pastries. There is also fresh fruit juice and the choice of tea and coffee on offer. I booked this hotel using the online hotel site expedia and paid a fantastic price for our stay. I know that larger hotels may have facilities that Crosti Hotel did not have, such as swimming pools and a gym, but I came to Rome looking to do some site-seeing and to soak up a bit of Italian culture, so for me to stay in this little immacutely clean family run hotel was a real treat!

We were welcomed at the hotel by a very nice gentleman who offered to arrange any visits or tours we might like to undertake.

The room did come with air-conditioning, but we didn't use it. The breakfast! You will be completely spoilt for choice! There is cereal, juice, rolls, bread, cake, cheese, ham, eggs, omlette, fresh fruit, yoghurt, croissants and the most delicious coffee (you can have tea if you prefer!). We found that after a breakfast like that, you couldn't eat another thing until 4pm! The hotel owners have a restaurant down the road and they offer a 10% discount on your meal. The only warning I would give is that we couldn't find a menu outside, so didn't know the prices until we sat down.

There was a lounge, kitchen, decent sized bedroom (with safe) and bathroom and kitchen with cooker, fridge, microwave, toaster and kettle and a good sized balcony. Some days(but not all) the hotel leaves complimentary fruit, yoghurt, water, crispbread and jam/butter/nutella in the room.The area is quiet, although the walls are a bit thin between rooms. The airconditioning was good. Staff were helpful, and on arrival we were driven to the apartment with our luggage. The block had 7 floors, and the lift was a little on the small size (but adequate) and if you can operate the lock on the ground floor first time you are a better man than i. Breakfast comprised cakes, croissants, cheese,cold meats, cereals, fruit juice, cold (in general) scrambled egg, fruit, fruit juice, yoghurts and coffee/tea. The apartment was a few minutes walk from the nearest metro on line b which allows access to the main sites. Walking took about 30 minutes to the main attractions;spanish steps etc. There are a few restaurants nearby, and if you ask at reception they will give you a card for a restaurant in the next road which provides good food (and 10% discount). There is a supermarket a few minutes walk away. Overall, the hotel is reasonably priced for rome. I was surprised not to be in the same place as the hotel (maybe i should have read the reviews in more detail), but the apartment more than made up for the short walk to breakfast. The breakfast is more than adequate, and travel is easy. (buy a metro/bus ticket for 1 euro for one day). The rooms were clean and tidy and cleaned daily.

The rooms were always spotless, the bathroom was enornous with jacuzzi bath. The bedroom was also large with a huge 6 foot bed, so I guess, because of the hotel layout, it is the luck of the draw, what size you get.

Would recommend to anyone.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "leaperone", "ReviewID": "UR13251677", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Crosti Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The staff were genuinely kind and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was thoughtfully presented and of good quality. My room was simple and clean. Yes, the surrounding area is a bit on the earthy side- but its also very close to Trimani wine bar and some very nice local restaurants. I certainly will return again.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "brum", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place\u201d", "Author": "Ahabrum", "ReviewID": "UR13122469", "Content": "This hotel was fantastic. Its right near Rome's termini station and it is so easier to get around and see Rome. The hotel is clean, the staff are super; they gave us advise on places to eat, go and the best way to get there. travelling was easy like using the underground but so clean and spacious even at rush times. The 2 bad things about the location were its next door to a strip club and on the same road as an adult cinema. The area is a little grim with a groups of men hanging around. I wouldnt suggest this area for girls only; if you have a big stong man with you its cool but else I would have felt a little scared Hotel though is fab!!!!", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Crosti Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d775990-Reviews-Crosti_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$112 - $212*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Castelfidardo, 54</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "775990", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/66/d3/66d308ca5f9358d7d557c87f6a5734e55large.jpg"}}
