Oh, no worries, its just some stranger snatching keys out of my hand and driving off with my car. Second, I walked to a near by restaurant to have a late night dinner and when I came home, the gate to the parking garage was closed. The front door was locked! No way to get into the hotel. NO WAY!!! So I climbed the garage gate and jumped over the top and let myself in. I went up to talk to the person in charge. It was pitch black in the lobby with one lamp on at a desk with the same valet guy full of attitude and hate. I WILL NEVER stay here again. NEVER.

Overall not disappointed for the price in this area, which could be upwards of $120 or so. A few hours before we were set to check in, I got a call from Jason, the manager, asking for my permission if he could transfer us to the Wilshire Hotel, a sister company, since we needed double beds and they only had king beds available and were overbooked. I obliged, but after reading the reviews for the Wilshire, I immediately called him back and said I'd rather keep the king room at the Shelter Hotel. Jason told me that wouldn't be a problem. When we checked in, a lovely man named Luis assisted us. He informed us that we were getting double beds, much to our relief. Check-in was fast and easy, and he gave us instructions on how their parking system works, which was: If you get to the garage and there are no more stalls available, just drive in, double-park, leave your keys with the concierge and they'll take care of it. True enough, when we got back that night, the whole garage was packed like sardines, so we left the keys downstairs and that morning, we found our car parked in a stall. As for the room: It's very spacious, although very basic. The dark hardwood floors are nice, and the beds comfy. However, we didn't find too many amenities in the room: no hairdryer (good thing we brought our own), no iron/ironing board, no pen or notepad (lol - I couldn't find any when I needed them!)...but they did have a small coffeemaker, an flatscreen TV with cable, the usual toiletries, and a cute little wardrobe with some drawers. I guess that's just how it is with boutique hotels - less is more! There was a really loud pooch next door, so I rang Luis to ask if he could transfer us to another room. But he said they were overbooked and had no other rooms available. Thankfully, by the time we got back that night, the doggie had calmed down...maybe the owner slipped him some Xanax :) We were also awakened by an annoying sound upstairs, like a child on a tricycle running around the entire room. Good thing we needed to get up anyway. But it went on the whole morning and the bad thing was the floors/walls were too thin you could virtually hear everything.

At that price this hotel was a reasonable value considering the various pluses (location and price) and minuses (overall quality of experience). This is definitely not a 'hotel' experience but at the right price it would be a reasonable trade-off if you are prepared and informed. Location: The hotel location is pretty convenient for getting around and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to a red/purple line train station. There are no good restaurants in the immediate area so you need to drive to eateries and entertainment. This is an apartment building converted into hotel rooms. Room and condition: I had a top floor corner king room and the room was reasonably clean and quiet(ish) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely an urban location with the associated noise but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the location. The feel/look is modern but the finishes are budget and are showing wear and tear already. They have added hooks and towel ladder in the bathroom so there is now somewhere for towels (but the hook was loose on the wall). I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed with the polyester (60%) / cotton (40%) sheets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in hot weather who wants to sleep on the equivalent of plastic wrap. There were four light bulbs burnt out in my room at check-in. The general level of service and my not caring much about light levels is why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t report the burnt out bulbs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say is that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised housekeeping never noticed. I did advise the desk at check-out so they could deal with it before the next guest. Service: Front desk is always staffed and staff were friendly however this is definitely not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience. The staff were young (and seemed inexperienced) and usually unable to help with questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is there a mailbox nearby?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how much is the bus?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is the wifi down?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is no hotel safe/lock box and nothing in the rooms so if you are an international guest be prepared to drag your passport around LA with you. Complaint: I emailed the hotel multiple times before travelling to find out how they handled late night check-ins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none of my 4 emails received a response and I was using the email link on the hotel web-site. I finally phoned and was told that it was no problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the front desk was always staffed and I could just check-in. Unfortunately what they did not tell me is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfront desk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is on the second floor of the hotel and that they lock the hotel at night and there is no doorbell/buzzer. I nearly traveled without my cellphone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thank goodness I had it with me as you have to CALL the hotel to get in so you can check-in. Some more detailed information about late night check in would have been helpful. When I got in the staff member on duty told me I should have beeped my car horn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 1:30 am, inches from the hotel where people were sleeping. Not impressed. Misc: Internet/wifi was constantly weak and I kept losing the signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no good location in the hotel were you will get a stronger signal (I did ask \u00e2\u20ac\u201c repeatedly). Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not enough spaces for the number of rooms so whenever they are full \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like weekends \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will end up double parked and must leave your keys with the front desk for them to move your car as needed.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMostly ok\u201d", "Author": "Amtex", "ReviewID": "UR119031519", "Content": "This hotel is ok, room and hotel facilities are basic.

It's a very simplistic place and that's what we grew to love about it. The room was clean, the staff friendly (I had no issues with leaving my keys with them at night), and the street was fairly quite by the time we got to bed--we even slept with the windows open all night! The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood in Koreatown and it felt like a safe area. Everything we wanted to see was pretty much within a three mile distance, which was really nice--we didn't have to spend the whole afternoon stuck in traffic on the freeway or driving around the city. Plus, it was nice to have the free WiFi (though it was a bit slow) and parking!

I want to start out my review by saying that I travel quite a bit to Los Angeles. I almost always stay at the same 2 properties in West Hollywood. I happened to be joy riding one day and I wound up running into The Shelter Hotel. I have to argue that although the hotel is listed as being in \"Koreatown\" in my opinion it is not in the heart of this section. In fact, it is heading to the West Hollywood border. Nevertheless, I saw the hotel and thought it maybe a condominium. In fact, there were several condominiums and nice homes in the area. The neighborhood is VERY safe. In fact, I am surprised at some of the comments. The hotel is in a very eclectic and nice residential neighborhood. You do see a lot of Korean restaurant and shops. Is this why people say these things? To be honest, I thought I had cancelled my reservation. I called and spoke to Jason the GM and I was stunned to find out, I still had a reservation in the system. Jason, went over and beyond helping me. I felt very comfortable speaking to him. I also enjoyed working with Steve, one of the nicest front desk reps that you ever want to meet. I have to say that the rooms are so spacious, especially for the price. I felt like I was in an apartment. My best friend Tawanna adored the property too. The rooms were gorgeous. Simple, and clean. The bathroom was very nice. I loved the hard wood floors. I am not a fan of carpet (especially since I have bad allergies) so walking into a room with gorgeous dark wood floors, was truly a BONUS! There was not ONE moment that I did not feel safe in this neighborhood. The staff provided one-on-one service, and I realized how important that was to me. I am a big fan of customer service and you cannot always receive that at the larger hotels. It felt awesome not being 'just a number'. One of the other things I loved, was the outer decor of the hotel. I love the brownstone effect and the pink crest logo on the building. It was this that caught my eye, on my joy ride that day. I loved the coziness, warmth and relaxing components that the Shelter Hotel provides. I do not have one bad thing to say about the Shelter Hotel. In fact, I found a place to get my nails done. Went food shopping for a few items. All in the same neighborhood. Now, it may not have anything you can walk to, but I had a rental car, and would rather drive where I need to go. The parking garage was fine. I do not know many places you can go to where parking is complimentary. The parking garage is very secure. There were BMWs, Mercedez Benz's, Infiniti's and many other cars in the garage. Economy, Mid Size and Luxury. SUVs also. There is a gate after a certain time of night that closes so no one can enter the parking garage that should not be there. I only have small recommendations: It would be great to have a cocktail hour offered at the Shelter Hotel. Add a DJ for that daily cocktail hour (offering five or six specialty cocktails) would add to this hip spot! It would also be nice to have a breakfast cafe where guests can pay for french pastries and other hot breakfast foods. I know that the hotel is decorating the rooms more... the rooms look great, but it would be nice to see that same brown background and pink crest logo on a bathroom carpet (smile). Maybe a small spa and a swimming pool (lap pool). I would give the Shelter Hotel a standing ovation!

I only have a couple of suggestions for inside the room and I wanted a comment card but was directed here. I think that they should use shower liners in the shower because our bathroom only had a curtain and if you leave the curtain out of the tub then you end up with water on the floor but if you put it inside the tub, it soaks the curtain. Another suggestion would be to have a second mirror above the desk or somewhere on the wall. Our room only had one above the sink. Having another mirror just makes sense so you don't have two people trying to get ready in the same mirror. Another suggestion (but not necessary), maybe just to add to the decor, some night stands or maybe an accent chair would be nice. The room was so roomy, so it wouldn't cause it to be cramped.

When i turned up at the hotel at 12pm after arriving from the airport, i was told the rooms were fully booked the day before and that the room was not ready. Well, i guess i wasn't lucky enough to check in at 12pm. Nevertheless I was told to leave my name with the hotel and they will call me back. When i penned my cell phone & my last name \"LEE\" on a make shift rough paper they gave me, the afro hair guy said LEE WHO? He should at least said \"Sir, can you please leave your full name please\". It was rude. When i returned at 230pm, he said, \"I haven't call you yet. Wait till 3pm.\" Which hotel takes 4 hours from the checkout timing of 11am to prepare just a room? I ended up felling asleep for 30mins waiting in my car in the carpark beneath the hotel because i was way too tired. When i went back up to the hotel at 320pm, he was not longer there. The guy at the counter, Steve, was more polite, thanking me for my patience. Had it not been Steve who was more polite, i would have changed hotel. I have been to various part of the country averaging at least 5 different hotels a year and that afro hair guy was probably the most rude ones i've met. A counter staff is the representative of the hotel because that is probably the 1st and the last person one would meet in the hotel. The last time i check the hotel name was Shelter Hotel & not Shelter Motel. It was my 1st ever visit to LA and i chose Shelter hotel because i had an horrible experience with Bed Bugs in Salt Lake City, Utah. I usually preferred new or refurbished hotels. But even though the room was big and i loved the wooden floors which was refreshing and different from most carpetted hotels, the room would really requires a table lamp, a hair dryer, maybe not put the towels beneath the sink, a fridge, a safe, more lighting and maybe a proper closet. The restroom would require a couple more hooks for clothings as well. The free internet was fast. The free underground carpark was small and i was told to park at the handicap slot when i returned late at night which was fine to me. I had to call to open the gate bcos i turn up at 12am plus at night. But it was nice knowing the cars were protected behind locked gates. Lastly, not forgetting the housekeeping left a big bottle of floor cleaner solution on the desk table as a surprise when i came back late at night (I did left a tip on the bed, probably it's not enough?) I'm usually tolerant & not choosy & i knew the hotel was in the midst of renovation, but judging by what i experienced and unless new pictures of facilities were added, i would not recommend the hotel to my friends in near future.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for our needs.\u201d", "Author": "wel0ve2vacati0n", "ReviewID": "UR93288885", "Content": "We were sweetly surprised by the hotel.

The room was very stylish with dark timber floors and furniture and pale coloured walls which gave it a bit of a designer look, but a little impractical as there was virtually no storage space. There was a small open closet with some hangers and a shelf above it but no drawer space at all apart from a very tiny one in the desk which was barely big enough for an ipod let alone any clothing. In addition to a lack of furniture there was absolutely nothing in the room to give you any guide to the hotel, no guide to the TV or phone, not even which extension was the front desk, nothing about the local area not even that little card that is on the back of every hotel door with the room rates and the hotel liability policy or a guide to where the fire escapes were. The room had a great LCD TV with a good selection of stations, very comfortable king size bed with great linens and nice towels and the bathroom had been renovated nicely.

I had been at a conference in LA earlier in the week - and decided to expend my trip by four additional days to catch up with friends and basically hang out. I've stayed at a number of different budget boutique hotel/motels over the past few years - and try to find a decent place that is around 100 per night or less. I booked my room through their website - and got an introductory price of around 70.00 per night, I think because they're still working on renovating parts of the property, like the pool. When I arrived, they graciously allowed me to check in early - as I had just checked out of my conference hotel downtown. The front desk person gave me the scoop on how their FREE parking worked - first come first served - if you block somebody in you have to leave your keys at the front desk - you need to call the front desk to be buzzed in after mid-night. The neighborhood is residential - but not great to walk around at night by yourself. A number of pretty aggressive panhandlers around bumming change when you get closer to the stores and shops in the area - but not near the hotel. (Some of the beautiful churches on Wilshire Blvd are good samaritanas and run food / shower programs for the homeless). That said - there are some great Korean BBQ / Pho places in the 'hood! My room was just like what was pictured on their website (and here on Tripadvisor). Modern, sleek and roomy! The bed was clean and comfy - but my room had some weird staining on the walls underneath the window - as if there had been a leak. Due to this the room smelled a little musty. When I opened the windows I noticed one window had a screen, the other one didn't. I was on the top floor - so I didn't worry about it. The bathroom was modern and sleek as well - but not as clean as I had hoped. When I got the shower curtain wet - it smelled like mildew and had orangey rust/mildew stains on it. A little bleach should take care of that - but something the management should keep an eye out for. The only weird thing was one afternoon I was just kicking it in my room - enjoying their FREE internet (which was great) - and suddenly, with no warning one of the workmen in the hotel opened my door to change the door latch plate on the doorjamb. No knocking or anything! Lucky I was alone! And clothed! Check out was smooth - no problems, except that was when I found out about the complimentary breakfast!

Don't stay here with your dogs unless you want the LAPD knocking at your door! I booked a room through Orbitz for a one night stay at the Shelter Hotel in Los Angeles. From the website, it looked like an okay spot for one night, and they take pets, so their website says... Well, after a grueling 3 1/2 hour in Friday traffic in L.A., we were ready to get into our room, and decompress for 10 minutes before we had to get ready to head out for our event. But...not so fast! We were, rudely, informed upon check-in that they had no record of our reservation. I thought that was interesting, since I was holding the confirmation letter from Orbitz in my hand. Well, a quick check-in it was not, but no problem; we worked it out, and the hotel did offer to give us a better rate for our trouble. We proceeded to unload the car, hustle our gear, ourselves, and our dogs up to the room. Well, after a long drive, no doubt everyone needed to relieve themselves, dogs included! We took the dogs out front to pee, and after returning to the room, get a phone call from Rick, at the front desk. He proceeds to inform us that we can't have our dogs there because they are over 20 lbs. If we want to stay, we are going to have to pay another $60! Well, I was shocked, as nowhere in any of the literature about the hotel either on Orbitz, or the Shelter's own website was this indicated. All that it says is that they take pets. I told this to Rick, and he went round and round with me. I asked him to simply show me somewhere that a weight limitation was indicated, and he couldn't do it. He then told us if we didn't pay $50, we had to leave. Well, the first time he said $60. Now which was it, $50 or $60? It was really startng to feel like an arbitrary request, as his amount requested, changed. I refused, until he could present me with facts, which I tell him is a reasonable request. Well, then Rick threatens to call the cops, and hangs-up. Now, mind you, we had nowhere else to go at this juncture, it's now after 8:00 p.m., we have an event to attend, and really, how the hell am I going to find another hotel that \"takes pets\"? I got the phone number of the GM of the hotel, Jason [-], and left him a detailed message hoping to get some kind of assistance with the situation, but to this day have heard nothing from him! We continued getting ready, and 30-40 minutes later, get a knock at the door. It's the LAPD!!!! I am asked out into the hallway, where the police proceed to tell me that they have been requested to remove us from the property! I am really apalled at this point, and state my case. They were very nice, and completely understood my plight. They agreed to mediate the situation, as we had nowhere else to go! So, I am escorted down to the lobby by the LAPD to work something out! Now mind you, kind reader, I am extremely embarassed by this! There are other people in the lobby, and even though I knew that I was in the right, I felt like a real chump! At the desk, Rick was nothing shy of a joke! I asked him, again, to show me something, anything that states that they only take pets that are 20 lbs or less. Again, he can't. I then ask him if they have a scale to weigh pets in on upon arrival, or if he is capable of making a weight judgement by just \"eyeballing\" it. What do you think his reply was? \"Duh...\"! I asked him, again, for the phone number of the GM, and also his first and last name. Rick says, \"I don't know how to say his last name\". I am thinking, \"Wow, what kind of Mickey Mouse operation are they running here?\". Well, I just want to be over this fiasco, and get on with my night, so the police ask me if I will agree to pay the $50 now, and work on getting reimbursed at a later date. They tell Rick, that if I do this, he must let us stay. I, reluctantly, agree (how easy will it be to get my money back at a later date)? So, apparently, we have reached an agreement, albeit I will try to dispute this at a later date. Rick proceeds to write some chicken-scratch, on a blank piece of paper with a photo-copy of my drivers license about a $50 fee for \"not informing the hotel upon check-in that my pets were over 20 lbs________(sign here)\"! At this point, I am laughing! They don't even have a pre-made form for this strictly enforced policy? He didn't even use hotel letter-head! Wow, they are really legit! (Please read with a touch of sarcasm)! Well, at this point, the police escorted me back to my room, and gave me their contact information for use at a later date, should I need their testimony for my dispute. The LAPD were, actually, very courteous and helpful. The Shelter Hotel...a total joke. Because of this fiasco, we were late to our engagement, and caused our hosts to be late as well. I have never been treated so poorly, or had such miserable customer service as at the Shelter Hotel. At this writing the GM, JASON [-], has still not attempted to contact me to apologize for the ill treatment we received there. Way to run damage control, Jason! I did talk to the customer service department at Orbitz. They did some research, and found that the Shelter Hotel, did NOT, in any of their literature, post a weight limitation on pets!

I had two different rooms and got a good cross section of the experience here. Rooms: The rooms are very minimalist, but extremely clean! there is a table, chair, bed, tv, and two night stands. That is it for the furniture. Not a problem for me. No closet, but a place to hang many things. No iron or ironing board, but you can request one and they will bring it to you. There is an ipod deck/radio/alarm clock which is really cool. The beds were both comfy, but the first room faced the street and had some noise early (I had to be up early anyway). In each room, I had guests staying upstairs from me at times. This was extremely loud and sounded as though they were stomping around. I requested to be moved from my second room about ten minutes after check-in because of the noise and they told me that they could not, but would ask the guest to quiet down. This was effective enough, but I did get the feeling that I would not have been moved to another room either way because they said that this would require them re-cleaning the room. Both rooms had a square cut out of the dry wall that would lift up probably for access to the electrical work. The square was cut too long, so it did not close all the way and left me feeling that, if there were any creatures in the walls, they would have easy access to my room. There were none that I saw though, so have no fear! The bathroom was small, but adequate. My first room had a serious problem with the shower though as the nob was very loose and difficult to adjust heat temp. The heater/aircon was very effective and served its purpose well. Amenities: What amenities? They have free parking and lock the gate around 12, but if you call the front they will open it for you after that. They offer free wifi which is amazingly convenient. They have satellite TV with HBO which is also nice. And they give you free coffee in the room. Location: I love it. Very quiet neighborhood. One minor incident in which the police blocked off the street and looked like they were arresting a few cars full of people, possibly gang related as it looked like an entire gang unit of cops were present, but at least they are responsive. I never felt unsafe at all, but I am used to being in very diverse neighborhoods. two blocks away is the metro and a couple blocks in either direction is amazing foods from all over the world. Value: I got a great deal online ($60/night) so for me, it was absolutely great value. This is not the normal rate, however, so I am not sure that I would pay $100/night, but it would depend on the time of year. There are some hotels downtown for that price that I would probably rather stay in, but again, it depends on the time of year. All in all, i would stay here again if I could get the same value. It was clean and comfy, which is the biggest thing to me. I could care less about how much furniture I have as long as I have clean bedding and a nice room. The whole place was very recently remodeled, so I will give them some time to work out the kinks.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cfabulous gem, modern room with fantastic bed\u201d", "Author": "VitaMinKY", "ReviewID": "UR52893530", "Content": "I found this hotel on Hotels.com and was very surprised at the price.
