{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the place,Supereb honeymoon choice My wife and I stayed from 1-4 july for our honeymoon. Service was excellent right from the pick up at the airport. We wanted to relax and chill as our wedding was just over the weekend and it turned out Villa Air was indeed the right choice. We ended up spending most of our time in the villa. We really enjoyed the outdoor concept.Everything was in good condition, in addition to efficient housekeeping which kept our villa clean and tidy daily(sometimes more than twice a day). The bathroom was very clean with good water pressure in the shower. Breakfast could be had in the villa, at the cafe or garden.Although the location was a bit remote they do provide daily shuttle service to Kuta, Seminyak, etc upon request. They also had full or half day tour packages for guests.We brought our own mosquito repellant which turned out to be redundant as the villa had its own electrical repellant in the bedroom and the 'burning' version in the bathroom and living room(replenished daily at dusk).We had a go at the spa which was very good that we made a decison to add another halfday.Lastly, we would like to thank the staff at Villa Air for our wonderful stay.", "Date": "Jul 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR769269319", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mohdnizar"}, {"Content": "Good place       The Garden", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR602551220", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Macha00"}, {"Content": "Exceptional Service and beautiful villas!! VIP treatment from the moment the hotel staff picked us up from the airport. Very attentive service staff! Staff were so attentive and efficient that we were gone from the villa for a 20 mins walk around and the make-up room service was done during that short time! Were we impressed with their exceptional customer service! Very beautiful and well maintained villas. Breakfasts served looked and tasted fantastic. Nice and quiet environment as it is a short distance away from the hustle of Seminyak streets. Villa Air Bali will definitely be our choice again the next time we visit Bali!", "Date": "Mar 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR948629259", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ZSL"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u3123\u4ef8\u9288\u5098\u5063\u9288\u88e4\u5046\u9289\ue042\u510d\u9288\u67ab\u5131\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(20980356, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR983628910", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "simogara"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u693c\u5135\u9288\u3083\u5125\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u9289\u693c\u5157\u9289\ue0ac\u7d17\u9350\u5470\ue5ca\u9288\u509b\u6e36\u6942\u6a37\u69c5   showReview(20753683, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR802201512", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5063\u9289\u581b\u511c\u9289\u66d8\u5050\u9289\u7b3a\u512a\u9289\u70bd\u5063\u93b6\u6ec5\u5162\u951b\u4f78\u3047\u6d5c\u6052\u4f04\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(20361647, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR978871583", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "aloha2cuba"}, {"Content": "\u7f0d\u6d2a\u7c35\u9287\u0441\u4ed0\u9287\u71b4\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19955633, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR151061057", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5a3f\u4eda\u9287\u6b0d\u500e\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19955561, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR943069178", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d630090-r18039970-Villa_Air_Bali_Boutique_Resort_Spa-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "630090", "Price": "$318"}}
