Guys works there are super friendly and that's pretty important, isn't it? Room we stayed was right front of the reception. Clean and comfortable but one minus point is a noise from corridor. Probably the result of the thin door but the hotel itself is an old house and could be worse. Street noise is another thing, but considering the location, well, ear plug might do good night sleep. Breakfast was a nice surprise. Definitely worth a money. Would we stay there again? Probably yes.

It's not a 5-star hotel. It's a small privately owned hotel in the gay neighbourhood of Berlin, but for the price you pay you get incredibly a lot. The guys at the hotel are super-friendly, the hotel is very clean, the design is great, and there were some really nice touches, like touch lamps, reading lamps, nice and new showers. I felt welcome. I've read complains about WiFi in some other reviews, but during my 6 day stay WiFi was working perfectly in my room. I was staying in a single room with a shared toilet, so the room was very small but conveniently laid out. I've seen the larger - double and family rooms - passing by, and those looked spacious.

On the positive side, the location is wonderful, great neighborhood for cafes and shopping. Easy to get to public transport. The hotel is in an old building with all kinds of charm and the rooms are renovated, modern and comfortable. I booked a double room for extra space and was not disappointed in the space. The breakfast for 7 Euros every morning is pretty decent and is a good way to get the meal done without alot of fuss. On the downside they seemed to always be short of towels and for a couple of nights I was denied a request for an extra towel because they had simply run out of clean towels. After a day of site-seeing I returned to my room and could not find some US Dollars that I left on my desk. I look everywhere and finally I decided that I would have to tell the front desk. I wasn't really looking to accuse their staff, but I thought that if other guests had reported missing items or cash, this might be a pattern they would need to know about. When I told the front desk person, their only comment was that the \"wind probably blew it away\" because the window may have been open. I was heart broken. I really wanted to like this place, but because of this very weak response I realized that they really did not care about my stay. Even if they think I'm making this up, what trouble would it be to actually act like they're concerned? Apparantly too much trouble. Ultimately I cannot accuse anyone of stealing the money, it was not a lot of money and I have no proof that anyone took it, but I'm so disheartened by the response to my situation that I cannot recommend this place.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat B&B right in the gay area, not a hotel though\u201d", "Author": "panagiotis123", "ReviewID": "UR102020164", "Content": "All in all our experience from ArtHotel was quite good.

Six of us were in Berlin arriving at various stages from Sat Feb 26th to Tue March 1st. Both of us that arrived on Feb 28th were put in rooms 4 and 8 respectively. These rooms were lovely. Obviously recently decorated and very well appointed. My friends (two girls... a couple) arrived on Monday the 28th Feb and were placed in a room in what seemed like a different part of the hotel. It was not recently renovated and was previously, or so they thought, a play room. It didn't even have a room number!! Perhaps this was because the hotel was full? Who knows. Then the last two arrived on Tuesday morning. They were put in a room that was VERY orange!! Obviously was in the process of being renovated as it wasn't quite finished. There was still some painting that needed to be completed around the windows. This is not a \"hotel\" in the traditional sense of the word. For example, there is not a 24 hour reception or bar etc. etc. However, the location is great for exploring all around Schoneberg and it's a 3 minute walk to the U Bhan in Wittenberg Plaz and you can also pick up all the Sightseeing buses from outside KaDeWe there too. There are some goods little restaurants around also.

That said, this was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. The bed was high and firm, the sheets silky. Large windows which were easily opened. Each room had it's own unique, bespoke welded stainless-steel bed. The large, square European pillows were great for snuggling/cuddling. The staff, Hauke and Chuck especially, couldn't have been more welcoming or more helpful. The pictures on the hotel's own website are accurate. Go for rooms 6 and 8 if you want the higher-end rooms. Room 2 if you're playful (ask the hotel about 2 and 13). At first, I was concerned about booking as I've never read a series of reviews so glowing. Barely a negative and those seemed minor. But I was more than pleasantly surprised - as was my mate who had a larger room. The location is ideal: 20 minutes or so from Tegel; right next to one of the best bars in Berlin (Prinzknecht) and, otherwise, in between a plethora of bars and the Wittenberg Church - and shopping. Close to U2, U-Bahn line as well. Definitely the first place I would consider for a return trip to Berlin.

The hotel is really close to KaDeWe Dept Store, another place we liked. The KaDeWe Food Hall on the 6th floor and is amazing. Lots of stations including champagne bars.
