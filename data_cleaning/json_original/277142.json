However, upon arrival we were informed that our accommodations were at Hotel Center-3, located a couple of blocks down the road. We were given directions in broken English and left to fend for ourselves in a crowded sidewalk. HC-3 is located on a side street and not easily visible. When we finally reached HC-3, nobody spoke English, and my Italian is very limited to profanity. To make matter worse, we had to wait almost an hour because housekeeping was still cleaning our room, and it was already late in the afternoon. The accommodation was extremely rudimentary, nothing spectacular as depicted on the website photos. We chose this hotel because of its central location. However, we\u2019d definitely stay somewhere else next time. Arrivederci! TRAVEL DATES: September-2009 LOCATION: Located near the major historical sites in Rome. Hotel itself is located on a side street which is not easily visible. POSITIVE NOTES: This hotel is somewhat similar to staying at someone\u2019s home except\u2026. NEGATIVE NOTES: \u2026..it definitely lacks the harmonic components due to poor customer service. AMENITIES: Free breakfast; Hairdryer, Clock/Radio; Private Bathroom. NIGHTLY RATE: $135+ Booked via Travelocity for a slightly lower rate. DISCOUNT ACCEPTED: None. NOTES: Please click the green \u201cYES\u201d button below if you find this review helpful.

Unfortunately I was told I had to walk my luggage and daughter back up the steps and a further 5 minutes down the road, turn right to Hotels centre 3, located about halfway down Via Achille grande. Once inside the 'correct' hotel we were greeted by somebody else who spoke no English yet started asking for \u20ac16, pointing at a printed note saying an overnight accommodation tax of \u20ac2 had been introduced in January, which I had to pay before being given a key. The shower/toilet/bathroom is the smallest room I have ever walked into. There is more room in portable toilets at festivals and building sites as they don't cram basins and showers in them. The toilet seat was the wrong size and subsequently when flushed, water splashed onto the floor.\u00a0 The shower had enough room to stand upright in but that was all. Movement was very restricted and the shower head itself hung on a poorly repaired handle and fell off with the slightest movement. In addition to this, the shutter/door to the shower didn't close shut so water gushed out onto the floor.\u00a0 As the toilet roll holder was located right outside the shutter the paper became wet and unusable. Finally, the sink leaked so even if the toilet and shower weren't used the floor was still wet. The towels provided were of the scale as the shower and totally insufficient. Babies are wrapped in larger blankets. 'Breakfast' consisted of the cheapest, bland pastries Covered in sugar to disguise the taste.\u00a0 An alternative choice of cornflakes or muesli 'style' food was on offer. I use the word 'style' as these proved even less palatable than the pastries.\u00a0 Scrambled egg and cheese \u00a0were also available \u00a0but looked quite foul and were placed close to raw meat which, as a vegetarian I wouldn't eat. And the 'juicy juice' on offer was simply cordial.\u00a0 Returning from a long hot day, we had to ask reception to turn on the air conditioning. And off again later. The TV remote was nowhere to be seen. I later found out they wanted money for it.

The hotel is close to termini station and close to the metro aswell which is realy handy and we walked to the coliseum in 10 minutes so very central, rooms in the hotel were ok the bathroom looked like something from the 80's and i had to call reception twice to come and show us how the tv worked, aparently everytime you turn it on you have to pull the plug out of the freeview box then plug it back in, dont know if this is only are room but very strange, lots of channels though english, spanish etc. We had breakfast every morning which was nice ham, cheese,bread, chocolate cakes etc only problem is ham was allways gone when we arrived which was sometimes 30 minutes after breakfast had started and when we asked the lady she just made a funny noise and 15 minutes later appeared with another tray of ham apart from that it was all good. The neighbourhood round the hotel and termini seems to be where all the chinese and indian immigrants have settled but we felt safe and never had any problems walking round the neighbourhood at night and there are a few nice restaurants near the hotel aswell.
