{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great stay at a reasonable price We looked at several hotels in the area. Staff was friendly, rooms clean and the price was right. Breakfast was as good as most. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that I am used to staying at more upscale hotels which is my own bias.

Unfortunately, Priceline does not let you enter reviews on their website. Upon arrival, the clerk was curt and unfriendly, and suspicious why I booked two rooms, even after I explained that I had a family of five with 3 teenagers and pointed out that I paid for both rooms in advance with the same credit card. My nonsmoking room smelled of smoke and the carpet and chairs were stained. The free wi-fi did not work, and the clerk could only say  I think a man came out to fix it yesterday, I'll check and call you back. Last we heard from her. Returning from dinner, there was a loud commotion in the parking lot which turned out to be the local sheriff arresting a crying, screaming young woman. I noticed the car next to me had its lights on and turned in a written description of the car and its tag number. However, the next morning I jump started the car after the staff refused to help. The driver said the clerk explained that she did not know how to find out whose car it was, although he and I both entered a description of our car when we registered. The breakfast was cereal, oatmeal, and some breads. Whole milk, no skim. The breakfast room was dirty and crowded, so we skipped it.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR897869818", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cvillediner"}, {"Content": "Disappointing for a Super 8 This is quite possibly one of the worse hotel stays that I have stayed at in a long time. The entire process, from booking over the phone to check in to breakfast in the morning was lack luster and at times down right rude.Booking the room over the phone felt like I was a horrible inconvienance to the receptionist. She was rude and abrupt with poor phone manners.When we arrived at the hotel the front desk was overwhelmed with people, there was only one person on staff to deal with check-ins and any problems/questions from guests.The ice machine was broken, the vending machines were out of pop and most items.The bed we booked was supposedly a 'Queen Sized Bed' but we only had a Double in our room. ( Measured with a tape measure to be certain, bed was 40 inches wide, a Queen is supposed to be 60 inches wide. ) Mattress was old, creaky, and uncomfortable.We were never informed of the times for start and finish of the complimentary breakfast, and when I went to get something for my wife and I a lady rudely told me 'I better hurry up' and then proceeded to take away things as I reached for them.The room was well stocked, it had a coffee maker and coffee, there were teas, and soaps. The room was fairly clean, and the television and free wifi ( used to write this review ) were nice. Location is decent, close to the Airport but not in a direct flight path, so you can get a good nights sleep.That being said there is no way I would stay at this hotel again, and I recommend that all travelers be wary and ask to see the room before you do a final booking. I've never had a Super 8 experience this bad, it is normally a franchise that I trust a great deal.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR208140936", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Daraddishman"}, {"Content": "Decent stay given the price paid I had an early flight out of SeaTac so decided to do a park and fly at one of the motels near SeaTac. Not all motels have park and fly and the Super 8 had the best price. For $100+ tax for a night including up to a week's parking, I didn't have high expectations.Check in was easy and for long term parking, there is a lot in front of the hotel and one in the back. The front lot was completely full so I chose a well lit parking spot in the centre of the lot in the back, crossing my fingers that my vehicle would still be there when I got back from my trip.The room is nothing to rave about. Basic motel room although the bathroom looked quite new and I realize that it could have been much worse. Walls are thin though so you can hear people talking in the hallways and you can hear people above walk back and forth in their rooms.Breakfast was quite extensive including various muffins, danishes, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, coffee and juice.Shuttle service to the airport is available on the half hour and it was prompt and quick. The drive is only a few minutes.On the way back, you were supposed to call for pick up from one of the courtesy phones by the shuttle pick up/drop off area but we lucked out and the shuttle just happened to drop someone off so we got picked up right away and our driver drove us to our vehicle (we were relieved to see it there!) and got our luggage and loaded it into our car. For the price, and knowing what is to be expected, I would recommend Super 8 SeaTac for a park and fly.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR809082491", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "italybound01"}, {"Content": "Decent, Convenient Overnight Airport Stay Stayed here for 2 nights. 1 night before our trip and 1 night on our return.

The front desk woke me up 2 times reference to a coupon I had. They said it was okay at check-in after a lengthy argument and phone call to a manager. Then called me out of bed to come down to tell me they would not accept it, then called the Assistant Manager again while I was there, who I spoke with on the phone, and accepted it a second time. Then had the inconsideration to call me a half hour later at 11:30 p.m; waking me from my sleep when I had to get up in 4.5 hours to catch a plane; to tell me now they would not accept it! This prevented me from a restful night and made the start of my vacation very tired. The noise from the rooms was loud, no insulation between rooms would be my guess. They did not wake me up as instructed. They overbooked the van by 3 people at the 4:30 a.m. leave time to the airport and of course everyone rushed out to fight for a seat, making an uncomfortable situation for all. This is the most disorganized motel I have ever seen. The bathroom sink did not drain, the FREE WIFI did not work. The rudeness dealing with my main issue and the indifference to other issues was not professional. She displayed a non-caring attitude and seemed used to issues; not one apology for 3 complaints. I heard 2 arguments with other guests at the front desk in the brief time I was there.

On a recent visit to Seattle, my husband and I chose to stay at this particular hotel because of the inexpensive rates, and because we've never had problems staying at Super 8's before. We weren't expecting the Ritz.... just wanted a decent clean room to sleep in. What a mistake!!!My husband woke up the following morning with what appears to be either flea or bed bug bites. We're now back at home and are taking every precaution in the book to ensure that anything that may have crawled into our suitcase while we were there is dead.I'm completely horrified with the experience. When we checked out early the next morning, the desk clerk was not the least bit helpful or sympathetic when we showed her the bite marks. Maybe this isn't the norm for this hotel - after all, you can pick up bugs in even 5-star hotels these days... it just depends on who slept there the night before you, right?

While convenient, it was NOT worth it! Checking in, the girl had a line almost out the door. She was moving very slowly and had no help.

Our room was only kind of clean--with the shower being the least clean of all. Then, all night long, people were checking in and out, and not only could you clearly hear their conversations, but in order to close a door in this hotel, they had to be slammed, so we heard the slamming all night. After only a couple of hours of sleep through all of this slamming, we checked out. A different girl was checking out and as I walked up she said, which room? I told her the number and by the time I handed her the key, she had printed our reciept. I looked at it (still groggy with door slamming), and noticed an extra safe fee on it. I told her that I noticed checking in that we could ask for that to be removed upon check out. She got very short with me, (even though there was NO line this time), and said, you can ask for that BEFORE you check out! I said, I AM checking out, and I AM asking you to remove it.
