{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Surprising Even though- as some of the reviews have pointed out the walls did need some attention and the website is not really reflective about the hotel- we found this place charming. Right across from the Palazzo Piti just 2 mins walk from the Ponte Vecchio the Sioggiorno Pitti is located on the 3rd floor of a building- (for some reason I thought it had a garden but I can't remember why). The room was massive and as well as having (a rather uncomfortable) masive double bed there was a sofa with a pull-out bed underneath. We were on a budget so chose to share a bathroom (but we think we got it to ourselves) which had a nice hot shower and a bath with no plug. The place was clean and easily accessible at all times of night (they issue you with a huge bunch of keys)We know it wasn't the height of luxury but it was good value for money (\u9227?10 for 3 nights for 2 people) and had the BEST eaterie around the corner called Casalinga and another called La Taraocchi- fantastic pizzas).", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR640790838", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Wooggle"}, {"Content": "Terrible! Worst hotel I have ever been in. Room was awful, walls were dirty and had footprints on them, somehow there were footprints on the ceiling. Electric outlets were pulled out of wall and wires were exposed. Sheets were stained. We asked for new sheets and were told it was 4 EUROS charge, even though we had just checked in and notified them about the stains on the sheets. Shared bathroom toilet would only flush once per 1/2 hour. There are much better hotels that only cost a little bit more. Owners were not friendly and spoke little English.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR815370877", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "owenk"}, {"Content": "good budget hotel This hotel is affordable and in a good location, right across the street from the Pitti Palace. It was a short walk to the Duomo and only 20 minute walk from the train station. We had a huge room with a decent bathroom. The guy at the front desk was helpful for my friend who's luggage was lost too.
