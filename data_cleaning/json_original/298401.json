Certainly I spent ten days here and never tired of looking over the busy stretch of water round that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coathanger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bridge. But the hotel is also conveniently next to a station only a couple of stops from the heart of Sydney. A more scenic route is to walk straight down from the hotel to Lavender Bay and along the waterfront to the ferry at Milsom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Point. North Sydney is quieter than central Sydney, but there is a good choice of restaurants and shops nearby and towards McMahon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Point. All that and the efficient, welcoming staff made for a more relaxing stay in the City than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expected. The rooms were clean, well stocked and everything worked. The only drawback was having to pay for the internet, which is oh, so yesterday. However, the bonus for me was the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free access to the nearby Olympic Pool (50 metre, heated, open air, laned swimming pool).

Fantastic accommodation, showcasing Sydney at its finest - this place is a hidden treasure! It is perfect proximity to North Sydney trains, Circular Quay, Blue's Point Rd, incredible restaurants, and anything you could ever hope to make a Sydney trip complete. The view is like being in a constantly moving picture of thriving, cosmopolitan activity (or an episode of Ferry Boat Fred) - which you have to peel yourself away from to experience the delights of the surrounding area. It's equally hard to peel away from the exceptionally comfortable bedding, the Blue's Bar and in-house restuarant to get out and about! In the words of the great Molly Meldrum, \"do yourself a favour\" and stay at the Harbour View Hotel.

The beds are fantastic (Rydges \"Dream Beds\" move over!) and all in all the rooms have been nicely fitted out. So now you have the great view, nice rooms and great beds.

The Decor is fairly tired and the restaurant food rather average but when you look out your window at the view of the Harbour and the Harbour Bridge - all is forgiven. So ask for a room with a view of lavender bay The rooms are a decent size. Its right next to the train line (ask for a high floor) as the trains run right under the hotel so can be a bit noisy late at night. Proximity to station is good for getting to central Sydney - only three stops. Its in business area so fairly quiet in the evening and weekend - but you so close to central Sydney its no problem. So you can eat out wherever and get back to the hotel easily. So good if you like to see the heart of the city but don't need to be part of it If you time it right its only about 30 minutes from the Airport too. If was coming to Sydney for weekend or a few days would stay here again. Its not a top notch experience, but it is reasonably priced and conveniently located.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cembarrsed dinning\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2517461", "Content": "With dissapointment two guest from Overseas two of us ordered the grain fed scotch fillet. i ordered mine as meduim rare and my guest ordered his well done. to my dissapointment the meal came out i attempted to cut the steak and found it to be like a piece of boot leather and with my exerprince in the food industry i find it very hard to believe that it was scotch fillet let alone grain fed. i then asked for the bill and observed the waiter checking to see if he had been tipped and rasing his eye browes when he saw no tip. what a diisapointment for my guest and myself the bill no was 60037 and cost for the meal was $172.90 for three people.", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Harbour View Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d298401-Reviews-Harbour_View_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">18 Lower Fort Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">The Rocks</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "298401", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6b/a0/79/filename-dsc00010-jpg.jpg"}}
