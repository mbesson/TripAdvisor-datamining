The manager, Mr. Zahed Hussien and the night manager especially, Nasia Uwulh, make this the worst possible location to come and rest your head. Don't let the low price pull you in. You will not even get what you pay for! Having the night to kill, I wandered down to the nightclub on the premise... only to be told that I am not welcome as it is Indians only... Indians only? And this went all the way up to the OWNER... Raj, arrogant and prejudiced... not in the way you'd think you would run into! I was baffled and tried to take this up to the management, only to be told, and I quote (only because I promised I would) Night Manager, Nasia Uwulh: \"We don't have time to here you're complaint, and if you want to continue, we will call the authorities and tell them you have been harassing us\" and this is AS A GEUST OF THE HOTEL!!!!! I was baffled to say the least. The evening security manager was an honest man and tried to do what he could, but in the end, he could not override the club owner, Raj and the night manager Nasia Uwulh. When all was said and done, I grabbed my things right then and there, and walked to the nearest hotel, absolutely refusing to spend the rest of the night there. After writing this, my next act of recourse is to contact dubai.tourism.ae or 80070090. I have NEVER seen this type of racism... I feel awkward crying 'racism' outside of the typical situation, but the entire hotel management got behind it... final word: DO NOT STAY HERE NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, loud music at night\u201d", "Author": "milosrb79", "ReviewID": "UR125407680", "Content": "The best part of this hotel is its location. It is just next to the Metro Station-Salah Al Din. Once you are in metro you can get anywhere. Also, Union is very close about 1.5 kilometres far and the street that connects Union and the next Metro station-Al Rigga is very close to the hotel and it is worth visiting because there are many shops, restaurants, fast food restaurants,etc. They are all on walking distance from the hotel. You can also walk to the Creek from the Hotel. Close to the hotel, in the same street is a souvenir, gift, perfume shop which is called Gift Village Discount Center,just opposite from Reef Mall. The bad part of the Royal Falcon hotel is the disco club, actually two disco clubs which are situated on the first floor.I was on the third floor and I could barely sleep.The music finished at 2 or 3 am. Then, in the lobby there are many prostitutes at night and one can pick up any of them. The room was ok. Only I had a problem with the door lock.If I turned the key once, it was still unlocked. I had to turn the key twice to lock the door which was ok for me, but the cleaning lady kept turning the key once and on two occasions I came to the room to find out that it was unlocked. So I had to write a message to my cleaning lady to turn the keys twice. Before my departure from the hotel I noticed that the problem was fixed. All in all, I wouldn`t recommend this hotel to the families with children, but to solo travelers it was worth visiting especially talking about the budget.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Tx", "Title": "\u201cUnorthodox, Different, Sexy & Cool\u201d", "Author": "Lorenzo C", "ReviewID": "UR124738381", "Content": "I stayed here back in October 2011 for ten days and was pleased with my stay. The staff was friendly, my room was kept clean, and my stay was so cheap I was able to spend more money on shopping and excursions. The metro station is less than a block away and took me everywhere I wanted to go......even the Dubai Marina!! The morning prayer in the loud speakers outside does not wake you up at 5:30am like some other hotels ( I say this with no disrespect to Muslim religion) This is not the type of hotel you stay at if you are very conservative or on a family vacation. Cheap fathers, do not bring your family here lol. You will like the Hotel if you are traveling by yourself, with your buddy, or with a girlfriend who is not conservative and likes to have fun and party. There are at least 4 clubs in the Hotel and sometimes music can be heard in your room until at 2am. Even though you could hear it, I don't think it was too loud. The music actually helped me sleep since I was by myself. The DJ's tracks were also good too lol ( I stayed for 10 days) The Hotel and area is extremely safe and you have nothing to worry about. But then again, I am very respectful and do not discriminate against anybody. One thing I did not like was I paid $24 (AED 84) a day for internet. The only option was per hour or 24 hours. It was over $10 to have it for one hour so had to accept 24hr internet since I needed it for at least a few hours within a 24hr period. If I could pause my time then $24 would have been worth it but you didn't have that option. If the Wi-fi was cheaper I would have given this hotel a better rating. The Royal Falcon is a great place to stay if you are just looking for a cheap place to sleep while you explore Dubai.

This is my 3rd stay in Dubai and i've previously stayed in 5 star hotels. This hotel is rated either a 2 or 3 star hotel and that is being generous, I wouldnt give it a star at all. I didnt dream there could be such a massive difference. All I wanted was a clean bed for the night. I arrived at the hotel to be told the lifts were out of order as there had been a fire....this worried me. My first impressions of the reception were not good but there was no one else there and I was taken to my room on the 2nd floor. I immediately saw the 'massage' sign and once in my pit of a room there was a plaque advertising massages from 11am to 3am, utter sleeze. My room was disgusting, the curtains wouldnt open and were hanging off the rails. I couldnt see out my window as there was condensation within the glass. The TV didnt work at all , the cupboard underneath had no base and I certainly wouldnt have put any of my clothing in the cupboards as it all smelt. The bathroom was equally nasty, the shower curtain was brown and didnt appear to have been replaced in years, the tap on the sink was hanging off, no plug in the bath if you could face using it. My one positive comment was it did have hot water for a shower, I needed this as the room was so incredibly cold it was the only thing that could warm me up. There was no way of controlling the air con, you couldnt even turn it off. I felt incredibly uncomfortable staying at this hotel and being a young white blonde female I felt out of place. As the lifts were not working I had to use the stairs and on each occassion there were men lurking around. Once in my room I later plucked up the courage to walk to reception to enquire about food and was told there was no onsite restaurant. I felt isolated in my room and only saw indian men and I felt worried for my safety. There were now a lot of men in reception and I was the only female there. I didnt want to venture out the hotel for food and felt it was too late to move and find an alternative, I only had to get through 1 night. Once back in my room I decided to get an early night, however the nightclub's loud music kept me awake throughout the night until approx 4am.
