On the other hand, if you are going to hang around the hotel 90% of the time, as most people do when they come for business events, this hotel is a good choice. There are not a lot of restaurant options nearby, but you can walk to a Stuart Andersons or to Fiiippi's Pizza, which serves o.k. Italian meals (the manicotti was heavy, but there was a lot of it). The restaurant in the hotel serves an excellent breakfast buffet. I had one dinner in the hotel via room service, however, and the salmon was overcooked, but I've found that most hotel chefs overcook salmon. The wine list is surprisingly good and the bar and poolside are pleasant places to consume the wine. One evening there was a wretched smell in the third floor hallway. It may just have been the result of a guest who had gas, but it imbued the entire floor. The engineer who was sent up to deal with it could not smell it . . . but I had to hurry him away because the odor from the hall was beginning to inundate my room while I held the door open to talk to him. I'm not usually bothered by smells. I have no idea what it was.

I was really caught off guard by how great this place was! The service from every employee we encoutered was excellent! Everyone was nice and helpful and smiled. The actually hotel looks like it has gone through upgrades. The thing is that with some hotels, even Marriott is guilty of this, you can tell they bought new carpet or painted but other were not upgraded. Every detail from floor to ceiling seemed new. If you are visiting San Diego and have a rental car I would recommend staying here over any hotel in Hotel Circle. As I mentioned, parking is free! It located off of the 163 minutes away from Mission Valley and 10 minutes from Balboa Park, the Zoo, Sea World, Hillcrest and downtown. Also hotels in Hotel Circle tend to be a little worn so this would be a nice luxury. Since it is near a business park it lends itself to be quieter too.

Great service from the staff, everyone was so friendly and helpful. Room was clean and modern as was the hotel itself. Actually really liked the bath products they provided. Room had a nice couch and working area, flat screen TV, and fairly comfy bed. Note to ladies: the hair dryer is in the closet. Took me a minute to find it. Bar and lounge area was nice -- our group hung out for a bit and had drinks and watched baseball on the TVs in the lounge at night. We spent the afternoon at the pool resting up for the race. Pool was a decent size and there was a huge fireplace and outdoor seating if you want to have drinks out there at night. The bar had fruit infused water (cucumber and orange) in large pitchers which was refreshing while we were at the pool. They also have free coffee at the bar 24/7. They provided a free shuttle to the race and a to-go breakfast for the runners. They also had a pasta dinner the night before for $10 which was decent and convenient. Would most definitely stay here again next year. Location is great, with easy access to multiple freeways. Parking was plentiful even though they were at capacity because of the race and some other event that was happening. And we got a really great price being part of the race as well.

We've been working with a company in the area. Somehow I've never found the time to write a review but we reached several milestones and our frequent stays are coming to an end. Of about six hotels we've stayed at during the last year, this is probably my favorite hotel in the area. The highlights are: - Beds: As in all Courtyards I find myself getting great sleep (after the first night where I never seem to sleep well away from home). - Pool: An Olympic outdoor pool. It's heated (I hope they use waste heat from some other hotel mechanicals because it probably would cost a fortune with electricity or gas), It's clean, It's almost always empty. Next to it is a spa which I've always been happy with. he spa has the usual chlorine levels but a quick swim after loosening up the muscles fixes that. - Workout room: clean, large in size and well equipped (never have had to wait for equipment during my 6:00 workouts) - Lobby: comfortable places to sit and meet up with your colleagues, clean restrooms, easy access to lounge, dining, and conference areas. Complementary coffee in the morning is pretty good. - Managers Special: (drum roll) Wednesday at 5:00 PM there is a managers special. They bring out a dozen or so bottles of wine and three or so cases of beer. Also they bring out appetizers (this last week it was BBQ meatballs and a great vegetable tray and then calamari when the meatballs ran out). Max the GM wanders about chatting with the clientele. Nice guy who has helped us get a room when rates are above per diam. There are some things I think need to be worked on: - Elevator floors: I use the elevators exactly twice, once on arrival and once on leaving, because I use the stairs as much as possible. But my co-travelers comment repeatedly on the elevators and especially the dirty floors. - Drink prices: Marriotts have never been a place to drink. Don the bar tender is great but I can't charge alcohol against travel so I have to pick up the charge. I had one drink each of three nights and bought two for my fellow traveler and it cost me just about $35. Given it is a pleasant place to have a cocktail and you don't have to drive but I think they might be pushing people to drink in their room that they might be missing out on sales of those delicious bar snacks (try the cross-cut fries with bleu cheese). Of course Marriotts no doubt runs this all through computer models and has optimized the profit which I embrace but maybe I'm not normal. - Some rooms are noisy: I don't typically have this problem because I'll ask to be away from elevators and ice machines. The only reason to stay near noise is to avoid the dreaded handicapped rooms (I don't need enough room to dance in the bathroom and rails to get off the toilet are totally unnecessary thank you). Other things: - In room: Tea and Coffee provided but if you are a tea fan you want to run several clean pots through the coffee maker or the flavor will suffer. Love the towels. Shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion are of good quality. There always seem to be some trivial stuff that is wrong (I got broken soap this trip, one shower curtain hoop was not connected). The 35 or so channels of LCD TV is excellent except they need to program the channel banners because a ESPN banners are on not only their channels but on others (room 188 had this problem on this trip but I've seen it on others). Grout is free of creepy stuff and foot fungus. The couch in this room had an obvious droop but I slipped a couple of inches over and TV viewing was comfortable. Carpet was clean. Drapes allowed you to sleep into the daylight without light bleeding into your room. Biggest complaint was that my mini-refrigerator froze everything and I could not find an adjustment to fix the problem. - Parking: Some of the places directly in front of the hotel are tight. But parking is free and there are probably about two acres. I don't like the fact that they have planters with bushes that don't allow you to walk to the building without dragging your bags over those obsticles - Breakfast: Great but I just have problems with $12 for a breakfast buffet. I'd always eat there if they had a nice bowl of fruit or yogurt over cereal for about half that price. I like to walk in the mornings so I usually walk to the north (to the left if you go out the front door). There is a Subway Sandwich shop 1/3 mile away that has good coffee and with a sandwich will cost $3. What is but can't be changed: Location: What can you say... I wouldn't stay there for personal travel. It's five or six miles to the stuff I do when not on business travel.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pomona, California", "Title": "\u201cI didn't even know it was here!\u201d", "Author": "poohchk25", "ReviewID": "UR118275439", "Content": "When my bf booked this hotel for our stay in San Diego, I was a little hesitant.

They are comfortable and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the linens nice and crisp. But my favorite part of this hotel is the food. I ordered a Turkey Burger for room service and it was one of the best Turkey burgers that I have ever had. It was well seasoned and just delightful.

Visited the Wild Animal Park and the San Diego Zoo. Check-in was a breeze and the service here is pretty good. No problems. It was a busy weekend with a lot of youth soccer kids staying for a local game, but the hotel seemed to do a great job accommodating. PARKING/LOCATION: Ample and FREE! That's a big deal in San Diego. I chose this hotel because it is close to San DIego Zoo (about 10 min away) and to a bunch of other things to do in San Diego, but it's away from everything so that you're not having to deal with traffic and crazy parking prices. Take note: The Wild Animal Park is not that close because it's located in Escondido (about 25-30 min away). We were coming from Los Angeles, so we went there first and then to the hotel. Worked out perfectly. The Zoo is better than the Park IMO. ROOM: The room was nicely decorated- pretty modern and new. Bathroom is shower/tub combo. The shower doesn't have much room on the ledge to put your toiletries and stuff. Neither does the sink area. The towels were a little thin and scratchy and the beds were pretty darn uncomfortable. I think it was the pillow. Not really sure, but the sleep quality was pretty low. There's free wireless in the room also and that's a plus. Also a nice big flat screen tv. HOTEL: The pool was hopping and bopping. Lots of people utlizing that. There's a business center with free computer use. The lobby area and lounging area is very cozy and nicely decorated. The breakfast buffet is really nice compared to other hotels. There's omelettes and everything (not just bad continental breakfast stuff). There's also a variety of restaurants near the hotel. Just ask the front to give you the paper with the list of restaurants. Note: There's a bunch of good Japanese places that are actually owned and frequented by Japanese people (that's a good sign). We ate at a Japanese BBQ place that had the best meat ever (even the Yelpers agree). Also, I took a quick glance at the room service menu and it was one of the most reasonable prices for room service food I've ever seen at any hotel. If I were staying longer, I might've tried it!

The towels were nice and fluffy and there were a lot of them. The entire room was very clean. The nicest thing about the room was that it overlooked the beautifully landscaped and huge pool and patio area. Most of the rooms in the hotel had balconies. Since my daughter was sick and needed to stay in bed as long as possible, I asked for a 1:00PM check out which they happily provided. It was nice to sit out on the patio and watch families playing in the pool. The hotel also had a very nice fitness center. There were 3 really nice treadmills, 2 stairsteppers, and 3 bikes. There were also 4-5 weight machines. What was nice is the treadmills looked out floor to ceiling windows to the beautiful patio and pool area. We ate breakfast at the restuarant and they had an all you can eat buffet for $12.50. They had everything you could possible want for breakfast included a cook who would make you a made to order omelette. The service was excellent and the food tasty. Whoever the loud partiers were the night before must have left very early Sunday as by 10:00AM the hotel was almost deserted and there were very few guests left. I had a some time to enjoy the property since we didn't have to leave until 1:00 and all of the staff I encountered were very nice and friendly. In addition to the restaurant, there is a bar and a little counter that sells drinks, fruit, snacks, and I think Starbucks. The Starbucks was closed when I was walking around. The hotel is right in the middle of an office park area and I didn't see any restuarants or stores close by so it was nice they had the little store and a restaurant on site. I was really worried when we got here, but the hotel ended up being very nice and relaxing and I have booked another stay there in May.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, MD", "Title": "\u201cStay here often - good business hotel\u201d", "Author": "User73", "ReviewID": "UR13304377", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel more than a dozen times in the past two years while on business.

However, as I said this was our choice and no reflection of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was $10 and easily worth it. The only complaint we had, was the pool area. It is VERY small, and while we were staying there, a group of girls softball teams were staying there. They would come in from the games and jump into the pool fully dressed in their dirty uniforms, and no one stopped them.
