I had high expectations for the room, given it was a studio room, and having looked at the photos on the website of the studio they were advertising, it looked very nice and spacious. Arriving at the hotel, the service was impeccable. The public areas of the hotel are beautiful, and the staff are friendly and attentive. The room however, was a little disappointing. Although the room was lovely and was very clean, there were just a few things that I felt let it down, and made it not quite 5 star luxury it was billed as. I actually had to ask if we had been put in a studio room, as I thought it was a little smaller than expected. There was far too much furniture in the room, and you had to be careful not to bump into the table or the chair when walking through the room. The furniture itself was on the verge of needing replaced, being quite chipped and worn, where people had obviously walked into it! The room lamps didn't match at either side of the bed, and the pictures on the wall next to the bed were hung so low that the huge bedside lamp completely obstructed them. It just looked a bit thrown together and lacking in attention to detail. Although the bedding seemed to be changed everyday, on 2 of the days the duvet cover had rips in it, which just looked shabby. The blanket covering the bed also had a stain on it, but as I never used it I couldn't be bothered asking for a new one. The room temperature was also a problem. It was not warm! Although we had the air con turned up full heat and the blower turned down, the room remained cool the whole time we were there. I asked reception if it could be adjusted, they looked into it and said they had 'fixed' it, but they obviously hadn't, as there was no change in the room temp. Breakfast was very nice, and the cooked breakfast was very good. No buffet, just 2 choices if you book the deal on the website - a cooked breakfast with toast OR pastries, or a continental, which came with both toast AND pastries. I thought this was a rather odd way to do things, making the guest having the cooked breakfast choose whether they wanted toast or pastries. In all the hotels I've stayed in, toast is standard! Just seemed a bit mean to me! But that was a small niggle, overall, the food was lovely and a nice dining experience. We were meant to have a glass of champagne on arrival, but this was missed by the staff checking us in. When we were checking out, we were asked if we had enjoyed our champagne, to which we replied we didn't get our champagne. The staff member was very apologetic and the manager has since offered us a bottle of champagne on our next stay though. While we were there, the communication lines were unfortunately cut by the construction work in the building next to the hotel. We had no phones, TV or internet for 2 days. Although the management did apologise, and it obviously wasn't anything the hotel could fix, it would have been nice to have been offered something to make up for this. A complimentary drink in the bar for example. But nothing was offered. Although it was a small inconvenience for us as we were on holiday and out sightseeing during the day, it would have been very inconvenient for anyone on a business trip, for example. In summary, the room was very clean, good service and food, and a beautiful hotel. But there were just too many little things that made this hotel feel not quite up to the 5 stars it has. I would say, it was more like a 4 star.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cImpressive... and love the Fedora!\u201d", "Author": "Member100", "ReviewID": "UR124563501", "Content": "From the Fedora-clad doorman to the stunning dome, I immediately felt I was going to like Threadneedles. I was assigned a large room down a side corridor with only one room opposite (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d requested a quiet one), with a very comfortable bed (only one demonic scatter cushion), proper usable desk, lots of power points including a European one, and a big armchair with footstool. The room itself was quiet and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear much apart from occasional distant door slamming, and the person in the room opposite (more below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). There was a massive bathroom - one of the nicest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in hotels, with a separate rainhead shower to the bath (which also had a handheld shower) and generous amounts of gorgeous Korres toiletries. Some additional nice touches: magazines in the bathroom (Instyle, FHM, not boring tourist ones), a choice of free still or sparkling water for the night, curtains properly shut during turndown so that no light peeped through, and some small suggestions around the room of room service offers and treats, which were subtly done. Two irritants that can be addressed: 1) The bathroom has large opaque windows with no blinds and an opaque glass door. As a result, light streams through from very early in the morning. Easily solved by blind on the door. I gather they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing a soft refurb, so hopefully they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll address this. 2) A nutty person in the room opposite having a screaming one-sided row until about 1am. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as loud once I was round the corner in bed, but still irritatingly and definitely audible. Not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d so love a door/double door to the room that blocks out corridor noise\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Having said that, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been someone vaguely considerate opposite, then it would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been more than ok.

We had a lovely dinner on the Friday in the restaurant (Bonds) and bar meals on the Saturday (the restaurant is closed over the weekend). The cocktails are many and varied. This area of London shuts down at weekends so its beautifully quiet. Shops, bars, restaurants are only a short bus/tube ride away. We walked to the Guildhall to see the Roman amphitheatre and the art gallery, to St Paul's (and a nice lunch) followed by the excellent Museum of London. All walkable. And for us the magic continued with snow. Breakfast (included on our deal) was very good. If you are on a deal you have a choice of continental or cooked. I was slightly disappointed that i couldn't have my usual cereal followed by poached egg- but never mind. All in all an excellent weekend destination.

My room was very modern, spacious, clean and had a very nice modernized but classy decor. The bathroom is large and has a shower and tub. The bed was very comfortable as well. The lobby is quite classy and the lounge/dining area is very well done with beautiful wood furniture and finishings - you really feel like you are in an upscale London hotel, that feels old but looks new (if that's possible!).

The whole hotel is beautifully decorated, the lobby has the most amazing ceiling. The room was huge and had everything you could ever need in a hotel room, the view was of the building next door, not that shocking in london and to be honest...it didn't matter and didn't detract from the room or the experience at all. We had read before staying there that the breakfast was worth staying there alone....not a lie! The breakfast was very good, although the included package means you can choose either cereals and pastries or a cooked breakfast, there was more than enough with either choice that you didn't need both and if you choose the cooked option you can have either toast or pastries with it so it's like getting both anyway.

Off of this is a sizeable bar and onto Bonds restaurants where breakfast is held. Oposite the reception desk are two leather lined and quite classy lifts to all floors. The lifts open into a dim yet warmly lit corridor with rooms off in an initially quite complex pattern. We had a lovely sized room with a small lounge area, king size bed, good closets and a well proportioned bathroom with bath and shower. All of the room fitments were of good quality and worked perfectly. The view from the room was a little dissapointing being the stained glass dome above the lounge, however it was a minor point. The staff were all excellent and from check in to breakfast we couldn't fault them at all. We arrived at 10.15 am and they still managed to sort our room out even though we didn't expect it.

The lobby unlike most hotels has a serious wow factor the hotel is in a historic building and it is amazing.

The location of this hotel means you probably won't get any views from the bedroom windows and if you do it will be of an office building, however if your here on business that shouldn't be a problem although on leisure then it's alaways good to have some sort of view. The bedroom is very good with lovely bathroom with seperate shower, with good good toileteries and a tv for those who want one in the bathroom. The bed is particularly comfortable. The only minor challenge i would have is the tv in the bedroom is very small but today's standards it wasnt a problem for me as I went out that evening but I think i wouldn't be happy if I spend the evening watching it.

There was a tube station quite close, and we also took advantage of how close the hotel was to the London and Tower Bridge as we took the opportunity to walk across both of them. The rooms themselves were of a good size, but found the lighting in the room to be a bit of an issue. There was a burnt bulb in the bathroom, but the lighting in the room was quite dim in general, especially for getting ready. Michael, the manager who oversaw our stay was very helpful, and got maintenance to fix the light as well as bring in an extra light, which helped a little. Michael was very accommodating during our stay, and even gave us some directions, and restaurant/pub suggestions which we appreciated. Also within the room they had some fantastic magazines about London, which was neat, especially being a first time visitor to London. There were some great suggestions for sightseeing, eateries, events, etc. It was a nice touch. Also, during our stay I noticed that they had some really neat personalized touches within the room. You could order a movie and they would bring ice cream and popcorn for a small charge, as well as rose petals in the bathtub with champagne/cognac. I wish that my trip was longer so I could have enjoyed one of these! Contrary to other reviews of this hotels location, we found on the weekend that there was quite a bit of activity.

We arrived just after 5pm and I immediately understood why my colleague had like the place so much. The lobby is beautiful with a large domed glass ceiling but also a really homely feel (not sure how they meneged to achieve this as no expense has been spared on the glitz & glamour of the surroundings). We were pleased to be told we had been upgraded (probably because of our anniversary) and made our way up to our room. Because this hotel in in The City, it was pretty quiet & we didn't see another guest until the morning. Our plan was just to relax in the room as we'd been to St. Paul's on the way to the hotel & planned to go to Tate Modern the next day. And what a great room it was - huge super-king sized bed, lots of lovely pillows, dressing gown & slippers each, complimentary choclates & a well-stocked mini-bar. The bathroom was also fantastic & great water-pressure (odd thing to say perhaps but I love having time for a bath when I'm away from home & the tub filled up within a couple of minutes). We ordered some food from room service which was delivered promptly & was all delicious but especially liked the Threadneedles Club sandwich. Had a good read of the provided magazines & books, then fell into the best nights sleep I've had in ages. I don't know what the matress-topper was made of but I want one! Received our complimentary newspaper as planned the next morning & after a couple more hours lazing around we checked-out to go sight-seeing. Great Portugese chap on reception who was extremely efficient in processing our bill whilst simultaneously discussing various European footballers with my husband. We would have had breakfast at the hotel (it certainly sounded delicious) but we were keen to get to the Tate before the crowds.

We were told that we could park temporarily outside the hotel, that someone would be there to help with the cases, and tell us where to park the car. I assumed this meant that they have a door person on hand to assist. Not so. I got out of the car quickly with our two suitcases and had to drag them through the door.

Our problems began when on arriving back at 2:30pm on the second day to find that the rooms had not been serviced. At 4:00pm a note were pushed under the door saying they had tried to service the room and were unable to do so. We were instructed to contact the front desk if we would like our room servicing. We did, but and when we returned from a night out, we found the room only adequately serviced. No toilet roll had been replaced, water had not been left and the sink was unclean. There were also very few TV channels as all of the Sky channels were not working. I tried to so ignore the short comings and chose to try and enjoy the rest of the stay. It was the next day when we arrived back at 4:30pm from sightseeing to once again find the room not serviced and that we had run out of toilet paper that I really became dissatisfied with this hotel. We once again had to arrange our own servicing. This servicing, again, was very poor. Only one glass and one bottle of water was replaced. The TV was still not working so I called the front desk to be told that there was a problem (I knew this as I was the one calling them about it!) and that it would not be rectified until after the weekend. I did make my concerns known about the service we received and was given an apology and a promise they would investigate our complaints.

Upon my return from lunch I found a handwritten welcome note from the manager - which to be fair was a really nice touch, as were the personalised business cards. One thing that was very annoying was the fact that the hotel seems to cut off all service to your phone! A friend of mine in town couldn't reach me all afternoon because my phone had no service. The second I stepped out the hotel, I got a flood of texts and messages... bit late by then! I went out in the evening... and came back to my hotel room late to find there had been no turn down service and no bottle of water. In fact, no one had been near my room. Now, I don't want to be picky but if you're staying in a hotel of this calibre, you do expect certain standards of service, particularly when they ask you at check in about it. Anytime I've stayed at the Mandarin, whenever I've gone out at any time - be it for half an hour or several hours - when I've come back, someone has attended to my room and put out fresh water for me and things like that - and that's in addition to their excellent turn down service... so not to even get the basics at this hotel was really disappointing. In the morning - there was no newspaper delivered either. Again - a minor point but still disappointing. As I said, I wanted to like this hotel. I can see why people love it - as on many levels it is great. But the attention to detail on my trip was lacking and at at hotel like this, you expect the attention to detail to be superb. If I had another function to go to in the area I might give it a go again, but I'd expect them to raise their game. If you are a 5 star hotel in London - you have to live up to that - because the other 5 star establishments in London are going all out to deliver the best. I have indicated that I would recommend the hotel to a friend because it's not a BAD hotel; if you've got business or a function in the city then it's a great location and nicer than other options. As I say - I was just disappointed.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cAlmost perfect\u201d", "Author": "vokese", "ReviewID": "UR60268533", "Content": "We stayed here over the Easter break, first time in this hotel.

We got a good rate since it was a weekend and the hotel is in the business district. Its really central being steps from Bank tube but discreetly located in a townhouse facade. We had a very warm welcome on arrival from Romeo (who continued to give excellent customer service throughout our stay) and were checked in quickly. I had emailed in advance to ask that we have a quiet room on account of my pregnant status (no late night clubbing for us) and in fact they gave us a complimentary upgrade which is always a lovely touch. Our room was fab, huge comfy bed with quality linens, separate lounge area, sliding doors to large bathroom with big walk in shower, candles and arran aromatic toiletries. Decor is modern, lots of wardrobe space, minibar, ipod dock etc etc everything you would need. We dined out that night and later wished we hadn't since we had a mediocre meal in a local restaurant. The next morning our breakfast at THreadneedles was FABULOUS - probably the best hotel breakfast I have ever had - and if that is an indication of the restaurant standard then an evening meal must be recommended. The bar attached to the hotel is elegant and classy (though small) and we enjoyed several drinks in there. The hotel lobby has beautiful domed ceiling and is a pleasant place to read magazines/books it also has an honesty bar. We had a wonderful stay at this hotel and hope to return. Brian Tapson the hotel manager followed up with a personal email, and a few months later I contacted him by email to ask about a room for my brother and his wife who were caught up delays at Gatwick. He replied quickly and arranged a room for them - when they arrived their bedroom was \"decorated\" in rose petals and they were made to feel very welcome. Top service Brian! - thank you.

There is an honesty bar around the central area (well stocked and a really nice touch) with sofas, chairs and tables and complementary magazines with a beautiful stained glass domed ceiling which is very impressive. The hotel bar is equally well appointed with contemporary furniture and moody lighting and I can definitely recommend the cocktails. The rooms are well sized with more contemporary furniture and an excellent bathroom including a TV you can watch whilst in the bath - nice!

The location for the hotel is fantastic - right in the centre of the city within 2m walk of bank and within a 10m bus ride of the value and nice restaurants of the east end - think Indian food. It's also a place where you can get to Oxford Street by tube or bus withtout a problem. The hotel itself; I was totally blown away by the quality of the decor and the furnishings. I had a double room - which my invoice has marked as \"LUX\" (which I'm assuming was luxury) but I think I was booking 'standard'. Perhaps it was a free upgrade - who knows. The room looked like it belonged in an upmarket house and didn't look like a hotel room at all. The things that stood out for me in the hotel were a. The bed linen was all fresh and high quality. THere was none of this white sheet that you usually get between you and the actual duvet (a short cut for hotel staff to keep their covers cleaner for longer). The bed was super comfortable - I had a backache that had persisted for a week, but the bed let me drift off within minutes of trying to sleep. b. We left the room for 1hour to get something to eat, and even though we'd messed the bed up just unpacking - housekeeping had come in and retidyied it!!! I was so blown away. And they left complimentary sparkling water and still water too. c. The toiletries were just lovely and great becuase we got a chance to freshen up before we left the hotel and there was enough for 2 - 3 showers without needing a replacement. d. The ambience of the room was lovely and there was a plasma tv in the shower (which incidentally was marble throughout). All in all, I can't find fault with the hotel and for the price I paid, I can't believe how fantastic it was. I may never stay there again, but only because I like to get a broad experience of hotels - and that means trying other hotels instead. However, if I was a frequent visitor to London, I would definitely stay there, and I have a feeling, that I was lucky to have lost my first choice hotel.

For our most recent trip to London, the rate for this hotel was pretty good compared to comparable West End hotels so we figured after several visits to London staying a little out of the way would be just fine for us. The hotel is very nice and attractive. The lobby has an outstanding handed painted glass dome that is very beautiful. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contemporary d\u00c3\u00a9cor is warm and relaxing and flows throughout the property. We had an executive room which is several room sizes up from the smallest room. It was a good size room but a little smaller then we thought it would be. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was great, with nice earth tones and cool looking light fixtures that gave off a soft glow. The TV was too small and placed in a tall cage that blocked your view unless you were in the bed. Although not that important to us, it should be noted that the TV channel selections also were very limited when it came to foreign stations. The room also was beginning to show some minor wear and tear. Some nice artwork was on the walls, and overall it was a pleasant room to relax in. The large limestone bathroom was very nice with separate shower, heated towel rack, and flat screen TV. The one area that needs some improvement at this hotel is service. It was very inconsistent. Since it is a small hotel, it seems the front desk staff does everything from concierge to telephone operator. Some members of the staff were very good, some were not. The turn down service was also inconsistent, but when it was done right, it was very nice with a bucket of ice, large bottle of water and a lit candle in the bathroom. We stayed for seven nights so we had the chance to experience the area during the week and weekend. It is very quiet on the weekends with almost every store in the immediate area closed. The best place to go if you need something is Liverpool Station, a ten minute walk. During the week, the area is very active during the day but gets quiet fast at night. The Bank tube station is a three minute walk with multiple lines that can put you in many tourist areas in ten minutes. If you are a first time visitor to London, you may not want to stay here. If you have been to London before, this location could work out well for you. London is a very busy and crowded city, especially in the main tourist spots. A stay at Threadneedles allows you to stay at a nice modern design hotel, in a relaxing area, yet with access to all the fun pretty quickly via a great tube system.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taunton", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Honesty Bar\u201d", "Author": "Propatria", "ReviewID": "UR11549039", "Content": "This is without doubt the finest hotel that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.

From the moment you enter the hotel from the bustle of Threadneedles Street you are enveloped in a calming opulence that both stimulates and soothes the senses. Your eyes are drawn to the magnificant stained glass dome as the attentive staff invite you to sit down as you check in. You are then guided to your room that is so superior to the ordinary that it beggars belief. But it's the touches that make this hotel so special. Like the complimentary business cards that you receive on arrival informing friends and associates that you are in residence, or the champagne, strawberries and rose petal bath that can be arranged for the romantics. And make sure you have a meal in the restaurant- Brownes, it is outstanding and one of London's best kept secrets. As is the bar wihich is a hive of activity in the early evening as brokers and bankers converge after a busy day. And if you come in late then head to the Honesty Bar and help yourself to whatever you like. And if you are honest (like me) write it down in the book and then settle into the sumptuous chairs under the dome to the gentle sound of Cafe del Mar and pass the late evening in the company of friends.

We have stayed in many similarly rated hotels in London and this was definately the best. We highly recommend it for tourists and business travellers. The hotel is a beautiful building both inside and out. It is lavishly decorated and the hotel has made the most of the building's period features. We booked a studio suite and were suitably impressed when we saw our room. It was very spacious, modern yet lavish decoration, and had everything you could expect from a 5 star hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel, however the restaurant looked impressive. Staff couldn't be more helpful. The hotel is quite pricey, however we would definately choose to stay in this hotel over other 5 stars in London. As it is in the heart of the City, the shops in the area are closed at weekends and it is very quiet, so it's helpful that it is so close to Bank station and it is very easy to get to all the major tourist attractions. We felt that the quality of the hotel was far superior to the 5 stars in more convenient loations, such as Mayfair or Oxford Circus etc for a similar price. The only downside to this hotel is that similarly to other prestigious hotels in London, the hotel does not have it's own car park. It is quite difficult to find. (A valet service would definately be helpful.) We parked in 140 London Wall Car park - which is at the London Wall Museum and is about a 10-15 minute walk away from the hotel. This car park was quite a find as it was a fixed fee of \u00c2\u00a33 for overnight parking at weekends. We are used to paying \u00c2\u00a320 to \u00c2\u00a330 per day in central London!

The location was excellent for me and my friend, as its a short (15 min) taxi ride to High Holborn (and shorter still to St. Pauls Cathedral), where you could get out and grab a tube to Covent Garden or even walk from Holborn to Covent Grden or Leicester Square. The hotel is also close for The Gherkin and Lloyds of London buildings, for those interested in modern architecture. The building is a former banking house, and the owners have refurbished it into a sleek, comfortable, modern yet welcoming style. There is lots of lovely walnut everywhere, and the rooms are really luxurious. We booked a deluxe double room but were delighted to be upgraded to room 106, the Shackleton Suite. The bed was huge, the bedlinen stylish and comfortable and it was very comfortable and quiet. The bathroom had a large bath and big shower, and lots of lovely Korres toiletries, as well as robes and fluffy towels. There was a sitting area with a flatscreen tv, wi-fi for internet connection and a CD/DVD player in the bedroom! The air con worked perfectly, and there was everything we could possibly need. You receive complimentary mineral water and a lighted candle on turn-down, and papers too. We found the staff to be very attentive (the front reception staff stand up when you first arrive and when you approach from the lifts...we felt like royalty, but it was clearly part of the hotel's approach to providing courteous and attentive service....other hotels should take note! Threadneedles Hotel has got it sussed!), friendly and accomodating. The wi-fi internet access on our t.v. didn't work, so they sent a porter immediately. When he couldn't fix it, they allowed me to have internet access from the reception office and did not charge me a cent. The breakfast was delicious - again, the attention to detail was excellent (the cooked breakfast was laid out beautifully on the plate and tasted great, so they got it right on presentation and quality.)
