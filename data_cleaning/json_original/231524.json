The directions given in the hotel's website were very good. The hotel is located in a central avenue in Barcelona, not far from Las Ramblas or Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya. The \"metro\" station is near the hotel and not hard to find. There are also some bus connections available. Next to the hotel you can find a Burger King and a KFC, as well as several caf\u00e9s and restaurants. There are some supermarkets and convenience stores nearby (LIDL is at a five minute distance from the hotel, in case you want to buy some groceries). The people working at the reception as well as the cleaning ladies were very nice. They were very helpful whenever needed, and prompt to answer any request we might have. The bedroom was nice, well furnitured, with all the basics you might need. The safe was a plus, in case you want to save something valuable. There was a LCD TV, which seems to have replaced the old TV sets you see in some of the old pictures from the hotel. There is cable TV, though almost every TV channel is either Spanish or dubbed into the Spanish language, which is a big downer and a disappointment if you understand nothing of the language. Needless to say the TV will be of no use unless you know Spanish or Catalan. The alternative is to listen to music in one of the two TV music channels or watch the news channels (the only couple of channels in English that were not dubbed). When the reservation was made it was said that the bathroom had shower and bathtub facilities. There was a shower, but no tub. The bathroom is very nice though. It was obvious they had had recent renovation work done. One of the things that was not so good was the fact that renovation was being done in other rooms, especially in the morning (when people are supposed to be sleeping). The hotel had notes apologizing for the inconvenience, which was very thoughtful of them, but still, it would have been nice to know of it before we got there. Plus, renovating during a low season would probably be a better option (but of course we have o idea what was behind the decision to do it at that precise moment). The room was always clean, the cleaning ladies did a good job making sure everything looked nice and neat. The hotel faces either the small street or the building behind it, so there is nothing amazing about that. But then again, you are not paying a five star hotel with a great view over the ocean. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, so I have no comments on that. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a friend.

As other reviewers have said, the rooms are indeed on the smaller side, but on holiday how much time do you spend in your room, you're out doing things like sightseeing and eating are you not. I'd say the best thing is probably the location, close to Metro lines 2 & 3, the actual parallel stop is about 3 minutes away on foot, and this opens up the vast majority of the city for the major sights, many of which happen to have a stop on lines 2 & 3. For example, the bottom end of La Rambla is one stop down line 3, you get off at Drassanes. The rooms are immaculately clean, everything works, and the staff are efficient. I can't comment on the breakfast as I eat out. Traffic noise is present, but later at night not too intrusive, unless you're a really light sleeper in which case I'd say look elsewhere. Another large plus is the realistic and reasonable price, which in an expensive city like Barca has to be a consideration. There are plenty of restaurants within a sensible walking distance, so eating is easy. The only thing I would advise you of is their policy regarding room keys, you hand it in each time you leave the hotel and collect it on the way in, asking for room xxx number. There was no particular policy in place that i could see confirming the identity of the person asking for the key, and with the changes of staff by night and day in theory someone random could obtain a key for anyone's room. It didn't bother me that much, but I am careful to take anything of value or importance with me and keep it on my person in a zipped pocket, as long as you're sensible, I consider the likelihood of being mugged less probable than having something taken from the room. There is a safe in the room anyway, so valuables can be kept locked away if necessary. Don't let this put you off, just be aware of it and ask yourself if you're happy with it. Anyway, as I say, I would return here without hesitation, the pluses are greater than the negatives, and Barcelona is such a fabulous city that using this hotel would help to enhance your experience.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucks", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "davecave", "ReviewID": "UR103848671", "Content": "This is a fantastically easy hotel to find, just a 5 min or less walk from Parallel Metro stop, which is just 2 stops from Las Ramblas.

The breakfast was adequate, not a huge array of choice, but more than enough to see you through until lunchtime. There are an abundance of theatres on this stretch of road, so if that's your thing you're in the right area. There are some great little authentic spanish cafes too, selling real spanish tapas and beer at real prices. To be honest when you're in Barcelona you don't really want to spend too much ime in your hotel anyway. Make sure you visit Las Ramblas, from where you can connect relatively effortlessly to all the major sights i.e. La Sagradia Familia, Guell Park, Port Vell, Gaudi House, Dali Museum etc etc etc. there is a million things to do here, and on top of all that it's by the sea.

What happened was that I had booked three nights via hotwire at the H10 Marina for about $70 per night, but then I realized we were going to stay a 4th night in Barcelona but couldn't extend for the same rate at that hotel, so I thought: Okay. I will test hotwire. I will pick the hotel that I would have picked if I hadn't used Hotwire. So, for about the same price (or about $10 less per night, same ballpark) I picked this place based on price/location/reviews. Let's just say it there was NO comparison, we missed the H10 the minute we walked in the door here and even more when we got up to our musty, ugly little room. It wasn't awful, but it was not appealing. You feel like you are in a budget hotel, which you are. You have to leave your key at the front desk every time you leave the hotel. It's just kinda old fashioned and basic. The location is decent. It is near a metro stop. Funny thing was, from reading the reviews here and on venere, I thought that this hotel was very well situated and that the H10 marina was further out and would be less convenient to the city center. But actually, they were equidistant to the city center, just in different directions. This was west by a 10-15 minute walk to the center (I'm using the Gothic quarter /Picasso Museum as the epicenter) and the H10 was 10-15 min walk to the East of the center. So not much difference. This place has a computer that you can use for free internet in the lobby, thats a big plus. It's also near a famous tapas bar that was on my list Quimet & Quimet. But when we went there after a really busy sightseeing day, and I saw how crowded it was and there is no seating, I couldn't deal, I needed to sit and relax, so we ended up going to a different place to eat. (The Cafe L'Academia which was utterly fantastic). The air conditioning worked really well, is another plus. The shower had good pressure and didn't spill all over the bathroom,(my only real complaint at the h10). But the room had a bit of a musty smell and the bedding was not very comfortable. I could hear drunk people coming back late at night that woke me up. I didn't feel as safe in this hotel as the other, though it wasn't super sketchy or anything. Basically, if you NEED this price point and can't find a better deal, it will suffice. But if you are thinking \"it looks pretty nice! Why pay more?\" , I urge you to consider doing a bit more research, because it is not a room you will enjoy coming back to.

The rooms are very small, the beds rock-hard and the bathrooms look worn down. It was clean though and everything (tv, lights, shower) worked. There is no form of luxury whatsoever, so if you're looking to rest or have a romantic weekend, go elsewhere. Also the walls are pretty thin, you can hear most of the things your neighbours say. The airconditioning wasn't working (hot air only) so it got very warm in the room. We couldn't leave the windows open because of the noise of the Av. del Paral-lel nearby. With the windows closed the noise is bearable, it didn't bother us during the night. Breakfast was OK, nothing fancy but enough of everything. TV has only one English channel (SkyTV), the rest is Spanish and Catalan. The hotel is close to public transport (Paral-lel station just 200 meters away) and there are ATM's, bars and fastfood-restaurants around the corner.

We could hear the people in the room next to ours clear conversations all through the night, on a weeknight at 3am. A call to reception did nothing. Additionally, I second the reviewer who said the front desk staff were lacking personalities. I know it's a 2 star hotel but I couldn't even get one of them to call our tour company to confirm our Montserrat tour the next day. He just pointed to a payphone and even as I returned several times to ask questions on how to dial from inside the city, etc. he had no answers. I got another staffer to agree to make the call for me later that day, I left all my info with him and he would \"call the room later today.\" Yeah, we never got that call.

Some of the reviews I'd read and pictures I saw made me think it would be ok but others weren't so good and I was still worried. I need not have been. Yes, it's not the four star hotel that I would normally look to stay in for a week or more's holiday, but it more than deserves it's two stars, to be honest, I would happily give it three. Arrival and check in was quick and painless, the reception staff were very efficient and spoke good English - particular thanks to Fran who was a very helpful young man indeed. We found our room to be very pleasant indeed, sadly it smelt of smoke but it wasn't bad enough for us to feel that we needed to switch rooms. Yes there were small things that some travellers might have taken photos of and posted on here, a bit of plaster missing from the corner of the concrete post in between the beds for instance, but frankly, for a two star hotel, it was more than adequate. The rooms were exceptionally clean and had everything we needed for a weekend - no tea/coffee making facilities but there was a mini-bar if you don't mind paying mini-bar prices. There were even toiletries in the bathroom which I'm not sure you'd expect to find in a two star property? There was a safe in the spacious wardrobe. Beds and pillows were very comfortable indeed and the rooms had air conditioning. I'd read some reviews that said this hotel wasn't in a very good location for eating out. Well, it is in easy walking distance of everything I can think you'd need. An easy 10 minutes to the Bus Turistic stop by the marina for instance, 10 minutes to La Rambla and about 20 to 30 minutes to the fountains (yes we walked it there and back!). There are places to eat within a couple of minutes walk and we felt safe even when we were walking around late at night (two female travellers!). It's a great place to stay if you wish to visit the two theatres in Ave Parallel as they're only about 5 mins max walk. The breakfast room seemed a lot smaller than I'd expected but was never more than half full and served a very acceptable continental style breakfast.
