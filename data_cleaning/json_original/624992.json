We were unable to get in and were still charged 80% of overall bill since we didn't cancel 7 days in advance. We are still disputing thier charges. This is NOT a hotel that we would recommend to ANYONE!", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gotland", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d624992-Reviews-Hotel_Gotland-Berlin.html", "Price": "$71 - $130*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Franzstrasse 23</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Lankwitz</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12247</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "624992", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3d/4d/3d4dafea9648ae5578a86f476215acfe1large.jpg"}}
