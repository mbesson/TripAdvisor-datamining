We were in room 107, slight disappointment with the bed as it turned out to be 2 singles pushed together but overall it was good. The room consisted of Mini bar, wardrobe, tea and coffee making facilities, desk/sideboard and 2 bedside tables. The bathroom had great water pressure, clean reasonably spacious bathroom with over bath shower modern facilities, shower gel/soap/lotion is provided along with a very very slow hair dryer. Breakfast is available for 11E which as i rarely eat first thing I felt to be overpriced so didn't bother but it looked perfectly acceptable if you are a breakfast eater, cheese, charcuterie, bread, croissants fruit and cereals. As you can expect for a centre location there was an element of noise, the is a church of the opposing corner...this means bells....over Easter there were lots of bells...but they don't last long. Catch the metro to st Michael/notre dame and it's a 5 minute walk along the seine to the hotel, there's a 8-8 a couple of bakers and other shops nearby, plenty of restaurants to pick from.

My wife and I just stayed there for three nights this past weekend. Here are the reasons why I wouldn't stay here again. First, the (room) wall is so thin you can hear the next room\u2019s casual conversations. Not laughing, not partying, not screaming. You can hear them talking in a normal, average conversation. I know Parisian hotels are small but this was bit too much. And yes, the rooms are very small. Second, there is a church right across the street. And the church bell rang early in the morning (sometime between 7 and 8 am). Every morning. My wife and I happened to find this charming, so we didn\u2019t mind it. But, if you are the type that would be bothered by being woken up by a church bell that rings 67 times (I counted it once) for over a couple of minutes, every morning, then this AIN\u2019T your hotel !!! Just for the sake of a select group of readers for whom this may be relevant, I feel I need to mention this even though it didn\u2019t bother us that much. Third, the night custodians at the front desk ranged from \u201cnot helpful\u201d to \u201cshady.\u201d The \u201cnot helpful one\u201d -- one night, the room temperature was too cool, and the room thermometer did not work, so I asked for an extra blanket. He looked around the basement, and said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have one.\u201d I asked, \u201chow could a hotel not have extra blankets?.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and walked away. The \u201cshady one\u201d \u2013 there was this smooth talking guy with a beard who was at the front desk on two of the nights we were there. (He had a lage mole smack on the front of his nose, so beware of this guy.) He kept trying to push various services on us, even to the point of our being uncomfortable refusing his offer. He tried to get us to go to a restaurant, giving us his card with his name on it, telling us to be sure to mention his name to the restaurant. He tried to get us to use a specific taxi company to go to the airport. We relented and used his taxi company, and it ended up costing us 15 euros more than the going rate. Shame on us, but we got tired of being harassed and had to get him off our back late at night. The management should fire this guy, but then it didn\u2019t seem like there was any management in charge during the day. Never saw anyone seeming to be \u201cin charge\u201d of this establishment, and it showed. Fourth, this place must be near or above the subway. Yes, we could hear the subway cars from below and the room seems to shake at times. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but I couldn\u2019t figure out any other reason for such a noise. So, if I am wrong and there is no subway nearby, then there is something else nearby that makes noises like a subway at various times during the night and day. I\u2019ll leave it to future readers to figure that part out. I know it wasn\u2019t the elevator, b/c I checked that. Anyway, the noise was irritating. There are other reasons, but I\u2019ll stop here. At the price range for this hotel, there are other hotels in the area that are much better. I found a few while I was walking around and checked the rates, and my suspicion was confirmed. I could have done much better at the price range this hotel was available.

Only a few downsides that are relatively minor - this hotel has the smallest elevator you've ever seen. Breakfast was not included, but we much preferred going out to the nearby cafes anyway.The wifi, although free, required you to enter your password every single time which was a bit annoying. And one of the staff members neglected to give me my wake-up call, but it was exceptionally early. He redeemed himself by making sure my taxi to the airport was prompt.

Beautiful old church with bells walking you up but we didnt care because it got us up and out into a wonderful city. The Rue Mouffetard one of the oldest streets in Paris, boasts both a lively marketplace and wonderful restaurants that we went to for three nights and tried three different restaurants. There is a marketplace just around the corner where you could buy fresh produce, trinkets antiques and only 10-15mins away is some of the iconic marvels in Paris noteably Notre Dame what a magnicent building and the pantheon just head the opposite direction. I would and will go back there again it was close to everything we wanted and for someone who hates walking everything was close by.

I stayed in Agora St Germain for 5 days (4 nights) in April with my best friend. This hotel is 100m from Boulevard St Germain and 500 m away from Notre Dame/ Ille de la cite/ Ille St Louis. It is on a quiet street and just around the corner there is the Latin Quarter that I just love. Pantheon, Sorbone, Luxemburg Garden are in neighbourhood. Metro station is like 1-2 min from the hotel which means you can reach any part of the city in not more that 25 min. So, location: just great! It is a 3 star hotel, but value you get is trully satisfying. I was not disapointed in any part of my stay. Rooms are really small, but it is the case in most big cities in Europe, so I expected it. We had a nice view over the street and church (there were no balcony, but a tall window with a french balcony). Be aware that there is a church just across the street, so around 8-9 you can hear bells, but I did not mind, actually they contributed to the spirit of the city :-) We did not use the hotel restaurant as you have boulangeries (bakeries) and restaurants with fantastic french food on every single corner in the city (and in neighbourhod), so it would be a real pitty to eat inside the hotel (and the breakfast is 11 euros in the hotel which is stupid to pay). There is a tiny market near the hotel (just in front of the metro station) where you can buy fresh fruits, cheese, pastries, wine and some genuine french specialties every morning/ day. So it is a great way to be Parisienne in few days :-)) Just grab a bottle of wine, baguette, some cheese and strawberries and head to Montmartre to enjoy in the sun on the grass in front of Sacre Coeur. The service in the hotel was really on a good level: the hotel staff was very helpful and we got some good advices from them, they were very pleasant and hospitable. Do not expect that housekeeping staff speak English, but at the reception they talk just fine. Internet services: wireless is free of charge and the connection was very good at all times (during 4 days). The check out is at noon. But in order to use the whole day in the city, on our last day we emptied our room early in the morning and when we asked where to store our luggage, we were told that we could put our luggage in a room in the basement, near the restaurant. It was strange as that room was not locked or anything, but we were said that it was safe. I was little worried about our stuff, but everything was OK at the end, and overall I felt safe at all times in this hotel. The room was very clean, again small, but you do not spend much time in it any way. Bathroom very clean and nice (renewed), we had a bath thub with a shower. At the end, I recommend this hotel and I will probably come back as it really is the most reasonable choice when you go to visit a city and plan not to spend much time in the room.

This was our first visit to France and the location of this hotel made it an almost perfect trip(biting cold weather). Note: our stay was part of a vacation package reserved with Continental Airlines Vacations. During check-in we were greeted with a friendly and courteous gentleman. He explained all the basic features of the property and the services they provide. The lobby was clean, comfortable and had a modern look to it. The elevator was tiny and could fit maybe two persons without luggage or one person with one suitcase. However, our room was directly located above the lobby and we were able to take advantage of the spiral staircase. Just below the lobby are the WC, luggage room and breakfast room. The breakfast room was well lit, clean and set with several tables and their wares. The lady in charge of preparing breakfast was friendly and always refilling our coffee. The food was your basic continental menu including five types of cheeses and two types of thinly sliced sausages. The food was fresh and table/glasswares were quite clean. Note: the breakfast is an additional charge and is stated so on the menu board in the lobby. As stated earlier, our room was directly above the lobby with a view of the main entrance, a wood working shop and a church just across the street. Note: if you're planning to sleep in a bit on Sunday morning, it won't happen. Those bells are loud and will wake you up. Charming but loud. Not a problem for us during our stay. Our room had two twin beds put together in front of a writing desk, wall mounted flat screen tv, a stocked minifridge and a mirrored closet in the corner. On each side of the bed is a nightstand each with a lamp. Both the bed linens and carpet were clean. No dust bunnies or stains. The room itself had no smell. For us, always a good sign of a well kept property. The bathroom was well lit and of reasonable size. We had a bath tub with shower and were stocked with both bath and hand towels. Note: our tub did not have sliding doors and curtains, so the floor will get a little wet after a shower. There is a half glass panel separating the sink from the tub however. Overall, the room itself is small and thinly walled, but this was never a concern for us as were dead tired every night and slept quite soundly. The location of this hotel was fantastic. We were within walking distance of several cafes and bistros, several bakeries(including Eric Kayser!), a small outdoor market, a cheese shop, a fish monger, a butcher and too many others to name. There are several ATMs and a few banks just around the corner. A laundromat is just two blocks away. The Maubert Mutualite and Cardinal Lemoine Metro stations are just blocks away. And located right next to the Notre Dame is the RER station St. Michel. We were also pleased with all the shops and eating places located nearby the Sorbonne University. Especially, with all the book stores. Overall, we were quite happy with staff service, the property amenities and its location. We have plans to visit Paris again in 2012 and would not hesitate to stay there again.

After figuring out which metro to take to get to our hotel we walked a couple of blocks and saw the sign. The lobby is very clean, and when we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen at the front desk. He gave us our key, and a password for the wireless internet, and showed us to our room on the second floor. The room was small but layed out well with a flat panel TV and a view of the courtyard below. The bathroom was also small but very pleasant with a very nice shower. We were a little unnerved by a damp odor in the room, but found once we turned on the Air conditioning that this smell went away. The bed was comfortable enough. We didn't try the breakfast since there are many bakeries and cafes a block away. We used Rick Steves 2007 Paris book and found cafes we liked in each arrondisemont we visited. Also, Notre Dame is four blocks from the hotel and is jawdropping in the daytime and at night. The Pantheon is also walking distance and for everything else the metro is not too far away. The location is simply great! I guess the one complaint I had was the one of the front desk guys told us about a shuttle to the airport for something like 34 euros. The guy was doing his best sales job to convince us that this was the best way to get back to the airport and he needed the money right away to hold our reservation for 5 days later. Well we finally agreed because I didnt want to carry our luggage up and down the metro station again. Our flight was leaving at 1 pm and he was telling us to do the shuttle that would pick us up at the hotel but no later than 8:40am. Well that seemed a little early to me but I said ok. So the day comes when we had to leave and the shuttle arrives at 820 am and the shuttle is crammed with people. We are sitting in the front seat, on the way to the airport, when the driver tells us we owe him another 8 euros to take us to terminal 3 because no one else was going there. I argued with the guy saying we had already paid, and he said that we had paid the hotel guy his money but still owed another 8 euros. Out of principle I told the driver there was no way we were paying. So he started muttering to himself, and kept driving and then dropped us off at the right terminal with two other couples.

From the very beginning, starting with a most pleasant, informative, and efficient email correspondence with Katrine with an online reservation made many months ago, several quick and informative email correspondences with Aline followed, and the help of Eric, our stay was a complete joy! There was another helpful gentleman at night. Sorry I couldn't remember his name. There was 3 adult women and we stayed in the only triple room they had. 1 queen and 1 single. They gave us plenty of towels when we asked and our room was very quiet in back, on the first floor. We could not hear any street noise and we were just steps away from busy streets. The location was perfect for us. Everything we wanted was within an easy walk even though it rained almost everyday. (Take an Umbrella) Great little food stands, open markets,restaurants, the famous Kaiser Bakery, metro, train, and of course the great sites such as Notre Dame were all less than 10 minutes away, etc. We asked for wake up calls and they were very accommodating and punctual about that. Everyday we were out the door and on our way after a helpful, informative, and pleasant review of directions with Aline. She was just fantastic!!! We did use the lobby one afternoon to relax and regroup with our friends. We did not have the continental breakfast that was served downstairs. I cannot comment on that. We did not use our room during the day. There was a desk, chair, and small minibar that we did use to keep a few things cold. That was great. There was a nice closet with side shelfs that allowed us to unpack and spread out our things. The bed was just right for me. No relaxing armchair in the room, so if you are requiring that, this isn't for you. We did not need heat, but did require the window to be open for fresh air and that was great for us, as it opened onto a private courtyard. By American standards it was a small room, but by European standards, I think it was fine and expected. The Bathroom was small, but modern, clean, and efficient with a hair dryer and amenities that we did use. For us the location and help of Aline made this especially enjoyable. The cons: NO INTERNET/computer!!! They sent us next door to the youth hostel which was better than nothing but a real pain,and that is my only real complaint. In this day and age and for the price, they should have internet/computer availability for guests to check email, confirm reservations, and look up information I believe. Also, we were not told that a large fee would be charged by the taxi driver whenever a hotel calls a Taxi for you. We needed one at a certain time for a train reservation. The 10 minute ride to the train station costs us 24 euros. The night before, a taxi driver had told us is should be about 10 euros.(To be honest, I don't know if the hotel realizes this, so if they did know, it would be nice if they told you up front that the Taxi charges more for that service.)", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cLocation was quite good, breakfast average, rooms small\u201d", "Author": "donnab50", "ReviewID": "UR64595388", "Content": "I have only stayed in one hotel in Paris, this one, but it served us well.

Our rooms were, well, a bit small by American standards (much as everything is in the center of Paris), but fully-equipped by those same standards (TV, refrigerator w/beverages, lock box, phone, closet, full bathroom w/tub/shower, large sink and toilet). Our rooms also had windows that opened, which was a great feature for letting in some fresh air and hearing some of the sounds of the city. The only downsides I can think of are noise and compactness. In the case of the former, closing the windows was enough to reduce the sounds from the Metro and businesses below to acceptable sleeping levels. In the case of the latter, avoid the microscopic 'lift' (elevator) and you'll barely notice. Neither of those concerns would cause me to look elsewhere for my next trip to Paris - I'll defenitely be staying at the Agora Saint Germain again.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton, Lancs", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel centrally located in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Hollydayhi", "ReviewID": "UR62785888", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights late April 10.

We ate at some wonderful restaurants in the area (La Maree Verte, Trumilou..) and every afternoon brought wine, baguette and cheese back to the room for a snack before napping and preparing for late dinner.

If we return to Paris, we may stay out of center as it is less expensive, but for a first time in Paris, Agora is absolutely perfect because you won't miss a sight!

Further, while having this conversation, my wife came down to the desk to report that a credit card was stolen as well. All the man did was direct us to a police station. We filed a report, cancelled the card (not after they tried charging over 8000 Euro; unfortunately 3000 got approved) and made our flight.

The weather was perfect outside so we didn't mind having no air con. I could see how it would be rough in mid-summer. Like I said, we were more interested in price since we did not plan to hang out in our room anyway and this hotel was an excellent value. Its location to the St. Michael metro stop was wonderful because from there you could get anywhere. We did breakfast at the Eric Kayser boulangerie and would highly recommend that to people. It is just around the corner on Rue Monge from the hotel. We did not try the hotel breakfast because of the cost. I think breakfast for two at the boulangerie was 6-7 Euro as opposed to 11 Euro per person at the hotel. The service was wonderful.

The chap at the reception spoke very good english (i think he probably got bored with my poor attempts at French) and was very friendly.

I could not fault the room at all. It is in an ideal location (Latin Quarter) and everything is easily accessible from the Hotel. The metro is only a block away if you wanted to venture further. Lots of bakeries, cafes nearby and only a short walk to find restaurants/bistros/brasseries in the St Germain area or Pantheon area too. Didn't opt for the breakfast (11 Euros, I believe) so i can't comment on that - i preferred my breakfast outside near the Notre Dame or the Louvre. They had no problem in leaving my luggage in the baggage room on my departure (late flight home) and had facilities for a quick wash and change before actually leaving.

I looked on their website and the price it gave you was only 20 euro more a night than we had booked - months earlier. I wrote another nice, French language email pointing this out and they pretty much said take it or leave it.

The room had a desk, television and nightstands. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was actually large by comparison, although I think that we had the largest bathroom on the floor. I did reserve the \"basic\" room and there are more deluxe rooms available. The front desk was very helpful. It looked like the inside of the hotel had recently been redone and was very pleasant. There was a small but nice sitting area in the foyer. Of note, the church around the corner rings bells at about 8 every morning - however, there is so much to do in Paris we were up anyway! The location was perfect - a 3-minute walk from a metro stop, a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, many, many excellent restaurants within walking distance and the greatest Bakery (Boulangerie Kayser) around the corner. This hotel is in the Latin Quarter.

Lots of tourist attractions are within walking distance, including the Louvre, Notre Dame, Pantheon, Sorbonne and rue Mouffetard. There are also numerous great restaurants and cafes nearby, and the metro is close, too. All in all, the location really can\u2019t be beat. Our twin room (#19) was quite tiny, though I suppose the norm by European standards. Still, we weren\u2019t even able to open the small closet without first moving the nightstand next to one of the beds, which was a bit of a nuisance. The bathroom was clean with a larger than expected bath/shower. The hairdryer looked like some sort of odd vacuum contraption, though, and blew out such little air that it took forever to dry our hair. Recommend packing your own. We never needed to request a wake-up call as there\u2019s a church at the end of the street and we heard church bells throughout the day and night. It wasn\u2019t terribly obnoxious, but it quickly became less charming and more annoying. My reviews on the staff are mixed. The woman who is at the desk during the day is very pleasant and helpful. The one time we asked for dinner recommendations, though, she gave us a card for a place around the corner and noted that it was open on Sundays, which it wasn\u2019t \u2013 not a big deal, though. However, the man on duty at night is a lot less friendly and a lot less helpful. Our first night there, we returned after a fairly late night out and were somewhat alarmed to find him sleeping on the bare floor behind the desk! He jumped up, clearly startled, when we came in. Very strange! Also, we requested a cab to the airport very early in the morning the day we checked out and specifically requested ahead of time a cab that would accept a credit card. Asking for this in advance was useless, as the guy at the desk simply went outside and asked the cab driver if he took credit cards after he arrived, which he didn\u2019t. I could\u2019ve done that myself. One other thing that I found bothersome is that the hotel requests that you leave the key with them any time that you leave the hotel. I\u2019ve experienced this before in Europe but it\u2019s a practise that I\u2019m not comfortable with, so we didn\u2019t abide by the \u201crule\u201d and luckily were never asked for ours when we left.

We booked a twin (double) room and stayed 5 nights. We got room 64 which was located on the 6th floor looking at the back alley of the hotel. As a result the room was very quiet (we did not even hear the bells of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet church which was located right opposite to the hotel - something that seemed to bother other reviewers in Trip Advisor). The bedroom had double-glazed windows and air-conditioning of a very good quality. The bedroom was relatively small but it was very clean and recently refurbished (note: not so small though by Paris or London standards). The bed mattress was excellent. The bathroom (with shower) was exceptionally clean, good in size and fully equipped. Service was excellent (we got in contact with five different employees at the reception - everyone of them spoke English and were very helpful) The location is magnificent to say the least. Very near there are shops, caf\u00e9s, bistros, brasseries and restaurants etc. Also it is very near or near to Paris' main attractions (Notre Dame, the Louvre, Latin Quarter, Boulevard Saint-Germain, Muse d' Orsay, The Eiffel Tower etc.). There is an excellent boolangerie (bakery) only a few meters from the hotel (it is called Eric Kayser and is located at 8 rue Monge: turn left as you go out of the hotel and a few meters down turn left again and you are in rue Monge). It has excellent croissants and other goodies. Try a stroll through Rue des Ecoles [fist street as you turn right getting out of the hotel] - and try \"La petite P\u00e9rigourdine\" on 39, Rue des \u00e9coles for some excellent and rather cheap French food - beware though the menu is only in French and written on a whiteboard). You can also try some of the numerous establishments found on the nearby Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel boulevards (most of them have English menus). For an excellent dinner at quite good prices you can try \"Le Petit Prince de Paris\" it is located at 12, Rue Lanneau (quite near to the hotel - 3 to 4 blocks away and off Rue des Ecoles - better to find it on a map though or at http://maps.google.com/). The metro stop is only two blocks away from the hotel (station Maubert - Mutualit\u00e9 at Boulevard Saint-Germain). Tickets can be used also at buses and RER trains cost: 1,60 Euro per ticket, but is a better idea either to buy a carnet of ten tickets at a price of about 11 euros (that is 1.1 per ticket) or even better to buy a Paris-visite card (unlimited travel for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days at 8,50 - 14 - 9 or 27,50 euros per person - see details at: http://www.ratp.info/informer/anglais/paris_visite.php All these tickets can be bought at all Metro stations (in every station there are employees where you can buy them - besides vending machines). Try to use the buses if you can (they have an excellent online system of letting you know the itineraries and the waiting time in every bus stop). Buses are quite fast and you can also see a lot of Paris by traveling on them. Otherwise try the Metro.

We used the Batobus to navigate the city and there is a stop at the Notre Dame which was so convenient.

The St Germain area is great with loads of different cafes, bars and shops within walking distance. We came across Tunisian, Japanese, Greek, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Turkish and of course French cuisine all in the vicinity. There are also designer clothes shops close by for those who can afford it (window shopping only for me!). Our room at the hotel was very modern, clean and comfortable. The minibar is reasonably priced (for a minibar in Paris) and contains a range of soft drinks. I don't know if our room was well sound proofed or the guests were quiet because we didn't hear a peep the whole time. There are TVs in the room with a small range of European channels and CNN and BBCWorld for the English speaking, not that a TV is needed whatsoever as we really only used the room to sleep. We had breakfast at the hotel once and it was fine, a normal continental breakfast as you would expect. We tended to visit the many patisseries, boulangeries and delis in the area! The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. People said before we went that we would find french people rude, but this is rubbish. Even though we spoke little of their language we found that everyone appeared kind and patient (bar 1 moody woman who worked at the metro station in Marne la Valee).

Rooms are small - or standard in French hotels/ B&Bs - and clean, with brand new bathrooms and nice fresh bedding, as someone else pointed out.

Yes, the church bells do go off a lot and the rooms and corridors smell of smoke, but this is just a part of the Paris experience. The hotel was close to the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame and plenty of restaurants and bistros. Internet was pay-as-you-go (but for our short stints online we tapped into someone else's wifi, which was free), plus the shower was strong and hot (mind the run-off) and the room was very warm, so we kept the French doors ajar in the night.

Nice enough to be a notch above the other gazillion budget hotels in Paris, but small enough to make you feel comfortable and at ease during your stay. SOME GREAT, UNEXPECTED features of the room included high thread count, awesomely comfortable bed linens and a firm Sealy quality mattress. Each side of the double bed (Room 68) had two, super fluffy pillows per person. The AC and heat (radiator) worked very well and the room never felt stuffy as the large double windows could be fully opened onto the street. THIS HOTEL MAKES a superb base for seeing the sights of Paris. With two close Metro stops, an RER stop and a short stroll to the Ile-de-la-Cite you will feel like you're really in the hub of things. WHILE THERE WASN'T much to detract from the overall high marks I'd give this place I would add the following... I wouldn't suggest paying for the hotel breakfast. At 11 Euros it's a joke. Go around the corner (out of the hotel, a left and then another left) and you will immediately find at least 2 places more reasonably priced. Also, even if your room is non-smoking (I'm not sure that there are any) you will smell smoke from other guests' rooms as the hotel is very small. The elevator is a 2 person ride, but the spiral stairs were convenient when there was too long of a wait. The church bells across the street will wake you up, but I found this to be a pleasant experience - much better than the \"waa-waa-waa\" of an alarm clock anyway. The shower-only setup in room 68 was less than satisfactory. With roughly 4 square feet to maneuver, no splash guards of any sort and super slick marble-printed ceramic tile taking a shower was an adventure. It was dangerous - and I'm young. EATING OUT SUGGESTIONS in close proximity to the hotel include a great Indian restaurant called the Bollywood Lounge, Cafe du Pont Neuf, the Kayser bakery and the multi-function, smallish cafe/bar next door to the Kayser. Breakfast there was 6.50 Euros for 1 croissant, 1 orange juice and 1 coffee of your choice. At night it was a great place to get a drink after being out all day - relaxed, never crowded with friendly employees (as long as you make an effort at speaking French; it seems to be the key everywhere though - especially if you're American).

We literally spent every night for a week researching online, talking to friends who traveled to Paris, and coworkers who live in Paris for the best hotel. We read and heard such scary things. I travel quite frequently for work but have heard some horror stories about Paris so we were extra cautious. I am very pleased to report that we made a fantastic choice.

I don't recommend the hotel for a honeymoon but for 2 girls who only needed a clean place to sleep and shower this hotel was awesome! The elevator was small but we both fit at the same time so it was no problem for us! We did have to take separate trips with all of our luggage but hey, you can't have everything! The room was small but there was enough room for each of us to put our stuff and get around. The best part is how immaculately clean it was! The bathroom looked brand new! You can't beat that. It did get warm in the room so we just kept the balcony doors opened a crack and it was fine. The church across the street did grace us with a wake-up call at 8:00 am on a Fri am but seeing as how we were already up and getting ready, it didn't bother us. Of course, the next day we were counting on the bells to wake us up and they didn't ring! YIKES! So don't count on them to be your wake-up call. The hotel is in a great location. It is right off of St. Germain street which we were told is the spot to dine. There are some great bars along the side streets too! Its a 10 min walk to Notre Dame and 20 mins to The Louvre. The hotel staff was so lovely! They were extremely helpful and polite and they speak English perfectly.

Booked the room as part of a vacation package through the airline. The location is excellent-- only a few blocks away from Notre Dame de Paris and the Ile de la Cite. The closest metro stop was \"Maubert / Mutualite\" which allowed us to get around quite easily. Visitors who haven't been to Paris before should learn to use the Metro immediately-- its so simple and gets you close to just about everything you'll want to see. Also, there were a few pedestrian streets nearby that were filleds with restaurants that seemed to cater to a lot of tourists. Food there was good and inexpensive, and stress free. Lots of choices. Breakfast was included in our fee, which consisted of coffee or tea with some croissants or other morning breads. Nothing too extraordinary-- but a very typical French Breakfast. It was nice to have breakfast at the hotel before starting out. The room was small, as are most rooms in Europe, but very clean and very nice. Our room overlooked the Rue des Bernardins adn the church or St Nicolas du Chadonnet. At times the bells of the church were a bit much (every morning they toll at 7h45 for a few minutes. Otherwise its just every hours) but I suppose that's part of the charm. We had a large bed, refrigerator, television, closet, etc. All the basics. We were really only in the room to sleep anyway. The bathroom was quite a nice surprise-- brand new fixtures. The shower was clean and warm. Big enough to take a bath to relax after long days of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and helpful. When you leave the hotel you leave your key at the desk, and whenever you return you just ask for it back. It was nice not having to worry about forgetting your room key. Be advised that next door to the Agora St Germain is a Hostel, and as such there were noisy young travelers in the street past midnight on some nights. Also, there is an amazing amount of traffic for such a small street-- so there's a lot of noise from the cars and scooters. When we closed our window, it was quiet again. There was a small air conditioner that cooled the small room very quickly. I don't know how well it would work on a sizzling summer day, but in the unseasonably warm spring it did just fine. Overall, we were very happy with our stay. Of course, its not the Ritz-- but it was a perfect location, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly.

I booked it via their own website, which had much better rates than any of the big travel sites. First, I should state that I was looking for a good value hotel, nothing fancy, but with a clean room and in a great location. The Agora definitely satisfied those needs for me. With their internet rate, I was able to get a superior room here for less than it would have cost for a standard room at what I believe to be comparable hotels in the area. So I booked a superior double room for my boyfriend and me, but when we got to the hotel our room (17) was unavailable because of a problem with the air conditioner. No other superior rooms were available so we took a standard room for the night (room 15) until one opened up the next day. They were very nice and apologetic about this, and we were also understanding and just looked at it as a way to save a little bit of money for one night. Room 15 faced inwards to an air shaft- which they decorated at the ground floor to make a sort of cute little garden- and had a double bed, with barely enough room to walk around especially if you have a lot of luggage. The bathroom is very nice but opens up literally right at the bed, so there is really hardly any privacy even with the door closed. The next day we were moved to room 29 (superior), which faced the street outside, had 2 twin beds pushed together (which I wanted, becuase I think you get a little extra bed that way), and was set up more like any hotel room you'd see in the US. The bathroom was separate from the main room area, and there was a desk. Both rooms had a 19 inch or so plasma tv, which was nice. Both also had a mini-fridge/minibar. I'd say for the extra little bit of money (maybe $50 a night), it is definitely worth it to stay in the superior room, because we would not have been comfortable in the standard for five days. There was just not enough space for us. Both rooms were a little stuffy, but we usually left the windows open while we went out for the day, which the maid closed during her cleaning, and then it was fine when we got back. Housekeeping was good and made up the rooms really nice. Hotel is in a great location- even closer to the Maubert Mutualite metro station than I thought from looking at maps. The 10 metro line definitely isnt the most useful one, but it's just one stop or an extra 5-8 minutes walking to a big transfer station. RIght down the street from the hotel is a strip of food stores- cheese store, wine store, butcher, fish store, bakeries.... literally anything you could need. We went to Maison Kaiser a lot for croissants, baguettes and sandwiches. Very good bakery. Most days there was a nice little market that opened up right there as well. Really great to walk through. If you walk straight up Rue des Bernardins you'll end up at the Seine within a few minutes, and the street turns right into a bridge to Ile de la Cite so it is really a great block to be on. We ate dinner every night in the area- 3 great ones in walking distance, Les Bouquinistes, Le Petit Pontoise, and Le Coupe Chou. We also ate a couple nights in a very touristy area off Rue St. Jacques by Notre Dame... both meals were horrible (in one you'd hear the microwave beeping every couple minutes when people's meals were done!). We should have known. But those other 3 restaurants were truly amazing. Overall, I was pleased with this hotel because it met my needs (which were, admittedly, somewhat basic, but I think similar to what most people look for in a Paris hotel). I wouldn't necessarily go there on my honeymoon, but for a trip where you'll barely be in the room it was a nice place to end the day. We liked that it was very close to the center of things but still a little off on a quiet side street (besides the horrible church bells every 30 min in the morning) and we kind of felt like we were going \"home\" every night.

My wife (like most wives) has high standards about cleanliness, food, decor, service etc. so I'm always hoping that our lodgings will be up to scratch as this is an important part of her enjoyment of our trips. The Hotel Agora St Germain exceeded our expectations as it was clean , well-run and friendly. The last bit was very important as we have been to France three or four times on family holidays and always had a good time, but we had never been to Paris and the impression we got from friends and our own research was that Paris could be a very unfriendly place and that the service in Hotels and Restaurants left a bit to be desired. The staff in the Agora ,however, were excellent, particularly the guys on the reception desk. We saw three different ones while we were there and each was cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable about the local area (and Paris in general) and patient with our poor command of French. The lady who looked after the breakfast room was delightful and got full marks from my wife who noticed that she was continually going round the room making sure that everything was just so, topping up the coffee etc. We saw two chambermaids while we were there and both ladies greeted us with a smile and \"bonjour\" each time we passed. The rooms were provided with fresh linen and towels every day and were cleaned to a very high standard. The Hotel is well-situated for the sights of Paris, particularly Notre Dame, which is about five minutes walk from the hotel - ideal for a romantic morning stroll with the bells ringing, leaves blowing around your feet and the wonderful smells from the boulangeries.The Jardins De Luxembourg, which is about ten minutes walk from the Hotel is a pleasant walk (don't forget to take some bread for the ducks in the Fontaine des Medicis.) If you are a Da Vinci Code bore, St Sulpice is about 5-10 mins away. Other places of interest such as the Tour Eiffel, the Musee D'Orsay, Les Invalides and the Louvre are within 15 - 20 min walk. The Arc De Triomphe and the part of the Champs- Elysees with the shops is about 30 min walk. Montmartre and the Sacre Coeur would probably be best visited using the Metro or the bus. The area around the Hotel has loads of Bistros, Brasseries, Bar-Tabacs and Restaurants of all kinds, we had meals in about five of them and all were good, though a bit expensive, expect to pay about 8 Euros for 50Cl. of beer, about 8 - 14 Euros for a pizza, about 10 - 16 Euros for a steak. The only thing that might be a probem at this Hotel is the fact that St. Nicholas' Church is next door and the bells ring quite often, we liked this as it added to the ambience, some people might not. Some tips if you haven't visited Paris before: Get to know the Metro, it is really efficient, cheap and the best way to get around, although it looks complicated at first. The trains come every few minutes. Taxis are very expensive. Learn a little bit of French. Even just \"Hello\", \"thanks\",\"goodbye\" \"how much is it?\" etc. This will smooth things along very much for you, particularly in Paris where they clearly appreciate any attempt to speak French. Paris is amazingly cosmopolitan, you will see people from all over the world. Spare a thought for the Parisians dealing with all these different languages, customs etc. They are often relieved and pleased when someone tries to do things their way and ease the transaction, especially fellow Europeans. Get to the sights early, there can be very long queues. We were there in December and were amazed how busy it was, during the high season it must be manic. Take boat trip on the Seine at night - if you are there as a couple - it is just one of the most romantic things you can do. Guys -if it's cold you might get a cuddle. There is a lot to see and do in Paris - don't expect to get round everything in a week. To sum up: The Hotel Agora St. Germain is a good, clean, well-run hotel in an interesting area of Paris which is reasonably well-situated to visit all the main sights.

AMAZING. my advice for first-timers: go on the fat bike tour in the evening. it's operated by americans and you get to bike through the city, take a boat ride on the seine, and just have a blast. my husband and i went on the bike tour the day we arrived in paris and i would say that my favorite memory of our trip is riding my bike through the courtyard of the louvre at sunset, seeing the larger-than-life pyramids for the first time with my husband. wow. all in all, the agora st. germain was a great 3 star hotel and we would definitely return.", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NZ", "Title": "\u201cGood Paris Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NessW", "ReviewID": "UR5563527", "Content": "I think this would be a pretty typical 3 star hotel in Paris but you might find one for the same price that is not as far east as this - The Agora St Germain was about 500m from Notre Damn metro stop, there are 2 others stops closer but Notre Damn is on more lines so we felt like we walked alot to get to and from the hotel from here, the walk along the river is lovely but we were usually exhausted from a full day and just wanted to get off the metro and be home!!

I had spent 2 weeks reasearching hotel reviews as I wanted something special, but couldn't afford the likes of the Ritz Carlton. And we couldn't have been happier with the Agora! It was super clean, fresh soft sheets, newly remodeled bathroom, (very modern) We got a room (#49) with a view of the beautiful old St. Nicholas du Chardonnet church across the street. The room was sound proofed and very quiet. And we just loved hearing the gentle peal of the church bells in the morning. It was so charming!!! The staff was terrific (especially Elaine) and there's air conditioning in the room to keep you comfortable, along with a flat screen plasma t.v. and built in blow dryer (which was great not to have to bring our own and try to find electrical adapters to use over there.) The elevator is tiny as others stated. But so what! You are always free to take the stairs next to the elevator. That's what we did going down. Taking it when going up to our room, and wasn't a problem to have to stand close to each other for 60 seconds. The hotel lobby was nicely appointed, and comfortable, with a morning paper in English to catch up on world news. The breakfast room downstairs was very nice, and yeah, 10 euros apiece seemed a bit high for the breakfast, but we did eat there twice in the week, and it was kind of nice having as much coffee as we needed without having to pay 5 euro for one cup elsewhere. There's fresh baked croissants, Pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant), baguette, cheeses, butter, jam, cereal, juice, tea, coffee, yogurt. And the french yogurt is REALLY good. Different than we get in the U.S. Much creamier! So while you can certainly go to a local pastry shop or cafe for breakfast, there's times when it's pretty convenient to just go downstairs and enjoy your fill of coffee, and plan your day out in the peace of the breakfast room, rather than on the busy sidewalk. You've got room to open your metro and city maps on the table. The location is PERFECT! You've got an ATM machine just outside the hotel, a 5min. walk to Notre Dame Cathedral, 5 min. walk to shops, metro station, farmer's market, restaurants, etc. A note to anyone who's never been to Paris: buy a one week pass for the metro, and at the same window, also buy the one week museum pass. A MUST!!! this way you don't have to wait in the long lines at the Lovre, (over 2 hrs wait otherwise) or Musee d'ORsay, or Palace at Versailles. You can just go to the front gate for reserved tickets. Well worth the money spent. You can get all over the place with the metro, it has good connections. And the pass also allows you to use the trains or buses within a certain region. If you do go outside your area, then you'll just have to pay a couple euros extra to exit the station. No big deal.

I could tell it was old, but they were able to update it quite tastfully. I really enjoyed going up the small elevator. All that could fit was myself and our luggage.

It was cold, but since it was sunny, we just bundled up and took to the streets. When it was time to warm up, we popped into a cafe for a bit. I would highly recommend a restaurant called Le Coupe Chew for dinner. FANTASTIC food and ambiance. Not too far from the hotel either. I found that the restaurants serving fondue around the corner from the hotel weren't that good. Besides the fact that they had people standing out front \"hooking\" you to come in and eat, the food was pretty basic.

Perhaps my husband would have liked that :-) I would also recommend taking a pass on the chestnuts roasting on an open fire sold by vendors along the walkways. Unless I got a bad batch, these are just horrid to eat. You've been warned. When you walk, pay attention to where you step.

We stayed at this hotal Nov 21-26, 2005. We booked this hotel through American Express Travel, the same as with our London Hotel. Before leaving for our trip, I decided to contact the hotel via email to confirm our room reservations for both hotels. The hotel in London, had a toll free number so I called and confirmed my reservation. The Hotel Agora St. Germain did not so I decided to email the hotel directly. Well, needless to say, I did not receive a reply back before leaving. I was a little concerned but since the hotel in London saw my reservation made through Amex, my husband just said don't worry about it and we went off on our trip. When we arrived at the hotel and en route to the hotel on the chunnel I was thinking about the reservation. Well, guess what.... they didn't have our reservation. Not their fault, in all fairness, it was travelocity whom sold the rooms to Amex... Amex thought everything was confirmed and passed the information to us. So, we felt confident about the choice but we were wrong. The woman at the checkin counter gave us a room anyway but said she wasn't sure if we could stay there the entire trip.... and we would have to take care of it with American Express. Lucky for me I had taken my cell phone and was able to contact American Express. Althought the call cost me .99 cents a minute, it was well worth it since they faxed over the confirmation and called the hotel directly to confirm receipt. This was taken care of within the hour of our arrival. However, starting out like this didn't really leave a good feeling... especially since the lady kept telling us that now she has a problem with people checking in on the 24th Nov. and seemed very frustrated that this happened on her watch. That didn't make things better... to be honest it added to my frustration. My husband had to calm me down of course and reason with me not to lose my temper since it was not really her fault. However, I did email them directly and at a minimum would have expected an reply email with .. \"we don't have a reservation for you... etc.\" I mean they did have a PC with internet access at the front desk. My husband did notice there was a fax on the floor. It is very possible that their carelessness could have caused this confusion and inconvenience. As for the room.... we stayed in room 69. The room was facing the street on 6th floor with a little balcony.. too little to step out but could open window/door and peek out. Heard very little noise. The bathroom was very clean when we arrived and the daily maintenance of same was pretty good. The bed was comfortable. They have a desk with a chair and a small ottoman. Heating in the room was fantastic. lighting was proper. The closet could have been in a different location.. Although the closet was big enough for Paris standards, to get to it and access clothing was a bit tight since it was right next to one of the nightstands... The luggage was easily stored under the closet... unless of course you have monster luggage. We like to travel light so our standard carry-ons fit fine. The room had a very delightful and clean aroma after it was cleaned daily. Oh... and great hot water and water pressure. What I didn't like was that they didn't provide you with shampoo soap and conditioner as separate items. They had a dispenser by the sink and in the shower stall with their so-called combination soap/shampoo/conditioner which really stunk if you asked me. We used it as soap since we had brought our own shampoo. No shower cap, no sewing kit, no other perks except for lotion. They have a mini fridge in the room with refreshments and a beer bottle opener and they do have corkscrews at the front desk you can borrow if you buy some wine. The rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. All in all is what we expected.... small, clean, tastefully decorated room. My husband just fell in love with the bathroom so I'll give them kudos for that. If it wasn't for that reservation snafu and the front desk person's indifference maybe our rating would have been better. Remember, confirm your reservation by phone with hotel directly. Faxes may end up on the floor below one of their counters/furniture. Oh and don't bother with the Breafast... There are plenty places you can buy a coffee and a croisant for under 4 Euros nearby or do as the parisians do... get a crepe to go...

I\u2019ve been to Paris often, but this is one of the better hotels for a reasonable price. We arrived late at night, but there was a night watch at the reception, which let us in without any problems. The rooms were small, like in every hotel in Paris, but they weren\u2019t too small. The interior was fine, the beds were excellent. More importantly the rooms were clean and were cleaned every day. With fresh towels and new sheets. The bathroom was fine as well, with a good warm, powerful shower in it. Breakfast was excellent, typically French breakfast with fresh bread and cheese. The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the center of the Latin Quarter, with many nice restaurants and caf\u00e9s nearby. Also the subway is right around the corner, as is the Notre Dame. I would definitely come back to this hotel, either for business or with my girlfriend for a nice weekend in Paris.
