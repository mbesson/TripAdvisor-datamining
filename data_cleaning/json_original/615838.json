The staff are very friendly and helpfull... when i booked the room online i also confirmed with the management of the hotel that i get a non-smoking room, since they dont have many of them ... i got it and was pleasantly surprised.. Outside the hotel doesnt look really fancy, and the lobby is not that special too, but once u are in the room everything is fine... and as i mentioned before, the staff of the hotel are very welcoming and helpfull - Imad, Hicham (shift manager) and friendly lady with the scarf at the reception... i paid ca. 75 Euros per night for double room and it was worth every penny... its a 4 star hotel altough a lil bit outdated looking but well maintained.. I didnt try the food, but they have nice buffet lunch restaurant, and they have room service too... Its close to Deira City Center shopping Mall and of course not that far away from the airport... the big plus of the hotel is that u get a wi-fi free connection, since its is not the rule in Dubais hotels... many hotels in Dubai (over)charge you even nowadays for wi-fi, but this hotel no, and actually that was also one of the main reason i booked the hotel... since i think that free wi-fi nowadays should belong to the guest service... If you are looking for quite place you will be fine here, but if you look for a lil bit lively lobby or some bars you have to get taxi and go to other part of the city... but at the end I would deffinatly recommend staying in the hotel...", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, nice and clean.\u201d", "Author": "Maindak", "ReviewID": "UR125147462", "Content": "I stayed here while on business. a very good hotel, the rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice. it is a halal hotel that means there is no alcohol or night club.

Muslim hotel...bacon.... am I missing something here? The Location is close to the airport, rooms cheap at 300 AED (Arab Emirate Dinah) per night. I have found the staff very helpful and willing to answer all questions if they can and perhaps a little shy if they don't know the answer to the question. Some stranded travelers lamented that no shuttle bus from the airport was available...stranded you are not! I can see the tail fins of emirates planes from my window. Taxi from the airport costs 30 AED in colloquial terms a coffee and muffin. From the hotel to the airport is 10-15 AED. Minimum taxi fare in Dubai is 10 AED so if your trip costs 6 you pay 10. 10 Dinah is about $3. Dinner buffet at Al Jawhara Gardens (\"Al J\") was good - tomato soup yummy. We also ate at the Meridian down the road (sp?) which had a glitzier glam selection of food and a very elegant foyer but I think the food at Al J was more tasty and half the price. Has a pool on the top floor and a female only pool and a gym. I think it has a sauna also. Internet works well, occasionally there is a holding pattern due to overcrowding and log on takes 30 minutes but this happened to me only 1 time in the middle of the day. Air conditioners are great and to quote from Pat Benetar - cold as Ice. Shower, Bath and separate bidet rather than a hose/squirter attached to the loo. Room sizes were good. Windows opened not siliconed shut for that additional Dubai luft. Plenty of cabs sailing past no- need to wait long. Avoid the unmarked cabs associated to the hotels, stylish they may be but twice or thrice the price. There are restaurants and some coffee shops nearby An Italian restaurant just down the road near the Mosque. City Centre is a large mall within walking distance, good for money exchange and shopping, has electrical, fashion etc. Great coffee shop in the middle with an amazing White Forest cake. Seems to be patronized more by local than touristy types. Check out Dubai mall, taxi fare is approximately 35. A must do is the Dubai Marina at night time - have a meal, light up a tobacco pipe and relax for a few hours- taxi is 55 Dinah approx. If you aren\u2019t used to smoking ask for the mild apple tobacco (I think its called) \u2013 it is very very mild wont make u cough and not at all like cigarettes. Al J is unashamedly a Muslim establishment. I was told gently when I arrived that there was to be no alcohol, and that single males and females are not to share rooms. If you are married - be able to prove you are married. Proof is simple, provide passports or documents with photo id and matching surnames. No matching surnames no bacon sandwich. If the weariness of marriage is scrawled over the both of you that might be proof enough... Al J isn\u2019t a glamorous and ritzy hotel and not a lot of wow factor... for a less expensive hotel however it is good. I have found the staff to be friendly and helpful. As to that slightly 'out there' post in which the staff were accused of being illiterate (see previous posts) it is true English is not their first language but they were able to make themselves understood and had a desire to be helpful, and their English was a lot better than my Moslem which would make the non Moslem speakers illiterate I imagine? The staff was actually very nice and quite engaging. The young men had a dazzling smile probably aimed more at my wife than myself. Is this post too long, am sure I have breached all posting etiquette but am unable to sleep and so very tired. In conclusion it is a hotel that is a Muslim establishment, reasonably priced, down to earth accommodation, friendly, clean and economical. A welcome counter to the very materialistic nature of Dubai. I might in honesty say the d\u00e9cor in the room was a little long in the tooth but I paid for and bought a Volkswagen and to expect a Rolls Royce is silly. If you check in and don\u2019t like it there are several hotels around the corner you can easily shift to, The Ibis and the Novotel are a 5-minute walk. The Ibis at about 380 AED doesn\u2019t have a swimming pool or free Internet in the rooms, rooms are small and modern and nice foyer if foyers are your thing and internet at snails pace is free in the foyer. Try the AL J. for a more authentic atmosphere. If you don\u2019t like it no problemo, scoot around the corner for a more western feel at the Ibis. Well it's time to go, my work is done here.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "iran", "Title": "\u201cBest Location ,Nice and clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "babakIran", "ReviewID": "UR119152719", "Content": "I think you can find this hotel as one of the best four star hotel in Dubai.It is near Deira city center , you can go there on foot.

Avoid the breakfast buffet (50 Dh), instead you could walk over (less than 5 min) to the Diera city center and have a nice buffet for about 20 Dh. I also converted currency there instead of the airport. It is also in a quiet area, no night clubs and is pretty much a family hotel as advertised. Staff were helpful and courteous.

(the room was not tidy or ready). the staff were really unhelpful -asked about certain tours etc, they refused to help and look busy. They asked us to speak to the concierge every day.(every morning we waited for him at 9am!)The concierge was never there!! only got to saw him on the last day.Then he would not stop buggin us to get on the tours. staff refused to get taxis for u. Breakfast was ok. Room size was ok- bed was really UNCOMFORTABLE.Bath/shower was not the 4* standard u expect.
