The bed was very uncomfortable. The TV didn't work. The internet connection was very slow and crashed every 15 minutes. The breakfast was very poor. I stayed there in the summer, it was impossible to stay in the room during day time because it was hot as hell and it was impossible to open the window! The worst thing is the staff: they were so tough and never smiled, as if they were military officers. When I tried to explain to the receptionist that I was very unsatisfied with the hotel, the uncomfortable bed, the very hot room, bad internet connection and bad breakfast, she didn't even want to listen. She refused to let me speak to the manager and she said I can always go to another hotel. That's exactly what I will do in my next visit in Berlin, and that's what you should do too.

The hotel was ok, the room was cleaned and tidied daily, not very much else to say, there was a small TV which only showed German channels.. Breakfast was included, and was pretty good, though it was the same stuff all week long, even on the weekend. One big no no for me was the lack of free WiFi, you had to pay 2euro per hour or 7euro for a whole day.. so keep that in mind if you're coming here. Nice hotel for the price and the location is pretty good, but I think the mitte area is better for young people coming to visit.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga, Latvia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly personal\u201d", "Author": "alaska088", "ReviewID": "UR84990072", "Content": "The location of the hotel is excellent - all tipes of transport are just minutes from it.

The hotel is staffed with Russians so launguage was sometimes a problem. The buffet breakfast was just the job, we made up rolls for the day too.

The shared shower and toilets were impeccably clean and modern - we were glad we didn't pay the extra EUR15 a night she tried to persuade us to on check-in for ensuite! They also put on a fantastic breakfast in the morning - bread, ham, cheese, cereal, stollen, juices, fruit - more than I expected. Location wise it is pretty good depending on what you are looking for. Being next to KaDeWe and the Kudamm was great - although very quiet in the evening. We were there for Mauerfall 09, so spent most of our time heading east towards Brandenburg Tor - although late night U-Bahn connections made sure it was very easy to get back. You are also close to Zoologsicher Platz with direct trains to the Airport so it is very well connected.

The venetian blind didn't shut and the curtains were see-through, but luckily, I was on the fifth floor and felt safe from prospective peeping toms.

FIRST DAY: very noisy! My room was at the second floor next to the housekeeping room and someone was slamming the door every five minutes! I could not sleep or just relax in the afternoon. I kindly asked the young lady not to slam the door (who previously rushed in my room without knocking at the door -- I was half naked!!), she apologized... 10 minutes later : BAM BAM BAM! . I returned to the housekeeping room: there was a man (I tried to explain the problem but no one in this hotel except at the reception speak English, they speak German of course and Russian, so good luck!) SECOND DAY: At the breakfest lounge: I asked if there were some hot milk. A very unpleasant person coldly answered: \"THERE!\" (there was some cold milk only...) After breakfast I went back to my room. \"BAM, BAM!\" every five minutes! I returned fot the third time to the housekepping room and asked for silence! Another lady apologized but a few hours later : \"BAM, BAM\" !!! A real nightmare. Finally I decided to explain the problem to a nice lady at the reception, who kindly wrote a paper in Russian for the housekeepers... (the only pleasant and polite person in this hotel...) THIRD DAY (the day I'm writing this review from my room): I spend the whole night out of the hotel and arrived this morning. I kindly asked the receptionnist --another lady I had never seen before-- if it was possible just to change the towels in the bathroom, and not to make my bed as I wanted to sleep the whole day and not to be disturbed by the housekeeper. She was VERY unpleasant -- not even a smile -- and told me that customers had to keep their towels which were not supposed to be changed every day!! I found this very strange for a hotel, also because their towels are very small and thin, and I replied to the lady that in hotels, customers put the towels on the floor to say \"please change the towels\". She seemed completely unaware of this custom... She coldly replied \"ok for this time\" (...) I will never return to this hotel also because they have absolutely no consideration for returning customers. I was so annoyed by their attitude that yesterday after lunch, that I decided to visit a small hotel in the same street (Ansbacher Strasse) for my next trip to Berlin and asked if I could have a look at one room : people were very kind, and were offering a single room for almost the same price!", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location\u201d", "Author": "Estonian_girl", "ReviewID": "UR13354573", "Content": "The location of the hotel is perfect, being next to KaDeWe (posh & biggest department store in mainland Europe, think Harrods & make sure u try their champignons!) and the Zoo. Bahnhof Zoo station has enjoyed a bad image due to drug trade but the hotel location is perefectly fine and I really enjoyed my night-time walks. After all, it's a minute or 2 away from Europa-Center shopping, Ku'damm with all the designer shops and in the heart of Berlin. You also have a tube station on the street and the nearby Zoo station is the centre of Berlin traffic, so you can easily go anywhere, although a lot of sights are within walking distance. Conveniently for tourists, tourist information is also nearby - you could wish for nothing more in terms of location. The hotel itself is nice, with a friendly Eastern European receptionist, and there is nothing to complain about concerning the rooms. I saw the memorial church from my window and it was really quiet at night! The guests are a mix of budget travellers - Italian and French pernsioners, German school groups etc and the breakfast buffet is enjoyable. There is a spa on the top floor of the building next-door which may be worth checking out, and I really enjoyed my late cups of Turkish tea opposite in Cafe Ansbach, which is incredibly cheap. For a gourmet experience, try KaDeWe 7th floor. I really felt sorry when leaving cos I felt like home, like a true Berliner. I've been back many times since!

The rooms were fairly basic although clean and comfortable. They were sparsely decorated and furnished and had blinds on the windows rather than curtains. The blinds didn't close properly so there wasn't a feeling of total privacy. The rooms didn't have tea/coffee making facilities although there were vending machines on two of the floors. The website states that the hotel has a bar, which it doesn't although you can buy cold beers out of the vending machine. On one of the nights the vending machine was empty. Our main reasons for booking this hotel were price and location and we were happy with both. The location, close to the Zoo and the Tiergarten is ideal for many attractions.
