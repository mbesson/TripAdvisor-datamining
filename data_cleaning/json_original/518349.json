The hotel is spectacular, and very well located near a metro station. Everything is easily accessible. We really enjoyed the design. The lobby is beautiful, and the staff is great. We really felt welcome, and the check-in was a breeze. The place smells wonderful and looks clean. The room (standard room) was beautiful and we loved everything at first sight. We had a small problem with the TV, but maintenance was there in 5 minutes. They quickly discovered that everything was working properly, and that they only had to change the batteries in the remote controller. Nevertheless, they offered to upgrade us free of charge - we declined because we felt this would be abusing the system, but we honestly think that this summarizes the service at this hotel : efficient, and excellent. The restaurant is nice. We didn't try the breakfast, but the dinner was great. Much better than your average hotel-fare. The waiter was very talkative and very accommodating. This would make for a perfect hotel if... and that is a big if, for a hotel... if we had been able to sleep for the two nights we spent there. The bed was hard as a rock, very uncomfortable, and we spent two horrible nights waking up every hours and two awful days feeling exhausted. I have never thought about us as picky. To be honest we have slept in beds so old that they had holes in the center, and never complained. This is the first time I feel I cannot sleep because of how hard the bed is. I've never seen this problem mentionned in all the critics on Tripadvisor, so I guess this is just us, and this bed was just not the right one for us. And it's a shame, really, because we loved this hotel so much. But I would not go back, nor would I recommend it to my friends and family : an hotel where you cannot sleep is not a hotel you want to go to.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location - value for money\u201d", "Author": "sarah d", "ReviewID": "UR127990887", "Content": "This is a great hotel, with friendly staff and in a good location. The hotel itself is very nice and modern with great views from the rooftop of the mountains, Torre agbar and sagrada de familia.

The room was cleared and replenished with new towels and mini bar items everyday. We didn't actually eat at the hotel, but at the food court in the shopping centre called Glories, this is just across the road. There is also a supermarket here if you need to get some water or any basics. For travel we bought a 10 trip card for 9 euros, this can be used on the metro, tram and buses, all these transport links are 5 mins walk from the hotel and are really easy to use, you can also get to and from the airport using this metro card on train. The hotel is only 4 stops away from plaza catalunya where you can walk down las ramblas, or you can get the tram down to the beach which takes 5 to 10 mins and the hotel is also 5 to 10 mins away from sagrada de familia by metro.

E.g. the rooms are not carefully built, typical aspects of comfort like a coffee maschine or water boiler are missing, you don't find the tissues, showering waters inevitably the whole bathroom etc. Breakfast is OK but too expensive when not included in the room rate. I recommend everybody to cross the street as there is the gorgies shopping center with a food court and a lot of caf\u00e9s over there where your breakfast will be fine and at a fraction of the hotel costs.

Barcelona itself is expensive for hotels when compared to other cities e.g Madrid, Seville, Cordoba and Granada and this reflects the Citiy's popularity as a tourist destination. The hotel is beside a modern building lit up at night which resembles the London Gherkin so it is difficult to miss. It is also very close (300 metres) to the Metro and convenient to several large shopping centres. The room was great if a little expensive. We were less impressed with the reception, the seating area and the restaurant which we think did not live up to the standard of the hotel. Service was poor and menus quite limited and expensive.

We stayed in the hotel Silken Diagonal as this appeared well recommended on trip advisor. However, word of warning to future travellers .... pack plenty of pain killers for your inevitable bad back should you choose to stay at this hotel. The hotel really needs to take on board the need for comfortable beds for city break travelers, for a four star hotel they need to make some changes to the quality of beds they are offering. Also we specifically requested a double or kingsize bed but had to push two single beds together!! Another point to mention, specially for us Brits who love our morning brew , there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which we found most suprising for a four star hotel!!!

The liocation is good - 3 min walking distance from metro station Glories +3 or 4 stops to the very center of Barcelona.15-20 min walk (or 3 stops by metro) to Sagrada Familia. Tourist bus stop is just opposite the hotel dore across the road. We were using this bus during 2 days. This is the \"City tour\", absolutely the same logic as in London, by double deckers. Tickets and earphones are available on board. Excursions are provided in the majority of languages. In the bus you will get a small book with a lot of supplementary discounts for the sightseengs and restaurants/bars in Barcelona. Shopping Center Glories is situated in front of the hotel, also across the road. Honestly, I did not find \"Glories\" very interesting from shopping perspective :) but there are a lot of small restaurants and bars to stay in the evening if do not want to move away from the hotel. Our room was reasonably big and always clean. The beds were comfortable. Soundproofing is good. Interesting design of the hotel from inside. Just for the traveller information as this is not a unique set provided in the hotel of this level. Provided: shower gel, shampoo, soap, shaving set and AS lotion, shower cap, toothbrush/paste, comb, sponges. Not provided: slippers (indoor shoe). If I try to see where I can find the weaknesses - this is probably that reception is always busy - a lot of people. But I do not think this is the significant point.

The location is a new modern business district, quiet with no street noise which means that sleep quality is very good. The hotel is walkable to Sagrada Familia (20 mins) city centre (45) but taxis are plentiful outside and reasonably priced in Barcelona which makes getting about affordable. The tourist bus stops opposite the hotel and the tickets can be conveniently bought at reception. The hotel is right next to the Torre Agbar tower which is beautiful at night lit up all different colours and can be viewed up close from the rooftop decking leisure area Floor 10. There is a small dipping pool up there also which would probably be very crowded in the high season. The tower is also useful if you are out walking as you can find your way back. We arrived for a break over New Year and found the reception very nicely decorated for the Festive Season and the staff at reception very helpful and friendly. We were instructed how to use the (3) lifts and if the instructions are followed the lifts are fast and easy to operate. The room itself was comfortable quite basic but the bed was large and very comfy. The bathroom was the weak link though - bath & shower quite awkward to operate and shower screen fixed which made it more so. We did not find the glass wall a problem at all (see other reviews) as there is a screen and the toilet cubicle itself is private, but we thought the glass bathroom door was a hazard so kept that open all the time in order not to walk into it. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as at 18 euros each its pricey, but there are several cafes & Starbucks just across the road at the Glories Mall and a large Carrefour supermarket where breakfast items could be found so plenty of choice. To conclude we intend to stay again at the Diagonal as we found it a lovely hotel, clean, modern and ideal as a base to explore the city and comfortable to return to after doing that.

We booked flights and hotel via lastminute.com and got a fantastic deal. Less than \u00a3300 per couple for 2 nights, flights included. Hotel is in a good position within walking distance to Sagrada Familia. Other than that, we used taxis to get around in as we were 2 couples to share the cost. Cost of taxis to and from Las Ramblas varied depending which route the driver took. Anything from 6EU to 10EU. The taxi rank is at the side of the hotel, by the entrance to the Novotel next door. Las Ramblas is a must, but do not eat at the bottom end in the middle of the pedestrian walkway, where all the tables and chairs are as you will be severely ripped off like us if you do. We found that the best place for tapas and drinks if you want to stay on las ramblas was a restaurant (can't remember it's name unfortunately) at the Caralunya square end of las ramblas, right at the top on the right hand side (as you enter las ramblas, looking down towards the port). It's painted white in the shape of a castle and has tables and chairs outside as well as inside seating. Without a doubt, the tapas and paella were by far the best in quality and price and the service was excellent. One of the waiters was a wonderful lady called Susane, she was Spanish and spoke English with an American accent. She would'nt let me go home without giving me a present, a beautiful necklace, as she said I reminded her of her sister. We originally went for breakfast and ended up going back for lunch as the quality of the food was so good. We also ate in the surrounding streets at bars, the market, and down by the port/harbour. We nwver actually tried the food in the hotel although the menu looked good and reasonably priced for hotel food. We did take advantage of the mini bar in our room as again, the drinks were reasonably priced. We ate out a few times in the Glories shopping centre next to the hotel, breakfast in Starbucks one day and dinner at the Italian restaurant which was delicious and good value for money. If you stand outside the hotel and turn right down the main road, at the end of the Glories is a little tapas restaurant which was the best value for money, portion size and taste we had. The courses kept on coming and the bill for 4 people including a bottle of wine, water and 4 large beers was around 80 euros. Fantastic value for money and delicious food. Next to the hotel was a little bar run by a Chinese/Spanish family which was also excellent value for money, cheap booze and the food looked good and although we never ate there, we can defintely vouch for the vino tinto, blanco and beer. The hotel room was comfortable if not compact, but I found the bed quite hard and did not sleep very well. Working out the shower/bath was no mean feat and difficult to fill the bath unless you were standing inside it due to the unmoveable shower screen. The vies from the hotel roof were fantastic and the sight of the Torre Agbar lit up at night next to the hotel was something to behold.

The room was fantastic. Very modern and stylish. The only downside was it was two beds pushed together.. The bathroom is seethrough but the toilet is in a seperate room which you cant see into at all. There is a flat screen TV which we didnt use. Our room was made off two large glass walls with electric blackout blinds that you operated by a switch next to the bed. I loved this - the view was great! There is a hairdryer provided in the room and a mini bar (pay for items you use) but we used the fridge to store drinks we bought in from outside. The hotel location was good. It is situated near to Clot underground station (five min walk) or Glories tram station (two minute walk). There was a shopping area opposite the hotel consisting of cafes, restaurants, shops and a supermarket. The hotel is themed in a very modern and futuristic style - but we loved it for this reason. The staff in the hotel were brilliant. The reception staff were very well informed about the city and every time we assked for help they gave us the perfect advise (ie. how to get to places, where to eat at night, etc) The roof top bar / pool area is very nice and gives FANTASTIC views over the port / city depending which way you look. I would say the pool is not for swimming though - it is tiny and I would be disappointed if I had booked the hotel in the summer to use the pool as it really is small. There is a bar in the lobby of the hotel. It is a very cool and modern style and we had drinks here. The 'barman / waiter' came to your table for your order and then served the drinks to you. He was very friendly! There is a good cocktail menu in this bar!!! We didnt use the restaurant as we like to eat out when away - but it looked nice and the menu was good. The city itself was outstanding. I booked the holiday as a surprise for my boyfriends 30th so that we could watch Barcelona play at Nou Camp. We did all the tourist stuff - sight seeing etc and found that the Big Red Bus Tour was great value for money and an easy way to get around the city. We also purchased T10 tickets for the underground/tram network and these were brilliant - you use one 'blip' per person for a journey no matter where you go or how many trains (so for example, to get to Nou Camp you need to get a tram from the hotel to the city centre and then change to the underground - but you only need to use one 'blip' as you dont exit the station).

I'm sure the roof terrace would be nice in the summer and when it's not raining. When we arrived there was some confusion as we had booked with a special offer but the message hadn't got through. First we had a room without a nice view which wasn't what we booked so we then moved to one on the other side. Both these rooms were ok but a bit small and the furniture was a bit shabby. Then we got a phone call from reception and they moved us to a suite up on the 9th floor, which I guess was the one we actually booked (or perhaps an upgrade, not sure). Anyway, it was lovely - a corner room with great views and both a bath and shower. I would recommend booking one of these. The rest of the stay was great, just the place to retreat from the rain!

The modern hotel has many stylish touches with lots of brass, shiny floors and white furniture in the lobby. LOCATION: Hotel is well placed opposite a shopping area with restaurants and shops like Zara, Massimo Dutti etc, Starbucks etc. It is also next to a tram line and metro station (useful for getting around town). There are a lot of bars/restaurants heading towards a large roundabout which is packed on the weekend. The hotel near to several sights including the Sagrada Familia and the Torre which lights up at night. You can see the Sagrada Familia from the roof terrace. ROOM: We had a standard room which was very comfortable with a floor to ceiling window on one side of the room looking out into the shopping area. Bathroom was interesting - make sure you are sharing with someone you are comfortable with as there is an uninterrupted view of the showers through a large glass pane. There are plugs in the bathroom- handy! The room coms with TV (BBC News is the only English speaking channel) and a well stocked mini bar. You also get nice sweets next to the bed! BAR/RESTAURANT: We did not eat in the hotel as to be honest the prices looked a little exorbitant and Barcelona has so many great places to eat there is no point is eating there simply because of the convenience. The bar is at hotel entrance where we spent a lot of time with a short cocktail menu. At peak times, they could do with more than one bartender. While the roof terrace was closed when we were there, it is well worth going to the top floor to get a look at the view, especially at night. WOULD I STAY HERE AGAIN? Definitely. We found a special rate online and recommend shopping around to see if you can get one too.

There is a shopping centre, with various fast food eateries/restaurants/tapas bars and a supermarket, just across the Avenue Diagonal. Taxi from airport is around 35 Euros (this includes a hefty 25% surcharge for travelling in a party of more than one) The reception and floor corridors are very dimly lit which is a bit disconcerting at first, especially at night. The lift is unique in that you enter your floor destination on a keypad in the lobby. The lift then assigns you a choice of lift (either A, B or C). Make sure you enter the correct lift, as you cannot change your floor choice once in the lift. The room (room 420) was reasonably sized. The bed was large but firm and the pillows were not to my taste (not substantial enough) and I had to request additional ones. When it comes to the bathroom, this is where things get a little weird. The front part of the bath/shower are enclosed in a glass partition which is completely visible from the main room, whilst the side are encased by a shaded fabric sort of cover which only partially resticts the view. The rooms are therefore not really suitable for couples who are not comfortable seeing each other naked! The power to the rooms are controlled by placing your room card in a card slot, and are fully air conditioned (during hot weather I recommend you place any spare loyalty type card you may have in the slot during the day so your room is kept cool). The mini bar was expensive (as you'd expect), but I prefer to buy my own provisions and keep these in the fridge instead (the cleaning staff don't seem to mind!). The rooms are advertised as sound proofed, but this is definitely not the case. There is a building site next door and the sound of the piledriver can wake you up around 8am, so not recommended for those wanting to sleep in late in the morning. In addition to this the windows in the rooms have automated sliding blinds which are quite noisy and these can be heard from other rooms. The hotel also has a small rooftop terrace with pool, although the pool only measures 7ft/4ft and the number of beds/chairs is rather limited.

It is a quirky, unusual hotel with distinct positives and negatives. I think some guests will really like it while others will find it quite annoying. The rooftop pool is a cool-looking triangle, but only seven meters at longest point and quite shallow. More a communal urinal for the rooftop bar than an actual swimming pool. The walls and roof are open to the Barcelona breezes and enjoyable views. The elevators are clean inside with no buttons or controls. Instead of a call button for up or down outside the elevators, there is a keypad on which guests enter their destination floor. The display shows the selected floor, then the assigned elevator (designated \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\"). It's important to watch for the elevator identifier, because it is only displayed briefly, and if you get into the wrong one, you'll end up elsewhere. Once inside there is no opportunity to choose a floor or change your mind. My room at least was quite small, and (typical for Europe), the supposed king-size bed was two beds next to each other, with separate mattresses, sheets, etc. I was disappointed in the lack of drawer space (only two shallow ones) but there are also a few shelves. My room had windows on two sides (one on Avenida Diagona) which opened for fresh air. There were two shades, one for darkness, and a sheer one for privacy, both electrically raised and lowered by bed-side controls. Housekeeping supplies tiny boxes of folded-up Kleenex with only five tissues per box. I found this wasteful (lots of extra packaging) and annoying. The bathroom has all-glass walls to the room. This allows in more light, and provides an open, interesting look. However, it might not be good for friends or couples staying in one room (although the toilet is in its own room with a non-glass door). The rainshower in the tub is nice, but lack of a divider (common for Europe) means the floor gets flooded with every shower, no matter how brief. There are no washcloths. I dislike hotels that cheap out like this. If I'd had a knife I'd have hacked down a hand towel. There are ample warnings about not leaving valuables in the room or in drawers, being sure the safe and room doors are closed properly, etc. This hotel has the worst Internet access I experienced in four continents. Even the premium, \"business-grade\" couldn't keep a VPN or ssh connection up, and Skype was unusable. The room layout is evil: placement of furniture relative to bed forces one to walk in a narrow channel around the corner of the bed. The mattress sits set back on a wood frame, so the eye sees the white sheet-clad mattress but not the dark edge of the platform, so the shin hits the corner of the frame. If I bang my shin once, I figure it's my fault for being clumsy, but when it happens repeatedly, I blame the system. To their credit, the breakfast buffet was very nice, and included both smoked salmon and plain yoghurt (two things I always want) as well as other meats and cheeses, a large number of pork products, eggs, and a nice selection of fresh fruit, which included sliced and skinned kiwifruit (a definite plus in my book). I found the front desk staff very friendly and helpful, as were the housekeepers and restaurant workers. There is a assistant in the lobby instructing guests on how to operate the elevators. The hotel has a main door on Avenida Diagona with steps. There are also two side doors, one of which has a ramp, but this is not obvious, so guests are always struggling to get their luggage up and down the steps.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "suffolk", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "keri123", "ReviewID": "UR118855146", "Content": "lovely views over city of barecelona,nice pool on top of hotel.the rooms were so modern and clean.little shopping centre just across the road,where you could get fresh bread and doughnuts for breakfast.the breakfast at the hotel was very good if you wanted to treat yourself and hav e a glass or two of carva.great hotel would stay there again.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel- bit overpriced\u201d", "Author": "u01mph", "ReviewID": "UR118542740", "Content": "Positives: Good location. 2 minutes walk from Glories metro stop which means you can get from the hotel to the heart of the city in about 15 minutes.

Especially the night desk attendant who checked us in at half past midnight on 21st September and dealt with a crowd and busy telephone with patience and charm. (1) No iron/ ironing board in room. Rang to ask for an iron, room service brought a travel iron with a UK plug (?) fortunately we have a universal adapter but the iron did not work. Rang again and room service brought another with a european plug, but it was covered with scorch marks and burnt clothes residue. Trying to iron a short for a business meeting the next day on a table (not ironing board possible apparently) with a crap iron when arriving after midnight is not my idea of fun. (2) bathroom arrangement - terrible!!. Glass walls around the bathroom area mean you are 'on display' when having a shower. Offputting to say the least. Also impossible not to flood the bathroom floor, as there is such a short glass screen around the bath and the bath surround does not allow draining back to the bath. I dread to think of the water damage that this must cause in the hotel. Lovely fixtures and fittings but implemented in an impractical stupid way. (3) room not clean - sticky rings on the table and floor not vacuumed around the desk area. (4) dark fake oak veneer Ikea-like furniture seem trendy, but it looks crap when chipped and scratched (as it was in our room, 504). View is of a building site with accompanying noise next door. (4) performance of the wireless-only (no ethernet connection) internet service was bad. Unreliable - fell out every 10 minutes IF you could even get a connection.

Tried to show her how I should open my safe and failed. Luckily this time the maintenance man came soon - repaired the plug and told me he couldn't fix the safe. I should get another one sone. Now - one week later - still no safe. Btw, safe is large enough for a netbook, not laptop. Using my friend's safe now. Taking a shower is awful! All the water runs on the bathroom floor. Positive: every day clean towels, sheets, bath foam, shampoo,.... A pity that kids are diving in the 4*2 m pool, which isn't designed to be used for that. Breakfast is ok, but the only extra is the unlimited cava and wine. Every day the same things. Elevators are nice and comfortable, but make noice, which disturbs when trying to get to sleep.

Our bags were taken to our room on the 6th floor and the room was a corner room with 2 huge glass windows, it definately had the wow factor and a fantastic view across to the Sagrada Familia from one window. Electic blinds blacked out all light when closed and although situated on the busy Diaganol road, we weren't troubled by noise. Opposite the hotel is a large shopping centre with a Carrefour supermarket and outdoor cafes etc, however, we set off to explore and found many very nice Spanish restaurants within easy walking distance. If you turn right outside the hotel and walk along then turn into the Rambla del Poblenau, there are lots of outdoor street restaurants. Carry on and you reach the the beach with sunbeds and beach bars. Turning left will take you to the Sagrada Familia.

It\u2019s also one stop from Clot Metro Station which connects to the main railway line for access to the airport. I\u2019d recommend buying a 2, 3 or 4 day ticket for the Metro as it\u2019s the cheapest way to get around. The red hop on hop off tour bus also stops directly opposite the hotel so it\u2019s worth buying a two day ticket (30 Euros) as there are two routes which go east and west round the city and it\u2019s a great way to see the sites. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms, but there is a small fridge in the mini bar which we used for own purchases of water, wine, yoghurts, etc., which we bought in the supermarket opposite as the hotel breakfasts were expensive. We drank coffee in Starbucks in the shopping centre opposite rather than sit in the hotel so we could sit outside in the sun. The bathrooms are not very private so I wouldn\u2019t go here with someone I didn\u2019t know very well. They are separated from the bedroom by a glass wall covered with fabric screen that is semi-see through. One person would have to leave the room if they wanted to shower privately. The bathroom looks nice but it\u2019s not very practical as the floor was always wet; however, the towels were changed daily. The rooms are nice and dark but the electric shutters and blinds are quite noisy and I could hear the lift whistling all night, but my friend slept through it and never heard a thing. The \u2018pool\u2019 on the roof is a nice area to sit although it\u2019s not actually a pool \u2013 you can get in to get wet and cool off if you are hot but you couldn\u2019t swim in it. It also only seemed to get the sun in the morning as the Torres Agbar meant it was in the shade later. The views are great though and if you go to the back of the pool area you can see the Segrada Familia from a good vantage point. I didn\u2019t see any pool parties in the week we stayed there, in fact there was hardly anyone sitting there at night, we took our own wine up there one night as the roof-top bar was closed. The beach is within walking distance (30 mins) or you can take the Metro. Be warned that the Metro closes at midnight during the week so we ended up walking home on the first night as we couldn\u2019t fathom the route of the night buses and it was a good hour and a half walk in dress sandals!

I had very high hopes for this hotel, but they were quashed by some functional issues that were not resolved to our satisfaction. The only reason I am giving this hotel 2 stars is because the breakfast is phenomenal. When Americans travel to spain, they must realize that breakfast and lunch are more emphasized than dinner, as Spaniards typically only eat tapas for dinner. The purpose of our trip was to go to for Sonar music festival parties (not the festival itself) and see the city, and this hotel has legendary rooftop parties. Our expectation was that there would be a lot of people partying in the hotel knowing the situation, so that is not what our dissatisfaction is about. The main thing is that I think they saw we were from Detroit and so they assumed we had no standards. We paid 165 euros (about $200/night) to sleep in a TINY (the \"comfort\" room, ironically enough) room, have breakfast, and go the the rooftop parties. Here's a list of everything that sucked about the hotel: 1. Our room did NOT have WIFI as advertised. No signal - zilch, zero, none. When my fiance brought this to the attention of the front desk, they said they knew our room didn't have it, but they couldn't move us because they were booked. Instead they gave us a pass for full internet access instead of web browsing, but as anyone on Trip Advisor knows, that doesn't matter if you can't get a freaking signal. They wouldn't even give us an ethernet cable to jack into the wall. I was really quite annoyed to learn that they knew about this problem in advance and didn't fix it in between the time we booked and arrived, which was about two months. It was very important for me to have net access because it was the only way for me to get in touch with my friends looking after our dogs, and yeah, I could have gone to the lobby... if I could have caught an elevator. More on that later. After this problem, we didn't report anything else, as all we expected is more sorry excuses as to why it \"was not possible\" to fix them. 1. The air conditioning didn't work, so we had to open the window = no rest for the weary, due to the loudness and the window needing to be opened constantly in order to avoid pruning. 2. The handle in the bathroom was all janky jankerson. Both my fiance and my friend (staying in another room) both got stuck in the bathroom and we had to let them our from the outside. 3. The furniture is very low quality ikea crap. Sure, it looks nice... if you can get past the nicks, dings, and spills, I guess the \"design\" is fair, but NOT FUNCTIONAL, and certainly not spectacular as the propaganda on their website would have you believe. As any good architect knows, the design must both function and be aesthetically pleasing to fall into the category of spectacular. 4. This room beat the living daylights our of us. Every time we turned around in the tiny room we either got a Tanya Harding to the shins from the bed corners or a sharp edge of a door handle digging into the back of our arms or some other like injury. 5 . When they changed our white bed linens, there was a big dirt stain on the top layer. 6. They never left us a price list for the mini-bar where it was supposed to be, even after they cleaned the room. 7. It was IMPOSSIBLE to catch the elevator, so there was a lot of stairwell climbing. Instead of reserving 1 elevator for people just going to the party, and the other 2 for people staying at the hotel, they co-mingled all 3 elevators. 8. The security was very rude. Also, even though we were paying out the behind to stay at the hotel, they would not let us bring drinks from the hotel onto the roof (even though you can do that at pretty much any hotel if the drinks are in a plastic cup), so drinks were 10 euro, the crappy quality beer was 5 euro - that even goes for people who got their drinks from the mini bar. I could see not letting people who weren't staying there not bring stuff in, but your own guests? seriously? terrible, terrible service. 9. Whenever we had a question about something at the front desk, they responded with an arrogant stank-eye instead of working with you to resolve the situation. 10. There is no ATM/ cash machine in the hotel - you have to go on a full out jungle excursion to the mall across the street if you want money. It literally wasted 2 hours of our vacation trying to find the darn thing. If most jet-setters are anything like us, the last place you want to go on vacation is to a flipping mall. 11. They didn't bother to clean the swimming pool on the roof, where the parties were, while the parties were going on. There was a bunch of litter and dirt accumulating. I was scared to take a dip, even though somedays it was pretty ungodly in terms of heat... and our a/c was broken. I know this is not what many people would want to accept as the truth, and I didn't listen to previous trip advisor reviews either because it looked so nice and was next to Torre Agbar, etc, but retrospectively I wish I had. The only thing mildly convenient was being able to ring 2 or 3 sets of friends staying in adjacent rooms... and the breakfast was fresh and delightful, but truthfully, the breakfast is fresh and delightful at almost any non-tourist restaurant in Barca!

The hotel is about 1 km (20 mins walk) to the Sagrada Familia and has good views of it as well. It is also only 2 min walk from metro station Glories and about 3 stops from the city centre. A bonus of this hotel is that across the road is a large shopping centre which also has a square with a few restaurants meaning you don't have to venture far if you don't want to. The room was lovely and airy. We absolutely loved the shower (massive shower head, great water pressure!). The electric blinds are quite cool and the floor to ceiling windows allow for some great views and light. The beds are large and very comfortable. The room was clean and well proportioned. I understand others comments regarding being able to see into the bathroom but as we are a couple it's not an issue. The toilet is closed off which is the main thing! The hotel also has a roof terrace with a plunge pool and loungers etc. The only drawback here is that the bar up there doesn't open during the day or early evening, meaning you have to go down 10 floors each time you want a drink from the bar at reception. The reason I gave service a 3 is because of the above about the terrace bar not being open and because I think the staff could have made more of an effort to make people feel welcome, such as smiling on occassion and cutting conversations short to serve people rather than finishing private conversations first. Also as we didn't really require any service, I don't have any other opinion on it. We had no problem leaving our bags at the hotel on the last day and they held in a secure storage room until you pick them up. The big attraction of this hotel is the location. I must state that there is some construction going on around the hotel and that the views from your room are not always going to be the best if you are on one of the lower floors. We weren't worried about this (we were on the 5th floor of a total 10 floors) as we didn't spent much time in the room as we were out all day and most of the evening, but others may be. The roof will always be the best place for views as you can see for miles. We didn't have any breakfast or meals at the hotel so I can comment on those other than to say breakfast is 18 EUR a person if you have not got it included in the price and this is for a simple continental breakfast so you may be better off popping to starbucks across the road for something to eat before you set off for the day.

Perfect room, until we discovered that the AC was not working. The temperature was more than 30 deg C after a while (the building is made of glass & steel only). After a few phone call to reception I was told the AC was not working, and was not going to work for my one night stay as we were a saturday and the technician would come only on a Monday. They admitted they knew the situation, they also knew we would come with a 3 month old baby. So not really professional from their part...they thought that having a suite would calm us... After some argument, we finally had one fan, the noisiest one I ever had which managed to cool down the room together with opening the windows. We had to keep the curtains open to let some air coming into the room, and of course kept the windows open. That hotel is situated in a busy street, next to a shopping center, so a bit noisy at night. We had a 20% discount at the end, which I asked otherwise they would have charge me the full amount. I met a colleague the day after who had exactly the same AC issue, in a single occupancy room. In his case a technician came and fixed it. There are still things I can't explain about that hotel... On the + side, the hotel is nicely located, next to the Tore Agbar, beautiful at night with varying colours. Beautiful view from the top floor with a small swimming pool. The hotel is situated as well next to a shopping center, and a metro station. Oh, one thing about the metro, don't listen to the receptionist who tells you that there are lifts at the metro station and that you can take your baby pram, there are nones.

We obviously knew the location of the hotel when we booked but personally I feel it lets the hotel down.

It is also at least 2 tube journeys to most of the main sites in Barcelona and a 5-10 minute walk to the station which is a little daunting late at night. There is not much in the immediate area except a shopping mall acroos the road which is quite boring but does have generic high street shops and cafes in it. On check in the staff were not very friendy, I don't think any of them actually smiled once, they seemed bored and uninterested. The lobby is very contemporary but it is a bit too much, it is very dark and the corridor to our room was even worse - it had no natural light and was like a nighclub with strange neon lights only! The room on first impression is quite cool and quirky but in actual fact its not very practical. It has a floor to ceiling window but unfortunately our view was just of grey drab buildings so not much point to it except for the light! The bathroom has a strange partition which moves and is actually see-through so there is no privacy at all whilst in the shower or bath. The shower head is placed to far out and soaks the bathroom floor. The bed was however quite comfortable and room has all the usual things needed, safe, TV, air con etc. On our first morning we were woken first by the maid letting herself in before 9am then about 10 minutes later by another male member of staff which was not the best seeing as though you can see the bed from the door! Also on the first morning whilst my fiance was having a shave the sink plug stuck and would not empty the sink so we filled in a form for repairs that could be left on the doorknob. We left for a days sighseeing and on our return over 7 hours later at 5pm our room had not been cleaned, bed not made, towels not changed and sink still full of dirty water and plug still stuck, even though the repair form had been removed from the door knob!!! However we rang down to reception and a rather grumpy repairman did come to fix it straight away. The walls are quite thin and must have beds back to back in adjacent rooms as on the second morning I was woken by the couples next door lovemaking!!!!!!! The rooftop pool area is a nice addition and has excellent views from it but the pool is very small for the space and on both days when we went up there all the sunbeds were taken.

It's only a 25 minute straight walk to the beach, 4 Metro stops to the downtown core (very short) and you can walk to local sights, you have a large mall right across the street (Glories) that carries everything you could possibly need on any trip, also due to the location the local area is nice and quiet come bed time since you are not in a busy core. To those who do choose this hotel here are some tips... - The hotel offers free WiFi, all you need to do is at the front desk ask for it and they will give you 24 hours of use with a username and pass all you need to show is your passport, you can request multiple days also, so you do not have to keep asking. - There are mixed reviews about an inroom kettle, our room did not have one and when asked they were not able to provide one. - The sea food place beside the hotel covered by a wall (when you face the hotel it is on the left side) is the best seafood out there and it's really cheap. Bring an empty stomach if you love sea food you will be full and happy at the end. - We were worried about the lack of English speaking locals there but English is actually fairly common in tourist areas and even those who don't speak it will make a very strong effort to communicate with hand signals and pointing, they are very helpful and friendly there. But still try your best to learn a little Spanish if you can, to make things easier. - Pick pocketing is all the rave on the net for Barcelona but as long as you play it smart you won\u2019t be pick pocketed. We never got pick pocketed at all. Just remember only carry as much as you need for the day on you, place money in a hard to access pocket or pouch don't carry a wallet in your back pocket.

It's in a safe, sanitized neighborhood; I walked home each night ranging from 1 AM to 4 AM and felt totally safe.

The room is decent-sized and has a nice minibar, but the real highlight is the amazing amenities kit that blows away any five-star hotel I've ever stayed at.

The staff here is excellent; I arrived at 8 AM and hadn't slept for about 36 hours, and while a room wasn't available when I arrived, the staff was happy to let me check in at 11:30, several hours early, once a room was made available. Everyone I spoke to spoke at least some English -- way more than my embarrassingly limited Spanish -- and a fair amount of the staff was totally fluent. NEGATIVES: The room's AC was pretty weak, and you had to insert your room card to operate the lights or the AC, so if it ever got particularly warm outside, you'd come home to a warm room. The shower/bath is in a glass sort of pod that's easy to see, so I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're traveling with someone who you don't want to see you naked. Room service stops at 11 PM. \"Free\" wi-fi requires you to register with staff every 24 hours if you don't have an EU passport, and is highly erratic; paying a few euros a day for an account on the same network was far more effective for getting work done.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piraeus, Greece", "Title": "\u201cEXCELENT CHOICE...\u201d", "Author": "bou_sta", "ReviewID": "UR70190033", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights during jun.Very nice hotel, with beautiful and modern decoration, at a good enough location close to the Agbar skyscraper (nearby commercial center, metro and tram station) and 15 min walk from sagrada familia and cuitatella park.

The \"tram\" runs down Avenida Diagonal right in front of the hotel but I'm not sure where it goes. Metro is several blocks away. Taxis are frequent. (Price to airport was $45 Euros.) SDB is ultra modern in a 90s sense which means dark, blacks, and grays. Prices for rooms varied widely--got mine thru AAA for a good price but others of my group paid MUCH more for the same or smaller rooms. My room was large with 2 huge floor-to-ceiling windows, 2 couches, 2 beds, a closet (BUT NO CHESTS OF DRAWERS), a safe, lots of options for lighting. No clock, no radio. TV with only one English station, plus one in French, one in German, and 3 in Spanish. A small window opened but noise from the street was then distracting. The BA was also large. The shower/tub was very high and quite dangerous to get in/out. NO shower door or curtain which then allowed most of the shower water to go on the floor of the BA. (There is a small half glass \"screen\"--like a stationary window attached to the side of the tub--that keeps some of the shower water in, but not much.) Beds were comfortable and bedding very fresh and clean. The a.c. was pretty good but neither the elevators nor the halls were a.c.'d, and they were VERY hot. Lobby, restaurants, and business center were a.c.'d. The room has a mini-bar into which one may put one's own food, however NO coffee/tea facilities in the room--VERY inconvenient! The \"business center\" consisted of 2 free computers w/ Internet and a printer. Dunno if copying/faxing was available or not. A GREAT inconvenience was NO PHONE MAIL (or messaging) in the rooms. For a hotel that tries hard to be ultra-modern, this was disappointing. Also the hotel did NOT change money, nor did I find a nearby bank. BTW banks are open only from 10-2 and close at noon on Fridays. SDB is right across the street from the large Glories Mall which has a food-court type area with reasonably priced cafes. Some took credit cards, and some did not. There is also a large supermarket in the mall but most things were packaged in large quantities. (They take credit cards.) Besides the hotel restaurants (which colleagues said were good), I saw no nice restaurants nearby. Two doors down was a 24-hr. pharmacy which was handy for several in the group who had minor hurts/ailments, forgot meds, etc. Very helpful staff but not well a.c.'d. The hotel has a LARGE wood deck on top of the building. Many people \"sunned\" themselves there but I was the only person I saw get into the TINY, freezing-cold pool. It was barely larger than king-sized bed. I've never been in such a cold pool, and I do a LOT of swimming. No possibility of actually swimming--too small and too cold. I chose this hotel because it was close to my business venue. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it highly. It was just OK. It was definitely NOT worth the higher price several colleagues paid for their rooms (most of which were smaller than mine).", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cNice Rooms\u201d", "Author": "BenjiBrown", "ReviewID": "UR68643943", "Content": "went to Barcelona for a long weekend and as we like to relax and do some sightseeing we booked a hotel with a pool.

All the hotels close to the venue were booked solid and the downtown hotels looked expensive. I found that the Fira Europa was about 30 minutes away by subway. I was there for 5 nights and it worked out great!. The major tourist areas downtown are a 10-minutesubway ride from the Diagonal on the L1 line. I was apprehensive about traveling alone in Barcelona. My neighbor \"lost\" his wallet at the airport just last year. Practically every American I met there had a story about pick pockets. The Diagonal is away from the tourist areas and the neighborhood felt very safe. I booked one of the deluxe rooms which was more than enough space for 2 and it provides a second very large window. The room was large, modern, relatively quiet and comfortable. The shower was amazing: A large, modern overhead fixture with plenty of water flow. It also has a directional shower wand both in a glass enclosed tub. The beds were European - 2 twins side-by-side with down comforters - Firm but comfortable with plenty of pillows. Rooms have wireless internet with free and pay options. The free option is slow, throttled access. You can use it for email if you access your mail via a website. It was not sufficient to support Outlook. The pay version is 6 Euros per day and is as fast as what i experience in US hotels. The TV has 3 or 4 English channels. The hotel does not have an exercise room; however, it is located on a wide, flat boulevard that is great for jogging, walking, bicycling. There is also a health club but I did not try it. The breakfast buffet at 17 Euros is not cheap but it offers a full selection of hot and cold items. There do not appear to be any other breakfast options at the mall across the street. The staff was great: Polite, responsive and bilingual. As pointed out by others you don't pick this hotel for the view. It overlooks a construction site on one side and the mall on the other. But having the Glories mall nearby is a very good thing - Plenty of restaurants and a grocer right across the street. The mall is the gathering place for the neighborhood. Lots of families come to visit in the open-air areas in the early evening. It is a great place to people watch. This is a solid 4-star hotel for a -star price. A tip: You can reach the Silken Diagonal form the airport using public transportation. Either take the Express Bus to te end of the line and catch the \"red\" L1 subway line to the Glories station. It is about a 300 yard walk from there and the station has elevators to street level. The other option is to take the train to the Clot station and catch the L1 to Glories from there (1 stop).

I travel a lot and know what I can expect paying certain price range. I stayed in hostels and luxury hotels - so, I'm pretty much aware of the fact you can't expect the same services for the different cost of the stay. But in case of Silken Diagonal I was absolutely stunned, that is why I decided to write a review. OK, first of all - my purpose of Barcelona visit was Primavera Sound 2010. Choosing the hotel I took into consideration location and services. Due to the tough schedule I wanted to find the place where I can relax from the busy nightlife. And Silken Diaginal seemed to be the best choice - 4 stars, not far from the venue, close to subway station. First of all, when I arrived, the staff was not that friendly you expect from such a place. Noone brought wine bottle opener to my room, instead they suggested to go to the lobby bar and open it there. Not much privacy, I thought, but didn't care a lot. Lobby bar where I supposed to spend quite amount of time was really-really small with transparent windows to the street with construction work - didn't like it at all. OK, let's check the swimming pool, I thought. The stuff told me the outdoor one has been closed (?) and will not open until 31/05. They didn't have any indoor pool either. Not having a pool I went back to the room to take a shower - disaster! There are 3 taps (shower tap, bath tap and 'jungle rain' tap - don't know the right name). In any position of the switch water runs out of all 3 of them. Furthermore, the shower is separated from the room by transparent (!) glass, not even matte. OK, i stayed alone - but what if I plan to invite someone later? Tired of all those things, I opened the curtains (my room was on the 1st floor) and has been stunned by a construction site view all over the street. What a great stay I'll have - I realized. And wasn't wrong - the next morning I was so tired of the fest that forgot to put DND sign on the door. The maid came in at 12, woke me up, apologized and gone. OK, my mistake, no problem. But then they were trying to break into my room each 15-20 mins until I realized I give up my sleeping attempts and got out. And the worst thing I left for the last - the last thing you expect from 4 star hotel is an absence of the Internet. There were no cable connection possible, only Wi-Fi, which could be used both ways - paid and unpaid. Paid option I didn't try - I came for leisure, not for the business trip. Nonpaid - it gave you password for 24 hours, no e-mail checks possible, only web - and God! it was SOOOO slow. It took 15 mins to download file of 5 Mb. Can you imagine that in 21st century in 4 star hotel?! Me neither. It was the last drop I decided to write this review. So, to resume: the hotel might be good for a business traveller leaving the room early and coming back late, willing to pay for Internet separately (the advert told, if you pay it'll be much faster and allow to check e-mail - didn't try, however). The good thing it is really close to subway station and to a big shopping mall named Glories. For the ones willing to have a great time in BCN, I DO NOT reccomend this hotel by all means.

The staff at Silken is extremely accommodating and speaks English quite well. Although we arrived 3 hours prior to the scheduled check-in time, we were given the room keys without any extra charge. There is also free internet which you can access by getting a printout every 24 hours for the network name and password. The metro station Glories is very close by and only 4 stops from the city center. The room was clean and the design was very modern and chic, although it is starting to look a bit dated. We especially enjoyed the glassed-in shower and huge tub, and we didn't have any problems figuring out which knobs to turn to get the water to come out (I am going to guess that other Americans were probably the ones with those issues). Likewise with water getting on the floor-- if you stand in the part of the tub that is enclosed, there is no major leakage. The bed was very firm, so if that is not your thing, I'd go elsewhere; however, it was pretty large. The electronic blinds were cool. Remember, you need to put your room key into a slot to turn on lights or ventilation (we were a bit puzzled at first). Despite our overall pleasant experience, there were a few letdowns as well. The walls at Silken are extremely thin, to the point that you can hear your neighbors' bodily functions, conversations, television selections, etc. If you are not comfortable with this, do not stay here!!! We had the terrible misfortune to be next to a man who was not only sick and coughing loudly all night long for 2 nights, but also got ragingly drunk and was banging about his room like an angry elephant. I could hear him with earplugs in. Luckily we had 3 other nights there of excellent sleep to make up for it, and the front desk staff was happy to switch our room. Secondly, the view from the Silken is nothing special. Empty lots and construction. We weren't looking for some amazing view, so we were not fazed at all by this. Do your sightseeing in the center. Finally, on our second-to-last day there, something happened either in a room or in the 4th floor hallway, and I can only say that I smelt the worst odor of raw sewage or human feces that I have ever been exposed to, mixed in with PineSol which the maid had clearly used to cover it up. Perhaps a guest was ill, perhaps something was wrong with the pipes, I am not sure. But it was really quite foul. It resolved in 18 hours or so and that was all we ever smelled; luckily, our room was fresh-smelling as ever. In short, I'd probably recommend the Silken to young couples. It's very modern, hip, and fresh. If you are someone older with mobility issues, more traditional tastes, or a desire for more luxury, better to stay at a boutique hotel in the Barri Gotic (and pay four times as much for it).", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cBeautifull room\u201d", "Author": "RoadtripNicaCosta", "ReviewID": "UR56295141", "Content": "We stayed here in october 2009 and loved the room.

Luckily, we weren\u2019t that unfortunate. Having booked a Silken Club room on the internet for a not-too-bad price, we arrived at noon and could immediately occupy the room while our reservation form said the room was only available from 3pm onwards. The room was one of the most convenient we\u2019ve ever had. We liked very much the floor-to-ceiling windows on either side of the room added a great sense of space to the room. The beds were huge, the wardrobes were sufficiently large and the safety box could hold a laptop or 2 SLR-cameras with a large telephoto lens. The table with 2 chairs was indeed more multi-purpose than a classic writing desk but I missed a desktop lamp when writing. I also missed tea & coffee making facilities which would certainly have made the room more homely.

My room was scrupulously clean, and while I didn't have a great view, for the price that's something I could live without. I don't think it's the hotel's fault if it's in an area earmarked for redevelopment. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows, and the electric blinds - 2 of them, worked fine and got the room totally dark, which I need to sleep. I'm sure the shower could be confusing - for the type of people who can't put the right shaped blocks in the right shaped holes. I'm no genius but I had it worked out in 10 seconds, and I rate that as a really nice shower. Sink stylish too, lots of great toiletries, which were replenished the next day. Nicely stocked mini-bar, but you're opposite a shopping centre with a huge Carrefour supermarket, so I'd recommend going there for any water / nibbles / Cava. I'd go over there for breakfast too, as it's a little overpriced at the SIlken. The restaurants look good, however, not that I ate there with all that the centre of Barcelona has to offer. I did have a drink at the lobby bar, which is actually reasonably priced, especially for regional Spanish wines, and I really like the lobby's look. Stylish without being unfriendly. Any complaints about the elevators are way off the mark. I never waited more than 5 or 6 seconds for one. You press the floor you're going to, and it tells you which of the three lifts - A, B or C - you need to get into. It arrives seconds later and you get in without having to press anything else. A nice touch. Staff were fine - I'm not a high maintenance guest anyway - but what I liked best about the hotel, apart from the stylish but comfortable room, was the location. I've stayed in the Barri Gotic, the Raval, in the Eixample, in an apartment, and liked them all, but Placa Glories and its station is only 5 stops to Placa Catalunya on the metro. You're in a quieter area, but still near enough all the action. It could do with stepping its internet game up, but the TV choice was fine. You're in Barcelona, what do you want to be watching TV for? Overall, I'd stay in this area and definitely in this hotel again.

The shower system is very confusing to operate, the water splashed all over and there wasn't anything to hold onto getting in and out of the tubs, not very safe. We were a little cold that night and trying to be energy conscious, pulled the comfortors out of the closet. They were both dirty and covered with mold. The motorized screen was broken on one of the windows. Breakfast was fairly good. Upon return from our cruise, we ended up with a room on the second floor, no view, dirty, the light bulbs in the bath were burned out, the toilet seat was broken, the stopper in the tub wouldn't pull up so we had to remove it in order for the tub to drain. The elevator system was very slow, the corridors so dark, you couln't see your door to insert the key. The lobby was supposed to be designed to look like a ship with an ocean theme.

We got a room on the 2nd floor looking at nothing else than a large building site (see pictures). We regretted not asking for a room facing the other way, until we later found out that there is an even bigger building site there. However, the main problem wasn't the view, but the noise from the building site that started around 7.45am and didn't finish till about 7pm. I know this is something the hotel can do nothing about, but it was the main reason why we wouldn't stay there again. The decor of the hotel was very modern and minimalist, felt almost Japanese. But the designer obviously put design over function. The shower/bath was good, but it was such a complicated system, so by the time we worked out how it works, we got showered with cold water. The electric horizontal blinds aren\u2019t practical as they are very noisy. It woke us up each time someone in several rooms around rolled them up and down. And you have to move them up whenever you want to open/close the window. The hotel lobby looks like a prison deck on the Death Star in Star Wars - the one where princess Leia was kept (see the picture). Terrible and dark. For a hotel that was opened only 5 years ago, much of the furniture was already very dated. The white sofa chair was terribly stained, the towel rack ended up on the floor the first time we touched it, the toilet seat was loose, and so was the bath handle. The window could be opened only to maximum, and it rattled terribly whenever it got windy outside. The hotel advertises itself as a business hotel, but the internet in our room didn\u2019t work. There are many TV channels, but CNN isn\u2019t tuned properly, so all you are left with in English is BBC World and Eurosport. By the way, don\u2019t expect the channels to be on the programs as indicated in the hotel book. The area is up and coming, good shopping centre with many restaurants just opposite the hotel. But if you wander into some of the other streets just east or north of the hotel, you feel like entering a Rio de Janiero slum. The hotel staff were professional but completely indifferent. The only person we got to smile back at us was the uniformed guard that was at the lobby all the time (\u2026by the way, why a uniformed guard, is the area of Barcelona really that bad?) We didn\u2019t try the restaurant as it is closed on weekends and national holidays (!!?) We ordered breakfast in the room only once, and it was a nice selection of pastries, ham and cheese. But we asked for it to arrive between 8-8.30, and it was delivered at 7.45 when we were still asleep. In general, not worth the 18 Euros. Positives? There were some. The bed was very good size, comfortable with nice duvets. The room was clean (except for few hair in the bath). The toiletries were good, although I cannot understand why the present you with things such as shaving cream, aftershave or toothpaste, but no hair conditioner. And the overall design of the room was nice, only if they thought about its function and kept it up to date.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pkjpholmes", "Title": "\u201cUltra-modern hotel!\u201d", "Author": "pkjpholmes", "ReviewID": "UR47391716", "Content": "On the outskirts of town really, perhaps 20 minutes walk from the tourist areas, but 5 minutes to the subway.

I booked through Expedia and got a good rate in combination with my flight. It is a very stylish hotel and I had a lovely corner room with great views. I read a lot of the reviews here before choosing the hotel and agree with some of the criticisms: that the beds are a little hard (but not that bad); that \u20ac17 for a continental breakfast +\u20ac5 etxra if you want something cooked is excessive; that it's virtually impossible not to get the floor wet when you have a shower & that the glass bathrooms would not appeal to some travellers (the toilet is behind a wooden sliding door though). I was impressed with the presentation and array of toiletries provided but I did think it unnecessary to have both a hand-held and an overhead shower in the bath, and it takes a little working out which handle on the wall controls the bath taps & 2 showers (be prepared for water to come out where you aren't expecting it to!). The rooms are well equipped, satellite TV but only CNN, BBC news & Eurosport are in English - they had film channels but these had been dubbed into Spanish rather than subtitled. It would have been nice if they had tea/coffee making facilities but perhaps they don't in order to encourage you to pay for breakfast in sheer desperation to have coffee first thing in the morning? There is a small fridge, jam packed with things you really don't want to purchase from the minibar but there is a little room to put things in. The staff were helpful and pleasant and the hotel whilst not being right in the centre of Barcelona is well located close to the Glories Metro which is only a couple of short stops from the centre (it really isn't that far at all when you look on that map). It is on a very busy main road but you shouldn't be disturbed by traffic noise unless you leave the window open - and you don't need to as the air conditioning works well, as do the 2 layers of blackout blinds which are controlled by bedside switches. The Sagrada Familia is only about a 15 minute walk away and it's very easy to get around by public transport to other tourist sights - buy a T-10 ticket for \u20ac7.70 which covers 10x Zone 1 journeys (quite a bargain I thought) on trains, buses, Metro & trams - I think all of the Metro system is in Zone 1 - as is the airport train stop. The shopping centre across the road from the hotel is quite large, has a lot of chain stores (Zara, H&M etc), the large Carrefour supermarket is particularly useful, and there are a lot of cafes and restaurants both in a courtyard downstairs and dotted around the mall including some well known chains: Subway, McD's (not open in the morning I noticed) Burger King, Starbucks etc. I chose to have breakfast at Pans & Company which is a baguette type chain as they have a good selection of pastries and small filled breakfast buns and they have a good breakfast offer of a pastry & coffee for \u20ac1.75, or coffee and 2 buns for \u20ac2.05 which given the hotel's \u20ac17 continental breakfast, is a bargain and the food is nice & the coffee strong.

The area is being redevoloped so the hotel is surrounded by building sites but to be honest we didnt really notice any noise.

From the airport we took a bus to Catalunya (8 euro for 2) and then a cab to the hotel which cost 10 euro. There's a strip mall across from the hotel, where they have clothing stores like Zara, H&M, and other Spanish brands and the french hypermarket called Carrefour. Euro was 1.60 to a 1 when we visted, so we shopped for basic food to save some $$ on breakfast. Their wine selection was quite large and inexpensive, with differnt selection of cava. We stocked up for our cruise there :). It's a great place to get gifts like Spanish Olive oil for family as well. The room at the Silken was very modern. I read the previous reviews and packed an extra soap/shampoo for myself, as they did kind of smell like male perfume. The bed was on the harder side but it wasn't too bad. I loved the rainfall shower, although you do need to be careful not to splash outside the tub. Overall with the money we paid it was a good stay. We booked directly through the hotel website and got a promotional rate $130 or so. Barcelona is a beautiful city so you're never in your room much! **Btw, one restaurant recommendation - \"Cal Pep\" in Ciutat Vella. This is a must!! They serve truly amazing tapas.

I'd been to Barcelona before and was more than aware of the prices of the hotels on the Rambla and in and around that area and had heard that most of them are quite noisy all night with the noise from passing traffic, sirens and people. So, I took a gamble and booked one this one that was further from the centre but just a couple of stops from the Olympic village area and casino. It is about 20 mins walk from the central bus station and easily identifiable from a distance. there is a tram station right out front wihch takes you to the Olympic village and a metro station about 70 metres from the door that will get you into the city centre in about 7 mins. We had emailed ahead and told the hotel it was my birthday and so requested a corner room near the top with a view over the city. We managed a corner room about halfway up with a view that would have looked out towards the sea if was a bit higher! However, the room itself was great - floor to ceiling electric blinds, slippers and robe, his 'n' hers sinks and mirrors, bath and separate shower and great freebie toiletries that had everything you didn't know you needed and more. Great for us as we went with budget airline and only took carry on baggage! The minibar prices were also pretty reasonable and had a good selection of snacks and drinks. We also had a safe which was a real bonus for tickets and passports. You also get a hard back book with guides to Barcelona style and culture, maps, etc. Really useful. Only downside was the view of a building site outside. You can't help these things though - unless you are paying more for a guaranteed view, etc. The room itself more than made up for it. But, the best bit was the view from the roof terrace where the pool is. At night you can see the whole city lit up. You are right next to the 'gherkin' (like in London) and on our first night there is was lit up in every colour - really lovely.

The way to get around from the hotel is the metro (underground) which we found very clean easy and efficient. It is only 4 stops to Catalunya which is the best stop for Las Ramblas and tour bus etc...Tour buses were crammed as the time of year we went but would recommend it as a brill way to see the sites. Park Guell is amazing, don't leave this out of your visit if you have not been, and near the olympic village there is a cable car up to a castle which is lovely and brilliant views of the port and the city.

I overlapped my stay with seven other colleagues -- we all had separate rooms, but we all had similar experiences. In summary: -- I was not permitted to check in until 3:30. -- Three days of my five-day stay there were marked with a LOUD thumping techno party happening all afternoon and evening on the top floor of the hotel. When I complained, the hotel staff simply shrugged and said that there was nothing they could do about it. Apparently they rent out the space frequently for functions. During this time the elevators were unusable, as was the top floor. The swimming pool was strewn with empty beer bottles. Enough said. You should have seen the line at the reservation counter of guests trying to get their rooms changed to some part of the hotel far away from the roof. This, of course, was folly -- in fact, you could hear the rooftop party from several blocks away. -- My reservation rate was incorrect. They had a reservation rate that was 15 Euro higher. When I asked for documentation of this reservation, they conveniently said that they had \"lost\" the paperwork. I had also requested breakfast, but again, this was supposedly \"not included\" in the reservation. One clerk finally told me that he would take care of everything for me. Upon checkout, I found that none of problems had been cleared up, which required an additional 20 minutes of wrangling with another employee altogether. In the end I got the room rate that I reserved, but for some bizarre reason they would not let go of having me pay for just one of the breakfasts. Was it their pride I was hurting? They acted like infants and tried to wrestle a few extra measly dollars out of me, all the while knowing that they were probably jeopardizing any good will I had left with them. -- The elevators are an abomination. They are small, cramped, and have a completely dysfunctional and non-traditional call system. Expect long wait times. -- There is no wireless internet access in the rooms below the top two floors. -- In-room catering clean-up apparently only happens once a day. I can't tell you how many times I saw meal trays sitting outside my hallway left unclaimed for hours. Was the entire staff too busy partying? -- Most importantly, not once during my entire stay there did I get a simple smile or thank you from the staff there. They dress smartly with their tailored suits and play the part, but they seem to have no talent whatsoever for making their visitors' stays comfortable. The hotel is not in the most convenient area of town, but it's not in the worst area either. There is an eyesore of a shopping mall across the street from the hotel, but aside from that there is nary a single convenience in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Good luck changing money, shopping for food or snacks, getting an after-dinner drink, or doing just about anything other than sleeping. (That is, if you can stand the noise from the revellers!) Yes, you can buy a drink at the bar downstairs in the lobby of the hotel at prices that are around 200% more than what they should be. In short: give this place a pass.

The lobby bar is a bit sparse, but they do have smoking and non-smoking sections. The elevator is strange, there are no floor buttons inside the elevator, you basically press your floor outside the elevator and it tells you which elevator you need to take, once inside, you cannot change your mind or go back!

Very close to the spectacular Torre Agbar - cool tower that can easily be seen from an airplane while landing or taking off. Great elevators. It is not possible to crank up the volume of the TV to very high levels - no disturbance from deaf neighbours. The bad: Very noisy road and a adjacent construction of a big building. Breakfast not included - in my country good breakfasts are included as standard. The view is so-so from some of the rooms. Mine view was not phenomenal despite I stayed at 7:th floor. Not very close to the centre of the city from the hotel, but possible to walk - approx less than 30 minutes. The floor of the bathroom gets wet when showering.

We really loved the double curtains that completely darkened the room. When we rolled them up in the morning, we were surprised how bright it was outside. They were very effective.

Admittedly the hotel was more of a crash pad for us after a long day sightseeing, but in that regard it met all our needs. Location - yes, it is a little far out but we both love walking and exploring less touristy parts of a city, so it meant that we had a good twenty minutes walk at the start and end of each day in the more residential parts of Barcelona. (Cab to/from the airport is around 30 euros) Opposite the hotel is the Gracias mall which had a good range of Spanish high street stores - for example, Zara was bigger that the branches downtown and distinctly less crowded. We could therefore do lots of our shopping and only have a thirty second walk back to the room with our bags. Carrefour, the hypermarket, is also in the mall and was great for stocking up on water and fruit etc. Opening hours for the mall are 10pm-10pm. I wouldn't recommend the eateries around there as hygiene doesn't seem to feature highly on the list of priorities The rooms in the hotel were extremely comfortable, clean and functional. The best part were the blackout blinds which enabled us to sleep like babies. We found the hotel to be really quiet and we only encountered fellow guests briefly in the lobby. My only real quibble with the hotel is the pool - it's more like a small tub. The roof terrace is fab for sunbathing with an exceptional view over the city but the pool was far too small for swimming in. Sadly the hotel roof bar is only open on weekends which we weren't told about - a shame as its a great place to relax late at night. What else would I recommend for travellers - for food, go downtown. I have some superb restaurant recommendations - Taller del Tapas, Agua and 7 Portes are excellent.

We had a fantastic time and were sad to be leaving. The rooms are exactly as you see on the website - we had a standard room and it was just perfect. I felt all of the pictures on the website were a fair representation, and we were even more impressed in real life. The electric black out blinds are great - never had a better night sleep, although we did sleep in every morning!! The room does not have tea and coffee making facilities or an iron which would both have been great. We ordered tea and coffee through room service and it was only 2 euros each so not bad. We also brought a travel iron or the hotel did offer a laundry service. We didnt get breakfast with our package so cannot really comment on that. We did get it delivered to the room one morning however, it was nice but i felt pricey at 20euros pp for tea and a croissant with some ham and cheese (we paid extra for the ham and cheese). It did arrive at the time we asked and the service for room service was always prompt and very good. Only had dinner in the hotel one night, restaraunt was quite quiet but the food lovely and service impeccable. Would eat there again in a minute. Staff were pleasant, some especially nice, other not so much but all in all they were very professional and helped us with any questions we had. Got talking to a few of the bar guys who are fantastic - Nicola and Miguel - they make a mean cocktail! The bar was reasonably priced also, 6 euros for a beer and a wine, with cocktails being 9 euros each. The terrace on the roof was our haven most afternoons. We would do a bit of sightseeing in the late morning and then head back to the hotel to lie by the pool and have a few drinks in the hot afternoon sun - was pure bliss! It was never too busy up there, and towels were provided which was a nice touch. Views of the sea were incredible. The only problem we could find (if we had to) with the hotel was its location. It is not a major problem but is a good 20 minute walk before you reach busier areas of the city. There is a tube station - glories, about a 3-4 minute walk away, or the tram goes right by the front door which makes getting around very quick and easy. We are hapier to be closer to the city centre restaraunts etc so would liked to have been a bit closer. The area is also under an awful lot of development. I think in a few years it will be in a great spot as there is so much being built around it. at the moment there is a great shopping centre directly accross the road with super restaraunts for breakfast, lunch or dinner around the bottom floor courtyard. Also a great selection of shops in here including a huge supermarket. There are cranes and building sites everywhere else though. This did not disrupt our holiday one bit as the blackout blinds blocked any noise in the morning, and there was no dust etc, it just meant that the scenery was not as nice as it will be when the works begin to finish. All in all, i absolutely loved the silken diagonal, it was modern, extremely clean and very professional. rooms were beautiful, it is very well located for public transport and within walking distance of the beach and busier areas for the city (about 20 mins) I would recommend this hotel to anyone and be sure that you would have a wonderful holiday!", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cDecent place to stay in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "marentis5", "ReviewID": "UR8282405", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights before a Mediterranean Cruise and enjoyed our stay. As other travelers mentioned, it's right next to a large cone-shaped building that's pretty cool. We loved being able to see La Sagrada Familia from our window! The rooms were very clean and the decor was nice. The bathroom walls are glass...but not the toilet (whew!)! Each room has one large bed for two people, so if you're traveling with 4 people, that will be two rooms. If you have three people, they do have some larger rooms with a couch that will accomodate that size group. The complimentary breakfast is phenomenal! There's a wide variety of fresh, hot food. Delicious fruit, eggs, meats, etc. It's all very good...even the coffee was wonderful! The pool is on the roof, which is unique, but it's incredibly small....SO much smaller than it looked in any picture we saw beforehand. Our kids didn't even want to go in it because they could tell that once they were all in, they wouldn't be able to do anything (there were 10 kids in our group). They didn't care about that though, we were there to explore Barcelona! It was easy to hop on the subway from the hotel (turn left outside the hotel and about 1/2 block up you go down the stairs to the subway) and see this wonderful city.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Barcelona, not sure about hotel\u201d", "Author": "Flylove", "ReviewID": "UR7483909", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in April. Hotel was easy to find. Not located in the main city centre but within close proximity to Glories Metro station. Modern hotel, Nice decor, Some parts a bit worn considering it is a new ish hotel, Electronic blinds, good daylight block out!! Nice TV but not too impressed with channel choices. Rooms was smaller than imagined from photos on website, no iron in the room although there is a laundry service, room was clean every day If you are a tea/coffee lover you might be disappointed to know there no facilities to make your own cuppa in the morning!! A bit of building work going on near by but that did not bother us . Amazing views from the roof terrace but very small pool. Across the road is a large shopping centre, 15-20 min walk down to La Rambla personally. Staff On arrival I personally did not get that warm welcoming feeling however when making enquires staff was very helpful Bellboy was selective when I was on my own could not be bother to call the lift for me. On departure, not a word of thank you from Reception Staff.

The architecture and style of the hotel appealed to us, and the price was reasonable. Although it is not in the city centre, it is within walking distance of attractions such as the Sagrada Familia. Alternatively, there are metro and tram stops by the hotel, giving quick and cheap access to the whole city. The hotel restaurant is not cheap, so we ate many of our meals at the various cafes and restaurants in the shopping complex across the road from the hotel, popular with many of the locals. As a gay couple we were concerned about how we would be treated. However the staff reacted very normally when we booked in at reception, apart from checking whether we did want to share the same room. The room was good, with everything that we would need during our stay, including a little safe and a TV. The housekeeping was great, and it was a real pleasure to return to a fresh clean room each day. The hotel was not noisy, but I did get woken up in the middle of the night a couple of times by someone in a neighbouring room opening or closing their electric window blind in the middle of the night! Other reviews mention the shower cubicle - if you are sharing the room with anyone you do have to know them well! The toilet was more discreet in a seperate room. The view of the city from the rooftop is fantastic. You would also get to see the neighbouring Torre Agbar, which sometimes gets lit up at night. Overall it was a great hotel, and I would recommend it to other people.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyler, TX", "Title": "\u201cServed The Purpose\u201d", "Author": "slevy", "ReviewID": "UR7012071", "Content": "This hotel was fine. My husband and I came to Barcelona for an extended weekend and many hotels were unavailable for Saturday night due to the football game Barcelona played against Real Madrid. Hotel Silken seemed to be the only one available that was in our price range and met our criteria. It is a very clean hotel with a comfortable bed and pillows, great bathroom facilities, and a pretty view if located on a higher floor. The furniture is cheap and not taken care of very well for being a newer establishment. They provide shampoo and soaps along with other toiletry items and a hair dryer as well as a converter that is installed in the safe box. However, my biggest gripe about this hotel is the noises you hear at all hours of the day. The shades are mechanical and we could hear when those staying around us were raising their shades each time. Also, anytime someone is showering, the draining water can be heard. It sounds as if an airplane is flying overhead but it is the water! I'm a fairly heavy sleeper but this awoke me each morning. The staff was helpful to us each time we had questions. The location is good. Only 4 stops from Las Ramblas on the Metro and next to a shopping mall with eating establishments. For $200 a night I don't think it is worth it. My husband was not impressed at all. If you can stay here for cheaper then it is worth the price; however at $200 a nightI think it should be a little nicer. To sum it up, the quality is cheap.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cFab Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "tyty'smom", "ReviewID": "UR6750884", "Content": "This is a realy nice hotel with excellent staff.

Very awkward for showering, but we made the best of it. The location is great, not entirely in the middle of everything but not far off either. We easily traveled by subway and tram to all over Barcelona. It is also walking distance to the mall and Gaudi's famous cathedral. Restaurant was pricey as was the room service. But check out the breakfast buffet. I think it was 15EU but well worth it and a great way to start the day. I would definately recommend and return to this hotel.
