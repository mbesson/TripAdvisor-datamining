We selected the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews, price and hotel amenities, namely the pool. The hotel is clean and the staff are helpful and polite. The deluxe room we stayed in (354) was clean and comfortable and reasonably big for a Singapore room. While the hotel's proximity to Kampong Glam is fantastic, it is a little inconvenient walking to Bugis MRT with a stroller, especially given the construction work around the station. However, it was only a mild annoyance. Another stroller type issue is that the hotel entrance is via about 10 steep steps and the doors are not automatic. The staff were pretty good at opening them and offering to help carry the stroller, but it gets a bit embarrassing after a while. As other travellers have mentioned the pool area is nice and we made good use of it. Housekeeping were efficient and kept the room beautifully. Our only problem really was finding somewhere nearby to have breakfast everyday. While we might have eaten at the hotel we prefer to get out and about. There aren't many places aside from the Toast Box at Bugis or MacDonald's (not our cup of tea) that are open at breakfast time and serve food a two year old child will eat. Probably wouldn't be an issue for most people. All that aside I would definitely stay here again, although my wife said she prefers being closer to the City Hall area.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cNot bad place\u201d", "Author": "heidehudini", "ReviewID": "UR127891185", "Content": "The hotel is a great place to stay.

The glass-fronted wardrobe has an automatic light that wouldn't switch off until, at 3am having tried to sleep with it on, i managed to jiggle the door sufficiently for the trigger to go off. So I counted the first night as a FAIL. There is a busy little bar on the ground floor which has a live band and a popular dancefloor with the mostly package tour crowd. it's very noisy and the last place I'd want to go for a nightcap or meet anyone. It's more pub than hotel bar. Breakfast on the executive floor was included in my rate. It's a pretty mean affair as hotel breakfasts go. As I went to get a glass of orange juice, I tried *five* glasses first before I got one that was clean: the first four were frankly filthy, which suggests that the dishwasher on the 6th floor kitchen needs servicing. Overall I think cleanliness an issue at this property. This shouldn't be a GHA hotel, in my opinion and I won't be staying there again.

This year, we have stayed at the Wangz, the Albert Court Village and the Park Royal on Kitchener and this is one of the best in its price range. Granted we got it at a fantastic price, almost 50 per cent off on Agoda, so my comments have to be taken in that light. Of course, our long-time favourite, the New 7th Storey Hotel, is no longer available and we have yet to find anything that comes close to it for value and convenience. I realize that the above hotels are not in the same category and we\u2019re still looking for a replacement for that hotel in an affordable price range. But the Park Royal on Beach is a comfortable, clean, convenient place to stay if you can get it for a good price. It does not warrant the rack rate of $250+, but is very good value at the $120 to $150 range. Pluses: 1. Room size: The rooms are much bigger than at the Albert Court Village and this was the main reason we switched over. It also has a mini fridge and very comfortable bed. 2. Service: We got excellent service from the doormen right up to the General Manager. Everyone was courteous, helpful, and responsive. Even upgraded our room without our asking, but we preferred the layout of the regular room because of the work desk configuration. We needed two work stations and they even provided an extra chair. 3. Restaurants: There are two, but we only ate one meal there because I wasn\u2019t well, but the food was good. Because of my illness I asked them if they could warm up a special dish that a friend had provided to help with my recovery and they agree without any problems. Prices are very high by S\u2019pore standards, however. 4. Location \u2013 This is a great location close to the MRT (metro) and with lots of shopping options (Bugis Junction, Bugis Village, Sun Tec mall, technology malls, Little India) and it\u2019s right across the street from Arab Street and lots of restaurants. 5. Free wifi was included in our room. 6. Great pool \u2013 best we\u2019ve seen in S\u2019pore 7. Business centre: We had free access to for printing and scanning of documents for limited number of pages. 8. Free shuttle to several key downtown locations 9. Free daily newspaper 10. Quiet except for construction noise (see below) Negatives: 1. Noise: We only had one complaint and that was about a persistent noise that started at 7 a.m. and continued late into the evening at irregular intervals. It sounded like someone dragging a table across the floor above us. It was only a minor irritation, but because we were working in our room we wanted to try to have it stopped. Senior management responded promptly to our complaint on two separate occasions but they were unable to find the source of the noise. It was only as we were leaving on our last day of 6, that the door of the room opposite opened and we saw two workmen in the room running cable. That may have been the cause of the noise, but management had never found it.

Some of the food was ok, but only because you can't really go wrong with that kind of food, such as fruit, cheese, bread etc. The food such as main dishes and desserts was poor and the cocktails didn't taste like normal cocktails do. The gym was very well equipped, however the equipment appeared to be from the 90's. On a positive note the treadmills had a nice view of the pool as opposed to gyms where the treadmills had no view. The outdoor area by the pool was pleasant and the pool was ok, however next door is a construction site, hence there was a lot of noise and consutruction smells when at the pool, which was unpleasant.

The hotel is located within close proximity to 2 MRT Stations each between 5-10 minutes away. It is also next to Arab Street and the Golden Mile Hawker Centre where authentic local food could be found in abundance. Ray who attended to my check-in procedures was professional and helpful. He was kind enough to upgrade me to a club room at level 6 of the hotel. My room 645 was located towards the end of the building. While it did not face the busy Beach Road, it opened straight to a construction site. However, given the very good sound insulation of the room, I wasn't affected at all even though workers were seen working on a Sat afternoon. My room was spacious and very well maintained. The toiletries was very well stocked. All the lightings in the room worked well and overall, I had a comfortable stay since I spent most of my time in the room to rest. However, the cable TV could benefit from more selection of mandarin and English movie channels. I didn't find the staffs at level 6 to be particularly friendly compared to the staffs at the check-in counter. The same applied to the bell-boys who wasn't smiling as well. However, I was quite impressed by the attentive service of the restaurant staffs. During breakfast service, one of the nice ladies would go around the tables asking if I would like a coffee or tea refills again and again. Breakfast was a happy affair where there was a nice selection of buffet items. Was also impressed by the well-maintained swimming pool at level 4 of the property. Again the staffs could be more inviting though. Overall, my staycation at ParkRoyal was a pleasant one. Nice rooms, nice pools and nice breakfast.

As I have commented in a previous review, while the hotel is not in the centre of the Singapore, it is only a short taxi ride to the main shopping district or to restaurants in Marina Bay, Clark/Boat Quay, Little India, Chinatown etc. And the Arab quarter is just across the road. The hotel has a great pool area, however, a few umbrellas or additional shady spots would be welcome.

When we landed we didn't have a taxi transfer pre booked but there are plenty of taxis on stand by so don't worry about that. You can also use the MRT (equivalent to London Underground) but this involved many stops to The Park Royal Hotel. The Park Royal Hotel is mainly suited to people on business however we were pleasantly surprised by how clean it was and how friendly the staff were. Our room was spacious and cleaned daily and complete with flat screen TV, safe and air conditioning. The only downside was that the hotel rooms didn't feature a balcony to sit out on and relax while we were waiting to get ready. The hotel has a nice open air swimming pool, gym and bar area. Please be aware that the bar can be quite pricey on an evening. The hotel provided breakfast as part of our deal and the quality of the food was good with buffet style help your self options. The hotel also has a restaurant on site with which we didn't use as we ran out of time however it looked really nice and had good reports from fellow guests. The hotel has a business centre which can be used to access emails and internet but a small charge is administered. The hotel is only approx 10 minutes walk to the nearest MRT station which is the best method of transport to visit such places like Little India and China Town. China town is worth a visit especially at night along with the Tooth Relic Temple and also the Sri Mariamman Temple both only a short walk from the MRT station. Little India is also worth a visit, in my opinion nicer than China town and some of the shops do some excellent authentic Indian food. I think the Star Bar was the name of the Indian restaurant we visited and I must say is still the best Indian food I have ever tasted. Singapore is one of the cleanest and safest places I have ever had the chance to visit. Singapore has many local restaurants but also has the major fast food outlets including McDonalds etc. The quickest way to travel around town is by the MRT which you can get a multiday pass of single journey passes all of which is really cheap. They also offer a small refund if you hand back in the swipe cards at the pay points. We found that the best way to see and find your way around the town is to just walk. We would recommend vesting Raffles long bar which is only a short walk to sample a Singapore Sling and the unusual environment. The Singapore Flyer at the time of writing was the biggest Ferris wheel in the world is located in the main tourist area and again is within walking distance from the hotel. The Singapore Flyer sits directly above the F1 pit straight and excellent views can be seen of the track and surrounding sights. This area is also home to the recently built Sky Park Hotel which is in the shape of a ship. You can visit the top of the hotel for I think around \u00a315-\u00a320 for a stunning view of the bay and surrounding area. You can also grab a drink in the roof top bar of which prices are not as bad as I was expecting from a 5 star hotel. The hotel also houses a casino and many top designer outlets to the ground floor. The only thing we wish we had done was to see either the Skypark or the ferris wheel at sunset because the views would of ben brilliant especially with the town illuminated Drinks can be really expensive in Singapore ranging anywhere from \u00a36 to \u00a314 just for one drink but food is quite reasonable. We also visited Singapore Zoo which was outstanding and probably the best zoo I have ever been too. The zoo is extremely well kept and relaxing with many of the animals in easy view unlike some where they seem to be kept inside out of sight. The animal show which included many types of trained animals walking above the crowd was also quite impressive. We spend a good 4 hours in the zoo and enjoyed every minute and well worth the entrance fee. The zoo can be accessed by the MRT but this involves many stops and then a final taxi journey to the zoo itself. This in mind we decided on getting a taxi direct which the hotel organised and again it wasn't too expensive. The F1 Grand Prix was to be held the week after our stay and therefore the town was in the process of setting up for the event. Its was a really good time to visit to see them setting the lighting rigs etc up for the night race and even walk along the F1 track. The town has many 5star luxury hotels which are worth a visit was a relaxing drink or 3. However like I said before drinks are expensive so be wary but I would recommend calling into Fullerton's and Raffles to sample the luxury environment and have a nice meal on the marina. Clark Quay is also a good place to enjoy the nightlife with many bars and restaurants stretched out along the marina. This is where the river taxis and river cruises also depart so if you want to see the floating football pitch, Marina Sky Park and high rise buildings direct from the water. Clark Quay has a nearby MRT station but is also within walking distance so walking back to the Park Royal after a night out isn't a problem. The streets during the day as well as at night appeared very friendly with people willing to help visitors and nothing seemed to be a problem. All in all Singapore is a wonderful place to visit for a short break as part of a stop off to another destination. We stayed for 3 days but probably required 4, as we didn't get time to visit Sentosa Island and Universal Studios. The Park Royal hotel is a good mid ranged priced hotel and is relatively well located for the main tourist sights.

Overall the hotel offers you basic amenities like a clean & spacious room with wi-fi connectivity (you have to bargain while you book it to include it in your tariff). The property is opposite Arab street & doesn't offer you any breathtaking views. Our room had a view of the busy intersection in front of the hotel.

There is a bus stop which is just outside the hotel & if you know the bus routes it can be a little more convenient.

I would suggest that the hotel provides 2 hand and face towels to complete the otherwise good amenities for a hotel of this rating. Another improvement to take note are the bath towels, they are OLD. Today, I noticed that one even had rust like stains on it. Apart from the small setback, I think this hotel is good enough for business travellers.

Awesome. 2) the pool is lovely. You are in Singapore but feel like you're at a beach resort almost! 3) the rooms are not super glamourous, but are more spacious than most at this price in Sg 4) there are lots of eateries in walking distance from Subway to more formal dining 5) the MRT station is around the corner. Really easy to walk with suitcases if necessary. Not quite so fabulous... the corridor noise can be heard pretty easily. a plethora of hotel staff will begin knocking on your door from about 830 am for everything from minibars to picking up room service that has already been picked up to checking if you have laundry to housekeepers. I advise putting out the do not disturb sign and only removing it when you go to breakfast. Both bathrooms in the rooms we were in needed maintenance - in one, a tile was falling off. in the other, the water filled in the bath while using the shower so I think the drain needed cleaning.

We Will Be Back.\u201d", "Author": "princessbandicoot", "ReviewID": "UR103479738", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for two weeks from the end of March 2011. While it was a business trip for him, I was there for a holiday. I had originally wanted to stay a little more centrally at one of the big 4.5-5 star places (Swissotel, Fairmont...), but we ended up at the Parkroyal because it was almost next door to the Concourse building where my husband needed to be each day. If it wasn't for this, I doubt very much we would have ever stayed here - our circumstances have led to a great \"discovery\" and we will absolutely return to the Parkroyal when we next visit Singapore. As a total package, the Parkroyal on Beach Road is hands down the best place we have ever stayed. When I talk about total package, I am referring to things like value for money, customer service, as well as the general facilities, inclusions and location. The Hotel is 4 star, but it feels and looks like more than that. It just has a really impressive feel about it when you walk into the foyer. We stayed on the 7th floor in an Orchid Club Premier King room, which meant we also received the Orchid Club privileges. THE ROOM Our room was fantastic. It was bright, clean, cool and modern with good furniture, fittings and a nice balcony. It was a reasonable size - probably larger than a lot of other hotels were offering for the money. I actually would have liked some outdoor furniture on the balcony (even just a bench), but this a minor gripe. I guess the humidity and heat might mean that most wouldn't use it : ) I loved the rainhead shower - best hotel shower I have ever experienced - and the bath was also a nice addition. There were just a lot of nice, practical things about the room and the way it was set up that you don't always see. The cleaners did a terrific job, and were always so friendly. The bed was quite firm and the pillows quite soft. I think this has been mentioned by other reviewers. I was a little dubious to start with, but it was all surprisingly comfortable. It might not be everyone's taste, but it's a question of style rather than of quality. THE PEOPLE I honestly cannot rave enough about the level of service we received from the staff at the Parkroyal on Beach Road. From the moment we set foot in the place to the moment we jumped in a taxi for the airport, every interaction was so pleasant and welcoming, from the concierge to the reception staff to the housekeeping staff. It says a lot of good things about the Hotel in general - you do not get this level of service excellence from a poorly run establishment, in my opinion. I must make special mention here of the Orchid Club staff. They were wonderful and we could not fault them. I was surprised to read the previous review that spoke about one of the male staff members being unwelcoming, and honestly cannot believe they are talking about any of the staff we got to know over our two week stay. There were the simple things like the way they greeted us whenever we saw them - it was always with a smile and it always felt genuine. The level of attention to detail and the professionalism they showed really impressed us and really made it feel like a home away from home. These little things really make a big difference to being in a foreign country away from everything and everyone you know. In this context, it is worth sharing our experience at check-in. It was brought to our attention that the credit card payment for our stay had been declined (we were there on a deal that required payment upfront and this had been made by my husband's employer). While it was simply an error/misunderstanding with the setup of the employer's new bank accounts, it was a Saturday and impossible for us to resolve with them on the day. It could have been a highly awkward and embarrassing situation for us, but the Orchid Club staff member checking us in was gracious, understanding and reasonable in the way she handled it. She understood that we couldn't do anything until the Monday to get the employer to rectify the situation, and simply asked for a credit card to hold the first two nights of our stay until the rest was sorted out. Our booking was never under any threat and this experience really set the tone for the rest of our stay. THE ORCHID CLUB I have read varying comments about the value of paying extra for Club Room deals in Singapore Hotels. After staying here, we have no doubt about it (at least as far as this place is concerned!) and would do it again in a heartbeat. The actual Club Room is delightful. Comfortable furnishings, beautifully air conditioned (some may say a little too well) and pleasantly intimate. Breakfast is included in your privileges and you can either have this in the Club Room with other Club guests or on the ground floor in the main area with all the other guests. The breakfast served in the Club Room is a reduced version of what is on offer in the main area. There are staples, while other dishes rotate. There is a chef there each morning who will cook eggs, bacon, pancakes and a few other things to order. The Orchid Club staff are incredibly attentive and ask you for a coffee/tea order as soon as you walk in (and quickly remember if you have a regular order). We had breakfast here every day except for one where we thought we would try the main breakfast. It was also good and a lot to choose from, but we much preferred the intimacy of the Club Room. Also included are evening cocktails (including beer and wine) with finger food from 6pm - 8pm. This was amazing value and we were regular attendees - it completely exceeded any expectations we had. Every night we felt so looked after - as corny as it might sound, it felt a little like we were at our local at home and the staff knew us as regulars and what we liked to order. The array of finger food (lots of different, yummy things for all palates) was impressive. It was a really relaxing way to spend the early part of the evening before heading out to dinner. Other great inclusions were things like priority check in and out, broadband access, laundry (2 pieces per person per day) and refreshments all day. LOCATION I now laugh when I realise I was a little concerned about location, mainly because of reviews I had read on here. It is not an issue at all. Unless you are planning on basing yourself at a particular location every day (like Orchard Rd) the Hotel is highly accessible to most places given two nearby MRT stations and a bus stop straight out the front. It takes less than 10 mins walk to two MRT stations on different lines (Bugis and Nicoll Highway). Bugis is one station away from City Hall interchange and is also the nearest station to access a number of great shopping malls. If walking doesn't interest you, the Hotel is well serviced by a taxi rank. I only ever had to wait once. But, I really enjoyed the short walk to the Bugis area for shopping and the train so I didn't use it a whole lot when I was just heading out to shop. It is less than 10 minutes walk to Bugis Junction, which is an excellent shopping location. Straight across the road from all the great eateries in the Arab Quarter, accessible by a pedestrian overpass. In addition to this there is a stretch of shops along the other side of Beach Rd including restaurants, gift shops, bars, a hawker market, smoothie/juice place - there's even a Subway and Pizza Hut if you are craving something Western. SUMMARY Singapore is a great place with great people and this Hotel represents these things perfectly. When we visit Singapore again, we know we won't have to do any accommodation research! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality accommodation, great service, with all the perks of 4.5-5 star, but without the price tag.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWill be back..\u201d", "Author": "LadyMephis", "ReviewID": "UR101474487", "Content": "I have always love staying with Parkroyal and this time round, I thought I should checkout the one in Singapore.

I thought this hotel was lovely, don't have a bad thing to say about it. The closest MRT station is Nicoll Highway, which is about a five minute walk, go up the steps by the Concourse building. That station is on the circle line, but it is so easy to transfer to another line at Dhoby Guat.

The pool side was very nice too, with a Balinese feel to it. The steam room was adequate but nothing fancy. The gym was surprisingly a good size too. I ate lunch at the Chinese Restaurant Si Chua Dou Hua on level 1 and the food was great. It was also fun watching the staff pour hot water for your tea with their fancy moves and pot. For the money I paid with the promotion (SGD380 in total for 2 rooms), it was value for money if you can disregard the slight inconvenience of the locaiton. However, I have some gripes during the stay too, which I feel the hotel should take steps to remedify: CHECK IN Upon check in at 2pm, I was told that only room 472 was ready and told that 473 will be ready approximately 3:30pm. We were quite okay with it and went into 472 to rest while waiting. At 3:30pm, the room was not yet ready, and at 4pm, I recieved a call from the receptionist informing that the room is ready and she will send someone to 472 to pass me the keys to 473. We continued chatting in the room and waited for the doorbell to ring. But what I saw instead was the key card holders containing keys to 473 being slipped / thrown under the door of 472. I just saw the thing sliding in and did not react in time to open the door and find out who that is. That is a totally unacceptable gesture by any hotel staff. It would have made sense if he / she has rung several times and done that after sensing that no one was in. But we were all in the room waiting and very sure we would have heard the bell. I am not expecting any grand passing over ceremony - I only expected at least the staff to have the basic courtesy and responsibility to pass me the keys personally. It was very rude and irresponsible of the staff, whoever he or she is, to resort to that. I was very upset and called the concierge to voice my unhappines, and the gentleman on the phone said he will reprimand the staff, but I was not given any follow up calls / answers after that. BREAKFAST We had breakfast on the morning of 2 Jan at 8:30am, and realized that alot of items had run out and were not replenished for some time. There seems to be a shortage of chef / staff doing the replenishment, and when it was done, seemed to be very sporadicly managed. It almost felt like you needed to be lucky to know what time to come in or risk having little selection to choose from. We and other breakfast guests were going around opening empty baskets and lids, which felt quite silly after a while. The restaurant probably could have anticipated the large crowd especially given it was a long weekend and plenty of tourists checking in/out and would have given me a better impression if that was managed properly eg. as simple as having more staff around. If I were a paying guest, I would be upset at having needing to pay but little to eat. The above being said, the rest of the staff I encountered during my stay were polite and pleasant. Worth a stay if you dont mind walking to burn off all the local treats!", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Great Pool but Construction Noise\u201d", "Author": "OzSooty", "ReviewID": "UR90691837", "Content": "We stayed here about a year ago and didn't hesitate to book again.

But PLS PAY a little MORE AND ENJOY THE BEST OF THE HOTEL! Stay at the executive floors. Dont stay in the superior or deluxe rooms. Pay abit more n stay at the executive rooms and you'll not regret it. Anyway, this HOTEL IS DIRT CHEAP compared to other hotels of the same rank n level of service they have to offer. I am truly amazed with the service n breathtaking view and the sleek design of the room. Yes the location may not be in the bustling Orchard Rd, but it's close enough. Come on, u're on a holiday, DONT BE LAZY, EXPLORE n walk ard abit! The nearest MRT/Subway station is Bugis Mrt. The hotel is close to the ditzy Haji Lane area. Something like a 'Little Arab' kinda place. Where there's lotsa mediterranean food n sheesha going on. But it has a certain charm to it. SINGAPORE is SMALL. everywhere is close by. U dont hv to worry abt travelling time. Just stick to taking the MRT/Subway or take the taxi from the hotel (just avoid taking the taxis during peak hours) PROS: Location. If u book the executive floor, your room would be situated at the top most floor, level 8 i think. and the view is simply stunning! i had one that is overlooking the Singapore Flyer n Suntec City and the lights from the view at night, is simply worth the extra bucks i forked out to get the best rooms (bear in my that the rooms in this hotel is MUCH cheaper than other hotels of the same level of stars). Service. The staffs are very accomodating and flexible. I had trouble checking in because of my credit card n the lady who was attending to me was very patient n professional. N if u walk ard the hotel area, staffs from the hotel were never short of smiles n will make u feel welcomed n u can actually feel that they enjoy doing what they do. (unlike some other hotel's service staffs whr u can clearly get the vibe that she dont wanna be there serving u or dislike working there. Cleanliness. Is superb. Nothing else to say. I feel like i walked right into a showroom. The room is BIG, HUGE, AIRY N ALWAYS BRIGHT! Definitely has a good vibe when u enter the room. Toilet. Is WORLD CLASS! Breakfast. Choices of breakfast is varied n aplenty! Checking in n Checking out was smooth (if not for the little incident with my CC, it wud've been. It's not their fault anyway. It's my bank's fault) Bed is very comfortable. Comforters were sooo smooth n crisp. Swimming pool is not indoors, it;s open air. N open till 10pm. Quite big. Of course not huge olympic size. Comes with free WIFI inside the room for those of u with Laptops. Just ask for the password n username. HAVE I MENTIONED THAT THE VIEW OUTSIDE MY BALCONY IS TO DIE FOR?!?!?!?! I'll definitely recommend this hotel to everyone that is hesitant. N will definitely stay here again!

I'll end this review on a positive note - what won me over was the service staff.

I had to stay there three weeks while waiting for a visa. It's not right in the city center but a short bus trip or taxi ride away from Orchard road. However the Arab street and a mosque are just across the street (you have to take a footbridge). This area is a kind of \"alternative\" Singapore with plenty of little unbranded fashion shops and middle eastern restaurants where you can smoke shisha in a water pipe. Some of the crowds there are quite a bit grungy. So it is a welcome change from the ultra clean sanitized international shopping mall Singaporean landscape. My room was on the Club floor. The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. I complained because I had one the few rooms on the back tucked next to the other building. It was very dark even during the day. I was promptly moved to room a room with a nice view on the Arab street area and the mosque. Nice! This Club floor room was very spacious and comfortable. Big bed and plenty of space to store your clothes and luggage. The bathroom is spacious as well and is separated from the room by a glass wall. You can have breakfast on the Club floor where it is more exclusive. The choice is limited but you can watch the morning news while reading a newspaper. It is very comfortable and the staff is attending to you. On the ground floor, you get the classic buffet breakfast with a much bigger choice but sometimes it was very crowded. In the evening the restaurant serves acceptable Western and Asian dishes. But if you have the time and opportunity you are better off dining at a food court or hawker's stall. The in-room service is quite good. The hotel is bar is hosting a bar that occupies a niche in the Singapore nightlife. It caters to ballroom dancers. So you get to see not so young couples dancing. It may not be your cup of tea but the bar was busy many nights a week. Interesting business concept, not trying to compete against bars in Clarke Quay or Robertson Quay. There is also a very comprehensive gym and outdoor swimming pool. The gym is part of a spa that is also available to paying members that are not hotel guests. That probably explains the high standards. The swimming pool on the hotel roof is very nice. You get a good view of the surroundings and can swim under a blue sky. So overall I had a very pleasant stay at the Royal Plaza on Beach Road because of the helpful staff, the very nice Orchid room, the gym in the spa and the swimming pool.

The airconditioning was also quite responsive to the digital thermostat.

It had a small local selection including curried vegetables, carrot cake and mee siam, dim sum in addition to japanese style rice porridge with pickles and condiments, salads, cold cuts, cheese, hot dishes such as chicken and fish stir fry, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, baked beans, an omelette, pancake and waffle station, continental selection of pastries and bread and a espresso machine!

The MRT Station \"Nicholl Highway\" on the Newly Commisioned Yellow Line(also called the Central Line) is about 200 metres from Hotel. \u2022 Shuttle Bus - A shuttle Bus also runs from the Airport which will drop you at the Hotel for S$ 9 per head; how-ever it takes a circutious route and could take from 45 minutes to an hour to reach the hotel. \u2022 Misc - For any information and advise, contact the Info Counter with a sigh \" i\" (in italics) and not the Transport Info Counter. They try to sell you the time consuming Shuttle Bus or a S$ 45 taxi. Taxi at the Airport Lounge Exit Gate is a very good bet and you get them in plenty Hotel per se \u2022 Cheerful Front Office Staff. Makes you feel good. \u2022 Take room towards the Main Entrance since you get a Green View. The rooms on the rear side face adjoining Buildings. \u2022 Clean, well furnished rooms; Toilets are good; Effective ACs. \u2022 Above Average and responsive Room Service. \u2022 Delightful and most helpful Conceirge/s. They give good and economically effective advice. \u2022 Travel Desk ( Rep of the Tour Coy and not an employee of the Hotel ) tries pushing his Tours. May not give other economical options. \u2022 Very strict on Security \u2013 You can access Room Floors only with your Room Electronic Key. Can go only to your Floor apart from Swimming Pool Floor. I had a malfunction with the Room Safe. A team of 3 people ( 2 from Hotel and one from outside the Hotel Security Company) having different powers had to get together in a Conference Call to sort it out with sophisticated Electronic Gadgetry. Made us feel very safe. \u2022 Convenience Store in the rear of the Hotel (adjoining Building). \u2022 They give a fairly good Exchange rate though some-what less from the one available at the Airport. \u2022 Nice Top Floor Swimming Pool. Muggy Changing Rooms though. \u2022 Overall Very Good. \u2022 Did not try their Specialty Restaurants. Across the Hotel The well known Arab Street Area with Bars, Shisha / Hookah Bars, Mid East / Chinese / American Food Chain / Pakistani Restaurants are all there. The food is good and reasonably priced. Cloth Shops, Dresses, Curios, Turkish Chandeliers/ Lights Stores make it a well remembered Shopping experience. Must visit Bashir Khan\u2019s KAMPONG GLAM CAF\u00c9 on 17, Bussorah Street. It is in the Arab Street Area. Delectable Food. For Dinner, ask for the Menu. Chicken Chops are to die for.

Like the honesty of the reservation officer, some other hotel would move in for the kill and tell you that the deal you wanted has been fully taken up, we now have another room but cost slightly more ........ I often also judge the age of staff in the hotels. This hotel employs more older staff than younger ones, which in my opinion provides better service, more thoughtfulness and compassionate. It is also nice to be served by man & women in their late forties to fifties, kind of bring back the Raffles/Good old days feel. Room is good and spacious even with extra bed, like the table which makes computing/work easy, Flat screen TV, nice beds. Lifts is kind of 70s with all the 70s buttons but serves its purposes. Breakfast is good, wide spread and happy with quality of food served. One of my problem about this hotel is the food, its near Arab street and with lots of restaurants around. But to look for a decent hawker centre or coffee shop to have a typical singapore cheap food stalls meal within walking distance is difficult.

There is a small bar for some fruity drink to quench your thirst. Overall, this is a good 4 star hotel, although you may need to walk a little more to reach the main shopping area. However, if you do like enthic taste of life, there is an Arab Street nearby where you can have a taste of muslim cuisine, turkish or Arab food nearby. You can even chill out at some of the pubs there with Arab water pipes. If you want somewhere not so crowded yet not far away from entertainment, this is a good choice for a decent stay.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cMixed review\u201d", "Author": "MRPHILLLEE", "ReviewID": "UR37365786", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel as a two night stopover on our way to Australia.

The room is not huge but more than adequate for two to share, bathroom a little small but very clean and has all the usual extras required.

However the hotel exceeded my expectations, and would definitely stay there again. Firstly the previous negative comments - noise and dirty room. The hotel was spotless from what I could see, certainly my room was. As for construction noise, there is certainly some around and it could be heard from the pool, but not from my room. I slept soundly each of the three nights I was there. Service was first class. I arrived at the hotel at 8am after a \"red-eye\" flight from Australia. All I asked for was the possibility of somewhere to change, but every effort was put into finding me a room, which was found. I was booked in and given free accommodation for the morning, so could snooze a little and shower before my first appointment that afternoon. They even found me a non=smoking room, which was something a five+ star chain hotel I stayed in 12 months ago couldn't manage. After that I found staff to be consistently friendly and attentive throughout my stay, better than the five star hotel. The room of course was smaller than the five star hotel, the carpets not as luxurious, and the bathroom and bath in particular smaller. But certainly not uncomfortably so. And of course very clean. It did face out the back, onto another building, but given the time of my arrival I didn't complain about that! If I was arriving at a more reasonable time, I would probably request a room at the front when booking. Breakfast was typical Singapore hotel buffet. The waffles and the eggs were very good, the bacon less so. A nice selection of fruits and I was happy. Coffee was out of an automatic machine that ground the beans and brewed under pressure, certainly much better than drip filter, but not quite true espresso. The pool was fantastic, and well maintained. Nice and deep at one end, which was nice for a hotel pool. Internet access was easy. It was charged for, but it was charged by the minute, so if you pulled the plug, or shut your computer the charging stopped. There was a daily cap as well. Reasonable charges compared to some I have experienced. I liked the location. Just a short taxi ride to the central attractions, there is also a bus stop for several useful routes right outside. Bugis MRT (underground) station was a \"one block up, one block across\" walk, certainly not too far so long as it wasn't raining. Best is that it is directly across from Arab Street, one of the most interesting areas in Singapore. I took several walks through this area, and ate there as well. However it does not sit on top of a mall complex, like city central hotels tend to do, so may not suit the avid shopper. It was also on the airport side of the city, which I like from an access point of view too.

Everything was there, the iron and board, fridge, internet line, toothbrush and toothpaste, abundant of fresh towels, etc. All the used stuffs will be changed daily without request.

Booked through their website at a dear price (S$160/170 per night), so we were expecting a good product for the price we paid. This was mainly because we initially planned to stay at the Allson for S$70 less, but it was fully booked through a cheap booking site. We'd been very happy with the Allson in the past, so the extra we were paying had to be worth it. Check in was a breeze at the lobby, where we were offered warm hand towels. Unfortunately the staff were very cold! Nonetheless, we quickly had a couple of cards in hand and made our way up to the room in the lift. The hotel is very much a business-type hotel and all very modern; not well suited to leisure travellers. A note worthy of mention is that the hotel is very long and rooms are spread out, so anyone with mobility issues might have trouble if their room is down a far end. We arrived at the room, which quite frankly could've been in any city in the world. Ugly bed spreads, sterile lighting, impractical bedding for the climate (sheets and warm blankets), no real place to sit comfortably, and, I know it's pretty standard, but a shower over the bath. When I had a shower, water travelled all the way around the edge and down the side of the bath on to the floor. We had a flood! In all, the bathroom looked very dated. All this and a horrible view over the back car park. Later that night, we were trying to get to sleep, but it was impossible as there was a dull hum from an air conditioner in the car park behind. Luckily enough our request to change rooms was accepted without a fuss and we had the privilege of dealing with a delightful Indian woman at reception. And, while the room we moved to was identical, it was absent of any hums and had a nice view over Beach Road. And, of course, the bathroom floor was dry! The next day we ventured down a floor to the pool and spa area. If the only thing you wanted to do was swim, this hotel would be perfect. The pool would have to be the best I have ever come across, deep enough and plenty of sun loungers around. Change rooms nearby were both spacious and clean. We didn't venture into the gym, but it seemed to be well equipped. The location of the hotel isn't as good as many others in the city centre, but nonetheless, it was only a few minutes walk to Bugis Markets and the MRT station was about ten/fifteen minutes walk. Taxis seemed to roll by fairly frequently for those needing private transport. But, on the whole, if one wanted to rely on the MRT to get around, the location of this hotel would be less than ideal. So, in summary, this hotel lacks value for money in many ways. Rooms, location, rates and service are nothing to write home about. Rooms are uninviting and feel cold. Swimmers will love the hotel.

Booked hotel through an airline package tour First, there are a couple of other hotels with the name \"parkroyal\" so make sure you have the right hotel in mind if you are reading these reviews. This one is the Plaza Parkroyal, along Beach Road across Arab street. The structure: It is newly refurbished. Work was just finished i think last Dec 2006or Jan 2007 so expect clean carpets, walls etc.. When I was looking for a 3 or 4 star hotel to stay i kept on reading about moldy, damp, poor wallpapers about the other hotels. At least chances are you won't be having those problems here. Well equiped bathroom with tub.It is indeed a lowrise building so dont expect views of skyscrapers etc. Our room was in the front so we had a view of the hotel's driveway and an adjacent garden. Pool Probably the best in all of singapore. nice balinese type with a superb view. One will just wonder, it is higher than most of the hotel's rooms and you'll pass through a labyrinth making you feel you're lost before you get there but the pool and view is worth it. Food: Wide variety of dishes, omelettes,cheese, bread, cereal, fruits and salad for the breakfast buffet. If you're trying to save money, stuff yourself at 930am as brunch. After 3 or 4 breakfasts though, you'll find the buffet boring regardless of the variety. I guess this is the same in all hotels Location: On the eastern side of the city center. It is near the Arab street for those interested in handicrafts etc. It is near the exit/entrance toward the main highway to the airport. A small mall (The concourse) where you'll find a food court. A 7/11 is 2 or 3 blocks to the right across the street. Payphone and bus stop, just in front of the hotel. Hotel is near the DHL balloon. Bugis MRT and mall/night market, although near is still a 20 min walk - a tiring one if you will be with old people. If you intend to go to bugis or use the MRT more than once, you will wish you didnt believe the reviews that these are just a quick walk away. But if you plan to go there just once, then its OK. Money changers at golden mile complex 3 blocks away or at Bugis. (Rates at arrivals at the aiairport are comparable with downtown though) Orchard Road fafar - you'll need taxi or MRT Transportation The MRT is superb by the way, you dont have to buy the stored value multi use card by the way if you plan to stay for less than a week. There are virtually no long lines when you purchase or get the deposits for the MRT cards. If you plan to use buses too, then i suggest you get the stored cards. Taxis - a bit expensive with all the tolls and extras added to the fees. Bugis station is a long walk away. you'll realize that its indeed far if you'll see that other stations are really just beside the other hotels. If you plan on using a lot of the public transportation, the hotel's location is a bit of a problem Sightseeing SH tours one of the better tour companies, and the only one with a tie up with Singapore airlines has a permanent booth near the concierge so no problem with pickups, drop offs. Credit cards accepted. Malaysia anyone? One of the main bus centers of Singapore - Golden Mile is just 3 blocks away. We took the midnight trip to kuala lumpur, slept in very comfortable bus (take your pick of the various bus types/fares/skeds) arrived early am. took a trip to genting highlands in the am and went to petronas/KL tower in the afternoon boarded the bus and were back at Parkroyal at 11pm. A 24 hour Amazing race like sojourn but was well worth it.Walking the 3 blocks to and from the bus station at midnight was very safe. Can't say the same for Puduraya, KL though. Concierge/ Front desk Very helpful, just approach them. Facilities for luggage storage after checkout while waiting for your flight. Bottomline: Nice 4 star hotel (so don't compare it with the 5 star chain hotels), good food, superb pool. Use of MRT/public transportation a bit of a bother not unless you are familiar with the bus routes. Have a nice stay in singapore!", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "PARKROYAL on Beach Road", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d306192-Reviews-PARKROYAL_on_Beach_Road-Singapore.html", "Price": "$159 - $853*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7500 Beach Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">199591</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "306192", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/20/d9/3c/hotel-facade.jpg"}}
