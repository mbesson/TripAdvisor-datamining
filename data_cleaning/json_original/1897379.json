Even though we booked two twin rooms we arrived there to find out that in this hotel only double rooms are available (not a good start I thought). Before checking in we were asked to pay the whole amount of money for our stay upfront which was ok but kind of strange. The hotel is actually two separate buildings with different entrance. Our rooms were not in the main building so we had to go out to Craven Road (a quite busy avenue) and then enter the main builiding everytime we wanted to visit the reception table or have breakfast. Breakfast itself was disappointing but after what we had already seen we weren't surprised. Rather poor, limited choices, we eventually gave it a miss and went out for breakfast. The worst aspect of this hotel though is the rooms. It was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in. We could barely open our baggage. Bathroom was equally small and uncomfortable. There was also a small, dirty (full of dust and cigarretes) balcony. It was hazardous to be out there cause if you miss your step it is likely that you' ll be diving down the road. Therefore rooms are absolutely not suitable for children. Now as for cleanliness, what a surprise: rooms were not clean! Stains of dirt on the sheets and towels, hair in the bathroom, cigarretes all over the balcony. Medium size plasma tv couldn't make up for this. Overall it looked like a cheap hotel except it was not actually that cheap. The only good aspect is the location, which was originally the reason we booked. Its in Paddington, withing walking distance from Paddington railway and tube station, not far away from all the main attractions of central London. I'm sure though that there are other better options at the same price if you are looking to stay around Paddington area, so just avoid this place, it's not worth it.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cnothing special to complain about\u201d", "Author": "slovene", "ReviewID": "UR121415530", "Content": "-good location -rooms recently renovated, very clean and quiet (on courtyard side), just a bit tiny.

On the negative side rooms are not to a great standard with regards fixtures and fittings. Nice flat screen tv but not tuned in, two shower heads but one didn't have a bracket, mattress on double needs turning or replacing as it had two people-shaped dips in it. If something is broken it seems to be left or repair botched. Little things that you don't tend to see at a quality hotel. There is no lift and a narrow staircase to rooms, not great if you have more than one small bag. Also a noisy hotel, you can hear traffic and people outside, as well as other people in their rooms. This hotel is fine for those looking for a crash pad in a decent location that is a little cheaper than some of the chain hotels, but not a relaxing getaway, family trip or business travel location.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alicante, Spain", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Novello", "ReviewID": "UR118228093", "Content": "Really, the only thing that this hotel has going for it is its central location. The bus stops and underground are only 5 minutes away; lots of restaurants very close to the hotel. Bedroom was a decent size, once you got to it, which we shared with some tiny ants! Bathroom was fine but small. First night we were at the front of the hotel, VERY noisy from the street (despite requesting a \"quiet room\" in my original booking). We were changed on day 2 to the back, which was quiet. The entrance and reception are to say the least very basic, to the point of being off-putting. Basic is the by-word of the hotel. We had a double room in the adjacent, unconnected building. We were on the third floor, up 54 steep narrow stairs - no lift! No drawer space to unpack - we decided not to bother; tiny wardrobe, with only 2 hangers - 1 each. No sign anywhere of the \"stylish decor\" mentioned in the website. Breakfast was very basic. The staff were very friendly, and reactive, when asked, rather than any suggestion of using their initiative. Internet kept going down. Frankly the 3 star rating of this hotel is a joke; at 105 GB pounds a night it was a rip off! Apart from the disappointment with the hotel, we enjoyed our time in wonderful London", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "clea2003", "ReviewID": "UR115222885", "Content": "We just wanted a twin room near Paddington as we were going to a concert in London. This hotel had very pleasant and friendly reception staff, and the room was clean and fairly quiet. We were allowed to leave our luggage with reception on day of check out, and unlike some hotels the reception door was locked when there was nobody available even for a few minutes, which is reassuring. On the downside there was some noise from the air conditioner which seemed to be right outside, and because the entire hotel decided 9am was the ideal time for breakfast the staff struggled a little - not something that was a major problem though.

The room was very clean and bright with modern decor and it had coffee and tea making facilities , there was a small cupboard for putting clothes in and this also housed a small fridge which came in handy. The bathroom was lovely with a massive shower the only problem we could see was that if you had somebody who was a little on the large side they might struggle to get through the sliding door to the shower as it only opened so far so it would be a bit of a squeeze. The bed was comfy and clean and the wall opposite had a small flat screen T.V. The problem with the room being in the basement was you could sometimes hear the underground trains and banging from chairs and feet as our room seemed to be somewhere underneath the breakfast and reception area - this was annoying because it meant you could hear people coming and going at all hours.
