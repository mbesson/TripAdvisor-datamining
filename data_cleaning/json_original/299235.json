Friendly atmosphere and caring staff. Our holiday had started badly with a flight delay from dublin to london where our luggage was left behind. We had gone to dubai to celebrate my birthday with the highlight being an evening at the dubai horse racing on the saturday of our arrival. As our luggage did not arrive we had no clothes to wear so missed out in going to the races which was very, very, very disappointing. On telling our story to the Director of sales and Marketing, Michaela Smith she immediately offered us a complimentary extra night which meant we could go to the races on the following saturday if we could change our flights. We were delighted with this offer as virgin atlantic had stated they would change our flights from the saturday to the sunday. However on ringing them they informed us that the flight on the sunday was fully booked so we had to return on the saturday and miss the races. We our however very grateful to the crown plaza staff for their kind offer and help and hope to return to stay with them again in the future and eventually get to the horse racing at Maydan race course. We felt we were given a very personal service by all the staff at this hotel from the General Manager Georges down.

While overall it was a decent hotel, I would suggest that it's not as good as the many published rankings would have one believe. Some items I took issue with: 1) I paid for a \"club\" room, but was put into an \"apartment\" on the same floor as the \"club rooms\" - but in the second tower. This was NOT a good deal; the room was not equivalent. 2) I had to ride one elevator down to the lobby and back up in another every time I met others in my group, went to breakfast, etc. This was due to #1, above. 3) I never received the daily newspaper delivery I paid for as part of #1. 4) The wireless internet service was spotty at best; I had to ask multiple times for login/password pairs that would work, and was never able to get more than one device to work at a time (even with multiple logon IDs). Speeds were quite slow for this level of hotel. 5) No minibar in the room, and no convenience shop in the hotel - no way to get even a basic soft drink without dressing to go into a restaurant or bar, or going down the street to an outside shop. 6) Pricing was excessive, even for Dubai. This was especially true in the hotel restaurants - $75US for a bottle of wine that sells for $8 retail isn't reasonable anywhere. 7) A coffee-maker in the room would have been nice, given the price point. Given all of these issues, I will give them credit for having generally good service, including a same-day laundry. The facility also had a wide variety of restaurant options; while over-priced, they were better than one would get at a comparable property in the US. Live music in several of them was a nice touch, as well. Although I didn't get the level of room I paid for, I will say that it was comfortable, had a great view, the bed was about right, etc. Although there was no airport transfer bus here, there's really no need for one, as the Metro and/or taxis are easy and convenient.

We chose it because we got a special rate using my husbands Privledge Card. We had read some of the reviews from Tripadvisor but decided to try it out for ourselves =) It was generally a pleasant stay and we did enjoy our time there. There were only some minor annoyances but nothing big enough that we wouldnt come back again :) Will list some of the pros and cons below: *PROS: - Room was large and clean. It was big enough to have a sofa and coffee table (not just standard arm chairs) - Bathroom was large and clean too. Had comfy robes and towels. Plenty of hoter water. - King size bed and pillows were comfortable. - You can manually turn the air con on or off. - Room had a trouser press which I'd never seen before. - Friendly reception staff and bellboys. - Clean hotel entrance, not overly fancy decor but still pleasant. - Sakura Japanese restaurant!!! Would totally recommend it! Fresh dishes bursting with flavour. Especially their prawn tempura sushi, was so delicious Im drooling on my keyboard now just thinking about it. :) - Complimentary dates and arabic coffee in the foyer Friday morning :) - Concierge was very helpful with directions and info :) - Hotel is in a FANTASTIC location - next to lots of restaurants and cafes (walking distance) and a short drive to some major tourist places like Dubai Mall etc *CONS (not major, but just small annoyances): - Valet parking could use more organising. It took us awhile to be able to pull in because of all the cars lined up, some of them just parked on the side waiting to be moved. They probably could use with more people working out the front. - There should be NO smoking allowed outside the hotel entrance - looks incrediably tacky when you have people hanging around outside having a drag!!! Not to mention Im 6 months pregnant, and having to walk thru a cloud of smoke to get into the hotel or into my car was terrible. - We had to wait 40 minutes before our room was ready - even though we checked in around 4.30pm. Wasnt overly impressed about this. - Instructions for the safe were hard to follow or wouldnt work properly so we couldnt use it. - When we checked out, reception told us that two cans of soda were missing from the fridge - even though we didnt even OPEN the fridge once during the whole stay. Although they believed us, it was a bit annoying to have to be questioned at all. Some hotels have the option where you can request in advance for the room mini bar to be locked so that you can check out more easily. They should have done this for us.

The gym is brilliant and totally new. I guess all the health club is excellent.

My Favorites are cafe Barabra and Cappucino cafe. Al Tannour is Lebanese one of the best spots BUT its opened for dinner only, and the menu is fixed so I guess you can enjoy Lebanese food but you will have to be eating a lot. its atmosphere is not Lebanese but its closed to the gulf atmosphere. even the management of the restaurant gives you the feeling they are in a different place separated from the hotel. Al Fresco Italian is my favorite as well and serves excellent food/drinks. AL Dana which is the main restaurant serves international food and is good option as well. You have others like Oscan Vine, Trader Vics, and Zinc to enjoy music/drinks as well. The Main issue with the hotel that it needs renovation/improvement/revamping.

Metro is about 5 minutes away, and there're always taxis outside, so accesibility is easy. That's where the pluses ended for me. The service was flippant and off the cuff.

Best gym I've seen in a hotel in a long time - high ceilinged and fairly cool as well. The pool area is alright, faces onto Sheikh Zayed so not the quietest, and when I was there (May) it loses the sun after about 2pm or so as it goes behind the building - but perhaps that's not SUCH a bad thing given Dubai's temperatures! I never really eat breakfast at hotels, but it seemed fine the once or twice I did, nothing special. The steak restaurant was acceptable but very overpriced, wouldn't particularly recommend that. The Japanese restaurant is excellent, they had lovely Tepenyaki chefs and the food was of very high standard. Good saki too. Harvester's Pub was frequented on a fairly regular basis in order to watch various sporting events that were going on during my stay, and it is excellent for that. They have a LOT of TVs (including a big screen) and they can show multiple sports at once. Pub grub is probably slightly above average, big portion sizes for sure. Staff were very friendly too. And then there's the famous nightclub, Zinc, right at the entrance to the hotel. As a hotel guest you get in for free. I would describe this place as... interesting. Mix of client\u00e8le seems to be hotel guests, hotel guests from other hotels, the occasional group of cabin crew (on certain nights) and... prostitutes. There's certainly a fair amount hanging around outside the hotel on Thursday and Friday nights, and it's not that unusual to run into them in the corridors of the hotel either (I did a couple of times in my stay there). It's not something that bothers me at all, and it's certainly not threatening, but if that's something that might upset you if you're wandering the hotel late at night, you might want to consider somewhere else. Oh, I almost forgot Trader Vic's which is the other bar in the hotel - their food is pretty good, and they have an EXCELLENT cocktail menu. It gets pretty busy on weekends, and their live band is good too. Worth checking out. So, in summary, a good hotel in a nice location. If a good hotel gym is important to you, this is a good place to be!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne night lay over.\u201d", "Author": "charlietraveler57", "ReviewID": "UR118516809", "Content": "Big, busy but great location for getting around.

The most disturbing thing that happened here was that I was asked by the hotel staff to fill in an evaluation review about the hotel during my last day at the breakfast. I filled it in and handed over. Now, these are supposed to be anonymous. But the staff member went five meters away, opened my review, and started reading it.

It\u2019s situated by the Sheikh Zayed road that runs through Dubai. The blue metro line also runs along the same road and a metro station is approx.10 minute walk from hotel. Location is also good for the Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa towers with approx 10 minutes ride by taxi. Otherwise hotel is situated rather far from the beach and the 5 star hotels and districts for best nightlife and restaurants. It will take you approx. 20 minutes (30 \u2013 40 dirham by taxi) to the Jumeirah Beach Park for the beach and other areas for enjoying evenings. The hotel building itself is rather old and has seen better days. It\u2019s connected to a small shopping mall which was closed or under renovation. The lobby is rather plain but works for its purpose. It doesn\u2019t feel very enticing and inviting for having a drink etc. Check-in was crowded but manageable on arrival. Got upgraded to a \u201cCaptain\u2019s Suite\u201d which was adequate but wouldn\u2019t have noticed being in a \u201csuite\u201d without the sign on the wall. Nothing special but the room was comfortable and adequate with basic amenities. Air conditioning system was fairly loud but fortunately didn\u2019t need to have it on in the evenings. Internet was expensive (25 USD / 24hrs) and slow. The swimming pool is small and located on the 3rd floor towards the high way so you hear and see the cars and traffic. The sun hits the pool area up to approx. 3 pm in the afternoon. It\u2019s a bit crowded and not the sort of place you would want to spend a day soaking in the sun. Went to the gym which was being renovated. There wasn\u2019t much space but the gym equipment was new. Breakfast service was quite disappointing as the breakfast area is way too small for the number of guests in the hotel. The tables were full at breakfast rush hour (8 \u2013 9 am) with lots of hassle and queuing. The employees do their best but the area should be enlarged and upgraded. Breakfast assortment was ok but nothing special. Taking into consideration the general level of hotels in Dubai I would look for another newer establishment. On Dubai scale this gets 2,5 stars out of 5. There\u2019s nothing terribly wrong with this but there\u2019s no splendor to it and the worn out building needs a substantial facelift.

This is usually a good idea so we agreed. We got to go straight to the room even though it was so early and the room, or should I say suite, was enormous. Lounge and dining area with separate king size bed room and even a powder room in addition to the main bathroom with jacuzi. We slept for 11 hours solid on the first night \u2013 the bed was so comfortable and only had a light doona which is what we prefer. The hotel looks like it is due for a makeover as it is a bit dated in its decor but it had so much going for it. We decided to have lunch there on day 1 and went to the buffet. We were told that for May on Saturdays they had a promotion and each person dining got to flip a coin and if a winner, got their meal for free. As I won the flip we got two meals for the price of one and the food was delicious. We thought it was sad that not many people were dining in the restaurants at all and a lot of staff were standing around with not much to do. Eat there if you can \u2013 it\u2019s great value and fresh & delicious. Room service servings were huge \u2013 enough for four people though there were only two of us. We had a kitchenette in the suite so kept food in the fridge for a late night snack on our second night. We had a 6pm pickup for our onward flight and were permitted to stay in the club lounge for as long as we needed to. The girls there fussed over us and were fantastic.

There is no way this should be rated as a 5 Star hotel. The rooms are really old fashioned and shabby. nothing plush about them at all. We had a fridge in the room and the seal on the inside of the door was hanging off and the back of it was a total block of ice. The view from the window was just the carpark. It is really clean and we had clean beds everyday, but if you are going for a treat which ours was, as it was our first week away without our children as well, I would not recommend it. I just assumed 5 Star would mean 5 Star! You can not fault the hotel staff at all though. We arrived at 2am and the Manager was there to greet us and we had booked a taxi through the hotel to collect us and even though it took us nearly 2 hours to get through passport control (so busy), the taxi was still waiting. We booked bed and breakfast, but only had breakfast 3 times, as some mornings there was curry and chinese, I eat anything, but this really put me off. Also we used the restaurant one night in the hotel, when we went in it was 10.30pm and we asked before we sat down what time they were there open till and they said 11.30pm, which we thought was fine as it was a buffet. It was seafood night, so we choose some fish to get grilled. The fish finally came at 11.15pm and when he put it down, the waiter said, I am now clearing away the buffet, if you want sweet get it now! We said, but we have waited all this time for the fish and his reply was, well if you had come earlier there would have been more choice!! We said you should never have seated us then, as we did ask. Anyway we left and went and got a MacDonalds next door. I complained and the restaurant manager (Brian) rang our room the next day to apologies, but when I got our bill before we checked out, they had charged us for the meal. They did remove it once, I went through the whole story again. I had informed them by email before we arrived it was my husbands birthday and they did give him a complementary cake and bottle of wine on the day. I could have complained about the room, but we weren't in there much, but I was really disappointed, as I had booked this holiday as a surprize for my husband and kept it a secret for 6 months. The Movenpick is just up the road and this is rated as 4 Star and it is beautiful, we went in and had a look and eveywhere is really modern and plush. This hotel is ideally situated for getting around Dubai, as the taxis are so cheap. 15 mins to Atlantis or Jumeriah Beach and approx 20 mins to the Meydan Racecourse, as we went to the Dubai World Cup. If you want somewhere nice to eat, go to the Marina, were there is Frankie Dettori and Marc Pierre White restaurant, which is lovely, but you do need to book this before you get there. Or the Butchers Grill, which is opposite the Jumeriah Hilton and this is fantastic. Lots of places don't serve alcohol, but all the hotels have pubs in them which have happy hours. In the Crowne Plaza there is a Harvester Pub which has a happy hour from 5pm till 7pm. A pint and a gin and tonic was about \u00a39 during happy hour. When you land at the airport, you can go in Duty Free and buy drink, it works out the same price as home. If you want a drink make sure you get it here, as the supermarkets don't even sell it! To be honest it was so hot, we drank hardly any alcohol and we like a drink. We also had high tea at the Al Burj (7 Star hotel), which is well worth doing, but I would book dinner if you can, we left it too late, so just had to settle for the high tea. Also Trader Vics restaurants are a lovely place to eat, there are loads in Dubai, but the one in the Madinat Jumeriah is great, the Madinat is a lovely place, all shops and stalls inside, as well as lots of restaurants to choice from. I would recommend the open top bus tour, we did this and it takes you all around Dubai and you see places you would never see if you didn't do it. We also went to Atlantis Hotel for the day, but not much here though, but it was nice to have a look about, not many water rides neither. The Dubai Mall is unreal, its a must, but everything is really expensive, loads cheaper at home. Also they are so hot on your baggage allowance going home, each extra kilo is 30 euros (KLM) and they won't let you over at all. Loads of people were over, we just bought another case in the airport and took it on as hand luggage and they were fine with that, so be very careful. If you want a hotel to stay in for business this is ideal, but I wouldn't recommend it for a family or romantic holiday.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Banglaore", "Title": "\u201cHome Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "RajeshKumarSingh", "ReviewID": "UR58887432", "Content": "Great for the Business trip with close proximity to the office..have stayed here for many trips .Very convenient location along Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai!

While the hotel itself is outdated and there are so many nicer hotels in Dubai now, incl. another crown plaza, we kept going back to this one for the good rates (actually it was cheaper than same time last year) and the wonderful service. Well, this great service is gone now as well. Rooms are clean and cleaners are polite, but the restaurants are a real disaster as they seems to have no staff around. A lot of staff we got to know in previous trips have left and we were told it is under new management now (but the hotel is still called crown plaza??). Well, this new management is killing that 'special touch' it used to have as nobody seems to enjoy working there anymore which reflected in the, previously so good, service standards.

The Crowne Plaza is right on Sheik Zayed Road, the main drag through Dubai. It's pretty sterile; all brand new modern hotels; but on the other hand, everything works just fine and access is great. The hotel has several restaurants. We ate at a couple although the Wagamama, a British noodle house chain was not nearly as good as the one at the Tower of London. It also has a nice, small pool area that was mostly full every day. Being there in November was great for hanging out poolside. The beach is great, but not super close. The hotel does have a free shuttle that will take you to Jumeirah beach park which is a pay entry park. There's also a free beach that doesn't have services available. But the sand is really soft and easy to walk/lay on. The high got to maybe 90 (fahrenheit) daily and just a little cool at night. At this time of year the humidity is gone, so none of the weather issues of the summer exist by mid-November. One issue is that everything is utterly air conditioned, which is a little annoying at this time of year when the weather is so nice. The sun wasn't too intense so we didn't have to worry too much about sun burn, although I'd bet that isn't true in the hotter months. There's a metro (monorail) being built that will go a long way along Sheik Zayed Road. Unfortunately, I already can't remember if there was a stop nearby. The stops are not very close together so the metro may or may not be helpful when complete in late 2009. Locals complain incessantly about the traffic, but if you've driven in Chicago, Dallas, LA, etc., the traffic here is nothing. The roads are wide, multi-lane and clearly marked. The only traffic issue is that although buildings HAVE an address, nobody goes by them, so you have to provide directions by landmark instead of by address number. However, in the case of the Crowne Plaza, every driver knew the hotel and there was never an issue getting there. In Dubai the water is de-salinated. It's perfectly safe to drink. However, it tastes completely foul. The hotel provides free bottled water, so it's not a problem at all. Particularly in the summer (but even for us in the fall) you'll always want to carry a bottle on you. I didn't experience that \"caught outside in the heat\" panic where having water is critical, but still, I did find I was drinking more water than usual. The toiletries in the bathroom were nice so don't bother bringing your own stuff, unless you're really picky about shampoo and conditioner. It's very dusty in Dubai (duh... desert) so I felt like my hair got dirty much faster than normal. I think the scarves worn by many Emiraties is not just cultural, but also practical. If I'd have been there much longer I might have been using one as well. But speaking of dress, you can dress however you feel comfortable. I saw everything from what had to be hookers to women in full burkas. In a pinch I would say respect the culture and dress relatively discreetly. But you don't have to worry about wearing shorts or covering your hair or anything. One benefit of this hotel is that it is directly across the street from the Jumeirah Towers (I think that was what they were called). It's 2 building that look like puzzle pieces fitting together. They stand out on the skyline, so you can easily spot \"home\" from other parts of the city. The Crowne Plaza has a mall in the lower level. There's a residence apartment attached so you can get all kinds of items from drug store items to Persian rugs right there. And speaking of shopping, it is THE thing to do in Dubai. Everything is built around shopping malls, and they could be plopped in any city in the US. Every mall (and I was in several of them) smells like Cinnabon and Starbucks. I never saw a Target, but Carrefour is the European equivalent, and can be found at the malls. But every chain store you can think of will be found at pretty much every mall. It's plentiful, but not especially exotic. At the souks (the malls generally have a traditional market section) you can find Persian rugs and other sort of local items, but even there, they're chain. For example, there's a Persian Carpet House in every mall, including at the mall in the lower level of the Crowne Plaza. The souks are barter based. The regular stores are fixed price. I'm not a big shopper, but if you love the thought of shopping at Chanel, Rolex, Tiffany, Dolce & Gabbana and 50 other high end shops, you'll find them all under one of several roofs. I can't imagine there would be the need for that many outlets of these brands, but then I'd never spend $1000 on a dress. This hotel was nice, but part of what you do in Dubai is wallow in luxury. I would recommend this hotel for business or for leisure, but I'd also say if you can possibly afford it, you should splurge and stay at one of the ridiculously posh resorts. There are probably 20 that would fit that bill, not just the Burj al Arab.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SUTTON COLDFIELD", "Title": "\u201cNICE HOTEL-VERY WELL SITUATED\u201d", "Author": "Abigail99", "ReviewID": "UR20540889", "Content": "We reaaly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Music good in Piano Bar and staff very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is on the main Sheikh Zayed road and is therefore affected by some traffic noise if you like to sleep with window open. The main road is a 13 lane highway, 5 lanes each way with a three lane service road. It's directly opposite the Emirates Towers but to cross the road you would need to take a taxi or to use the pedestrian underpass (not tested!) Their partner hotel for the beach is in Shahjah and there is no alcohol served there. We took a taxi to the Le Meridien Mena Sheyah and paid 100 dirhams for a day's access to their beach, superb. The Holiday Centre shopping mall underneath the Crowne Plaza hotel has a supermarket, and an excellent italian coffee bar serving meals and is a free Wifi zone so no need to logon in the hotel and pay for internet access. There's hairdressers, clothing shops, nail bar, carpet shop, shoe shop, jewellers, pharmacy, the ubiquitious MacDonalds (and a TGIFridays next door), and a newsagent so immediate needs catered for. Obviously, Dubai has bigger and better malls in abundance. Taxis are plentiful. Staff are unfailingly polite. A clean hotel in all areas. The pool area is not very large and is affected by some traffic noise. Used the dry cleaning service and it was very fast with perfect results. Free shuttle bus to Mall of the Emirates and to the airport. Turn down service with a chocolate on the bed every evening. A bowl of fresh fruit and chocolates in room on first evening only. On the whole, it's a reasonably priced hotel. I was there on a business trip and suspect most of the other guests were too.", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGood all round hotel\u201d", "Author": "Moaning Minnies", "ReviewID": "UR5979928", "Content": "Stayed here on business a few times, most recently in September 2006. This is a good hotel in a good location. Of course it is part of an international chain, so lacking in unique or special touches, but does everything pretty well. Business facilities are good - broadband internet in the room and they did not charge me to print a couple of pages in the business centre. Bars and restaurants also good - the steakhouse is nice, and the breakfast buffet has a good selection.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Crowne Plaza Hotel Dubai", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d299235-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai.html", "Price": "$131 - $353*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sheikh Zayed Rd, Al Nahyan Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">PO Box 23215</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">23215</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "299235", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c8/3a/35/situated-in-th-heart.jpg"}}
