The room has private bathroom with hairdryer, TV, phone, security box, air condition, heating and fridge.. Lugagge care service for free.Reception open 24h. I had a single room, it was not so spacy but quite normal for 1 person, they have double rooms and they're more spacy and had a small terrace. At first I communicated with the hotel to know about the length of the beds cause someone wrote that they have too short beds and its not a good news for tall people)), but they answered me that bed size is 190cm x 90cm, and its ok! They also suggested me that they have small double rooms with double bed, bed has this size 120x190cm. The rate was 20 euro higher than mine so I decided to take single. These double rooms has a balcony to the back side of the house, there is no special view, but you have natural light and sun, and it's quieter. My room was exterior to the street with window and the view was the house, but it was ok. If the rooms will have view to the street Nou de Sant Francesc there is a construction works right opposite the building so its more noisy cause they begin to work over 9am and the cran begin to work))). You can take the breakfast in the hotel for 5 euros but I didnt, I had a breakfast neat the hotel at the Vitaminas with fresh juices, it was over 8.5-9. Its very close to La Rambla and near metro station Drassannes, 2 stations from Placa Catalunia, close to Gothic quarter and Port, you can take rickshaws to go to the beach or to some cute restaurants in the Port.

The price you pay is value for money. The reception staff (3-4 guys) were all helpful, all spoke English well. Room was clean, neat, LCD TV, air conditioning (not the best, but did the job), and a bathroom shower and toilet. It's only 5-10 euros more per night than a private room in a hostel, but provides a lot more than just a hostel (i.e. in-room toilet and shower, fridge, TV, aircon). A previous reviewer said it felt like a hostel. It did not feel like it, but there was some refurbishment going on (April 2011) so maybe some of the older rooms were hostel like. Certainly not ours. If you are worried, just ask them for a modern room. Problem solved. If you're still unsure, look at my photos as evidence. Pictures speak a thousand works, so here's 4-thousand words for you! The room felt quite modern with the LCD TV (smallish 14\"), small fridge, and clean bedding, table. This was on the 4th floor, and there were notes about construction going on. I believe a room was being refurbished close to ours as we did hear some noise during the day. Definitely no noise at night (4th floor, not overlooking any pedestrian area). Room service did a good job and visited daily during the 5 day stay. Internet was free, and wifi was available all throughout the hotel. Most importantly, it was fast. Didn't partake in the breakfast as wanted to try the local food in and around Barcelona. Location is very central, about 2-3 streets away from Las Ramblas. A 2 minute walk at most. Several convenience stores are nearby. The beach is about a 10-15 minute walk. The hotel entrance does have a bit to be desired as it is down a side street and so for the unfamiliar can come across as a bit dodgy. It's not though. If you're visiting it for the first time, take a chance to view Google Street Maps to give you an idea of how to walk to it from Drassanes Metro/Las Ramblas. Sleep was fine, no noises interrupting at night. Room view wasn't much, but then I'm not interested in a hotel view I'm interested in exploring cities. What I see outside the room window doesn't bother me much. At checkout we were asked if we needed a cab, which we did and the reception person phoned up a taxi and within 10 minutes we were on our way. Taxi to airport cost \u20ac32 (someone else had \u20ac37, I'd put this down to traffic plus airports often have surcharges). In terms of my ratings, I put the location at only 4 star due to the back-alley feeling issue (which in reality is a non-issue, but some people may see it differently). Everything else gets 5 stars for this price range.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Londonderry", "Title": "\u201cA hostel, not a hotel!\u201d", "Author": "maureenann18", "ReviewID": "UR102710037", "Content": "Max on reception never made eye contact when we entered, asking for our passports and payment on arrival. First impressions stick! He lightened up over the week and became quite the charmer. A bit late! Out of the 3 men on reception I encountered, Phillipe was a gentleman. He was lovely. The \"hostel\" is very well situated within minutes of the Rambla, shopping, restaurants, beach, taxis and metro. The room was not clean when we booked in. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 6 months. Dust on the skirting was thick, and the washbasin was dirty. I complained after 4 days and the bedding was changed; washbasin was cleaned. The room was still dirty as the corners were not cleaned and dirt was sticking to the chair legs. Balls of fluffy dirt were everywhere. Two good points were an electronic safe and a larder fridge. Don't expect to sleep well as the noise is awful from the people on the same floor. Loud voices constantly and slamming of doors every few minutes. No-one takes any heed of the noise restriction from 11.00pm. The street below is also noisy if you happen to have a room with a balcony facing out from the front. Arguments, voices and skate boarders are the norm even at 2 or 3am. In the morning if you are lucky to have had a few hours sleep, you are wakened by the building site right across the street, at 7.30am. Finally, we ordered a taxi for the El Prat airport at reception the night before we left, and were quoted 30 euros from Max. The taxi meter showed \u20ac20.80 when we got there, then the driver fiddled with the meter and quoted \u20ac37.10, which he said was tax.

The hotel is ideally placed for Las Ramblas, the harbour and the underground station (Drassane). We were obviously lucky because the hotel was very quiet so no problems with noisey neighbours.

The place is hard to find, and we stumbled upon it sort of randomly. The service was always polite and adequate, and we had no problems with check-in or check-out. The room was good-sized, with a small couch and double bed, and the bathroom was big compared to what we were expecting. Location is great - close to La Rambla if that's what you're going for, but also a couple blocks off of it and close to the more laid-back restaurants and bars, too. They also had free WiFi, and they let us borrow an adaptor for our laptop. I'd say that I like the room size (big) best and liked the sound-proofing of the room least - we didn't have a problem with street noise, but you can hear absolutely everything in the hallway, so if neighbors come home late you will know it.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Canton", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d634631-Reviews-Hotel_Canton-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$55 - $127*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Nou de Sant Francesc 40</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "634631", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/3/8/5/3/113583/113583.jpg"}}
