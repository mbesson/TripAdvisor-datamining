The rooms are huge (apartments, with a kitchen area), and clean and modern. There are two TV's, a seperate bedroom, and cleaning is great. The breakfast buff\u00e9 is OK, nothing special. More western style breakfast wouldn't hurt... But that's nothing I can complain about. Lots of fresh fruit, which is awesome. Service was OK, they were helpful when we asked for help. The pool on the roof is excellent when it's a hot day in Dubai and you don't have the nergy to take the cab to the beach. It's clean and a nice chill-out area. However, during our stay, they performed some work in the pool area, and it was closed for some days. They compensated it by directing us to another nearby hotel, also with a pool on the roof. That's good service. The location is not that good however. It's not that far from the metro (both red and green line), and around the metro there are some convinience stores and restaurants. But to get to the new modern Dubai (the Malls, and the Marina), it's a 20 min ride with the Metro. And to get to the old parts, you can walk (~20 min), or take a cab. But its not 'around the corner'. The area where the hotel is located is mostly full of other hotesl, or apartment buildings. It's safe, but not very touristy. All in all, a good hotel, we can recommend it.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGood mid-range hotel\u201d", "Author": "bigbozfriend", "ReviewID": "UR124699810", "Content": "We specifically booked this hotel as it was a hotel apartment and it gave us more options than a usual hotel room would. Check-in was efficient, although the attendant took an age to bring us our bags. The bed was very comfortable. The bedroom portion had sufficient lighting and had two adaptors for our various plugs which is something that you do not see everyday. Both the TV in the bedroom and lounge had a variety of channels, although the reception was not good. Not sure if that is a hotel specific, or Dubai specific problem. The bathroom was spacious, had sufficient cupboard space and storage for bags. The shower was not great, more a dribble than a flow. The overall room was tidy, but a bit dated. We enjoyed having a mini kitchen, with fridge, microwave, sink etc. The reception were helpful in arranging excursions and taxis. The location to a Spinneys and the Burjuman Mall was good, but obviously further to get to the other spots. Taxis are cheap and plentiful so that was not a problem. The only real gripe we had was that we booked and paid for a room with a balconey. We did not get one, despite management saying they would move us. They also said that there is no price difference, although their website showed there was a small AED25 per day difference. If this could have been resolved, I would have been happier. The pool on top of the roof is clean and we enjoyed some time there. There is also a jacuzzi there and that was good. We had room service the one evening which was fine.

This area of Bur Dubai, heavily populated with hotels, between Kuwait Street and the busy Khalid Bin Al Waleed Road looks to me more like a residential quarter. It is a quiet neighborhood where you can find a variety of shops within a walking distance, from the Burjuman Mall to Spinneys supermarkets. Two metro stations are also nearby: Al Karama and Khalid Bin Al Waleed. The hotel is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport. The check-in was smooth and the staff friendly, particularly the employee who cleaned my room. My apartment was spacious with a bedroom separated by a sliding door from the living-room and a well equipped kitchenette. The bed was comfortable and the room very quiet although overlooking the street with a balcony. The kitchenette included an electric four plate stove, a microwave, a toaster, an electric kettle, a fridge and a washing-machine. Everything I could possibly want for a one week stay. In addition to 2 flat TVs there is a free wired internet connection with a reasonable speed in the rooms. The only flaw I could find was in the bathroom. The hand basin towel rack does not exist and the towels hang over the bathtub so that I had to stretch over the tub to reach them. I presume that the position of the towel rack is intended for tall people (which is not may case) but even though I fail to see the logic of it! Other than this minor flaw, I had a wonderful and peaceful stay at the Savoy Suites at a fairly reasonable price for Dubai standards.

We rented a 2 bedroom apartment with 1 extra bed (they charged us for the 2 extra people, which was expected). They held our passports to scan these which was a bit weird but returned it promptly afterwards. The apartments were easy to find and located in a quiet neighborhood in Bur Dubai (10 mins walk from Burjuman mall and metro station and about 15-20 mins from Meena Bazaar). It tooks us about 15 mins by cab from the airport and 10-15 mins by cab from most major attractions. The check in was smooth and the hotel staff especially Mr. Usman were very friendly and greeted us warmly with fresh juice and dates. They initially offered us a smoking suite and took a few hours to change it to non-smoking, but offered complimentary tea and coffee. The rooms were nice and spacious. The living room was smaller with a small kitchenette. There were 2 flat screen TV's, a small balcony, 2 large bathrooms. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. There was a gas stove, microwave, dishwasher, basic dinnerware and cutlery, coffee machine, hairdryer etc. The staff provided personal attention each time, addressing us with our names. We used the rooftop pool and jacuzzi which was very nice. These were not heated but we didn't mind as it was quite hot that day. There was a gym and separate sauna/steam rooms for men and women. The restaurant/cafe was quite good but a bit expensive (35 Aed for breakfast) compared to local standards. We ate out most of the times (lots of excellent cheaper Indian and other restaurants in meena bazaar). They also offered a complimentary fruit basket with great quality fresh fruits and water bottles on the first day. The room service was prompt and housekeeping was offered daily. They provided basic toiletteries and equipments and overall, we were happy and satisfied with the value. Free shuttle was available every morning to Jumeirah beach and the metro station.

We travelled with Mercury Direct and the choice of hotel options for the Dubai stopover seemed limited so we went for one with reasonable reviews. The hotel is really more of a 'base' than a holiday destination in it's own right. It has very clean and cool lobby with a cafe area which serves at the breakfast area also (breakfast is OK - not a huge amount of choice and some strange options due to the lack of bacon/pork, etc as Dubai is a Muslim country, but good enough). First impressions of the room was very positive - there is a large lounge/kitchenette area and then a bedroom area further in. The bed was extremely comfortable after an exhausting, and very hot, day in Dubai. The bathroom was clean and tidy. The air conditioning worked very well and another 'must' for Dubai. It's VERY HOT outside. There are 2 LCD TVs in the room, but rather limited channel choices. There is a fridge (good to keep cool water in) and a hob if needed. The gym up on the roof is small, as is the pool (not much more than a plunge pool really), and seems a little bit of an afterthought when the hotel was built, but as I said, this hotel isn't a 'holiday destination' and more of a 'base' to explore from. We only had 2 full days in Dubai but packed a lot in: The old town area is worth a visit, but seemed rather deserted when we were there, and the museum is also quite good with a look at the history of Dubai (plus it's air conditioned in parts!). The spice souk was disappointing, and the gold souk is full of shops and shops of gold and all a bit overwhelming - we found a small watch shop and got 2 very nice Swiss watches at a very good price. The trip across the Dubai creek on the boat taxis is an interesting experience, just be ready to jump off at the other end! An evening dhow cruise (they pick up from the hotel) was a lovely way to spend an evening with very good food (air conditioned, again!) but rather mediocre entertainment. Dune bashing in a 4x4 out in the desert + dinner at the bedouin village (complete with belly dancers) was also great fun. If you like water parks, then Wild Wadi is worth a visit - not quite on the scale of Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon in Orlando, but some entertaining water rides.

The hotel is perfect for this short break being only ten minutes from the airport which I thought to be comfortable and very fairly priced.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "International traveler", "Title": "\u201cBetter places to stay\u201d", "Author": "Dave2749", "ReviewID": "UR7427377", "Content": "I have been required to stay at the Savoy Hotel Apartments on and off since early 2006. Our company dictated that we stay at this hotel since they were picking up the tab. My last stay there was in March 2007. I've stayed there approximately 6 times. I've read several of the reviews and I wonder if the people who wrote the reviews actually have stayed at this same property. Let's go down the list. The service is average. The food would have to be considered average to below average. If you miss the standard meal times, good luck getting a hot meal served in a reasonable amount of time. The rooms-below average by Dubai standards. Think Motel 6 with a tile floor instead of carpet. The pool, again, think Motel 6. It's located on the roof but is extremely small, the lounge chairs very cheap, no decorations or scenery to speak of and the adjacent gym is a tiny room by any standard. We have been lobbying our company to switch hotels for us now since our first stay at the Savoy Apartment Hotel and we just received news that our efforts may have finally paid off. We will be switching in the near future and we are ALL happy for that. Dubai simply has too many nice hotels in a similar price range to stay at this very bland and impersonal property. I'm usually not this critical and am definitely not a \"nitpicker\" but after repeated stays here, I can't wait to switch to a different property.", "Date": "April 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGive this a try..you'll be surprised\u201d", "Author": "ChrisGilbert", "ReviewID": "UR5223959", "Content": "We have just returned from a magnificent 5 nights in Dubai and I can honestly say that the staff at the Savoy Hotel apartments made it all the better. We chose this accomodation based on the reviews that fellow travellers had written and given that we were wary of staying on Jumaireh beach with its vast construction work going on. We arrived early morning after an overnight flight from the uk and were allowed to check in immediately.We were greeted with fresh juice and complimentary bottled water in the room. The studio apartment had washing machine, cooking facilities,iron together with the normal hotel room facilities. Breakfast was included in the price and this was well presented and plentiful. The staff while extremely attentive were not obtrusive and went about their roles to ensure the visitor was made to feel special. The rooftop pool was a marvellous retreat to cool off and often we were the only people there - bliss! There was little noise and no major construction work surrounding the hotel. If you don't want to stay on the beach give this little gem a try...you'll be glad you did - we were.", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA decent hotel with good value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4549966", "Content": "This hotel isn't the fanciest in Dubai, but it is clean, safe and located in a good spot.
