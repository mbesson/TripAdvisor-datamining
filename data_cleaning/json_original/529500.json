The hotel is a nightmare - dingy dismal cramped rooms, dirty bedding and the staff - well what can I say! Apart from a helpful German lady on reception on the evening of our arrival, the rest were a nightmare! They were actually threatening and aggressive to me, in front of my family and demanded that I pay for my booking (which I had already done!). They then stated that they had not confirmed my booking and had no rooms available. When I produced my confirmation (received by e-mail from the hotel directly) they had egg on their faces. No-one spoke English and I was fortunate that I speak German - God help anyone who has the bad luck to stay at this hotel and doesn't! This hotel should be closed down immediately - it is the worst place I have ever stayed in and the worst service I have ever received. It is also situated in the middle of nowhere with no transport links close by. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU STAY AT THIS HOTEL - IT IS NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Framingham, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOK for 30 euros\u201d", "Author": "Yigal", "ReviewID": "UR5625029", "Content": "The location is far from center: you'll have to walk 10 minutes to the U-Bahn, then take a ride of 40 minutes (change the trains once).
