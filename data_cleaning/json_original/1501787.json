Reviews were mixed for this hotel but this hotel was the best we could afford and seemed to be one of the few that had comfortable beds which is a must for me! At 130/140 euros a night though it didn't come cheap but then it is a 4 star hotel on one of the most expensive streets in Barcelona. Positives: In an ideal location for exploring Barcelona - very nice cafe 2 doors down Caffe de Francesco which I highly recommend for wonderful coffee and magdalenas Very comfortable bed and pillows Negatives: Unfortunately they have thought only of the modern aspects and not though about the practical aspects - wooden flooring in the communal areas meant when people came back late at night you could hear the clunking of the shoes on the floor - especially bad were the high heel wearers! This meant that I never got a good night's sleep at all whilst at this hotel. To run a bath you had to get right into the bath to access the taps as there was a massive sink unit and shower screen in the way. Bath was a porcelain bath - extremely slippy and I had to have my husband help me out of it - this would be no good for older people - to be honest is an accident waiting to happen! The bathroom doesn't have a proper door - sliding doors so not very private when somebody is in there and in the bedroom the door is a mirror/door that you slide across - this doesn't block any noise out at night from the corridors! Lighting - very annoying - you can dim it and turn it up but it doesn't go that high so putting on make up etc is very difficult in the morning. Only a small desk provided - not much storage space at all and the few hangers in the wardrobe leave a lot to be desired - we had to place our cloths on the small sofa near the window as there was no room for them! Tea and coffee facilities provided but these are charged for! Breakfast 18.50 euro each per day - absolutely unbelievable - we went out for breakfast every day - 2 coffees and 2 croissants = 8 euros total. On our last night we discovered on returning to our hotel that our room had ants in it - my husband immediately went to the desk to report this and somebody did attend the room - he said to my husband that the maids had told them about this in the morning but they hadn't bothered to do anything about it and we were not made aware of it so by the evening it had gotten bad! On checking out no mention of the ants and we weren't even asked if we had had a good stay. Overall I was very disappointed with this hotel - I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends and family and wouldn't stay again.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201c10-rated hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Vladimir_from_Moscow", "ReviewID": "UR126757121", "Content": "We've spent lovely 3 days at SixtyTwo Hotel with my wife and it was one of the best experiences we've ever had. Only facts (as they arise upon arrival): 1. If you arrive to Barcelona airport, take a train, exit at Passeig de Gracia, 10 steps more and you are at the entrance of the hotel. It takes you 3.60 euro and around 25 minutes. 2. We took executive double room and it was right decision, because it faces Passeig de Gracia, beautiful street with nice view. A sea to the left, mountains to the right, old and at the same time modern Barcelona in front. There is a nice balcony, from which you can enjoy the view. 3. The room itself is modern and everything is brand new there. It's not huge, but enough for everything you need, if you don't expect it to be junior suite. 4. The bathroom is also great - all the technics works perfectly, the water pressure and temperature regulations work, like you are at home, without any problems. There is a big shower cabin (about 1m x 0.8m), a bath and a toilet. 5. A couple of words about lightning system. It is operated via smart-home system. Very easy to use, and what is really amazing is that you can create very chill-out atmosphere in the room dimming the lights. 6. If you book from the hotel's site, you can also book a bottle of Champaigne, which will be ready by your visit. Add this to chill-out atmosphere from previous point and you can really relax. 7. During the night the sound insolation is great - the noise on the street is quite high, but if you close the windows, it becomes very quiet in the room. Not a recording studio, but absolutely enough to feel relaxed. 8. The breakfasts are far better, than in standard hotels. You have different types of yogurts, meats, cheeses, cakes etc plus you can order one of 4 types of dishes from the kitchen. 3 of them are different tasty omelettes plus smoked salmon with Mascarpone and other stuff... 9. The hotel is also perfectly situated in the city. Passeig de Gracia has all the high brands shops one can imagine, it is 5 minutes walk from Rambla and other central (tourist of course) places. 10. Wifi is quite fast and free. It was possible to chat over Facetime, so good enough. The only thing I missed was a table for working, which is a norm at business hotels. But this hotel is definitely much more for relax and having fun, than for work. 11. For the stuff. Usually one can read, that 'the stuff was very helpful\" etc. I can't say anything regarding this - we didn't have any problems and so didn't need any help. The check in and out took a couple of minutes, the guys at restauraunt during breakfast also were fast and positive. As a sum-up - if you are looking for a good mood, good impressions and high quality service, I would really recommend this hotel.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cTriumph of design over comfort\u201d", "Author": "Sandra Levine", "ReviewID": "UR126681523", "Content": "The pros: location, location, location comfortable bed big, clean bathroom The cons: No comfortable chair, only a desk chair placed in a corner away from a laptop computer desk that was also used as a coffee-making station, etc. Inadequate space for clothing for a stay of longer than a couple of days. There were some small built-in shelves in the closet, but I had to use the safe as an additional drawer. Weird half hangers in the closet and not enough of those. The norm is one facecloth, despite the fact that two people were registered for the room. After requesting another from management, on some days we received an extra one. Zombie-like service at reception desk. My husband's wallet was pickpocketed in the metro. We asked for new room keycards, which we received, but not even with a comment along the lines of, \"That's too bad,\" or, \"I'm sorry you had that experience.\" We checked out the night before, without any comment from the desk, nor was there any comment when we left the next morning, like, \"I hope you had a nice stay.\" We had been there for eight nights. Don't these people know that they are in the \"hospitality\" business. I don't expect genuine hospitality in a hotel, but aren't they supposed to create the illusion of it? The hotel was nowhere near full during the week we were there. In other cases where we've had a similar situation, we were upgraded, but not here. When we asked for more hangers and another facecloth, we got strange looks, as if these were peculiar requests. I understand that part of this attitude is a display of hipness, considering the hotel, but older, seasoned travelers may want to look elsewhere.

Overall, the experience was a very positive one and we had a most enjoyable stay. The location was perfect - right on the main shopping street; very convenient for transport, access to the main sights and for shopping and pavement cafes without being too noisy. We were between two fabulous Gaudi buildings and walking distance from the Ramblas and the port (a longer walk, this one), with buses and taxis available right outside. The hotel itself was beautifully decorated, new and contemporary in style, although perhaps trying to be a bit too clever - the lighting in the bedrooms was far too complicated, the blinds so bleeding edge that they weren't reliable and no curtains to keep out the street lights when they didn't work. The bed was very comfortable and the balcony overlooking the main street a nice bonus. The bathroom in our room was large, with bath and separate shower cubicle. Toiletries, mini-bar, tea and coffee suppliers were all replenished daily. Our friends' room was at the back of the hotel, overlooking an interior courtyard - not such an attractive outlook but the room itself seemed larger - there was more seating within the room. The bathroom was slightly smaller. Nonetheless an attractive and comfortable room. Breakfasts were excellent - buffet style in a club-type room on the first floor - with very fresh produce and a wide range. The same room was used in the evening as a lounge, and with laptops available for internet access. I understand that the hotel now offers free wifi too. There was also an honesty bar, which was a very nice touch - just a pity the reception desk didn't have the same prices as were displayed on the bar when it came to paying the bill, but this was quickly sorted out with no fuss. The staff individually were generally very helpful and good natured both before our arrival and during our stay. We were really happy with the restaurant recommendations and bookings were made for us for restaurants and taxis with no fuss. The only criticism I would have would be over attention to detail, and handover between shifts. As it was our friends; wedding anniversary I wanted to arrange a treat for them in advance. The hotel had offered a bottle of Cava during an email conversation so I arranged for some flowers to be delivered and put in their room. On our arrival, the flowers were there but no sign of the Cava, even after 24 hours. However, after a gentle reminder the Cava was delivered, accompanying by some delicious chocolates and a delightful message left on the mirror! The most significant issue we had was with our room - on arrival neither the blinds nor the safe worked. Because of an absence of proper handover between shifts it too until the third day and several reminders to get moved (the problem with the blinds was not easily solved). Eventually, after first offering us a pokey corner room which we refused, we were begrudgingly upgraded as there were no other rooms equivalent to our original one available. Credit has to go to Hakim, who, unlike the receptionist on duty at the time, knew how to handle this kind of situation, moved our luggage for us, made sure we were happily settled and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine in recognition of the upheaval. Things do go wrong with equipment, that is understood - I only really have two complaints about this issue - there appeared to be no handover between shifts and we started from scratch each morning; and one member of the reception staff didn't appear to want to offer any alternatives when they found the problem with the blind was going to take some time to solve. I gather from the hotel management that they have looked at the handover process to address this issue - I am impressed that they took the trouble to email me after our visit in response to the feedback I left when we returned home. In summary, we had a lovely stay at the hotel; we were very happy with almost everything and I would have no hesitation in returning, or in recommending it to others. I also think it's good value for money. Indeed, I have booked clients into the hotel for their wedding anniversary in March 2012, prior to their departure on a cruise from Barcelona port, and I know they will be as satisfied as we were. And we will definitely return.

There are lots of nice places to eat in general though as you walk towards the city centre and a McDonalds 5 mins away (no hot breakfast menu when I went)...good for a coffee fix. I couldn't find a local place for bottled water and snacks but this seems like Barcelona in general, not many stores/kiosks in tourist areas like I am use to so I ended up having to walk to the department store 20 minutes away for snacks and drinks before it closed.

His work required us to stay at a different hotel for the second half of our trip (Barcelo Sants). I booked Hotel SixtyTwo based largely on the recommendations/reviews found on TripAdvisor, and I must admit that I found them a bit misleading. The hotel's location is, by far, its best selling point. It's located equidistant between Casa Mila and Casa Batllo, and only about a fifteen-minute walk from Sagrada Familia. Lots of designer, high-end shopping on Passeig de Gracia as is the subway/underground stop if you wish to explore other neighborhoods. We were in Room 210, all the way at the end of the hallway on the second floor. In our days at the hotel, we did not run into a single other guest at the hotel. Though December is not high season for travel to Barcelona, we was a bit surprised. Our room was as pictures indicate -- low, platform king bed with a couch annexed off with tall windows, a closet hidden by a heavy mirrored door. The safe and minibar refrigerator is inside the closet; please note the safe is VERY small (too small to fit my iPad -- had to carry it the entire time in my purse). The TV is, also, quite small (23\"?), and, as we discovered on this trip, the channels for foreigners are limited as there are only four English language channels (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, BBC News). On demand television is a pipe dream! As I noted in the title of this review, the hotel nickels-and-dimes you for everything. Wireless internet for 24 hours is 12 euros (free at our other hotel), each bottle of water is 3 euros, even the espresso pods for the Nespresso machine in the hotel room cost 1.5 euros each. I have never stayed at a hotel that charged to use a coffeemaker/espresso machine in individual rooms. Never. We had credit from Hotels.com for a free night that made the cost of our two-night stay very affordable ($230 total instead of $400+). Without that credit, the hotel most definitely would not have been worth the price indicated. The location was convenient for exploring the city, but there were not other advantages that warrant the cost. We would not recommend the hotel to family or friends traveling to Barcelona, and should we return to Barcelona for a leisure trip in the future, I would book a major brand hotel (Mandarin Oriental, Ritz, etc) for that stay.

The location is great if you are in barcelona to shop or if you intend on using the metro a lot. The staff was very helpful with all of our needs.

We asked the front desk about it and they said they were expecting us to check out. We explained that we had mistakenly thought we were scheduled for 5 nights. They instantly renewed us for 1 additional night at the same rate. The entire exchange/mixup took less than 10 mins to resolve. I was a bit embarrassed about the mistake but they were more than happy to accommodate us.

Same hotel, same staff, but a visibly smaller room at the back of the building. We had requested, and had actually been looking forward to the same or a similar balcony room as that given to us during our first stay considering that we were \"return customers\" so to speak, but unfortunately, this was not to be. The hotel management may have had its reasons for this (we were told that they were fully booked and that the rooms with balconies were not available) but our second stay was a real letdown.

The negatives on this hotel consisted of two major things and one possible misunderstanding. First the misunderstanding... I left a nice tip with a note asking for an extra large towel, as I use two just for myself. I didn't get it, but that could have been a mistake. The fact that we had to pay for wifi in this day and age is bad enough, but you must pay 12 euros, each day, for EACH UNIT. Laptop? 12 euros. Smartphone? 12 euros, iPad? 12 euros. I mean, that is just absolutely ridiculous, and insults me as a guest. I didn't complain about having to pay for each of the nespresso coffees, and I wouldn't have complained about the wifi had it not been for the 12 euro, per unit charge. The other problem I had was with one of the front desk clerks. He worked the day shift, and was just so smug and arrogant. He offered his service, but lacked concern for anything that did not interest him. I know the folks at the hotel read these critiques, and I'm certain they will know which man I speak of. The one other guy who was working with him there, on the day we checked out, was such a nice guy. I wish I knew his name. He had darker skin, and a great smile.

One other tip - most of the taxi drivers had never heard of this hotel and struggled to locate it, even when we gave them the exact address. Our friends arrived at 2am and the taxi driver gave up and asked them to get out the cab further down the road! If this happens, ask the cab driver to drop you off at the Hotel Majestic on Passeig de Gracia. That's a massive hotel and about 4-5 doors down from No sixty two.

None of my expectations came true. The late shift concierges were not at all interested in their guests. They were just hanging around in the lobby, and not understanding my issues. Firstly I booked a non-smoking room, but there was none, and the receptionist said, I should open the window. Bummer. The one who guided me to my room did not even know what to show me upstairs. He was a funny one - lost in space. The rooms are spacious, that's true. And I guess some time ago it's been a modern, state-of-art environment - but once I stepped into the bathroom I was disgusted. The shower was so mouldy, I could hardly breathe. I've never been in such a messed up shower room. It was quite offending, to offer this kind of place for money. The same receptionist said: he wouldn't understand my problem, there'd be a tub too, and I could simply close the shower and now use it. Well, that's a strange perpective. The replacement room they wanted to give me for one night (and then move again), had other service issues, I doubt that the bathroom's floor's been cleansed before me checking in. The next night (after talking to the supervisor) I stayed in another room - no shower (only tub) but everything's been a bit sticky and worn-off. A shame because you could clearly see that somebody invested a chunk of money in this hotel. Given the great location some people might enjoy staying here.

Pros: good location right at the Passeig de Gracia metro stop, close to several Gaudi sights and in the middle of the Eixample area, however, about a 15 min walk to the top of Las Ramblas and the beginning of the old town. We would take the metro back (although only 2 stops) after a day of walking around down there. Staff very helpful and friendly, we got several wonderful restaurant recommendations!

We ended up taking a taxi back to the airport, which was about 30euro.

For our arrival, we took the Aerobus from the airport to the Placa for 5 Euros each and walked to the hotel. As we arrived very early and on a Sunday, our rooms weren't ready yet, but they stored our luggage and gave us a map & tourist booklet and sent us on our way. If you are looking for this hotel on Google Earth from the photo-Street View layers, it is located between the green Casa del Libre bookstore awnings. As this is a photo from last year, the Hotel Sixtytwo awnings are not visible. We found this hotel on Expedia, and got a good rate for Sunday-Thursday. We watched the prices go up, up, up for Friday/Saturday then they were sold out for those days. I believe there was a large trade show in town that ate up a lot of rooms for the weekend. Our room was on the street side, and had a view of Gaudi's Casa Batllo', which was charmingly lit at night. Had seen some notes of complaint about street noise. Um, seriously? Through that double paned insulated glass? Hardly. There were electronic room-darkening blinds which we only used one night, as they really made the room dark and I prefer light in the morning to so I can haul myself out of bed to start sightseeing at a reasonable hour. The small balcony had a lovely wrought iron railing. Our room for Sun-Thurs. was # 402, and was quite spacious and nicely decorated. The bathroom was the largest I have seen in a European city hotel. Everything was very modern, and the toiletries were of nice quality. There was a tub with a detachable shower spray, typical of what we have seen in nicer hotels in Europe. Was I going to splash all over the place as usual? Yep. Can't get the hang of those things! But wait! there was a hidden shower room that was a dedicated shower with a door! Awesome! No more splashing around! The bathroom had a large sink and vanity area, and a short roll-away set of shelves for storage. Then a closed off toilet room and the shower room, both with a shared sliding door, and the tub. We had a queen size bed and a useful low shelf about 2 feet wide running the entire width at the foot of the bed. Generous closet space, mini bar/fridge, safe, funny orange chair, and a desk that we did not use. The lobby was not large, but bright and always attended. The cleaning times varied from about 10-5. There was a breakfast buffet available, but we did not use this service. It was abuot 20 Euro per person, and we prefered a smaller meal. On the first floor (2nd floor for Americans), there was an open lounge, 2 computers for general use, and an honesty bar. You were welcome to have drinks and just write down your room number, and they would add it to your bill. The breakfast buffet was served here also. We had to wait a few times for the computers to be free, but with a lovely lounge overlooking the Passeig de Gracia, it was hardly a bother. The hotel is right next to a metro entrance- the large Passeig de Gracia station. As Friday/Saturday were at first beyond our budget and then full, we moved to a different hotel for those nights. Unfortunately, due to the closure of the Barcelona Airport for part of our departure day, we were stuck in Barcelona for an extra day, and we returned Here to Hotel Sixtytwo. I say stuck, since we had to trudge back into town with no hotel or really a clear picture of what we were supposed to do with ourselves of for how long. The airline gave us an estimated departure time of 5 days later! We booked for one night, and it eventually turned out that was all we needed. Our second room was on the 3rd floor facing the back courtyard. It was smaller, no separate shower room, no shelf at the end of the bed, but what must have been a large balcony was converted into a small room with a fabulous and deep room-width couch thingy. This was perfect for our day of confusion, as we ended up spending most of the day on the couch. A couple of notes- The satellite TV was iffy, sometimes you got all the channels, sometimes some of the channels, sometimes none of the channels. The second room had A/C problems, and we couldn't get the temperature to regulate, despite several attempts from the front desk staff. I believe this was a known problem, and they did try to adjust it for us. In April it was bearable. In August? Perhaps not. This hotel is under new management within the past year, and they have done a lovely job. It is 4 Stars, and really- the location is wonderful- so close to the metro! There are great restaurants around, and it is in close proximity to the Casa Battlo, La Pedrera and the interesting Antoni Tapies Foundation. We especially enjoyed the Cerveceria Catalunya for tapas. We paid $162 USD per night for the 5 nights we were there. Rates higher on weekends and when they are more booked up I suppose. We paid $240 USD for that extra night at the end for a smaller room on the back. Wi Fi was 12 Euro per day, so we did not hook up to that, prefering to use the lounge computers for free or the cafe a few doors down had free wi-fi. We really liked this hotel, and would stay again at the $162 USD rate. That was a bargain for this class hotel in this neighborhood on this street. The $240 rate was more typical for what you would see right around here. The area is filled with every sort of lodging from cheap hostels to fabulous 5 Star wonders. We certainly don't fit into either of those extreme categories, and were very happy at Hotel Sixtytwo. Oh- all the front desk staff spoke English and were always polite. I think once word gets out about this hotel it will not only be more difficult to get a room, but you won't be able to get any rates under $200 USD. Book now! There are maybe 45 or so rooms.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPlanned visit during volcano incident\u201d", "Author": "Pstephe1", "ReviewID": "UR62989957", "Content": "I had a terrible experience with this hotel during the above incident. I emailed asking if there was any flexibility around the cancellation policy and reveived no reply. I called and was informed that there was no flexibility, I then tried to re-arrange for a later date but despite numerous phone calls and emails could not get a confirmation of this booking. I decided to cancel And book with another hotel, they have not even had the courtesy to email me back to confirm my cancellation.

The sound proofing is perfect, while the room faced Paseig del Gracia we didn't hear any noise at all. CD player, flat screen TV, very comfortable bed... The reception was very friendly and helpful and the complimetary wine tasting on Friday night was fun.
