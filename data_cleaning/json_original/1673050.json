This is a good place if you having reasonable expectations in relation to what you are paying for. The motel have three main areas: ground floor rooms, first floor rooms and outside rooms. Consider the latter if you want privacy as they can be access by the parking lot without been seen (but less safer). The motel is located in a so so area, but it is not a problem if you are with you own or rented car. It is not the place to go if you plan to go for a walk at night, but Miami is like that: without a car you are not going anywhere. With a car, the location is quite convenient. You're like in the middle of everything: Miami Beach, Sawgrass, Downtown, Airport are all withing reasonable driving times. The place has a nice modern design, despite being far from cool and frankly speaking done with standard to cheap materials. The room was reasonable clean and personally I have not experience the rude attitude by the staff. As a matter of fact they have been rather helpful and also one of the girls at the front desk is very pretty also. The motel also have a nice common area where you can meet other people or even have meals so no need to pay for a restaurants. Good for young people but not for those looking for a quite place. The staff is very fluent both in English and Spanish. Probably, the main two significant cons of the motel is the wi-fi coverage, good in the common areas but bad in the rooms, and low ventilation of the rooms. All the windows have fixed panels so can't be open, and this generate some humidity problems (not very serious but important for some). Regarding the wi-fi, it is not something of this motel: for some reason wi-fi coverage in many hotels (even high scale) is very bad when now this service is essential and very cheap to provide. A third contrary could be a below average breakfast. Self service coffee, yoghurt and juices, which are nice, but only donuts for eating. Adding some bread slices and biscuits could be great for a better experience. The issue with the deposit for the remote is usual in places like this in Latin America, so it is not such an issue. Don't expect a Hilton's room or a great breakfast in a $80/day motel. Overall, it is a good place for male solo or group travellers for a couple of nights, or for young women or couples in a budget provided are not looking for any luxury. Definetly, it is a below 35 years place, pointed towards youngers.

What do people expect for such a low price? The Hyatt this is not. But for the money and the location, you will not, you should not, be disappointed. If you are, then you really should book something that does not have \"motel\" in the name. The motel is a smart, tidy little art deco style place, right on Biscayne Blvd. There are two parts to the motel, one being an old school, drive up to your door motel, and the other, a traditional 2 story, wrapped around a courtyard. The place has a look of a recent remodel. Clean and bright, with tile floors, orange deco walls and unique wall hangings and furniture in the lobby. The desk clerk was polite and efficient. The check in process hassle free. I was given a corner unit, in the front, facing Biscayne. If you are sensitive to traffic noise, this is not the room for you. If you are a city dweller already, this is a great room. Nice windows looking onto Biscayne. A wrap around terrace, private to the room. The floors are tile. The furnishings older in appearance. The TV, small and old school. The bathroom was clean and tidy. The bed was firm and the pillows sufficient. The courtyard is beautiful. There are nice patio furnishings to lounge about on. There is a coffee counter and daily breakfast is served, utilizing this courtyard space. It is intimate and a great spot to gather and chill, or meet fellow travelers, if that is your thing. The breakfast was OK, typical offerings from pretty much any motel/hotel. Dunkin' Donuts, cereal, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee. I did appreciate that the hours for breakfast were more in line with a vacationing schedule, from 8-11am, vs 6-9 at most other locations. This allowed for a decent selection, even if you came downstairs at 9am. My issues with the place were few. The lighting in the rooms is in need of upgrade. There are two table lamps, and that is it. So nighttime is dim and early mornings as well. There are no plugs in the bathroom. There is no shampoo or other \"normal\" amenities in the room, like a clock. I also found it odd that there is a deposit required for the room key and TV remote. I could understand if this was an \"hourly\" motel, or I was somehow, sketchy looking. I did not have the $10 cash required, and was given a pass at registration. However, at 10:15pm, there was a knock on my door, with the desk clerk looking to see if I got cash. I did not, and never paid the deposit. Not sure why this is required, and how $10 could replace either product if it went missing. Just a weird policy and a bit off. The Internet connectivity was spotty, at best. I went hours without getting solid connectivity. I saw repeaters placed in the courtyard, but perhaps a couple more are needed. All in all, this is a great value for the money. It is clean, safe feeling and the whole staff seemed nice. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to get into Miami Downtown, South Beach or Aventura. I went to all of these locations and they are all convenient and close. Again, I wonder what some expect, but this met my expectations and exceeded in some respects.

Overall the motel is value for money, a nice comfortable stay for less than a week or so.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cReservation Mistakes, Lies and No Apologies\u201d", "Author": "chri5tina", "ReviewID": "UR89336990", "Content": "I made the reservation online and requested a non-smoking room. When I arrived I was given a smoking room (complete with awful stench and ash trays). When I asked at the front desk to have my room switched, I was told that the rooms were all full, so I would have to talk to the administration in the morning. To be fair the rooms were clean and it is a pretty courtyard. Water flow in the show was low but there was enough hot water. However, you have to put a $10 cash deposit to get the TV remote and there are no phones in the rooms (I had to use my cell to call the front desk). The thing that absolutely ruined my stay was when we checked out. Since I'm allergic to smoke I felt terrible in the morning, and I went to the front desk to ask for a discount on my stay. The girl at the front desk went to ask, and came back to tell me no, the room I stayed in IS non-smoking. I asked about the smell and the ash tray, and how could she pretend it was a non-smoking room, and she said the ash tray was to take out to the patio to smoke. I felt to awful to argue, but I probably would've have gotten into \"Do you think I'm stupid?\" pretty fast. It's been remodeled to look pretty, but the rooms are pretty ghetto, no frills is just a nice way to say it, but it is clean. I probably would have given it a tolerable rating if it weren't for the way I was treated, which was absolutely appalling.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "22312", "Title": "\u201croach problem\u201d", "Author": "nina_hermosa", "ReviewID": "UR88783781", "Content": "The staff was super nice and friendly, so I was hesitant to leave a bad review, but I think it's fair to warn other travelers.

Near a lot of fast food places and our event was only 5 min away which was great. Also the renovation was just like in the pics no false hopes we got just what we saw in the photos which is a plus and trustful, staff were friendly always opening the door for us it was a perfect experience, and as i said in the title it was killing hot outside so the ac worked MARVELOUS it really saved us.

We go to check in and the girl at the front had a very nasty little tude. We were then informed that we had to pay a 5.00 deposit for the remote to the tv... a little silly but we did anyways. We go to the room and the door wouldnt open we were informed to jiggle it around and it would open. Well it did and believe it or not the room was very well kept.

Our room had two bedside lamps (with dark lamp shades) to light the whole room, and the bathroom had one bulb in a wall sconce.

The staff was very friendly, and the hall was very nicely decorated, with cute white/orange chairs, there was a nice lounging area outside with a microwave. There are plenty of free parking spaces. Free internet is accesible in some rooms. The room was nice, I loved the little details like the toiletpaper that had the end folded in a triangle, (sounds strange, but it just looks nicer). The bed was okay, looked nice and the sheets were very clean. Room had a nice atmosphere to it, but rooms can be quite noisy since the walls are very thin. The things I would advise Motel Bianco are: *fix the things that need fixing (door, window, lamps). *clean the bathroom more accurate; although in general pretty clean, there were still some hairs in the showering area. *and very important; when you use a bleach to get those sheets as sparkling white as they are, please be sure to wash them again with a nice-smelling detergent, because the bleach smell kept me from sleeping and irritated my throat a lot.
