It is close to most of the tourist sites in Rome and it is a bit unusual. The decor is a throw back to the 1960s with black and white lucite and lots of mirrors...even on the ceiling above our bed! The room was very small and we had lots of luggage as we had been touring Italy for 3 months, so it was even more cramped. We had a juliet balcony overlooking a tiny courtyard and a vent from the restaurant that sent delicious scents up to our room when we left the balcony door open..which was almost all the time as our room was so warm. The weather was unusually warm in Rome and it was easier to open the door than to try to cool the room. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom, although small, was pretty with all its marble walls. I was a bit disappointed with the size of the room but otherwise I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The staff were wonderful and the included breakfast was amazing.

Decorated with floor to ceiling (and sometimes also the ceiling) mirrors, heavy with black marble and high-gloss cherrywood built-in cabinetry, the interior of this boutique hotel resembles the hull of a mid-rate cruise ship. The halls are narrow, small, and disorienting (due to all the reflective surfaces) and the rooms are oddly layed-out, dark, and reminiscent of what you might find on the lower deck of a Princess cruise ship. The downstairs piano bar is decorated with glittering bedazzled artwork of Marilyn Monroe and a rhinestoned leopard lays languidly over the piano itself - Michael Jackson would love this place.

Some people on here have said they thought the decor was too dark but, after a day in bright sunlight and 40 degree heat it was a cool and calm haven. We were a party of 6 - my husband, myself and my teenaged son in one triple room and my sister with her teenaged son and daughter in another; both rooms were perfectly big enough for 3 adults and we found the beds very comfortable. Some people might not like the fact that every room is different but, for us, it just added to the ambience.

The Piano Bar is stuffed with comfortable sofas and armchairs - just what you want after a hard day sightseeing!

One of the best parts for us was the extensive buffet breakfast served each morning in the breakfast room. The gentleman running the show was extremely friendly and attentive and the food on offer included: cheeses, cold meats, cereals, croissants, brioche, yoghurt, multiple juices and of course a lovely cappuccino to start the day! The only downside to our stay was that our room was located on level 5 right beneath the rooftop terrace which was apparently very popular at night! We did not go there at all but we certainly heard everything that happened up there - the music, the people, chairs scraping the floor...not good for jet lag! The price of the hotel for location and amenities was very reasonable and despite the aforementioned issue we would stay at Hotel Valadier again.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat and Magic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Luoca", "ReviewID": "UR114894230", "Content": "I often go fo business in Rome and I think that the Hotel Valadier is one the mosto beatifull and charming hotel in the magic Rome.

The breakfast was excellent. Really, the mozzarella is just amazing!)) Loved the breakfasts! Staff is very helpful, informative and friendly. The Wi-fi worked. No problems. Yes. The location is perfect. In the heart of Rome, very convenient. I also recommend the restaraunt Il Brillo Parlante - it's just outside the hotel. Excellent wine and tasty pizza! And it works till 2 in the morning, can you imagine? that's rare for Rome)) The upstairs restaurant HiRes is also opened until 2 AM. Great service and super-tasty fish.

I would personally like to thank all the hotel staff and workers for their amazing service while my wife and I spent Christmas there from San Diego, CA. We walked in and were quickly greeted with bag service, bonus right there! Juliette who checked us in, was a great help for us throughout our trip as well. Tucked between two main streets and a huge Piazza was our hotel. Sidenote: the best pizza and pasta place we had in Roma was right next to this hotel. We shared a slice on Christmas Eve with Alec Baldwin there. Also, went back again and had some amazing Tortellini. At this point I will let you find your own Pizzeria. But if you want to take my word on this: Head to Babuino, take a right, and it's the first pizzeria on the right. I believe next to an art Studio. About 50 steps from the front. Our Room was just perfect for the two of us. Great upper mirror above the bedroom, full sky TV, and hot shower. I would have to say the maid service was great as well. Our room was always clean. We dined at the IL Brillo Parlante, and a great experience for our first night. Late dining is great here as we were the only Americans dining their, in a packed room. Definetly go here for some great food at this fun Ristorante. 2 people about $60.00. Also, the continental session in the mornings was a great way to fuel up, and enjoy some delicious cured meats, bread, and cheese. The staff in the mornings was excellent and they served as Barristas by serving us Espresso's, Latte's, etc... At this point, I would like to disclose one of the hidden treasures that makes this hotel fun and that is the bar downstairs near the lobby. Let's just say I had some Vegas experience nights at this place during my stay. Smoking inside, beautiful women dancing to the tunes of a Italian Man singing: cool Jazz, slow blues, and rock hits. It felt like a scene out of the 50's. A fun night here will cost you about $75.00 bucks, but well worth it if you like to party.

The room was large enough for that amount of time and the street was very quiet. Bathroom was very clean, as modern as Rome gets, and spacious by European standards. The triple room does not have a divider between sections of the room, although the bathroom is a separate room (shower only). Service was helpful and always on time (no delays, everything as expected). The restaurant next door is great, especially for a first stop upon jet-lagged arrival. The one odd thing was the location of the room in the annex - the building literally has 2 floor 5s. We would take the elevator from the lobby, get off on 5, walk up 3 steps and down a all, through an unmarked door, up two sets of stairs, through another unmarked door and finally to our room. We never could get back through the hallway doors (which locked and didn't always have an entry slot) to go back down to the lobby--so we had to go all the way down to the first floor (via stairs) and out on to the street & turn the corner to get back into the hotel! The location of the hotel is quite nice if you want to spend a lot of time in the historic center. It's very close to Popolo and the Borghesa park (lots of green and space to walk and grab some quiet) and it's not far to the Spanish steps and major shopping & some lovely restaurants. It's a bit of a jog to ancient Rome (and of course you'll spend the whole time walking around those sites), so I suggest cabbing or grabbing the subway down & back for that trek. Same with a trip to the Vatican, especially because you have to cross through busy traffic to get there. The downside (sort of) is that the internet never worked, period.

Yes, rooms here are small - but without gut renovations, most places in Rome are sure to be similarly space-challenged. Rooms are modern and well-appointed if a bit too masculine/gentleman's boudoir for my taste (dark marble, dark wood, and the coup de grace, an octagonal mirror above the bed). Shower is good, but the hair dryer is the old-style vacuum-on-the-wall-with-no-power type. The business center is very cramped and inconvenient and in order to use the internet from the room, you first need to visit the front desk to pay up and get a password (a bit inconvenient if you've already settled in for the night). MInibar was stocked, but when I opened a bottle of white wine, it had completely spoiled (it tasted like tap water) - however, this was quickly reconciled and I was never charged. Finally, the front desk could have been more helpful in offering restaurant tips -- upon request, I was directed towards the pricy Hi-Res on the rooftop, which I opted against.

As I was puzzling over how to handle this, the waiter came over and pretty clearly decided I was trying to figure out how to get change and leave less than a twenty. So he sort of gathered up one of the the 20s, told me it was the right tip, and scurried off.

Spent a few days at the start of the week at the Valadier, then again for one night at the end of the week. The staff was good in moving around or storing our luggage if we or the luggage arrived before check-in time, and then making sure it was placed in our room once it was ready. Very conveniently located hotel. Supposedly named after Napoleon's architect. Some other reviewer described it as stylish and - although it is small - every corner has some interesting feature, and it all is put together in the manner reminiscent of the cramped but efficiently organized quality interior of an older cabin cruiser. For example, there are two elevators but one holds only two people and the other holds four. And they are not side-by-side: you have to take a twist or two thru short hallways and sudden doorways to go from one elevator to the other, and there is a lot of shiny marble walls and floors so navigating oneself from one public area to another is like being in a small but classy amusement park funhouse. If you don't pay attention you could easily wander into a unisex bathroom at the wrong time. Our first room was small, but at least you could walk around inside it without any unnatural body twisting. Our second room (501, I think) was so small that you literally could not walk around without some kind of crab-like sideways move. The bed was large, though, and comfortable. Also, 501 is just outside the stairway that leads to the lovely rooftop bar. Nice night time views of the neighborhood. Waiters were constantly positioning large propane heater towers for our comfort against the coolish Roman night. Watch out for the cost, though. For example, there were 4 people at the table next to ours, and they drank about 3 drinks apiece (mostly white russians, I believe) and the waiter mistakenly handed me their bar tab and I noticed that it came to over $200 US for those 12 or so drinks. I hope they enjoyed the ambience. Some of our group spent a rainy evening in the piano lounge and the waitstaff even came up with a lovely cake for someone in our group who was celebrating a birthday. Heard they had a great time. Not sure about handicap accessibility, since to go from the front door to the lobby you need to deal with about a half dozen marble stairs. Location of the Valadier is a block from the Plazza del Popolo (it is located on a cross-street so that you can come out the front door and either go left/left or right/right and still end up in the piazza) where several free concerts (complete with video screens) on a large temporary stage were held during our stay. Also, on the other edge of that same Piazza is a church that was featured prominently in the movie Angels and Demons (I think it opens at 6:30 every day). A block from the Piazza is the subway station. You can buy your 1 Euro subway tickets at the nearby tobacconist. The Valadier presented a nice breakfast buffet every morning at 7am, so you can eat well and get an early start on touring each day. I used the internet for a fee. I think it was 5 pounds for one hour, 8 pounds for 3 hours, or 15 pounds for 7 hours, or something like that. And as I broke up my stay between the beginning of the week and the next weekend they still allowed me to carry my unused hours forward to the second half of my stay there.

So, my expectations were not high, never having been to Rome. After staying at the Valadier for 8 days, I can definately say that I would use this hotel again. First, the staff were all excellent English speakers and more than willing to help in any way they could. Some people say that the rooms are small. We had a triple, with three people (2 adults plus 1 teen boy). The room was big enough. However, we did not stay in the room much except to sleep. With the sofa bed stowed, there was plenty of space to move around. The beds were excellent. All three beds, including the sleeper sofa, had firm, comfortable mattresses. I have chronic lower back pain, and I can say that I slept well. The linens were all high thread count Italian made. The room was also kept meticulously clean. My only negative comments are that the television set was rather small at about 30 inches, and difficult to see from across the room. The ammenities in the hotel are excellent. I particularly enjoyed the rooftop restaraunt (Hi Res). The food and staff were excellent. I can see why the local Romans frequent this place. The loaction of the hotel could not have been better. Most of the major sites were within walking distance. The Piazza del Popolo was one block from the hotel. The Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain were a 15 minute liesurely walk. The Pantheon was about the same. The walk to the Forum area was 25-30 minutes depending on your pace. The walk to the Colloseum was about 40 minutes. The Vatican was about the same, maybe 45 minutes. We were not power walking. Also, there is a taxi station and a bus stop in the Piazza del Popolo, it you do not wish to walk. There were many restaraunts and shops. The night life was very active, with streets crowded well past midnight. Most of the street level restaraunts near the hotel had sidewalk seating. We sampled maybe a dozen different eating establishments in the neighborhoo. I can say that the atmosphere was polite. The Italians are more than willing to let you sit for 2 hours or more for dinner. This is very different from the US, where they always seems to be pushing you out the door.

Mistook location of Valadier as thought it was closer to via Condotti near the Spanish Steps. The hotel describes its situation as being between Spanish Steps and Piazza Popolo - sort of bending the truth a bit as it IS really between the two but about 20 yards from Popolo and 4-500 metres from the Steps. However, it was a good location and we certainly weren't bothered by the noise even though we stayed Thursday and Friday nights. Our main concern about noise related to an air conditioning unit directly situated on top of room 301, so whatever you do, dont accept 301 because it will probably keep you awake all night, and especially if you cant work out where its coming from it will drive you mad trying to find out - well, at least it did me in. When I asked the next morning the response was an immediate transfer to room 402, so they must be entirely aware of the problem. 402 had one of the fabled mirrored ceilings and when I was at reception (without the missus) the next morning the receptionist asked in a deadpan sort of way how much we'd enjoyed the room. I could swear there was the inkling of a twinkle in her eyes. Anyway.........onwards. We found the second room adequate, though tiny, especially the bathroom, but then we werent there for a luxurious stay, just to enjoy Rome and have somewhere clean and OK to sleep, which the Valadier suited well. Drinks at the bar are very expensive and I wouldnt recommend it - just pop out and take a walk. Breakfast was very good with aq decent selection of good fresh breads, some hot stuff, fruit, cakes and cereals. We did go for a drink on the charming roof terrace - all very modern and swish and very impressive. The view is fantastic. The food looked excellent although we didnt try it.

We were originally supposed to be staying elsewhere but it closed down so we had to book the Hotel Valadier very last minute. We were a bit anxious because we read other people's reviews saying the rooms were tiny. When we arrived we found that Expedia had incorrectly booked us two double rooms when it should have been a double and a triple. The hotel very helpfully swapped some other people about to accomodate us. Our rooms were small but bigger than we expected. There was ample space for us. The room was on the fourth floor and was very clean. It was two twin beds even though it was supposed to be a double but we made do. The bathroom was clean with a bidet and a shower over the bath. The hotel had a great location and we walked everywhere. It is about 30 minutes to colosseum and 30 minutes to vatican. It is just south of the lovely piazza del popollo and has a great selection of shops and restaurants close by. On our first night we did not sleep until 2am as the bar on the hotel's terrace on the sixth floor was hosting a wedding. My partner went downstairs to see if we could swap rooms but as he descended downstairs he realised the noise was the same all over the hotel. I dont think it was very fair on people who paid to stay in the hotel to be bombarded by very loud wedding music until the wee hours of the morning - I dont know how anyone in the hotel would have slept until the wedding finished. We certainly did not which made us tired and irritable for our first proper day out in Rome. Our first morning at breakfast did not go so well either. We were seated at a dirty table. There was no cutlery. We had to wait until we were almost finished breakfast before we were served tea/coffee by a very grumpy girl. The breakfasts did improve as we continued our stay, though first impressions count and our first impression was not good. They also need to fix their toaster as you have to put the bread through twice before it is done. Also they have fruit salad and half peaches on offer - but these are straight out of tins - they should put in a bit more effort to make fresh fruit salad. We had drinks in the hotel on one of the evenings. We ordered three beers, one orange juice and one cocktail - the bill was 50 euro!! It was a standard 10 euro per drink - even for the orange juice!! Bit scandalous! So if you are drinking there in the evenings get cocktails - you might as well since you will be charged 10 euro no matter what drink you get. Apparently the excess cost is to pay the piano player - a piano player who is not particularly good or needed. They would be better served investing in a cd player, getting rid of the piano (it is actually a keyboard) player and reducing the prices of their drinks. When we went to check out we ordered a taxi for 2pm. 2pm came and went and no taxi - we spoke to the man at the desk who told us he had mistakenly booked it for 2.30pm instead - this was an outright lie because he had confirmed earlier to us that it has been booked for 2pm - plus when we had booked it earlier that morning we saw him write 2pm down. There was a difficult customer at the desk around 2pm that we heard giving off and we strongly suspect he gave her our taxi to get rid of her. It made us late for our check-in time and we had to queue for check in for 40 minutes. Also I was struggling to lift my suitcase up the ten or so steps to the front door of the hotel while a porter just stood by and watched! I was a bit annoyed at this as I was clearly struggling. With regard to tours of the Colosseum and Vatican - I would recommend booking with an Australian girl called Hanna Schneider - she is currently with Gladiator tours but is opening her own company soon with her partner called HM Tours - she is really good and much better than a lot of the other tour guides we saw. With regard to restauarants - we cannot recommend this place enough - it is called La Capricciosa. Its is just off one of the main streets Via del Corso which runs down the centre of rome.

If you're into octagonal mirrored ceilings, this room is a very fine choice indeed. In fact, mirrors are everywhere, and you quickly become very aware of your own behind - where ever you are in the room, you can see yourself in at least one mirror, from at least one angle. Fascinating, if the view is pleasant. The room was cleaned and scrubbed properly every day- everything was so clean, fresh and polished. There was an electric window blind, a bit extravagant and unecessary, but when in Rome... The hotel is very near all of the sites we wanted to visit so we just walked everywhere. It was easy to find the historic sites during the day, and equally easy to find good restaurants at night. You really don't have to worry about getting cabs after a night on the tiles. Must say, we had a great time, I just wish we could stay longer. The noise is mentioned quite a bit in the other reviews - we had no problem with it, the sounds of people on the streets and discrete outdoor restaurants' noises on a warm summer's night, that's what we went to Rome for! We were too knackered to register anything anyway, after miles and miles we walked, and pints and pints we drank.

Breakfast is a continental one with some cereal, pastries, yoghurts, toast and the usual continental meats that I never understand people wanting for breakfast. It's OK, but not as good as a hotel where you get a lot of English going and get a fried breakfast. I don't think breakfast is a big thing in Italian hotels.

Just cut through to via di ripetta. 3) ATM in via del corso. 4) Alimentari (food shop to get your water for your mini bar) in via di Ripetta (cut through from hotel and turn left). 5) church at far side of Piazza del Populo has 2 Caravaggios that are worth spending 10 minutes looking at 6) Walk to see the church decorated with the bones of the Cappuchin monks (27 via vittorio venetto) 7) Taxi rank in Piazza di Populo. About 8.5 euros to train station. 8) In the evening you can walk to the Trevi fountain and have an ice cream or a drink, but you might want to actually go to a different area such as Piazza Navona. (I expected there to be bars overlooking all the main attractions such as the Colloseum, Trevi, Spanish Steps etc but they are often just small bars down side streets). In summary, we probably would have preferred a hotel nearer the attractions but we couldn't find one available (certainly not for the same price).

With the window open it was quite noisy from the street below but with it closed you couldn't hear a thing, and as it was really hot during our stay we kept the window closed and the air con on. The rooms on this side of the building did seem to be a lot bigger than some of the others (you could see by the floor plan on the fire safety card - yes I did read it as I have to know where my nearest exits are!), also when the rooms were being made up we saw come pretty small ones as we walked to our room from the lift so if your room is small you may think about asking to move to another if possible (rooms 308 to 316 seemed to be quite a bit larger than some others on the 3rd floor, it may be the same for the 4th floor rooms too). The hotel has two restaurants and an adjoining pizzeria which is part of the Valadier Groupe. Breakfast was served in the main restaurant on the 2nd floor - a hot and cold buffet \u2013 perfectly pleasant and substantial enough. On our first night we had dinner at the 'Hi Res' (High Restaurant) at the very top of the hotel which was excellent and we would highly recommend it, even if you are not staying at the hotel. It is very modern in style and has panoramic views across the rooftops of Rome - great food, good service and a great barman served us the best mojitos! The hotel interior is covered in polished marble which was almost mirror like. Our bathroom was covered in marble (very clean) and there were mirrors on the ceiling in our bedroom!

It took me a long time to choose a hotel as I wanted everything to be perfect. When I booked I requested a really nice room if possible, i was told they would reserve a classic double room for me. I am a hotel Manager myself and therefore I know what to expect from a 4 star hotel and this did not even live up to a 2 star standard in my opinion. We arrived late on the 30th of Jan 07. On arrival I expected the room to be ready. There were 2 men behind the desk who spent about 5 or 6 minutes deciding where to put us. I was disappointed as the room wasn't as nice as i expected and it was a twin not a double which i had booked. The porter asked us to go to the bar and then he rearranged the bed. At the bar we ordered a bottle of beer and a class of wine which cost a staggering 20 euro. There was construction going on outside our window every morning at 7.30 am, if it had been street noise I wouldn't have minded so much because the hotel can't help that. However we were in a back room so the work going on was internal. My patience had run out on the last morning as I wanted to get some sleep before our flight home. I rang the front desk to be answered by a man who claimed he didn't know there was work going on. I received no apology, he just said he'd get somebody to come up and stop it, nobody came... The room was warm and stuffy and the air con was useless. They rang us on the morning of check out at 1 min past 12 to see what time we'd be leaving our room, check out was 12, they could have given us a chance....Not enjoyable and not friendly at all. On check out they had extra charges put on to our bill which we did not have. There was no apology for this either. The only good thing I can honestly say about the hotel is it's location. It is within walking distance to everything. However if I had the chance again I would definately not stay here.

If I could offer a word of advice to our American brethren, please please please lower your expectations when visiting Europe - land is expensive, the buildings are old and not designed to be hotels; if you want a palatial suite, go and stay out of town - you simply won't get it in Rome city centre. The staff were more than helpful, and spoke excellent English. Breakfast was an excellent spread of bread, meats, cheeses, cereal, juice, and fruit, with a small selection of hot food.

The restaurant was not opened while we were there and we did not have any drinks at the bar. We enjoyed being out in the city and coming back to our room to enjoy a few glasses of wine alone upstairs! The breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of eggs, meat, cheeses, cereals and pastries...very filling start to the day! The best aspect of this hotel is it's location. It is right on the Piazza Del Poppolo and a few blocks from the Spanish Steps. We had no problem walking to virtually every tourist destiniation in the city...even did the 30 minute walk from our hotel all the way to the Colisieum! Also the hotel is in the area of Rome which by far seemed to be the most popular for night life...bars, restaurants, etc. All in all a great stay and would definitely go back", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine Ayrshire scotland", "Title": "\u201cI am hard to please, but\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4399724", "Content": "Before going I read all the reviews about this darling little Hotel and felt really dubious about going. Prices of soft drinks 16 Euros ... piece of nonsence. Ok maybe you are paying on average of 1 - 2 euros more, but hey isn't that the same with every hotel? Loved every minute of my stay , had read about tiny bedrooms.. ours was BIG... only scary moment was when yoiu tried out the bed after such a long journey and first out there was no bounce to the bed... solid but the big moment was when we looked up( my friend and me..just pals) and there was this massive mirror in the ceiling. WOW. So okay iit was formally a brothel and obviiously the hotel has kept a lot of it's original features. Beautiful wee hotel with REALLY very helpful staff. Can't say one thing bad about it. Bed linen and towels changed EVERY day. Eating places were really good for breakfast and other meals. The location is superb. Hopefully you will take something from these comments as being postive. At the end of the day you are only in the hotel to sleep and have breakfast, what more really do you want. The whole picture is to see Roma... and wow what a location Roma surrounds you. Try the Covona cafe eaterie behind in the piazza Popolo up in the square behind you, just sit and watch the people.. great and ask for Angelo... he's the man. ENJOY! I certainly will be recommending this as the place to stay. Just go and see for yourself.

We booked two room for my family. The room with two single beds was much larger than the one with a double bed, but each was very elegant with marble bathrooms and cherry wood paneling. Hotel staff was very helpful and breakfast was the best of the other two hotels we stayed in Florence and Venice. Pre-dinner drinks in bar were only 7 euros each for a glass of wine. Close to Piazza del Poppola and Spanish Steps.
