My real problem, with this hotel is how very unfriendly it is to anyone who uses technology. First is the $22 a day internet charge, which I know a lot of short-sighted hotels still do. But then, there is no wifi (oh there is weak wifi in the lobby but guess what? they charge you again for it), so I have to hard wire my laptop but using my iPhone and iPad on wifi? Forget it. But wait, there's more! The real kicker came when I went down to use the business center. Not only are the computers not upgraded and warnings pop up every minute saying the system needs updating and the hard disk is almost full, but even if you paid the $22 for internet, that doesn't cover the business center! They wanted me to cough up another $5 for 30 mins access to the internet to print a boarding pass. Ridiculous.

Upon sitting in the room for a few moments regretting our decision to move from Four Points to be closer to the conference, we noticed extreme road noise coming from the street and train station below. I went to the window and realised that it was open about 1cm. I tried to no avail to close the window, it was bolted in place and I ended up cutting my hand slightly. I called reception about the noise and window and someone from maintenance came up - only to look at the window, say that is how they are here and the rooms are not sound-proof \"per se\". I demanded to speak to someone about changing rooms as every car that passed sounded like it was driving over the top of us. I also called Four Points to look at moving back there but unfortunately they were booked out (lucky people there). Spoke to reception who said they would send somebody up. 20 minutes, 25 minutes still no one. Called again - told he should be on his way. All the time I just sat in the room staring at the wall (no cable channels to speak of on the tv). Finally the person came to move our room which was on the entire other side of the hotel next to the indoor pool. It was quiet but still was tired and the bed looked and felt generally bad. The pillows also were not down or plush. The lifts in the hotel are old and decrepit. The carpets are old.

The guests above the room (I believe to be 812) arrived at approx. 9.00 pm and were constantly banging their feet and jumping on the floor for 2 hours. Perhaps they were dancing or decided to annoy the guest in my room. After 10.00 pm I could hear the traffic downstairs honking their horn every now and then and I went outside the hotel to see what was going on and there was a car parked on the left side of Albion St facing towards the hotel (Oxford St). I can't believe somebody would simply park their car in far left lane where there is clearly a No Parking Sign and traffic could not get through. I advised reception who said they will notify the Police. 2 hours later the honking still continued. In the morning after breakfast I went outside and would you believe the car is still there and cars had to go around it still honking their horns. I went out for the entire day and upon my return after 6.00 pm, you guessed it, the car was still parked there! I thought I can't put up with horns honking for the entire night. Anyway, I went to my room tried to ignore the honks by watching tv and by 10.30 pm I couldn't sleep because I knew in my mind I was expecting honks! And yes, there were honks! By 1.00 am I was still awake. I eventually fell asleep and after breakfast I went to check if the car was still parked there and to my amazement it was gone. I was expecting it to still be there and was (sad to say this), hoping it was so somebody else could put up with what I had to. The Sebel it definitely not a quite hotel and with the traffic at the corner of Elizabeth and Albion St you will not get a good night's rest.

The room is quiet despite the railway proximity. The bathroom lets it down, with it's tired shower-over-the-bath affair. But it's not a big problem. What is a problem for me in this room (917) is the wiring for the lights. It is not possible to have the bedside lights on without having a main overhead light on in the entry foyer. This is an incredibly annoying and stupid design. I also could have done without the cleaners' hairs in the bathtub and on the throw at the end of the bed. Please, please, can hotel chambermaids start wearing nets when they clean bathrooms and make beds? It really grosses me out to come across those long hairs. Then there is the breakfast room. It looks and feels like a giant pig troff or food hall from a low brow suburban shopping mall. I took one look and left (plenty of more interesting breakfast places around Crown Street). Broadband internet is available at an absurdly unreasonable price, as it is in most Australian establishments that consider themselves to be upmarket but which are sadly out of step with the rest of the world on this issue.

My superior single was the same as their double room. After the first night we were informed that due to maintenance of air conditioning units we would be upgraded to deluxe rooms for the remainder of our stay at no extra cost. The deluxe rooms had newer furnishings, smaller wardrobes and no bath, only a shower. Both rooms were lovely, dont get me wrong, but as a female tourist I wanted room to hang clothes and new purchases, and a bath to soak in after a long day exploring. The amenities were excellent, with a decent sized swimming pool (changing rooms attached) and a sauna - though this took quite a while to heat to a decent temperature. The staff could not have been more helpful and nothing was too much hassle. They were, I think, among the nicest staff I have met in my world-wide travels. So full praise to them. Breakfast can be purchased at reduced rate with the room. I would strongly recommend you do this. They serve buffet style a full range from continental, to full cooked english, to cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, etc. The little girls loved the freshly made pancakes and berry yoghurt. I found the fresh coffee -yes the proper stuff not cheap & instant- to be life saving in the mornings. The beds were comfortable and King-size is King-size, not a queen-size masquerading as King-size. Though the small raise in the middle of the mattress was interesting. I take my own pillow to any hotel I vist as I am fussy, but the ones available were not all squashed and matted inside and the bed itself did not have impressions of previous guests bodies in the mattress. As soon as my eyes closed I was asleep and slept soundly..... if it fitted in my suitcase I would have taken the bed home!! The only complaint I have is that on the last day there was no hot water for about an hour in the morning. It appears that emergency maintenance to the hot water supply took longer than anticipated and the reception staff (naturally) did not want to ring the rooms, waking guests, to inform them of this. Though a cold shower first thing in the morning can be considered invigorating and refreshing, its not really my idea of fun. Still I was awake when I got out :) So all in all I would recommend this hotel to families, singles, etc. It is child friendly, It is excellently situated: just down the road from a main station (no I couldn't hear the trains); next to the free city bus line; close the restaurants; about 20 minutes fast walk from the wharf; not near any night clubs so no noisy drunks to wake you at 3am. We initially took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, but returned via train which was cheaper and just as quick. So for those on a budget dont think the distance from the airport is a problem. Also with the free city bus link just down the road you can hop on and travel to the \"tourist spots\" free of charge.

The mini bar fridge in my room was actually a freezer - it froze all my drinks, and it was way too overstocked.

The air conditioning has no way you can control it, except to turn it off or onto another fan speed, but it seemed no matter what I pressed nothing changed. I was on the 9th floor. Called reception a few times and they addressed this issue quickly - It seems there is an ongoing problem with quite a few of their air conditioners, but after a few minutes it cooled down and was at a bearable temperature.

The location is fairly hidden away, ok if you want to walk a while to get to the heart of the city, but definitely not on the doorstep of the major shopping areas or cafes.

I asked a man who appeared to be the housekeeping manager about the noise - he assured me it would last 1/2 hr or so and \"absolutely not\" all day. We went downstairs and spoke to the front desk manager, who said renovations begin every day at 8:30am and go until 5pm. We requested a different room, as my husband had work to do in the room during the day and the noise was atrocious. We were moved to a room in the 'old wing'. On the upside, the rooms are a good size. But, clearly the only thing they are renovating are the bathrooms, and not to any great degree as far as we could see. The room furniture was identical - and just as old and beaten up as in our first room. The bathroom in the room we moved to was horrible - rotting door frames/skirting boards, dirty, moldy tiles. However, after dealing with renovation noise, this was a tolerable alternative, until my husband took a shower and found a couple of hairs on one of their folded up bath towels that he used. Long, black, not at all like our hairtypes. We stayed 4 nights and everyday found either more black hairs or just dirt/hairs on the floor and in the bathtub - housekeeping is shocking here! Our new room overlooked the main road, and was about 15metres from the street corner - buses came roaring around and up the slight hill. Some rooms may be 'tucked away', but ours certainly wasn't. Luckily we had to be up by 7am every morning - a lie in past about 8am with the street noise would not have been possible. The lift buttons in one of the lifts didn't work properly... push as hard as we liked, no success. So we took to using the stairs to our 2nd floor room, rather than wait for another lift to arrive. Breakfast was possibly the only positive thing here... nothing incredible, but acceptable selection and quality, and a nice ambience with newspapers provided.

Other reviews have commented on its dry-ness or staleness - but it is a hotel, presented in an almost clinical way. So, it is what it is. I stay here because of its geat location and decent service and its tucked away from the noise. There's a 7Eleven right on the corner which is convenient (although, there's usually some kind of drama out the front, it doesn't inconvenience hotel guests) and the place next door has delicious Pho.

Would I stay there again? Being on a budget probably not at full price, but if a price like what I paid for came up again, then most definitely. Probably the only negative thing I would have to say about my stay is that stupid $50 credit card validation thing that major hotels have a habit of doing - I had expected it so I made the point of putting fifty dollars on a card I don't use often and using that card instead. Seriously I don't know why some hotels do this but other hotels don't need to - its a practice that I think should be illegal, or at least made part of the rate. Granted they tell you that you get it back when you check out but it actually takes a week, as the bank has to clear it. From a hotels point $50 may not be much but for those on a budget it could mean $50 that (in the worst case) you may need to get home. *Gets off soap box* Sorry, just had to vent.

I took advantage of a remodeling special and was able to stay here for just $6/night more than a private room at the nearby hostel! Front desk: All staff were helpful, from check-in to check-out. Common features: Lobby had been remodeled with a somewhat austere modern design. Indoor pool and hot tub were pleasant but barely used by hotel patrons. Hot tub water was filled to an oddly low level, leaving too much of my 6'1\" body exposed above the water. Breakfast wasn't included in my room special, so I can't comment on it. Room: Remodeled with the same austere modern elements found in the lobby. Comfy bed, sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-fridge, and flat-screen TV. TV got about a dozen fuzzy channels--this is cable? Coffee table and desk had not been dusted. Mini-fridge was overstocked, and a bottle fell out simply by opening it. (More on this later.) There were views of the street from my room on the third floor, but I wasn't staying here to see Sydney's skyline, so that didn't bug me. (Some rooms look onto the roof of an adjacent building, which would bug me.) Drapes: Although the room had been remodeled and had newer furnishings, the drapes were stained and dirty. The fact that they didn't match anything else in the room suggests they had not been replaced as part of the remodel. This was further confirmed when the drape rod fell down while I was closing one of them, forcing me to contact the front desk to get it put back up. Bathroom: Also remodeled, but with an awkward shower design. It was half open and flush with the remainder of the bathroom floor. Absolutely terrible design. Also, the shower handle came off when I tried to turn it on the second night. I was able to put it back on myself, but it shouldn't have come off to begin with. Also, there were insufficient hooks to hang up towels, clothes, etc. Location: I had a morning train to catch on my way out of town, so I really liked being walking distance from Central Station. If you don't have a morning train to catch, though, other parts of the CBD are more central to visitor amenities and tourist attractions. Price: Got a steal of a deal, but most people won't be so lucky. The credit card fee was a tacky addition; one would expect it to be quoted in the hotel price. Also, the front desk tried to charge me for that bottle of water that fell out of the overstocked min-fridge. I protested and the charge was removed without incident, attesting to staff professionalism. Overall: Once construction is done and some attention is spent on the details (drapes, dust, shower handles, mini-fridges), the Sebel Surry Hills may be a nice place to stay.

I don't know if it was the a/c or the dropping outside temps. The windows in the rooms open and this was an option in the second room, but the first was too noisy. Lots of people going to/from pool, but we didn't use. Paid $4 per 30 minutes to use their computer/printer in business center. Short walk downhill back to Central.

The rooms have recently been updated - some with beech wood furniture, other's with a more modern and sleek black finish. The bathrooms are very pleasant now, modern, clean and well appointed. The internet, as other reviewers have mentioned, is expensive ($25 per day), but on the flip side the parking ($10 per day) is relatively cheap for a location so close to the city. In way of location, the Sebel is perfect. Aprox. 20 - 25mins from the airport and roughly five minutes drive to Darling Harbour / Harbour Bridge & the Opera House etc. The staff are friendly and courteous, though a little unprofessional and not particularly organised. It's often the case that the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing, so if you have any issues expect it to take a few phone calls to different departments to get them sorted out. Room Service food is fine - not spectacular, but what can you expect from room service? Restaurant breakfast is standard bacon & eggs etc.. Again, nothing special. Can't comment on dinners as I haven't eaten there for anything other than Breakfast. There's a courtyard located at the end of the hallway on level five that's open from 6am to 10pm, but take note - if you're in a room on level 5 they do NOT have mini-bars - you need to get a Smart Card from reception to use a vending machine located in the corridor. Full mini bar in rooms on other floors. As other reviewers have pointed out, there are minor renovations going on in the foyer and reception areas, but they don't get in the way of anything. At the bottom of the street, no more than fifty feet away is a Seven Eleven, and there's a bottle shop about one hundred meters up Elizabeth St. toward the train station. Plenty of restaurants near the area, and a very quick (maybe five minutes) walk into the heart of the city. Overall, a good hotel for the cost, all the facilities you could want, comfortable rooms and friendly staff.

It changed from cold to hot frequently without touching the control and could be dangerous if a child was showering. Overall we were very happy with the hotel.
