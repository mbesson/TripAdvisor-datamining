What I wish I knew before our trip was that there is absolutely NOTHING by this hotel (except other hotels. Not even a gas station mini-mart). Unfortunately for us I did not realize the extent it would take to get to civilization. If you are looking for a clean over night stay by the airport and don't mind the rough around the edges decor then this is the place for you. But however, if your plan was like ours and you would like to sightsee in Philadelphia....look elsewhere NOW!!! The hotel does offer a shuttle to the airport/ train stop, but you will likely wait for the shuttle for as long as 25 mins. Then you will take the train, and then the subway. All in all it is about a 1 hour trek each way (if you hit everything right). In hindsight we should have paid an additional $20 a night for a hotel in Center City. Each day we figured the cost of travel to be about $11 per person. Another thing that I wish I had paid attention too...if you want any extras...you are going to pay for it. Food at their restaurant \"Relish\" is ok, but it is pricey. You are going to pay for internet, color copies, laundry service and parking. After our 4 night stay it was obvious to us that this location is doing everything they can to cut costs. Even if it means holding back on the toilet paper!!

I will start with check in where I waited 30/40 minutes to check in while people kept going around the line to speak with employees at the front desk and were not advised they had to wait in line like everyone else. Even though there was a SPG Gold / Platinum desk check in it was not recognized. The hotel this first evening consisted of large groups of children running the hallways till the very late night / early morning. Calls to the guest services went unattended and parents were nowhere to be seen. Going to the front desk resulted in no response either.Told they would talk to the groups but nothing happened. As the hotel is a large atrium sound reverberates throughout the building. Well night one done.... not much sleep. Asked to be contacted by the manager and not followed up by the property. Night number two actually got worse. ...\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It was New Year's Eve and it seams the hotel had allowed \"large\" groups to occupy their rooms ( some with more that 20 by our count), large amounts of alcohol being carried in by guests and screaming and yelling from the balcony of the atrium till well past 3am in the morning. At some point furniture was thrown from the 7th floor to the atrium below, people screaming, fights breaking out and people passed out in the hallways. Calls to guest services went unanswered. At some point the police showed up when a huge fight in the atrium ensued and arrests were made? Needless to say a quiet night of sleep did not happen for a second night in a row. Requests to have the manager contact anyone from our group went unanswered and the lack of concern from the employees seamed to be \"business as usual\". The lobby and hallways looked like a war zone with trash strewn everywhere. Finally night three when we returned to the hotel from work and tried to eat a peaceful dinner in the restaurant. Drunken football fans two floors about the restaurant decided to yell from the balcony at hotel guests below and proceeded to drop their pants in a display of public nudity for all to witness at the restaurant below. When a couple with children sitting near us asked the manager to intervene and call the police nothing was done about it. They were insistent that the police be called but the hotel did not follow through and they left. We also complained and were told the guests would \"quiet down\" but needless to say not much was resolved. At what point do you ask guests to leave the property? What this all boils down to is a hotel which does not enforce it's own policies, could not care about the comfort and safety of it's guests and lacks any professionalism.

We had a very mixed experience. First of all, this hotel is one of the most difficult to find in the US. While it is right next to I-95 and the airport, there are no direct exits or service roads to get you to the hotel. Twice we drove several miles out of our way to find the hotel. You use different exits from north and south of the airport. The hotel website should warn you about this. If you are not an excellent navigator, get great directions. When we arrived at check-in time we were told that a large group had checked out late and there were no rooms. They were just starting to clean the rooms at 3pm. We were offered a room where some of us would have had to sleep on a sleep sofa. We opted to wait for our room but after more than half an hour we decided to take a room that was ready. It was not the type of room we had reserved but at least we got to sleep on beds, not sofas. The beds were the best part of the room, very comfortable, so I am glad we held out for a room with beds for everyone. It also had a separate living room which gave our children more space to play. Another plus was a mini-fridge and a very strong showerhead. The main negatives were very worn furniture. The desks, tables, and so on had lots of scratches, a floor lamp was so broken the lamp leaned at a 20 degree angle from vertical, the heating unit door cover was broken off and laying on the floor. It looked like a dump. Another very disconcerting feature (for people with vertigo) is that all the rooms are accessed by hallways overlooking a eight story atrium. There is only a short rail (maybe three feet high) to prevent you from plunging to your death. Why hotels think this is attractive or acceptable for families with young children is beyond me. The hotel has an indoor pool and hot tub but we did not have time to use it because of the delay in checking in. The hotel also charges for internet and parking, features that a mid-price hotel near an airport should provide for free.

The man who checked us in was very polite and friendly but could not seem to answer basic questions about how the parking system there worked (kind of confusing) or directions. However our main motivation for writing this is the situation we experienced in the restaurant the next morning was appalling. First there appeared to be almost no one working there and there was no one manning a starbucks coffee stand that was sort of part of the restaurant. There were a handful of customers, all who looked angry and upset and no waitstaff. There was a tiny disgusting looking buffet (and we are not picky eaters). A really rude woman -(calling her a hostess would be stretch) appeared and complained that someone had messed up seating at the tables so we would \"just have to wait\". She was not in any type of uniform or nametag, wearing trashy street clothes and completely unprofessional. We were finally allowed to sit. A customer next to us finally got the attention of another employee who appeared to be the only other possible staff member. She asked if he wanted his check and he looked horrified and told her he had never received his breakfeast. The same rude woman who intially refused to seat us then came out of the kitchen area, fighting with another person, screaming obsenities and dragging a giant bag of trash acroos the floor almost hitting us with it. We eventually left and never saw a real waitress much less have hope one would come to our individual table. We had the luxury of the fact we had already checked out and thank god were not headed to the airport or in a rush. I can not imagine being a hungry, rushed or stressed out traveler there. There is nowhere in the area to walk or drive ,no stores or restaurants and there is no in-room microwave, so you are completely dependent upon the food and service at that restaurant. To add insult to injury, when we left we took the time to very politely let the front desk staff know how bad the situation in the restaurant was so maybe they could alert someone to it. One woman just gave us a real fake \"sorry\" and the other woman (who appeared to be a manager or in charge) walked away as we were talking.

Check-in was on 7/09/09 and check-out was on 7/10/09 (confirmation #544428231). Your property was selected due to its proximity to Philadelphia International Airport, the fact that it was a suite property, and because I had an early morning international departure. Upon waking up on the morning of 7/10/09 I was disappointed to discover that there was not enough water pressure to take a shower. However, by placing a drinking cup under the sink faucet I was able to accumulate enough water to wash my face and brush my teeth. Unfortunately, I was flying to China and would not have the opportunity to shower for an additional 24 hours. Your maintenance department was called and a technician did come up to the room to investigate. However, he had no idea why there was no water. At this point I had no choice, I had to leave for the airport or miss my flight. All I could do was look forward to arriving in a third world country where water is available in the hotel rooms.

The suites are large enough for a family if needed and the living area had a nice leather sofa and a comfortable chair along with a nice desk area. I did find the lighting in the living area to be a tad dark since the windown opened into the atrium area of the hotel. Gym was very small but nicely equiped.

I arrived at about 2:45 (check-in is at 3:00) on a Wednesday for a one-night stay and was informed they had no rooms currently available for check-in and it would be a little while. I noticed a handful of other people also waiting to check-in including some attending a conference in the hotel for Sunoco. So I wandered over to the \"business\" center which is two computers (one with a big sign reading out of order) and a printer. I decided to check-in for my following days flight and print my boarding pass except the printer wasn't printing anything, perfect! After about 20 minutes I wandered back to the front desk and there was now a healthy line of people waiting to check-in (it is now about 3:10). Finally they start checking people in albeit very slowly. I requested a room away from the highway and the staff member looked at me with a smirk and told me that was next to impossible considering how busy they were but my room was only partially facing the highway. I headed to my room on the 3rd floor and was disappointed the minute I stepped in. There were multiple holes in the walls that were simply spackeled with no paint and/or wallpaper. The carpet in the \"living room\" of the suite was also pretty dirty. There was a USA Today on top of the TV from the day before (Tuesday) which led me to believe one of two things: (a) my room was not cleaned or (b) my room sat empty all day Wednesday which didn't explain the \"we have no rooms\" comment. I parked my suitcase in the bedroom and stepped into the bathroom which was amazingly filthy. The grout throughout the bathroom was filthy and the ceiling paint was peeling. The \"kitchen area\" was a joke but serviceable. The bar/reception area is smack dab in the middle of the hotel and it gets LOUD in there when there's a group of people together. Thankfully, it wasn't while I was trying to sleep. Also, parking is $5. I got so many conflicting answers but by the end, I just drove out of the parking lot without being asked for my money. I can't believe this stay cost me $139/night. This stay wasn't worth $1.00 and I will never be returning to this hotel again.

The hotel website showed a beautiful hotel - and it is from the outside. The hotel shuttle from the airport was quick. My family has a suite with 2 double beds and a sofa pull-out. There are apparently only 1 of those on each floor. We got room 225. We walked in, and were very disappointed. As a frequent business traveller, staying in Sheratons means clean, comfortable, safe room. This room was not of Sheraton quality at all. The room had a funny wet moldy smell to it. Being from the desert in California, with no humidity, I didn't know if that was from the climate or from a problem with the room/hotel. I know when I've travelled to the Carribean, it always smells funny to me. We left to find dinner, which is difficult with no transportation, unless you want to eat at the hotel. The hotel staff said the shuttle to the airport would take us to Ruby Tuesdays on the way, and they did. When we were finished, we jumped back on another shuttle that was dropping off some more guests there and returned to the hotel. Went back to our room, ready to relax for the evening, and that's when the \"free\" room started to not be worth it. We started noticing how gross and worn the room really was. I went to put the safety chain on the door - both parts of it were falling off. I took off my shoes - the carpet was sopping wet in front of the bar sink. The ceiling had stains on it from water leaks. The carpet was ripped. The sheets were limp and worn. We were tired, and decided to just make the best of it. However, there were 2 family reunions going on in the hotel. Right outside room 225 is a seating area for about 50 people for dining. The dining room was closed, but the people from the reunion were using it anyway, in addition to the conference rooms downstairs they had reserved. Also, the hotel has a large open area in the center, and all of the rooms surround this area. So people from the reunion were shouting to each other from floor to floor, across the atrium. I finally called and complained to the staff. They were very nice, and security did finally get rid of the people outside our door, after 3 calls. They also refunded my points for my stay. In the morning, when we went to shower, we found that the bathtub valve to change the water to the shower head was missing, and that the floor was really filthy, and the shower curtain was moldy. I'd had it. I called the front desk and asked them to book me two rooms at the Four Points, since we needed at least 3 beds and Four Points only has 2 per room. I didn't care the cost, I just had to get out of that room. They offered to try to move me to a similar suite if they could find one, or two adjoining King suites. I told them I didn't care where I was moved, as long as the rooms weren't as gross as this one was. They told us to go downstairs and enjoy a free breakfast while they tried to accomodate us. We noticed that laminated benches and planter boxes in the atrium and restaurant were heavily water damaged - at some point there must have been a heck of a huge leak in this place. When we were done with breakfast, they said they had two adjoining king suites (4 beds total) for us to look at. We went to look, and it was like night and day. Those suites were nice, clean, and didn't smell of mold. They were still very worn, but the staff told me the whole place was being renovated in November. We moved to those suites, and then set out to explore historic Philly. We took the airport shuttle back to the airport and then hopped on the train. That was very easy. Overall, this was one of the worst hotels I've ever been in. A Motel 6 is cleaner. However, the staff were all VERY nice, and VERY helpful.

I have no problem with staying 15 minutes outside the city and saving $125 a night. The suite is a large 2 room suite with a very comfortable soft bed and great comforter. The furnishings are not super modern, but are ok. I never had a room with ripped or torn furniture. Again this is a Sheraton, not the Ritz-Carlton.

Why did the Sheraton have a vacancy, I wondered? My experience, for $169, was OK, but just that. I expected more value for the price. On the plus side, the hotel is convenient, has more interesting architecture than most airport locations and, contrary to what some other reviewers experienced, my room was clean, the bed comfortable and the plumbing, electrical and HVAC worked as they should have. The room decor was acceptable, but spartan. Bare walls above the sofa bed (did not try it to see how it worked) and the matching chair gave a decidely unfinished feeling to the room. The furniture style was an early and not wholly successful imitation of \"Pottery Barn\", which I did not mind too much. First impression of the room was modestly favorable. It also was quiet, a big plus. However, with the lights on came reality. The furniture was in poor to bad condition: dents, scratches, gouges, stains and--in the bedroom--the bottom drawer of the combination TV armoire/dresser was bashed in. The bottom drawer simply was impossible to open. I was alone, did not need the space and was staying only overnight, so I did not report it to management. Breakfast the next morning was pricey, but really not unexpected and not much different from other hotels of this type. I certainly have paid a lot more in downtown hotels in various cities. For coffee, oatmeal, organge juice and toast, the bill came to $20, tip and tax included. Service was fine, but the nicely pressed tablecloth had what appeared to be coffee stains and the silverware was badly spotted, which I hoped was from the dishwasher and not a previous guest. I asked for and got replacements, which were in similar condition, so I ended up using a spare napkin to wipe off the spoon and knife.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Laurel, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cConvenient for those early flights out\u201d", "Author": "o2bmmw", "ReviewID": "UR6929027", "Content": "During the Valentine's Day ice storm, our flight to Florida was cancelled, but we were lucky enough to have a flight out very early the next day. Rather than drive on icy roads at 4 am with 2 kids, we opted to use some Starwood points and stay at this hotel. The good: I accidentally booked the wrong date and the hotel was booked up, but the manager got on the phone and was able to help us change the room to the night we needed. Front desk staff and bellman were very friendly and helpful when we checked in in the evening. The King bed was good. TV channels were good. The lobby and public areas are impressive. The dessert we bought for our daughter in the restaurant was good and service was prompt. Airport shuttle service was prompt and helpful, and parking costs were reasonable. The bad: We were sent to a room that obviously had not been cleaned since the last occupant left (bed was slept in, water glasses around etc). We called down and they changed our room. Pillows were sad and because the hotel was so booked, they were all out of additional pillows. The restaurant hostess does not appear to have ever cracked a smile in her life, despite our going overboard to be nice and complementary to her. We had a similar experience with our waitress. The ugly: The pull out sofa. REALLY! The mattress was so old and worn that the foam was coming out. This was patently unacceptable . Our kids were so tired they slept without a problem . HAd we been staying longer, I would have insisted on being moved again. Summary: Given what we paid (NOTHING) and the convenience of needing to be by the airport with parking on an icy night, we think it was worth it. We would stay there again if we had a super early flight out. But I agree that the rooms are tired and need updates. Public areas are fine though. If you aren't stuck at the airport, or if you don't have an early flight, I can't think of any reason to stay here.", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA fine airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "Harlaching", "ReviewID": "UR6647872", "Content": "I don't understand the negative reviews. We scored two Thursday night rooms at $70 each via Priceline and were very happy with the entire experience. It's a big somewhat impersonal place, but what do you expect at an airport hotel? The rooms are very large suites giving you plenty of space to stretch out. The beds were very comfortable. There was absolutely no aircraft or road noise and the a/c also was very quiet which enabled us to get a good night's rest after a long transatlantic flight. We found the staff very nice and helpful. OK, the furnishings are bit worn but nothing unusual compared to what you would expect at a 3 star chain hotel.

The bed was absoultely amazing, words cannot even describe the cozziness. It was perfect. I have since then never slept better. You sink right in the bed with the squishy matress and down blanket and pillows. If I could afford it- I would fly there just to sleep in that hotel again, That's how great my stay was.
