We needed to be in this vicinity to be close to some relatives. Unfortunately, since it was the week between Christmas and New Years, most places were booked. So we broke down and decided that it would be OK. Now the place isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, but just so sad. And it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The place was probably something pretty nice in 1970. Unfortunately, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like anything has been done for the place since then. Nothing in the rooms works right and the one horrible staff person around had no means or interest in making anything better. Also, we were the only people there, so it all felt abandoned. We should have stayed further away in San Juan or Fajardo and driven back and forth.

When we were there in early 2000, and it was empty except for me and my husband. The first room they gave us must have been the worst room they had. Mildew all over the walls, filthy toilet, etc. When I went to the office to speak to the owner, she said pretended not to speak English. Fortunately, I am fluent in Spanish, so I complained about the room and asked for my money back. (We had made advance reservations, believing the web site!) She refused, and said \"take it or leave it.\" I said, \"Fine. We'll drive back to San Juan and I'll find the tourist agency and let them know what has happened.\" She then said she would give us a cleaner room. We were taken to a room that had no mildew; it was on an upper floor, not at ground level. Much better. There was a huge pool which looked ok, but it had a small household size device for cleaning which circled around and around. We decided not to risk the pool due to fear of infection. During our three day visit, no one else checked in. There was no food service and the hotel is down a two-lane winding road which is very dark at night, so we had to be sure to eat before we returned for the evening. I was astonished to see the review which said that this is a top notch facility. The grounds are very beautiful, and it is remote and natural. I would hesitate, however, to come here with children or anyone who is not in good health. You have to fend for yourself, and the mold/moisture problems are a concern. Frankly, I was surprised to see that the place was still in business. If you are planning to stay here, there's no need to make reservations or to give credit card information. Go see it to determine if it is what you want, because once they have your money you may not get it back. Not to worry if you change your mind; several hotels on the main road. This is not the only place to stay in the area.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harbor Springs, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful gem in rainforest, will bring the kids next time.\u201d", "Author": "sparky6915", "ReviewID": "UR57075056", "Content": "We loved staying here and will come back with our 4 kids. This is a hidden gem in the rainforest, a former sugar cane plantation located on a rushing mountain river (there is also a small stream with a footbridge) with large pavillions with skirted tables suitable for entertaining large groups. We saw two old carriages that must have been used for tours or something of the many acres of the plantation. The humidity creates a perfect environment for moss, beautiful ferns as tall as our second floor room, flowering trees and vines. I don't know how the owners keep it up. As we walked by the pretty, large and clean pool (there is a smaller unused one by the office/owners home-do not judge by this first impression) a very slight breeze came and a shower of nuts and leaves fell into the pool and onto the walk. The pool was clean, so they must have to sweep constantly. The resort was like stepping back in time, the environment is jungley, as expected in the rainforest. We loved hearing the tiny coqui frogs in the evening, and it surprised us that most of them went to sleep for the night later. We have stayed at many 4 and 5 start resorts and this was no problem for us; state of the art many years ago and a very refreshing experience -a charming phone booth with lights still glowing down by the pool does not work. Where do you even see phone booths anymore? The tv in the room didn't either, but the one in the lobby had comfortable couches, and did work. We did not come to Puerto Rico to watch tv anyway, and had our books. We knew in advance that the outdoor restaurant had suffered from the down economy and the beautiful covered silver serving dishes sit unused on the buffet. We met the chef as we were checking in, he had to find another job but were told by the owner that he is like family and still lives onsite. We bought our hot dinner from the deli at Ralph's Food Warehouse (or named something like that) a nearby grocery store on highway 3 and brought that and some fruit for breakfast to the hotel with us. They have bottled water and pop and beer for a small fee in the lobby, but be sure to get it before the owners turn in for the night as the cooler is locked. There is a refrigerator and microwave, as well as a coffee maker with a pouch of Puerto Rican coffee in the room. The shower was hot, the beds comfortable and the sound of the rushing river was a delight. It is safe, there is an automatic gate at the entrance to the grounds and we were given a remote so we could come and go at our leisure. Cell reception is very spotty in the mountains, so we left once in the early evening to call our kids. Please tell your friends about this place so that this widow and son can afford to make some repairs to the grounds and buildings, this is a large jewel created by a man with vision that deserves to be preserved. We ate breakfast at Don Pepe's on hwy 3 and highly recommend it. El Yunque (the national rainforest) is very close and we drove up there the following day to see the beautiful waterfalls.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThe worst place I have ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "dem219", "ReviewID": "UR42036074", "Content": "Simply horrible.

The stay is bare-bones, but pleasant. We found the room to be very dark - with very little lighting provided - but the service was decent and our stay was quiet. The sounds of the coqui and other night wildlife easily drown out cars passing on the nearby road, but can keep you awake at night if you are a sensitive sleeper.

We had just come from a week on Culebra so we were relaxed and peaceful. The drive from Fajardo to the Rio Grande Plantation was culture shock with traffic jams, loud music blaring, and tons of people. Rio Grande Plantation took us back to the peacefulness of Culebra...only at the rain forest instead of the beach. The owners are so gentle and accommodating. Hotels.com had botched our reservation and had us arriving at a different date. We were lucky there was even a room available. The one room open was one of the more expensive \"outside\" rooms and our reservations were for the less expensive \"inside\" rooms. The owners gave us the expensive room for the less expensive fee. BTW, don't do the inside rooms. The outside rooms are worth the extra. The rooms are great and the facilities mostly 4 star quality. Remember, you are adjacent to the rain forest. There are frogs, turtles, birds, and tons of plants. Don't get freaked out if the pool, as fantastic as it is, has a few leaves in it in the morning. Let the frogs serenade you to sleep, take a midnight dip in the pool, walk through the grounds, and enjoy the rain forest. We had two teenagers with us so you know they need activities. Rio Grande has the great pool and they have an outside covered activity room with two pool tables and two ping pong tables. There are arcade games as well, but they were unplugged and didn't look like they worked. That brings up the realization that this hotel/convention center was once a huge enterprise run by the current owner's father. They have outside covered pavilions with the potential to host hundreds of day visitors . I don't think that is occurring now so the hotel guests have this huge facility to ourselves. It offers private walks through the trees and bamboo, watch the turtles, and photograph the flowers. I'd suggest calling the hotel directly to ensure your reservation and to speak with the owners. They are good people and are working hard to keep this facility top notch.

After some difficulty getting someone, we were asked to wait. We were then finally checked into one of the smaller rooms with no view to speak of. It was clean and modern. Staying there was somewhat eerie; we were the only guests in the place.
