Our shower had a tough time producing hot water and the water wasn\u2019t draining properly in the tub. I was standing in a lukewarm shower while standing in 3 inches of water. Not very nice\u2026 We let the staff know and they offered alternated showering facilities and comped our parking which was a fair trade. Pros: Our room was clean and a decent size, beds were firm and comfortable, the staff was delightful and there was a flat screen TV and a refrigerator in our room. Cons: While the location of this hotel is in Downtown Vancouver, there are a lot of other hotels (within the same price range) in the downtown core that are more central. Parking is $27 per night which is far too expensive for the location of this hotel. Our room looked out over a busy street and there was very little sound proofing on the windows. My wife kept asking if I was sure I closed the window because it sounded like the cars were in the room with us (I had closed the windows).", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cIt's dirty.\u201d", "Author": "TorontoTravellingbug", "ReviewID": "UR127915929", "Content": "I stayed here for four nights in April 2012 and found my room was filthy \u2013 dust everywhere; my TV remote was caked with old dirt and the bathroom vanity/pullout mirror was covered in other womens' makeup \u2013 nauseating. Every day I put the mirror and turned it at an angle to draw attention to how dirty it was, and every day it was put back as though it was actually clean. I mentioned it to the manager on my way out who said he'd be addressing the problem. Let me know your thoughts on Room 818 in that case. This may just be a case of too few staff cleaning too many rooms in too short a time, but it has really affected my view of the hotel. If that's the dirt I can see, where else are they cutting corners? Also to note, the computer and internet access are $3 for 15 minutes on an old, old system.

I say okay, there wasn't anything REALLY wrong with it, but it was all the 'little' things you know? We ended up changing rooms as the first room we were given (we booked online), was tiny and had a really big old eyesore of a house right outside the window that really looked like a deathtrap and needed to be torn down. This room was so small, we could barely move around the double beds. The faucet leaked and water spewed out all over the counter. We were moved without any issues, to a room facing the front which had a slightly better view, but a bit more noise (wasn't a problem though). Room cleanliness, was OK, ( I did find some gum on the carpet which remained there throughout our stay even though I'd mentioned it, so that didn't really impress me all that much). The rooms had full stocked mini bar, but no corkscrew, and the bell hop had to come up and open our wine for us. For a wine 'themed' hotel, I was surprised by this. The wine tasting..... well.. we never got to go to this even though we were there 3 nights, as it was at a VERY awkward time, and only for one hour, between 5-6. I would suggest it be a bit longer (2-3 hours would have been perfect)... you could have come back from a full day, had a nice glass of wine, then got ready and headed out again for the evening. We used the fitness facilities here... not too bad, and the view was good. The elliptical trainer's computer didn't work, so you could USE it, just not know exactly what you were accompllshing. They had a water cooler up there for guests, however, there were NO disposable cups (shame, because who brings there water bottle on vacation?) Jacuzzi was great.... nice and hot.... however the jets didn't work :( The beds were small. My cousin and I each had a double bed, but you definitely would NOT book this room for 4 adults... the beds were hard and I don't think they actually had boxsprings, just some kind of hard platform that squeaked when you moved on the mattress. The ;staff were helpful at this hotel, but it didn't really 'knock my socks' off you know? It wasn't bad, but it was the little things overall that just kind of added up.... including having to call down to the front desk for more toilet paper......

The hotel mostly looks like it was nice, once, maybe in the early 80s. But, maintenance has been lacking: the walls in the hallways and elevator could use painting, rooms look old and out of date. The images that they show on their website are all of the honeymoon suite (which they don't tell you), but even that room (which they gave us for a small upgrade charge after we complained) was only just average. The biggest complaint is probably noise: walls are very thin, so anytime someone walks down the hall or opens the door to their own room, it sounds exactly like someone is walking into yours, which can be startling. Also, the heating/AC unit is very loud and sounds like there are some marbles rolling around in there. This was true both of the original room we had and later the honeymoon room.

The mattress and pillows were awful. I've stayed at Ramada's that were more comfortable. I've stayed in an Executive brand hotel before which I believe the one in Harrison Hot Springs is - total luxury compared to downtown Vancouver ! The pillow was the worst.

Since we wanted to save on our food budget, having kitchen facilities was a must. The room came with a FULL kitchen - stove w/ oven, fridge w/ freezer, dishwasher, glassware, utensils, etc. Small food markets were nearby. A nice amenity was the in-suite clothes washer & dryer. The room (a 2 bedroom suite; one room with a Double bed, the other with a King bed) was great for our group of 2 couples - there were 2 full bathrooms (one with shower, the other with shower/tub), great closet space, comfortable living/dining space (3-seat sofa, reclining armchair, desk w/ chair, large flatscreen tv, etc.). Note to travelers from outside North America : a Double bed does not mean 2 beds. The furniture and decor was functional and comfortable. The beds did not seem to be as hard as other reviewers have mentioned. As for the wine theme of the hotel, besides the wine sample in the hotel lounge/restaurant (which we didn't go to), there was no other wine \"theming\" we noticed. I'm not certain what the expectation of the other reviewers was...perhaps a fully stocked wine cabinet in each room?(There are liquor stores within a 5 minute walk that sell wine, beer, etc.) Given that the hotel is located in an urban environment, 100s of km away from any vineyards, I'm not sure how it could be more wine \"themed\". The location was excellent; within a 5 minute walk to convenience stores, coffee shops, English Bay, restaurants, nightclubs, etc. The proximity to the Granville street bridge made me glad that we were on a high floor - although if we had always kept our windows closed, we wouldn't have noticed any traffic noise. There was no room attendant on the second day of our stay - which was a little disappointing. We just threw our towels in the dryer to compensate. The price was reasonable, given the downtown location (C$313/night, including taxes). Parking was an additional C$27/night (including taxes). After finding out that the density of Vancouver is nearly the same as New York City, I accepted that rooms would be a little pricier than other cities.

I found it to be clean, comfortable, in a good location (easy walk to downtown) and friendly staff. The hotel overall is a little dated but the rooms themselves I found to be up to date and very clean. There were only two things I could find fault with. Firstly, the airconditioning in the room was very loud when it cut in and cut out throughout the night to keep the room warm. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, and it was enought to wake me each time it kicked in. Finally, the big drawcard for me was that this was a wine themed hotel. Being a big fan of wine (and living near the Barossa Valley) I was keen to embed myself into a hotel which advertised itself as being themed in this way. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. yes, there were ceratinly large quotes around the foyer about wine and yes there was a picture in my room of a bottle of wine, but that was about it as far as I could see. I attended one of the 'complimentary wine tasting and reception' sessions in the restaurant, because I was genuinely interested in learning more about Canadian wine and the Canadian wine industry, and expected that there would have been a small selection of wines (from the featured winery) on offer with perhaps a cellar door staff member or one of the hotels staff to explain a little more about the wines on offer. What I did experience was a number of people (mainly alone) sitting at individual tables in the small bar area drinking the half a glass of complimentary 'merlot' that was the wine of the day. The staff member asked me if I was there for the wine tasting, told me that the merlot was the wine of the day, poured me a glass and I then found my own table and drank wine on my own! I asked the young lady about the wine and other than telling me it was from a Canadian wine region not too far away, I got not much more. Don't get me wrong, I was not expecting a major wine event, but I did want to make the point for any of you serious 'winies' who may be thinking you'll stay simply for the wine theme, that it may not be as good as you think But if you are simply looking for a good, comfy, clean and safe hotel, then the Executive should fit the bill", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cDirty room\u201d", "Author": "lilyblue3", "ReviewID": "UR106700931", "Content": "I booked this hotel through the BMO Vancouver Marathon \"recommended hotels\" page.

We left for dinner and told the front desk about the unclean room on our way out, they said they would have it cleaned. We came back to find a complimentary bottle of wine, which was nice. The bucket that it came in - a plastic bucket that chemicals were formerly stored in (the label was still on it) - was a bit odd. The rest of the stay was pleasant enough, although they did post a flyer for a \"BMO Vancouver Marathon Breakfast\" starting at 6am. I asked if it was complimentary and the front desk had to look up our reservation to see if we qualified.

There was also a huge spa bath with a shower over it which was lovely. One the second leg however we were put in a room with 2 double beds which was much bigger, smaller bathroom, but the beds were tiny! Neither of us is large by any stretch of the imagination, but we struggled to fit in together! The two rubbish things for me at this hotel were a) the TV system which wasn't normal channels but some weird computerised system that was not easy to use at all. It was as if they wanted to make it difficult so that you would just give up and pay for a movie and b)The wine tasting was a bit of a joke. Not really wine tasting but just a spash of wine in your glass to 'taste' and that was it- just one wine. However, now I have seen how expensive wine is in BC so I can understand that at \u00a350 a room they can't really be expected to host a lavish wine tasting every night! I can't believe that advertise it as such as it seems to upset people more than not offering anything at all! The hotel was extremely good value but I would only stay here again if I got the same deal (because it was cheap) not because it was 'stand out' in any way.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cStay elsewhere if you can\u201d", "Author": "MartinAdrogu\u00e9", "ReviewID": "UR83668322", "Content": "I spent two nights here with my family in order to explore Vancouver.

It\u2019s number one asset is the staff. Not just a couple of people, but every single person I met from the GM to the cleaner was friendly, helpful and couldn\u2019t do enough for me. In particular Allen, Gus, Ashley and Jennifer were fantastic. They gave me suggestions about their favourite things to see and do in the city etc. And they upgraded me from my hotel room to a luxury apartment on the 18th (top) floor\u2013 so I had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, massive open plan lounge/kitchen/dining, laundry (bonus!), walk in wardrobes, spa bath and stunning vistas all the way around overlooking False Creek, Granville Island etc. I was dancing around in the great bit space wishing I had someone to enjoy it with! The food in the restaurant La Vallee was EXCELLENT. They had a 3 course special which was just divine. And they have other specials each day such as Martini Thursday. Only downside was that there are no pay-for-view movies in the apartments. For me as a solo traveller, I like the option of watching films at night. But there were 50+ channels of cable television and DVD players. The wine receptions also need to be re-named. It was more of a wine \u2018sampling\u2019 \u2013 with one wine tasted each evening between 5-6pm. But it was a good idea and a great place to meet people and talk. I got the feeling most people were expecting more wines to taste and/or something to snack on (because of the name of it). But these little things didn't spoil it for me at all - as the service was so excellent. The second best thing the hotel has going for it is the location. I just thought it was the best place to stay in the city. It was only a two block walk downhill to the aqua bus over to Granville Island (a place I loved so much that I went there 3 times). You had the blue route trolley bus pickup right next door at the Quality Inn and the red route pickup just around the corner at the Cascadia Hotel. Walk a couple of blocks up and right on Davie and you were in Yaletown for all the restaurants, or a couple of blocks up and left on Davie and you were in the Davie Village shops (internet shop, supermarket, bottle store etc). Then just straight up 6 blocks or so to the heart of the city and the Skytrain, Canada line train, Pacific Centre shopping, Art Gallery etc. Nice scenic walks both ways from bottom of hill around to Yaletown/False Creek or along English Bay to Stanley Park. I would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend this to other travellers who like to walk a city and like to be away from the big brand hotels and cruise ship passengers (on the other side of town).", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mexico city", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "maukd", "ReviewID": "UR76337893", "Content": "The hotel is great located, one block from the sigthseeing tour stop and public transportation.

ROOM: The room was really small but clean. The bed is the most comfortable I have slept on and I would stay at this hotel again just for that alone. Although very small (reminded me of Parisian hotel rooms), the room had everything I needed. However, I would suggest that the hotel update their furniture and information desk-packets as the furniture was nicked up and the info package had stains and typos. With regards to noise as addressed by previous reviewers, I was on the 9th floor and did not hear any noise of the highway ramp outside. LOCATION: The location was fine \u2013 I have no complaints in that regard. It was a five minute walk to catch the water taxi to Granville Island and the hop-on/hop-off trolley car stops in front of the hotel next door. Also I took local transit to the Airport and the bus stop was only 2 blocks away on the same side of the street and cost me $2.50 to get to the airport. I walked across town from the hotel to Canada Place (the opposite side of town) and it took me a comfortable 20-25 minutes - so for people who like to explore on foot the location of this hotel should not be a problem. There are also a couple of convenience stores around the corner. RESTAURANT: I managed to eat at the restaurant one night as I was too tired to venture out again and was pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent and the food was good and fairly priced. Overall, I would stay at this hotel next time I visit Vancouver but only if I received the same price or very similar.

Our intention was to have them stay within walking distance of our apt, give them the facilities of a suite i.e. laundry/kitchen and also give them a view of sunsets over English Bay. The best suites are west facing and have balconies. The price was not a problem. I booked the suites in person. I checked on the reservation 3 times. At each visit I offered a credit card as a deposit to confirm the bookings. This was refused. Imagine my surprise when we were informed by a voicemail message on the night before the family's arrival that all nine of them were to moved to one of this Chain's out of town properties- namely Richmond, BC! We quickly scrambled to find another hotel (at a hugely increased cost to us) so as to ensure we were close together on this first visit to Vancouver of our Australian family. After this experience I visited the management in person. Suddenly I could not get confirmation of the suites I had booked several months in advance for the return family visit. But hoped things would work themselves out. Then, shortly before they were to return, I got an email from the Hotel's Sales Manager saying that our party\u2019s bookings had been changed. - One couple had been assigned a \u201cRegular\" hotel room. No laundry/kitchen/view and small room. (Avoid these like the plague!) - The configuration and location of the other previously booked suites would now require us to book another suite at further cost! - View rooms were no longer available. - Rooms were now on lower floors close to the bridge or facing away from English Bay. (Avoid lower level suites/rooms overlooking the Granville Street Bridge - noisy traffic.) As mentioned above, the best suites are west facing and have balconies. Of course, if you book them you may find, as we did, that you won't get what you have asked for even if you have confirmed several times. Our solution was to move our guests to the hotel next door (the Quality Inn) It did not offer the \"potential\" of the views sought from the Executive Inn and had a lower rating. But we found the Front Desk and staff could not have been more helpful even with our late booking and the rooms were as promised! Naturally we moved our NZ family who were to arrive a couple of weeks later out of this property.

My second impression upon arrival was - well, this seems like your typical boutique hotel in downtown Vancouver; intimate, tastefully urban, and well planned. We checked into our room and both my fiance and I were quite surprised about the size of the room. Sure, we have stayed in much smaller rooms in downtown Vancouver but we selected a superiour room which was supposed to be the middle offering of their room selection. But the room seemed remotely reminiscent of those found at the Empire Landmark hotel with the noteable exception that these rooms have better albeit still aging fixtures. Nonetheless, my fiance selected this hotel because of the whirlpool bath which was very nice! We were not dissappointed beside a few exceptions. 1) plan on 30 minutes to fill the whirlpool. The water comes out very slowly, which sort of ruins the romantic mood that one otherwise would expect to enjoy with such an amenity. 2) be patient with the room thermostat. Once you select your temperature, the HVAC unit takes its time to \"fire-up.\" I did not know this and sware I spent 10 minutes trying to get the thing on, as the room was very stuffy upon arrival (it was a nice sunny spr/ummer day). It does eventually come on and worked fine. 3) No movie selection here. I mean, come on .. no typical movie channels or even good pay per view selection. It appears their entertainment system was manufactured during the early 1990s as its not very modern. One would ask why this would matter in a world class city like Vancouver, where there is soooo much to do. Well, when you return to the hotel after doing the Van City you might want to see a private movie (no dirty thoughts!!!). Poor selection and it is not \"on demand,\" as you wait for the time the movie will show. It has been years if not decades since the last time I've seen such an antiquated entertainment option. 4) The front desk seemed quite surprised to have guests during my visit. When I checked in, he seemed rather amazed that I selected his hotel. After experiencing the above 3 comments, I now realize why he might think this. My fiance and I frequent Vancouver BC very often, as we live in the Seattle area and going up to the big city is \"nothing\" for us. We often stay at more expensive, higher class hotels but she wanted to try a more budget option with a whirlpool bath ensuite, hence our stay here. But the front desk did not have the usual dimeanor of most Vancouver hotels as he was not very hospitable nor did he suck-up to us. We love these things and often tip people who make us feel welcome and special, so his behaviour was a disappointment. Beyond those special notes, if you're on a budget and want a quieter place to stay downtown this place will not let you down. We had a terrific view of English Bay and the West End and the nightlife was hardly noticeable near the hotel; quite a surprise since this is downtown Vancouver where nightlife is abundant everywhere, all-of-the-time. And the whirlpool bath did live up to our expectations. We loved it and even used it as a benchmark for our future purchase of one. We did not like the fact that the shower was also there (not separate) but hey I did say this was a small hotel room, you know. One final note, I noticed that the entertainment system had a channel for tourism Vancouver. Im not sure if every hotel has this channel now (as I dont recall the channel on my last visit to Vancouver at a different hotel in Jan 2005) but THIS CHANNEL is world class, well done, and very attractive especially for the tourist to Vancouver. I learned much about the city and I have been coming here for years now. And the tone of the channel and its commercials are sexy, sophisticated, artistic, and modern - just like Downtown Vancouver itself. I must commend Tourism Vancouver for the channel and must emai them also. Of course, downtown Vancouver was awesome. In fact, we had more fun during this visit than probably any other vacation we have been on. Perhaps this is the reason for my rating the hotel as above average, I mean I did have a nice sleep, conducted my business downtown successfully, and my fiance had a lovely time. But I must be honest that we probably will not stay here again due to the above issues unless my fiance has a desire to stay in these budget accomodations again, with a private whirlpool bath.", "Date": "April 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Amy50", "ReviewID": "UR2873471", "Content": "I had a wonderful stay here!
