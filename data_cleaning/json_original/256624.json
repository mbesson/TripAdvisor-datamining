As you walk in to your apartment and down the hallway everything else is lost in the fact that when you hit the lounge/dining room there before you is the amazing site of Sydney Harbour with both the Harbour Bridge and Opera House in perfect view. Pulling ourselves away from the view, the apartment was a great size with many great features. Two bedrooms, one with a king bed and ensuite(including a bath), the other bedroom with a queen size bed and another bathroom just outside. If needed both the beds can be split into two singles which is great when travelling with children. There was a fully equiped laundry(would be great for longer stays) and a kitchen complete with fridge, oven top, stove & microwave. The indoor pool was great and that also has magnificant views over Sydney Harbour. We only used the restaurant for breakfast but found the buffet breakfast had a wide variety. We found all the staff to be pleasant and helpful, from check-in to having room service dinner delivered(why eat out when you can order in and just sit back at 'your' dining table and soak in the view). On our second day my husband discovered that he had left his sunglasses in our car which had been valet parked. This was no trouble to the Concierge who in a matter of minutes had gone down to the car and retrieved them for him. The rate for Quay West Suites is comparable to other big city hotels, and even if it does cost a little bit extra it cannot be beaten for size, location and did I mention the view?", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guernsey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Holiday\u201d", "Author": "keentraveller362", "ReviewID": "UR128078042", "Content": "My sister, my daughter and I have just spent an amazing 10 days in a 2 bedroom suite with fantastic views of the harbour and opera house.

The staff was friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel was excellent. It was a 15 minute walk to the Opera House, which we went to twice. It is a closer walk to the ferry pier ( any visitors to Sydney should do themselves a favor and take a ferry trip to Manly, even if you don't get off the ferry, it is a great way to see the city)and a 10 minute walk to the botanical garden. Sydney is an expensive city and the fact that your hotel room has a kitchen is a real money saver. Ask at the desk for directions to Woolworths (the Australian Safeway) and you can buy food there. Eating out can really eat up your dollars, if you do it for every meal. I also liked that the room had a washer and dryer for your clothes. But the best part of this experience was the view from you room. We paid more for a room that had a harbor view, but it was worth it. You get a balcony and you can see a lot of Sydney harbor, including the Opera House and the ferry pier. It was constant action out of our window. The suite consisted of the bedroom and a large room that was a combination living room/kitchen, so you had much more space than your average hotel room.

The room itself was very clean, modern, spacious (as i am a active wheelchair user), with a bath and shower which had a removable shower seat. The maid service was very good with daily linen & towel changes as you would expect. The room service charges were comparable with local restaurants in the Rocks area. Matt, James & all the other staff/managers couldn't do enough for us and gave good recommendations for local restaurants & attractions. We checked out for a few days to visit The Great Barrier Reef - Quay West kindly allowed us to leave some of our bags free of charge in their luggage storage. All these little services made our honeymoon hassle free & enjoyable. There is also a free to use desktop PC in the lobby if you don't fancy paying for WiFi.

I have been visiting Sydney every few years since the early 90's, both for business and vacation. It has become so expensive, though, that this will probably be my last trip to a wonderful city. Having said that, I can really recommend the Quay West Suites. When planning for my 2012 visit, I decided to stay for two full weeks and wanted a hotel that could provide plenty of space for just relaxing between shows, dining out and special events. After researching a number of hotels in Sydney, I decided on Quay West Suites. The description of the accommodations sounded like what I wanted, and the location at The Rocks was important given the number of operas, symphonies and plays I planned to attend at the Sydney Opera House. Possibly because I had booked in for two weeks, I was upgraded to a larger suite upon my arrival...certainly a pleasant surprise! Aside from a spectacular view and the accommodations I was hoping for, there were several other features that made me really enjoy this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful, professional and friendly. There were a lot of little touches around the suite that I would expect in a top-ranked hotel, and others that were a nice surprise, such as the complimentary detergent provided for the washer/dryer, which allowed me to return home with a suitcase full of clean clothes! Another plus, which I didn't really notice until the very end of my stay was the \"quiet.\" No sounds from adjoining suites or heavy footsteps tromping overhead...just an occasional ferry horn from the Harbor below, and on the last night of my stay, the sound of explosions coming from a spectacular fireworks display near the Opera House, which I enjoyed viewing from the dining table in my suite! Other than that it was one of the most relaxing hotels I've ever stayed in. I should note that this particular February-March (Summer in Australia) was one of the rainiest in Sydney's history, so it was especially nice to curl up with a book on the sofa in my full-size living room and whip up an occasional snack in my fully-equipped kitchen when I couldn't be out hiking about town or sightseeing.

Rooms were in good condition, views outstanding, the pool on level 23 & 24 has uninterrupted views of Harbour bridge and Opera House (see photos) and has a glass side wall. We had breakfast in their restuarant - good selection of hold, cold and pastries, etc.. and plenty to eat.

I absolutely obsessed over where to stay in Sydney with 2 kids and I am so glad that I chose this one. First of all it is not easy to find a hotel near the harbor that will accommodate a family of four (most only allow 3 people per room) but this hotel with their 1 bedroom suites plus sofa bed was perfect. Rooms are not super modern but are well appointed and very clean (with kitchen and laundry). The location and service are what make the place. From the time we checked in their service was commendable. It was 9am and our room wasn't ready so they gave us towels to take to the pool (which has a beautiful room of the harbor) and had us in our room by 11am. The hotel is in between the Shangri-la and the Four Seasons and is only a 5 minute walk from the harbor and a 15 minute walk to the Opera House. There is no better deal in the city for this hotel class than their \"Kids Gone Wild\" Package. For $349 (2 night minimum) it includes a 1 bedroom city view suite, buffet breakfast for 2 adult/2 kids (value $120 per day and it is a really nice buffet), family pass to the Taronga Zoo ($128) and valet parking. I checked out the Westin while we were in town which I previously had booked and canceled. It looked very nice but is much further away from the harbor. It is a little more expensive, and although their \"heritage rooms\" are very big, they still have 2 beds in the same room which isn't always easy with little ones.

You may question why my title is \"Comfortably Dull\" when the way I have described this room sounds adequate. The hotel lacks a factor which is what I always look for in hotels. An element of \"Uniqueness\". Everything is very standard. Although the room may be comfortably is far from unique with an element of character about it. The lobby is very plain and extremely boring.

I informed Raphael about the cold food situation, however she didn't appear to be bothered and made no attempt to rectify the situation.

A highlight of the hotel is the heated indoor pool and spa located on the 23rd floor, as well as a sundeck. The pool looks out over the harbour and is fantastic! A great way to relax after exploring all day. The hotel's location is perfect, about 5mins walk from Circular Quay train. A little easier way to get to the hotel is to walk on to George St through the reception at the Four Seasons Hotel, take their lift up to level 2 and they have a back exit to Harrington St, cross the road to the Quay West car parking where there is a lift up to Gloucester Street. This cuts out most of the hills to the hotel and makes it easier with suitcases! But i wouldn't advise getting caught by the staff of the 4 Seasons!!

I suggest getting your rates PER NIGHT in writing 100%. They upped our rates on various nights by $69 AUD. I had to speak to the manager, as I felt scammed. They ended up finally just increasing it by $19 on various nights. How can a place get away with this? We were told our rate was $159 per night for 7 nights. When we checked out, some of the nights were $180, $205, $169.. very strange--WHAT A SCAM, and WHAT UTTER BS. Other than this, we loved the staff, the hotel, the convenience of being so close to everything, yet blocks away from the noise. We would return here, but would simply request the nightly rate--BY DATE-- in writing. The hotel does not have the service of Shangri La, but feels more like \"home\" to people. LCD TVs in the living room, bedroom also, nice bathroom, Bliss shower products, dish soap, laundry soap. Doing laundry while traveling is a nice convenience and this alone makes this place worth staying. Even if there is noise, which we did not hear, you can turn up the air such that it is loud. DSL, etc for a price, pay per view, etc. Staff was really nice here also. Did not care for the changing rates..

The with charm and grace, the bellhops lugged our giant suitcases up 10 flights of stairs with only the glow of flashlights to guide us. Huffing and puffing, it was an experience I will never forget. We returned to Sydney in August 2007, again to stay at the Quay West. I must say I was just as pleased years later. We love the magnificent view and the spaciousness of the apartments. The location is perfect for sightseeing. Everyone in our family of five had their own comfortable bed - plus two bathrooms AND a washer/dryer. The kitchen is adequate. Perfectly suited for a take-out dinners and everything you need to make your own breakfasts. There are grocery stores within walking distance. One of our rooms had an enormous patio. But perhaps our favorite amenity of this hotel is it's swimming pool, hot tub, workout room and sauna on the upper floors. There is nothing better to combat jet-lag or relax from a day of sightseeing than a refreshing swim or a work-out. Most of the time, we were the lone occupants in the facility. The view over the city and harbor is breathtaking.

Actually we stayed here for 3 nights (we booked a special package - stay 3 pay for 2). We arrived after our wedding reception at approximately 12.45am and we were checked in straight away. Our bags were brought up to our room by the bellboy - fantastic. When we booked the room we made a note to the reservations office that it was our honeymoon and we had requested either a harbour view or a floor high up. We ended up with the latter (approx 15 floors up from memory). The view was ok and if we looked to the very side of our living area we were able to see a glimpse of the harbour bridge. Lucky for us if we looked into the reflection of the windows of the hotel opposite we could in fact see the harbour. When we had settled into the room (approx 20 mins later) I phoned reception and requested a bottle of champagne or wine be sent up (because I was assuming this would be included already and 'waiting in our room'). We were expecting a \"no problem sir it will be up shortly\" but instead we were cut off and were told that we would be receiving a call back from the night manager. About 10 minutes later the manager phoned back and said \"sorry we are unable to offer you any champagne as you did not request it when you booked\". WHAT? AM I HEARING THIS RIGHT??? We could not believe what he had just told us!! To be denied this on your own wedding night really got us down. I mean we have had friends and family stay in cheaper accommodation on their own wedding night and they even got a surprise in their room (strawberries AND champagne). But for us we got NOTHING. Only a room on a supposed \"high floor\". We really felt like we were staying in a motel at this point on. Because thats how we felt we were being treated. Don't get me wrong, the room was lovely and spacious, bathroom fittings were ok etc. The location was great as well (5 min walk to Circular Quay, the Rocks etc).

Being a family of five, normal hotels are always impossible to stay in due to us always needing two rooms. We didn't want to have to sacrifice class for space and the Quay West didn't disappoint. The single best factor about our two bedroom suite was the view of the harbor. It is stunning to wake up every day with a front row view of the bridge on your left, the activity of Circular Quay in the center, and the Opera House to the right. The view is worth every penny and I couldn't take enough pictures of it. The furniture is nice and is done in a modern style. I found the style a nice compliment to the view which is the true show case. A stuffy room with lots of wood and fabric would take away from the views which is the true natural artwork of the room. The kitchen came fully equipped and we were able to make breakfast each day in the room and had two dinners in the room also. The hotel will go shopping for you (for a price of course:) or you can walk ten minutes to the Coles Central Grocery on George Street. The beds were a little firm, but none the less still comfortable. The two bedrooms each had a view out over the water that leads into Darling Harbor. We used the washing machine twice and it was nice to refresh clothes before continuing our three week vacation. The two bathrooms were nicely appointed in marble and fit in nicely. The staff is kind and very professional. The maids did an excellent job and the room looked spotless every time we returned. The location is one of the best in the desirable Rocks/ Circular Quay area. It was a five minute walk to the ferries, ten to the Opera and Royal Gardens, five to ten minutes to the city center, and fifteen minutes to Darling Harbor. Sydney is not a huge city to walk around (in the CBD), but some areas are obviously more upscale than others and the Quay West is in one the nicest as exemplified by all its upscale neighbors like the Four Seasons, Shangri La, ect... and the designer stores around it. I used the gym and the treadmill is fine and the pool is very nice, but we didn't use it as it isn't large enough for the amount of people that wanted to swim. There were probably six groups/ families in the pool everytime we wanted to go and elbow to elbow in a pool isn't our idea of fun. On a quiet day I think the pool is probably great. Other than that, the hotel was great, the staff worked out our confusing reservation/ change of dates seamlessly, and we had a great time in Sydney while at the Quay West.
