The location was terrific -- short walk to the Colosseum, metro, and several markets/restaurants. After visiting the nearby Church of St. Peter in Chains, we found a park where we were able to purchase espressos and watch the locals. It was only a short 10 min walk from the hotel and we enjoyed returning several times during our trip to get away from the hustle & bustle of the traffic. The hotel was extremely clean and tasteful. The bed was a bit hard and the bathroom needed some updating but these were only minor issues. Alberta was a wonderful host. She provided many useful recommendations regarding local markets for supplies as well as restaurants. As we had an early morning flight back, she was kind enough to provide some instruction on how to prepare cappuccinos since we were leaving before she arrived in the morning. We did tire of the same simple breakfast each morning by the end of the week although it was always fresh. My only true concern was the noise from Via Cavour at night. There is a restaurant/bar close to the hotel entrance. Workers cleaning up around 1-2am would make quite a racket before they left. After two days, I purchased a set of ear plugs at the pharmacy next door which took care of the problem.

Now for the CONS: we stayed in a room on the courtyard side and I have to warn all that the restaurant downstairs is noisy throughout the night until about 3am, moving tables, stacking chairs, staff conversing. Then it quiets until about 5am and starts up all over again. Coupled with the hardest mattress we slept on (and I sleep on a semi-firm at home - this one was very, very firm), and pillows with no give to them, equaled the worst sleep we had while in Italy. As another reviewer mentioned, breakfast was a spartan affair - a croissant, yogurt, juice, and coffee.

The bathroom is very small, but has the essentials. Because the air conditioning was on we kept the bathroom door shut so did not hear the noise from the street and nearby restaurant while we slept. We slept very well, and the hotel was very quiet, in part because of the small size of the accommodations (less than 10 rooms). Each morning when you are ready for breakfast, you ring Alberta (or one of her staff if she is out of town for a day or two) and they bring a tray with continental breakfast -- croissants, bread, juice, cocoa, coffee. Basics to get your day started. We found it tied us over until we had a light snack mid-day and then a full dinner in the evenings. As other reviewers have noted, the real gem of this hotel is Alberta -- she was so responsive by email before our stay, arranging for airport transport (so nice to step out of the terminal at Ciampino and see the driver holding the sign with our name on it!), making restaurant recommendations and reservations for dinner. She and her staff are wonderful. Via Cavour is a busy street, without much charm, but step off a block and you have the character-filled streets of the Monti neighborhood full of cafes, churches and shops.

The rooms were immaculate and spacious, and decorated with themed movie posters - My wife and I were lucky to be in the Honeymoon room, with the La Dulce Vita poster!! The hotel is a budget hotel, and is very inexpensive by Rome standards, but you couldn't find a more gracious hostess than Alberta, and a wonderfully maintained small business right in the heart of the Eternal City.

We selected Hotel Paba after reading lots of reviews, comparing prices, and weighing our options for quite a while... and we chose wisely, indeed! Hotel Paba is run by the delightful Signora Castelli and we received a warm welcome every time we returned to our room after long days of site-seeing. (For those of us who aren't lucky enough to have an Italian grandmother, Signora Castelli provides a glimpse as to how delightful that experience would be.) It's located on the second floor (which means the third floor to those of us who count the ground floor as the first) of a building with a charming, tiny elevator and wide marble stairs. This is not some cookie-cutter hotel... there's only a handful of rooms and you really feel as though you're slipping into Italian life by living in an apartment during your stay. Rome is a pretty grueling town for tourists... so you need a hotel that's both centrally located and comfortable. Hotel Paba is right by the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, making it ideal for tourist activities (and making for a great walk home in the evenings after dinner, with all the ruins lit up!). It's also close to the train station, the Colosseum metro stop, and several bus lines -- you'll be well-situated for all your exploration and transport needs. We visited Italy in August, which means we were prepared for high temperatures, and with Hotel Paba's air conditioning, we were always grateful to collapse into its cool embrace. We were in the \"Honeymoon\" room, which featured Italian posters of Roman Holiday, To Catch a Thief, and Gone with the Wind. It had windows that opened on to the street, giving you a bird's eye view onto the bustling street below -- but once the windows were closed, the room was wonderfully quiet and serene. The bed was enormous and is perhaps the firmest bed I've ever slept on, but after running around the city all day, we never had any trouble sleeping. Signora Castelli brings breakfast to your room and she's a warm, wonderful woman with all kinds of information about her city. Do yourself a favor and stay at Hotel Paba when you visit Rome. You'll be getting a wonderful deal for your money (without breaking the bank by any means) and you'll come away from your own Roman holiday with charming memories of a unique and sweet establishment. You'll wish that every other hotel you stay at had a Signora Castelli waiting behind the desk to greet you upon your arrival.

However, we did not bother as sleeping deeply was not our purpose for our 3-day trip in Rome. Also, since the building is old, there was noise when other room occupants were flashing their toilets or were having a bath. The only significant drawback was that we discovered hair from previous occupants in the bathroom floor and on the bed sheet. However, we did not complain to the Hotel lady, so we cannot accuse her of taking no action. On the contrary, I am sure that if we had compained, she would do her best to satisfy us.

Wonderful fresh crossaint, bread with assorted cheeses, yogurt, juice and choice of several hot beverages.

We were around the corner from the Colosseum and a short walk from the Termini Station. We walked everywhere. The furtherest point was Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica which was only about 20 - 25 minutes at a slow pace. But it is part of the experience to stroll the streets and enjoy the views and stop along the way to grab a gelato or snap some photos. Some Rome Tips: If you have the chance, eat in the area of Travestere. This is a wonderful and authentic Roman neighborhood. Fantastic restaurants and the prices are much lower than the other areas. Grab a bottle of wine and relax on the Spanish Steps - and try to ignore the people pushing flowers. Just say no and they will leave you alone. Not a big deal so don't let it ruin your vacation. The audio tours are worth a little extra to get a history and background of the sites (Colosseum, Vatican Museum). Also, keep an eye on the street vendors' prices. They are higher than the actual souveneir shops so look out for price tags on the street vendor items (they will mark them up and then offer you them at half price which is still higher than shops). They are not honest people which is something we figured out by doing some quick comparison shopping. We did not have any issues with pick pockets.

It's not easy to find a hotel that can accommodate 5 people in one room, especially in Rome, and what a find this was! We had the \"Happy Family\" room (love the name!) which was spacious enough for all five of us PLUS our five suitcases! The room, described by Rick Steves as \"chocolate-box tidy\" was spotless, comfortable, and nicely decorated. It has a king-sized bed (big enough for my husband, me, and the 10 year old, and although we could have had an extra bed set up for her, we opted not to and were fine), a twin bed, and then another twin in an adjoining little bedroom (claimed by my 14 year old son). There's free wi-fi in the room, a satellite tv, safe, hotpot for tea and mini-fridge which was perfect for our drinks and snacks. The bathroom was spotless and included a bidet. Although it is located on busy Via Cavour, we had no problem with street noise. The location is perfect...just a short walk from the forum and colosseum and close to sightseeing, bus stops, two metro stations, shops, ristorantes, bars and gelaterias (very important for kids)! The gem in the crown, though, is Signora Alberta Castelli, who runs her hotel efficiently and lovingly. She was very helpful in suggesting transportation, restaurant, itineraries, you name it. We looked forward to seeing her every morning as she brought us our yummy Italian continental breakfast (fresh delicious sweet croissants, rolls/jelly/butter/cheese, hot chocolate, espresso, orange juice and yogurt). She translated a phone call from an Italian family friend for me, gave us tips for our daily outings, helped me with my (bad) Italian and was always gracious and ready to help. All this for a very reasonable price. Oh--and don't be put off by the exterior of the building in which the hotel is housed. Unfortunately the door has been graffiti'd (as we found was the trend in much of Rome) and the trash cans for the block are lined up outside, but it has nothing to do with the quality of or the interior of the building. It is a great area of Rome in which to stay, with lots of sights to see within a short walking distance and everything else easily accessible by bus or metro. As some other reviewers mentioned, the king-sized mattress in our room was very firm, but the only one who cared was my super-picky husband, who traded with the 12 year old and slept in the twin bed for the last few days and was fine. Pina, the very pleasant chamber lady did an excellent job of housekeeping, providing fresh linens and towels daily.

HUGE king bed (a little stiff, but not bad)... plenty of room for luggage and clothes in the armoir. the bathroom was great with a good sized shower stall and a heighth- adjustable shower head... convenient for those of us who are tall (i'm 6'6\"). alberta serves a simple but great breakfast of pastries, yogurt, tea, coffee and european crackers anytime you like, all of which is included in your stay. the hotel is a 10 minute walk to the colloseum and a major metro stop. it is not close to the vatican/ st. peter's/piazza navona, but just hop on the metro or the 116 bus and you're there. plenty of restaurants nearby, but DO NOT eat at MASSENZIO down on the corner... way over priced, crummy food served by rude staff. always seek out the places where locals eat... all in all, hotel paba is a great little place to base yourself while exploring rome... friendly, clean and a great value! you will get a lot for a small price in comparison to most of the other hotels in rome... travel safely :)", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDelightful clean little hotel perfect for a stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Ruebrezin", "ReviewID": "UR16533761", "Content": "Two words that cause me to give this hotel a very high rating are: Alberta Castelli. Alberta runs a wonderful, warm 7 room hotel located on the 2nd (Euro) floor of a building on Via Cavour, near the Colisseum. If you are looking for special grand scale amenities, this is not for you. But, if you are looking for a wonderfully clean hotel, with a person who can direct you to the finest (not necessarily expensive) restaurants, help you with reservations at museums, greet you with a friendly smile, serve you breakfast in your room (tables in all rooms); this is definitely the hotel for you. Don\u2019t let the 2-star scare you AT ALL! This is a great little hotel, on a busy-ish street. Because the hotel is only 7 rooms on the 2nd floor and not the entire building, the sign is small next to the door, but if you have the address with you, you or your driver will find it with no problem. Breakfast is croissants, little rolls and yogurt, juice or coffee or tea. Frankly, it was nice to eat and not have to get dressed beforehand! When you left your room, you were ready to head out for the day! I liked that right across from the hotel is a Tabachi, where you can buy train tickets, stamps, post cards, 2 shops where you can buy food, wine, olive oils, etc., and the post office. Just off the street on either side are little winding streets, like alleys, with little shops, restaurants, and gelato. If you head \u201cup\u201d Via Cavour towards the Metro stop and stay to the right, you will find a full service grocery store as well! We walked nearly everywhere and only succumbed to taxis at the end of some days because it was so unseasonably hot and we didn\u2019t have summer clothes with us! The taxis are easy, the drivers are friendly. Alberta suggested reservations if dining after 8 pm which we did on each night. We liked one restaurant so much, we went back twice, something I never do while on holiday. Some people have written here that the beds are hard, but honestly after a long day in Rome, I was perfectly comfortable \u2013 and I am not a good sleeper, but I was in Rome! When we arrived Alberta noted that the room she had booked for us, Room 7, would be too small as we had more bags than she realized. She wasted no time in making sure that the next day she would move us into a larger room, Room 4, on Via Cavour side as that room was available the next day. I would definitely stay here again on a next visit to Rome. It is like staying with your mom or grandmom and you treat the room as your own home, it is so clean and welcoming. OH \u2013 and there is even a tiny lift so you don\u2019t have to haul your bags up the stairs. The Via Cavour side is a bit noisier than the back side of the hotel, but that didn\u2019t bother us because we like to hear and see activity in a city where we are staying! There is A/C too and I admit that we did use it on a couple of nights when the temperature soared. Alberta is very responsive to your questions if you are planning to book, just email her and you will hear back from her the same day or next. Don\u2019t hesitate to book here!

After the first night, I had no trouble sleeping (either because I was so tired or because I became used to it). Just to show that this is somewhat subjective or a matter of taste, my husband had absolutely no problem sleeping and didn't think the bed was too firm. The breakfast is a simple continental style, with a croissant, cappuccino, rolls and spreads, yogurt and orange juice. We had plates and silver. I won't say it was exceptional or great, but the bread was fresh and tasty and it got us through the morning each day, plus it was included in the price and served in our room when we wanted. The decor in the room is pleasant, but not fancy. Overall, the room is a great value for the price in this expensive European city. It is centrally located, has good service and offers all the basic amenities you need (safe, TV, hair dryer, storage, clean bathroom, comfortable). I'd highly recommend it for those traveling on a budget who still want a clean, comfortable, nice room and want good customer service. It isn't for those looking for luxury accommodations.

All the other important piazza's, fountains and churches are around 10-15 mins walk away- although we were sure we could have found shorter routes but the Centro Storico is like a beautiful maze. The furthest we had to walk was to St Peters at 30 mins - we were amazed to find that it was free to walk around the basilica. The hotel was of very good quality for a 2 star - large rooms, high ceilings and well equipped bathrooms. We were disappointed to be given room 3 which was situated behind the reception desk (we heard guests arriving, phones ringing frequently) and which had no view at all but we rarely spent any time in the room. The breakfast was brought to our room but to be honest we only really ate the yoghurts. The croissants were coated in icing sugar (far too sweet for first thing in the morning), there were a few slices of a bizarre toast/biscuit thingy and a few jams and cheese spreads. I am sure it is authentic italian but it was all very indigestible at early morning. I recommend you buy some fruit and keep it in the fridge.

The location is fantastic, even closer to the Colosseum than it appears on maps. The room has a desk, a large wardrobe, a table with two chairs. The huge bed might be a tad too stiff for some, but I didn't mind. My boyfriend and I were assigned room 2, affectionately dubbed \"Lover's Nest\" on the door, ha ha. Movies of bad American movies (printed in Italian) decorate the walls, which lends a homey feel. There's a stocked mini fridge, but room to put in your own drinks. There's a radio and a small TV (essential for watching \"Quincy\" and \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" in Italian). The bathroom is completely modern, stocked with tissues and a hair dryer (not very powerful, but it works). One of the things I enjoyed most was having breakfast in the room. Alberta will bring you breakfast each morning on a little tray. Just ring her up and two minutes later, she's at your door with fresh croissants from the nearby bakery, yogurt, bread, cheese, cookies and jam, and whatever kind of coffee or tea you like. I liked not having to search for breakfast and saving time by eating right in the room before leaving for the day. Alberta is a great hostess. She was extremeley helpful in calling cabs for us (they arrive in 3 minutes - amazing) and warning us about crooked cabbies trying to overcharge unsuspecting tourists. We were there when daylight savings time ended, and she left notes on our door reminding us to reset our clocks to the new time. Very nice! Also, the carry-out pizza joint across the street was great - some of the best pizza I had. And pretty cheap. One piece of advice: If you plan to pay with cash (for a discount), make sure you find a working ATM in advance. The night we wanted to pay for the room, both ATMs near the hotel were out of order, and we didn't have time to find another one. So the lesson is, when you see a working ATM in Rome, use it.

In March, I had originally made reservations to stay from the 7th to the 12th, but about a month before my arrival in Rome, Alberta, the lovely lady who owns and runs the Paba, informed me that she made a mistake and double-booked my room. I had to stay across the hall in the Hotel Ferraro, which would cost 15 euros more (115 to 100 for the Paba) for a double/single use room. I appreciated the notice and that she made alternate accommodations for me that were so convenient to the Paba, but the Ferraro doesn't compare and even though she gave me the 15 euros in cash upon my checking out, it wasn't even worth anything close to 100 euros. So that was disappointing. When you book, just double-check the dates I suppose, to avoid something like that happening. But I think it was an anomaly and I doubt that she makes the mistake often. And the only reason it was actually a problem was because of the low quality of the other hotel. Now to the hotel itself. The location is great. It is right down the street from both the Colosseum and Forum, and any bus you could possibly need, plus the metro, are all within a 5 minute walk. Multiple supermarkets and restaurants and a travel agency and internet cafes with cheap internet are all within a minute or two walk from the hotel. I had room 7, right on the reception area and right by the door to the hotel's entrance. But the room faced away from the street, so it was quiet. I heard noise from reception once in a while, but because Alberta left around 9pm and didn't return until about 7:30am, my sleep was never disturbed. She brings you breakfast in your room anytime from 7:30am to noon; you just tell her when you want it. See the picture I posted of it. It wasn't fantastic, but it was an adequate amount of food to start the day and when I was there, everything was perfectly fresh. When I checked in, I was given a very very helpful bus map, on which she outlined several of the major sites and how to get there. This was most helpful as there are so many buses in Rome that can be confusing. Any time I had questions, she or the other woman who was sometimes there were more than happy to help, look things up for me, arrange a cab to the train station for my departure, etc. Really friendly and helpful service. The room itself was good-sized. A huge bed that was actually 2 beds pushed together, but that wasn't noticeable. There was a satin covering on the sheets, which was nice. A little marble table, with chairs, for breakfast, a closet, a minibar/fridge, plenty of light, plenty of electrical outlets, and I found the bed to be comfortable, but yes as other reviews have said, it is firm. But I didn't find it so hard that it was a problem. There was a small TV up on the wall, which got a lot of stations but only BBC World in English. The bathroom was adequate with a separate shower and big sink. Everything was perfectly clean and in good condition. The air conditioning was powerful and remote-controlled. There is no internet service at the hotel. Alberta offered to let me borrow her laptop if I needed it, which was a nice gesture, but she would not give out the password for her wireless so I could use my own laptop. But the proximity of several internet cafes made it bearable if you are like me and need to check the email every day. All in all, this is a very good hotel and was worth the 100 euros. The mixup with my reservation was unfortunate because that hotel was nowhere near the class that the Hotel Paba is. But Alberta is a wonderful lady and she runs a nice little establishment. It is not without its quirks, but Rome is an expensive, hectic city, so it was nice to have a comfortable, friendly, relaxing, decently-priced place to return to at night and if I needed to rest my feet in the afternoon. If I return to Rome, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Hotel Paba again - I'd just book really really early and I would triple-check the reservation!", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Fairy, Australia", "Title": "\u201cStale breakfast every day\u201d", "Author": "Aroney", "ReviewID": "UR8482944", "Content": "The position was really good as it was close to the forum and other tourist sites, the lift was an amazing piece of work, something out of a Hollywood movie ,My main complaint was the awful stale breakfast that we had to endure every morning with the same lame excuse being that the bakers were not operating today!!

Hotel Paba has big sized rooms, is very well located, and most of all is the most helpful place I've ever stayed. As you'll see from many of the other reviews, the Hotel is run by Sra. Alberta who is a charming and extremely helpful lady who made our stay so very easy and pleasant. So here's some hopefully helpful info to help you if you decide to stay here: GETTING THERE: From Termini Railway Station Hotel Paba is just a 10 minute walk away. Or you can go on the metro if you want. WALKING: Exit Termini at the main doors into Cinquecento Square. Now head to your left and you're looking for a road that goes off to the left from the square called Via Cavour. We looked for the most obvious one and it was that one. Get onto that road and stay on the left hand side. Now start walking and keep going until you reach Cavour Metro Station. Here the road now does a weird thing as it kind of turns into another road (or so it seems). Nevertheless, keep on going staying to the left hand side of the road which means you'll have to cross over and once you see the Post Office across the road then look out for the hotel. METRO: Get down onto LineB (I think) and you're heading south. Cavour is the first stop. The Metro is mega easy. You just need a 1 euro coin per person and you buy a single ticket per journey. Whether you're going 1 stop or 50 with 4 changes, it's still 1 euro. You just have to use them within 75 minutes or so of them getting stamped at the gate thingy. GETTING IN: OK, so you're here now. First off - ignore the grafitti. This is Rome. Everywhere is covered in the stuff. That's Romans for you. It doesn't mean that you've walked into the heart of the Italian equivalent of Harlem. In fact you are currently only about 100 yards away from the Colisseum (turn around and go back up the street 30 yards - look down that street to your right. See that bloody great big thing down there? Yes , there - the one with the arches, yes that's it). So ring the buzzer and the door will open for you. You're heading for the first floor (one floor up - it's different for Americans isn't it). But hey - what's that groovy thing looking like something out of 'From Russia with Love?' - it's a lift that's what. Check that baby out - it's straight out of the 30's - get to know it - you're going to become friends. So you've arrived. Shut the door to the lift (both of them or others can't call the lift and the whole lift service grinds to a halt) and the main entrance to Hotel Paba is right there on your right. Step in and you will probably meet Sra. Alberta. SIG.RA ALBERTA: Now I don't know what impression you may have got from other reviews, but I must admit I was expecting someone a bit like Kim and Aggie from TV (Sorry Americans you won't get that reference). Someone who's very much in charge etc. Well she isn't at all like that. She is a wonderfully elegant lady who is genuinely pleased to meet you (and that doesn't happen often in my life I can tell you). She speaks excellent English so don't worry about any language issues, and she is a fountain of knowledge on all things Rome. Take your guidebook by all means, but if you really want to know how to get into the Vatican Museums without having to queue for hours then she's the woman in the know. THE HOTEL ITSELF: First of all - it's tidy. Very clean and very tidy. The ceilings are very high and there is a touch of Rome everywhere. The Hotel is set all on the one floor with the Reception being the central hub by the main door into the Stairwell and that groovy lift I mentioned earlier. Sra Alberta tends to hide herself away behind the reception desk watching telly so is always at hand should you need her but not in your face. There are some books available if you've forgotton to pack one and also in reception there are the standard leaflets. Sra Alberta will also hand you a free map of Rome when you check in (and it'll end up being the one you use rather than the one in the back of that very heavy DK guidebook you've bought - you did buy it didn't you - does it feel heavy yet? Have no fear.. It will) ROOMS: We only stayed in one but did manage a peak at a couple of others whilst the cleaning was being done and the first thing of note is that for a capital city the rooms are very big. The beds are also 'oversized' which in reality means 'bloody big'. Each room has Air conditioning which can be a bit loud - but it was 35 degrees outside so who's conmplaining? Our room was en-suite with a decent shower which had adequate power and there was no problem with hot water. There is a safe in the room, as well as the standard drawers and wardrobe. We also had a table and two chairs where we ate breakfast each morning. Overall the rooms are, like the rest of the hotel, tidy and spacious. BARS: So you've arrived, you've found the hotel, you've checked in, and now you want to check out the area around the hotel. This, of course, means going for a glass of wine or a beer or two. Good thinking! Head out of the Hotel and take a left down the hill towards the Forum. Go past the restaurant which has overspilt onto the road and keep going until you come across an ice cream shop / sandwich shop / bar. It's on a corner. Look - don't the people look friendly in there. All smiles. All Happy. Do you know why? It's because they charge 7 Euro's for 400ml of beer that's why. DO NOT GO IN HERE!! Carry on past until the pavement opens out a bit and there are some seating areas under umbrellas. You should be near 'The Richmond'. Go and sit in one of these. They look more expensive - but they're not. The Chianti is pretty good. We also ate here and the food was pretty decent albeit touristy. RESTAURANTS: There are loads of restaurants near to the Hotel but one which we really enjoyed and was cheap can be found if you leave the hotel and go down the hill and then look for the first (or second) left which goes back up hill (towards Colisseum). There is a restaurant on that road on the right - go past that one and there is a lovely little trattoria further up the hill on the left. It's really authentic. SUPERMARKETS: If you're anything like us then you'll want to make some sandwiches to have with you during your trecks around Rome and Hotel Paba is really well situated for that. Directly across the road is a shop which sells Bread, Meat and Cheese and also some pre made sandwiches. They're cheap and delicious. Further down the hill but on the same side as this shop is the nearest grocery / deli - you can get all sorts in here including cans of beer. OTHER SERVICES: There is also a Post Office across the road from the Hotel and bank machines and a Bureau de Change. The Bureau de Change had the best rates we found in Rome so it's worth checking out. FURTHER AFIELD: I won't bore you with any recommendations about what to do in Rome as if you don't find out for yourself then don't bother going. Well I say that, but I will recommend one thing which you really ought to do. There is an area of Rome called Travestere which you really ought to go to for an evening. You can catch the bus from outside the Hotel (ask Sra Alberta - she knows all the timetables of course). Once you get there you'll discover street upon street of bars and restaurants. Each one tucked away and then opening out into hidden little piazas. The atmosphere is lively and the prices are cheap. As you approach the river you'll come across street vendors and riverside bars. It really is a great night out and is much better than hanging around near the Forum. So that's the end of my 'TripAdvice'. I hope you found it useful. I wouldn't ever normally write something like this unless I had been very impressed with my stay - and the Hotel Paba really deserves a great write up. We found the Hotel on TripAdvisor so it seems fitting that we should add our own review and hopefully help you out as well. Enjoy your stay in Rome.

It was easy to shut out all the noise since there were two curtains, a window, and shutters. It is steps from the Forum and Colosseum and located in a neighborhood that felt safe even at night.

There was a safe that was easy to use and the bathroom was spotless. In fact, the whole place was spotless. Alberta delivers breakfast to your room every morning. There was so much food that we'd take a few items with us to snack on throughout the day, which helped save time. There were rolls, a croissant, yogurt, and biscotti. Alberta also makes you an espresso from her espresso machine.

Alberta is an excellent host. Very helpful and considerate. My wife and I were travelling with our son, and we booked a triple room. Except it was better than that, the third bed was in a small room adjacent to the main room. We all therefore enjoyed unexpected privacy when needed. We were delighted when we realised what our accommodation consisted of. The location of the hotel is almost perfect. It was great to step put and see the Colosseum within minutes. The Forum is seconds away also, which is great, because you can get there early to avoid the crowds, and believe me, you will want to avoid the crowds! Don't miss the Capitoline Museums, they are superb, and are also only minutes away. Museo Borghese is a 'must see' as well. Not see easy to get to from via Cavour - catch the metro from the Colosseum to Flaminio and walk from there. If you are on a bit of a budget, there is a great Pizzaria in the lane parallel to via Cavour, via Madonna di Monti. It's called Alle Callette. It seems popular with locals, the staff are friendly, and has a great buzz. If you are like me, I really enjoy eating somewhere that I can't hear the english language. That way you feel like you are away. Anyway, Pizzas from 6 euros and a bottle of Chiati for 8 euros can't be bad.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.E.Asia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "A-square", "ReviewID": "UR6812108", "Content": "Ms. Alberta, the owner, is a very warm person. We were given the Lover's Nest room for our honeymoon. She also gave us a map and bus services handout which turned out to be very useful. Room is big, water pressure is good, location is very close to Colloseum/Roman Forum and within walking distance to shopping area on the Via Nazionale road. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Ask for recommendation from Alberta. Last time we gave her a restaurant name card and she intends to go there to try herself. So, her recommendation is guaranteed to be of a good standard. Breakfast is good, served in the room because there's no dining area. If going there by public transportation from the train station, better take bus rather than the Metro because you'd need to go up/dpwn the stairs/escalator with your luggage in the Metro and then you also need to walk to the hotel. There is a bus with only 3/4 stops and the stop is only 2 min to the hotel (metro stop is farther). We took Ryan Air-budget airline from Rome to Venice. From the train station, there's a bus 6 Euro/person going to the budget terminal. Ticket sold in Tabachi (newstand). Location of bus departure was difficult to find, though. Be sure to ask for clear direction when using the service. But the trip was quite entertaining because we went through Rome suburban roads for about 40 min with a driver driving the big bus like driving a small car and there's some local music, too.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBijou hotel lets you concentrate on your Roman holiday\u201d", "Author": "JohnnyBoyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR6811599", "Content": "Small, comfortable and friendly hotel on 2nd floor of a block on a fairly busy (traffic) street.

The breakfast was delicious--a fresh cornetto, sweet bun, cheese, yogurt, biscuits and cappucino. By European standards the room was large and the bathroom was nice and clean--no problems with water pressure. I was concerned about the location but we walked everywhere--only took the subway twice, once to the Vatican and once to the Gallery Borgese.

The room was kept clean and neat. The rooms at the front of the hotel that look out onto Via Cavour are rather noisy until early morning but not as bad as some. Opening the shuttered windows in the morning is an experience too as it is a great feeling to see others making their daily deliveries and setting up shop for the day while you, being on holiday, have the time to sit and watch.The breakfasts were the same everyday and pre packaged but adequate. What made our stay at Hotel Paba so memorable was Alberta's welcoming smile when we arrived and everytime we returned. She was patient with our tirade of questions and if she did not know the answer immediately, would always do some research and give us an answer later. Alberta made us feel special! The hotel is well situated close to many of the great Roman historic sites and there are many good restaurants close by. We felt safe walking around the area during the day and at night. A waiter in a restaurant across the street from Hotel Paba initially tried to overcharge us for our meal but when we asked for the bill to be itemised, we were charged correctly.

I believe we were upgraded to a larger room than we had originally booked, and we were not charged any extra. The cost is very reasonable, especially given the good location (the Coloseum is literally within site). The main asset is the owner, Alberta, who was very friendly and helpful. She gave us several good dining selections, provided us with helpful site-seeing tips, and reserved tickets for our visit to the Borghese. As other reviewers have stated, breakfast is basic, but enough to get you started for a day of site-seeing. The only complaint I would have was that we stayed in a room which bordered the main street which could be very noisy even late at night, so if you are a light sleeper, try and get a room further from the street.

The owner is very pleasant and helpful. She recommended some good local restaurants, how to book our train passes to the airport, how to get to the Appian Way and was helpful in many other aspects as well. The room was large for European hotel rooms and the bathroom was a decent size with a regular shower. We lucked out and got the family room so we had an extra room with a twin bed which made the room even larger. The breakfast was served in room each morning. Our last morning there we had to catch a plane very early so the owner was kind enough to ensure we had breakfast and helped show me how to make a cappuccino and where to get the food from the hotel pantry in the morning since she would not be there in the morning to help. This was above and beyond my expectation. She normally got there around 8am.
