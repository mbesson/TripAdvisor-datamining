There have been many changes to Oakwater since July 2011 and the other reviews show that. I am here myself right now, and could not be happier with the resort, the location, the facilities, the improvements made, and the unit I am staying in. It is sad that someone would go out of their way just to bring a place down, and not direct their issues to the people responsible. I appreciate Lisa K may have wanted to vent, but this was not the right place to do it. Oakwater is one of the best communities in this area right now, and I would urge those that have stayed here recently, and those that will be staying here in the future, not to let 1 review put you off.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLove love love this resort!!\u201d", "Author": "Myra G", "ReviewID": "UR125799306", "Content": "I loved this resort! In the past I have always stayed in a hotel and this was my first time renting a condo at a vacation resort. It was spacious and in a very convenient location. Unlike a hotel room, it had a fully stocked kitchen and I was able to cook some of our meals and save money. The Disney parks were only 5 to 10 minutes away and we were able to walk to the nearby shops and restaurants. The resort had a games room and a play ground to keep my 10 year old son busy when we came home from the parks. The atmosphere at the pool was very inviting, as the pool was heated and they played great music! The new management staff were very kind to us and said that there are many more good things to come at this resort. I definitely will book at the Oakwater Resort my next trip to the Kissimmee/Orlando area.

We saw new pictures on the Internet and even a new YouTube video. It almost seemed too good to be true. We loved Oakwater before but now we would NEVER consider staying anywhere else. We found out that a new Management company has taken over and gotten rid of many non-paying owners. I am sure those owners were the reason so many unhappy people stayed at Oakwater in the past. Don't go by the old reviews! It is completely different now. The pool area is superb with all new furniture and even music now! There is a new arcade and spa! We were even able to book a shuttle to the airport. Highly recommend this resort!

I was great! We booked our condo through \"GoDisneyVacation.com\". We rented a 3 bedroom condo that was spacious, neat, clean and priced right. It is also located just 1 mile from Disney! My kids loved the lagoon resort style walk out pool, hot tub, water fountain play area and play ground. When we booked the condo and I read all the reviews for this property I asked Scott from GoDisneyVaction.com if there was new management at Oakwater because the reviews are so different from early last year to now. He told me that was the fact and assured me of how nice the property is. And it was. Don't rule this place out based upon old reviews. We loved it!!!

The condo was very clean and tastefully decorated, felt like we could have called the place home. We were four adults and one infant in a three bedroom condo, lots of room to hang out together or separately whichever we chose. The ensuite off the master allowed us to share the kitchen and main living areas but have a separate washroom which was awesome when having four adults needing a shower in the morning before leaving for the day. The kitchen was equipped with the everyday essentials for preparing meals although we had a screened in deck off the condo and ended up renting a barbeque for the week which was great allowing us to prepare great meals vs having to eat out all the time. We found the location of Oakwater Resort to be very close to the Disney World and close to some great outlet shopping centres.

The beds were so worn out that you can feel the spring on your back. Will give you backache. So we checked in at 4pm. Went to condo found carpets were badly stained as if pet had stayed there, both toilets running water, all pots were dfilthy with dried food still evident, lack of cutlery, no can opener, bed sheets unchanged, patio door could not lock, plates barely enough, no soap, towels only 3 bath towels which looked dirty and worn out, walls everywhere was dirty with marks, the place had not been dusty for months! No maids been there. We complained to Management, Alex but no action taken. Owner called next day and assured us that we will get new pots and pans but stayed 6 days no new pots and pans. Alex assurred us that carpets will be cleaned , toilet fixed and can opener next day. But next day we only got can opener which was dirty. The Manager was off sick. We complained to Bookit.com, our booking agent and they got the runaround from Florida Magic Vacation also. We spent most of our time calling Management and Bookit.com to resolve these issues but no-one really cared or bothered. It was the worst vacation we had ever. Bookit.com advised me that they are taking this accomodation out of their system. i wished it was done before got there! We were told there was internet at the condo, pool, but found out this was not available. Also were told by Bookit.com that these were new condos , well they were over 5 years old and disgusting.

We were told they had free internet, but we had to pay for it at the clubhouse. How could they NOT have bathmats? We also didn't get handtowels. The fitted sheets didn't even stay on the bed b/c there was no elastic in them. We got tired of chasing the office down and still not getting anywhere. We thought we could tell them when we checked out how dissatisfied we were, but the office was closed at 8:15 in the morning. No office hours were listed. The location was ok, but I would rather have driven further for a cleaner unit. There is no excuse for crumbs on the sofa. YUK! Don't stay here. You will be sorry. I called the other day after we got home, and they said they'd get back to me. Sure!! NOT! I'm still waiting...they were going to check to see why our unit wasn't clean.
