{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location, Great Hotel We were in town for New Year's holiday and wanted a place close to our points of interest which was shopping and the Cotton Bowl. This hotel was the perfect place to stay. There are 4 restaurants on the same block of the hotel (Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse, and Cheddar's) that makes it very easy to find good food close. We walked to Olive Garden for dinner one night and Outback Steakhouse the second night. The Holiday Inn and Suites is located on the other end of the block and we saw people walking from it to the restaurants also. Our hotel was clean, safe, and newly remodelled. The room was a bit smaller than expected but for two people it was very accomodating. The kitchen was helpful as we like to have a cup of coffee and eat breakfast before heading out for the day. We were not afraid to walk to our car when we came in late both nights as the hotel seems to be in a nice part of Dallas. There are two upscaled apartment complexes across the street from the hotel along with the restaurants on the other side which made us feel much better about the location. The hotel within 4 miles of the Northpark shopping area as well as the Galleria and the night life of Lower Greenville Avenue. There is a DART public parking lot 3 miles south on Greenville Ave where you can park and ride the DART to any part of Dallas you want to go. There are other DART locations closer but no public parking. Believe me, DART is the only way to get around in Dallas especially if you are wanting to go to Downtown Dallas. When we return to Dallas, we will likely stay at the Extended Stay again. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Its very easy to find at the corner of I-635 and Greenville Avenue.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR450911131", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LittleRock_ArHawgfan"}, {"Content": "Good value! Stayed here for 2 nights on Aug. 6 and 7, 2004 and had 2 king rooms, for $50.00 each. By calling the hotel directly, I got a cheaper rate than what the internet rate was showing and also did not have the full amount charged to my credit card right away. The hotel is easily found off of I-635 and it is easy to get to other areas of Dallas. They serve a free breakfast in the mornings--continental type foods, cereal/milk, fruits, etc.The rooms have a sofa (with pull-out bed), a small kitchenette with refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, small stove with 2 burners, some cabinets, coffee maker, and small table but with only 1 chair (in the king room, at least). There are also some dishes and utensils. Near the bed, on the other side of the room, is a desk and chair, and then the bathroom area with tub/shower combo and toilet together and sink/mirror outside in the room. There is also a space to hang clothes and put the suitcase rather than a regular closet. There is one TV in the middle of the room that can turn towards the bed or towards the sofa. Upon arrival, we checked in fairly quickly. The staff was nice, and some staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I had reserved the rooms about 2 weeks earlier and called to confirm 2 days before our arrival. In spite of this, they only had us down for one night but that was quickly remedied and we were given our key cards. They put our rooms next door to one another b/c they do not have connecting rooms. The rooms all open to the outside, rather than being inside a building and opening into a hallway. The outside areas and corridors are well-lit and we felt safe (4 women), but we did walk quickly from our car to the rooms. The hotel does appear to be in a nice and safe part of town.One room was fairly clean but had the faint scent of smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. The other room was clean and did not smell of smoke. The room with the smoke-smell also had 2 full trash cans, even though the room had been cleaned earlier in the day. I called the front desk and they sent someone to take care of this. The gentleman who came to deal with this apologized several times and was extremely friendly while taking away the trash and then cleaning the trash cans so they didn't smell. He also gave some suggestions about avoiding certain areas of the interstate during early evening b/c of traffic congestion and helped with directions to some of the places we planned to visit. A really great guy! I think that housekeeping has a slight tendency to forget things b/c we had no coffee packages in one room either day and our other room did not have a 2nd package of coffee on the 2nd night of our stay.Overall, I believe the hotel was a good value for the money and would stay here again.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR867061022", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lee4"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d543081-r12276655-Extended_StayAmerica_Dallas_North_Park_Central-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "543081", "Price": "$77"}}
