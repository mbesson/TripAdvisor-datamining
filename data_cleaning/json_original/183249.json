We got our 2-br suite for $CDN165 online. I honestly don't know how we could have done a Montreal getaway weekend otherwise. Our kids are 3 and 1 years old, and usually in bed by 7:30 p.m. When I was a kid, I recall my dad sitting in the bathroom reading a newspaper after the lights went out when us kids crashed in a small hotel room with two queen beds. Now that I'm a dad, I know I couldn't do that. It just isn't a vacation. Two tiny downsides in my opinion: 1. Parking isn't onsite. It's a 50 metre (yard) walk down the hill at the Delta Hotel. It is a bit of a circuitous drive to get there from L'Appartement Hotel, with all the one-way streets, but the walk is an easy one, particularly after we realized there is a back door to the Delta that is right across from the parking elevator. L'Appartement lets you load and unload your vehicle from a few short-term parking spots right behind their facility. We ended up parking our vehicle for the entire trip and taking the metro (the kids enjoyed the train and we didn't have to worry about find parking) so this wasn't a huge inconvenience for us. Next time we go back to Montreal, we're definitely going back. 2. In our room, the walls seemed a bit thinner than they perhaps could be. Our first night, around 11 p.m. there was a bit of noise from another room, we think above us.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to try the swimming pool. The strength of this hotel is its location. Indeed, it is located downtown on one of the biggest streets of the city. It is full of restaurants around. You can easily walk to the major shopping areas or to Chinatown. The subway station is really close. It is only few steps away from the cultural area and the summer festivals. The location is almost ideal and Montreal is the place to be during the summer with its old town, terraces, F1 race, Cirque du Soleil, and all the festivals. I hate carpet and especially smelly ones. So I kept the window open all the time and it is noisy all day and all night outside because of the traffic. It is the price to pay to be downtown.

We stayed 3 nights and it felt like a real home away from home. Many reviews we'd read were full of accurate and useful information (we took our sedan rather than our crossover vehicle in order to fit into the parking garage and were glad we did. Our own experiences were never disappointing at L'Appartement from the moment we pulled up to the welcoming attractive front. We were looking for comfort, value and a bit of romance. Here was a place where we could feel that we were spoiling ourselves without the guilt of overspending on needless extras. No valet parking, no bell hop to carry our baggage to both demand tips; $$ that we so carefully budgeted for our get away. The cozy lobby had a touch of class feel to it, but if you're looking for up to the moment, trendy stylish glam, it might not be your best bet. If you're looking for comfortable, clean, style with friendly service, this is your place. Tired it is most certainly not. Our first impression was only enhanced by arriving at our room that had been upgraded to a suite from the studio that we had paid for. What a lovely surprise and we scored a balcony along with the extra space on the 14th floor with a nice view and windows that open for lovely fall fresh air. Although previous posters have commented that the bathroom fan didn't work (which is true) I was impressed with its cleanliness and I'm pretty picky when it comes to hotel bathrooms. I'm a little claustrophobic so initially it took a bit of getting used to being in the kitchenette and bathroom that were both pretty tiny, but \"small\" price to pay for such conveniences. It is rare to find both a continental breakfast and wireless internet at no extra charge. The staff were always friendly, helpful and inconspicuous. As we were a little into each other on a romantic getaway, the staff were there when we needed any thing but never really obvious which was nice. The location was simply perfect and we walked absolutely everywhere we needed to go. Close to Mont Royal, the Plateau, Old Montreal, Crescent Street, St.Catherine's. I can't imagine a better location. Only one tiny issue which was totally out of control of the hotel management, had to do with outside, really loud, construction noises beginning at 7:30am. Not something that a week end guest would experience, but a fan in the bedroom or nearby bathroom may have helped to drown out the noise. The cherry on top of the wonderful treat, was the roof top patio and pool. On my first morning, it felt like such decadence to work out on the bike, do a few laps and relax on the patio which was so tastefully decorated with lovely, colourful planters. All that said, upon paying our bill, the best surprise was no surprise. All too often the prices quoted differ so much from the end charges, but the bill was exactly as it should have been. We agree that any time we return to Montreal as a couple or as a family, we will most certainly not be staying any where but L'Appartement.

A continental breakfast is included that is slightly better than the \"free\" continental breakfasts you usually get. It includes yogurt, whole grain bread and bagels, plain instant oatmeal and fruit for those wanting healthier options. Staff are helpful without being effusive. On the downside, there are just two small elevators so if the hotel is busy, you may end up waiting a while. My advice would be to ask for a room on a lower floor so the stairs are an option if you are in a hurry. Dog owners: dogs are allowed. Although the website says \"small\" dogs, we stay there with 2 60lb beasts and they have never said anything. Montreal is not a dog city, so many hotels do not accept dogs or charge you a hefty fee.

Old (circa 1970s?) 16-floor apartment/hotel on prime corner along Sherbrooke Ouest in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. Right across is the Delta Hotel, and next to the Delta are the tall Holiday Inn and the even taller (and huge) Hilton Garden Inn. If location is your top priority, L'Appartement is a decent, inexpensive choice. Building has a nondescript brick facade with equally nondescript wrought-iron balconies for some rooms. The adjoining hotel has now been purchased by McGill University, and has been converted into student housing. Main entrance to McGill is just 2 blocks away. Nearest Metro stop is on Rue President Kennedy which is a short, 3-minute walk from the L'Appartement. Foyer is mid-sized, and reception accomodates 2-3 hotel staff. Main floor has an exit to the back which has a very small parking lot that accomodates a maximum of 6 cars. Otherwise, parking is on side street. Breakfast is free, and is served in the main floor corner room with generous views of Sherbrook st and side street. Breakfast is served at 6:30-9:30am on weekdays, and 7-10am weekends. Same fare everyday --- milk, juices, coffee, croissants, sliced bread, generic waffles, cereal, yoghurt, muffins, fruit (apples, bananas, oranges, kiwi) --- no power breakfasts with egg, bacon, sausages! There are 2 elevators which are totally inadequate for the number of guests. Same elevators are also used by cleaning/service staff, resulting in an extremely long wait during peak hours. Hallways are not airconditioned, thus creating a sauna atmosphere during the summer, especially with halogen potlights. The rooms are average in size. We have stayed in both one-bedroom and two-bedroom suites. Airconditioning is not centralized; window-type units really don't have any role in hotels. The one-bedroom unit has a single AC in the living/dining; thus, the bedroom door must be left open for cool air to enter. Bedroom has a ceiling fan. The 2-bdrm unit has 2 ACs --- one in the living/dining area, and the 2nd in the masters bdrm. Again, the smaller bdrm has only a fan. Queen bed is comfortable, and sheets/towels are always clean. The living room futon (where my 19-year-old, 6-ft-1-in son slept for 9 nights) is notoriously uncomfortable (like sleeping on a speed bump). After the 1st night, he placed the mattress on the floor and slept better after. Fridge/freezer with separate doors; toaster; coffeemaker; microwave; range/oven; and enough cooking/eating ware. Single 3-pc bath is clean but not luxurious. Lots of closet space. WiFi is free, and signal was strong anywhere in the hotel (including the open-air rooftop sun deck). On the top floor, there is a coin laundry room with 2 washers and 2 dryers that all worked well ($2 per load). Coins, detergent, fabric softener are all available for purchase at the front desk (99cents for single-load box of detergent). On the same floor, there is a sauna room, and gender-separate washrooms. On a higher level of the top floor is the freshwater indoor pool, roughly 25-30 feet in length and 12 feet in width (depth of 3.5-6.5 feet). On one side of the pool are gym equipment: 2 treadmills, a universal weights machine, 2 stationary bikes, and an elliptical trainer. Towels always available, though I once went up at 6am to use the treadmill, and all towels were dirty. On the other end of the pool is the glass door that leads to a down stairway to the open-air tanning deck (3 reclining deck chairs). Nice view of Mount Royal from the deck and pool areas. These areas are open from 6am to 10pm. If you enjoy walking, and are reasonably fit, the hotel is only 1.5 kms to Old Montreal. When I was there, I jogged every morning towards Westmount (lovely neighborhood --- reminds me of Boston or Georgetown). From the hotel to the corner of Prince Albert (few blocks west of the old city hall, or hotel de ville, of Westmount) is 3.5 kms; so the roundtrip is about 7 kms. For excellent dining, you can walk 5-10 blocks to either Saint-Denis or Blvd Saint-Laurent (fall in line for Montreal smoked meat at Schwartz Hebrew deli). To summarize, the location is unbeatable. The place itself and the prices are decent. But if you are looking for above-average comfort, let alone luxury, this hotel is not for you.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood experience\u201d", "Author": "DrizBelgium", "ReviewID": "UR79627538", "Content": "Room 207.

We had a Single Studio with 1 Queen Bed on the 5th floor. The building looks a little scruffy from the outside and is very '70's in design. Montreal, however, isn't always known for its love of good architecture. The location makes getting to downtown and the St Catherine Street areas very easy and you're in easy walking distance of just about everything else that wouldn't require a bus ride anyway . The room was clean and of a good size for two people. All of the rooms have a small balcony, which is a boon if you have to smoke, as all hotels in Montreal are non-smoking. The room was made up each day, although on a couple of occasions this was as late as 15:00. All of the rooms have a separate kitchen area with a cooker, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, fridge and sink. This is a real bonus for longer stays. We managed to cook a meal for guests on one occasion and prepared our own breakfast each day. The included breakfast in the breakfast room is on the mediocre side of okay but we only tried it once and decided to fend for ourselves instead. All of the cafes in Montreal make good coffee with the possible exception of \"Second Cup\", but that's just my personal opinion, so why drink coffee in the hotel? The breakfast room also contains a Computer and printer, the ice machine and a coke vending machine. There is nothing as grand as a \"business centre\" but all of the rooms have wireless and wired Internet access with a decent speed. You only get a code for one machine so if you have an iPod as well you would need to get two codes at check-in. Major positives for the hotel are the roof level pool and open rooftop terrace with a great view towards the mountain and over towards the Olympic Stadium. The pool shuts at 22:00 but both are well worth a visit. Also up on the16th are a sauna room and a laundry room. There are several exercise machines in the pool room if you feel the need. Downside 1: The air conditioning. Each room has a unit under the window of the main room. The unit is very loud when running and if you're a light sleeper you will not get to sleep with it on. Looking at the room layout on the door I would suspect that the rooms with a separate bedroom don't have any AC in the second room and Montreal gets very hot in the summer. Warning: If you are on the lower floors at the rear of the hotel. The building next door is in the process of becoming a McGill residence and its air conditioning units vent with so much noise that you will not be able to sleep with the windows open to get around the noisy AC in the room. I should think anything below the 10th floor would have an issue. Obviously if you visit in the winter this will not be a problem. Downside 2: The lifts. There are two and you share them with the staff so when the rooms are being cleaned expect to wait for one empty enough to use. No big deal if you are not in a hurry. Downside 3: There is a ventilation duct over the bathroom door which allows you to clearly hear any conversation, or anything else, occurring in your direct neighbors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bathroom.

Perhaps unusually, we wanted to make a lot of our own meals, and needed to work a fair amount on our laptops. The location was great, on the main Rue Sherbrooke artery, near some major museums, and a reasonable walk to much of the city. There's a Provigo supermarket a couple of blocks away which was fantastic for buying food, and lots of cafes and eateries nearby (check out Avenue du Parc). Room was OK - nothing special design-wise, but it did the job. Kitchen was compact and had everything we needed, bathroom was fine too. We had a problem with the kitchen tap leaking, which they fixed immediately, except it never went completely cold after that. I couldn't be bothered complaining again, and we filled the kettle from the bathroom tap. We were on the 4th floor, with our window/balcony at the side of the building (not on Sherbrooke). This made the room pretty dark, and also left us near a huge noisy outdoor industrial fan. As a result we couldn't really concentrate on working with the windows or balcony door open - annoying. If you're going to spend considerable time in your room, worth asking for a high floor. Internet worked fine - EtherNet rather than WiFi. Breakfast was pretty good - like most places in North America, it was a bit of a carb-fest, but there was always fruit and fruit juice available. Worth getting to breakfast early - at around 9am there was generally no space to sit down, which meant either loitering around, or taking a tray up to our room. Judging by breakfast, the crowd at the hotel seemed mostly to be couples, often with kids. Lifts were a pain. With two to serve 16 floors, and the maintenance staff sharing them with the guests, we often had to wait 5+ minutes for a lift to arrive. And when one did, it was often filled up by a housekeeper and a huge wheeling laundry bin. From the 4th floor, going down stairs made more sense. Pool was great and a fair size - often had it all to myself during the morning or early afternoon. In the evening there was usually at least one family with kids using it, which meant no space to swim full lengths. Roof deck off the pool was very pleasant, although it is fairly unprotected and could get windy. One other minor annoyance - on checkout there was a phone call on our bill from the first day. We were surprised but didn't argue since we were in a rush and it was only a few $s. We realized afterwards it was probably left from the people who checked out of the room a few hours before we checked in. Hotel should be more careful about that. In general however, no complaints about the staff who were courteous and friendly. Bottom line: at the price, this was a great place to stay, with a few annoyances as above. It's also worth considering Le Square Phillips, the somewhat more upmarket (and expensive) sister establishment, which is located more towards the business district.

The rooms are clean, and in great condition. Overall, I think it is a great place to stay; in fact, I moved from another hotel to stay here. Here are the pluses and minuses, in my opinion. Pluses * Good location (close to restaurants and fun things) * Pool * Very nice, tastefully appointed rooms - big and recently refurnished * Staff is super nice * On-site parking that you do yourself, so you don't have to keep on tipping some valet or wait for your car * They don't charge for local calls (but do for 800 numbers) * High speed internet (but not wireless) * Balconies * Squeaky clean and nice smelling everywhere I've looked Minuses * lots of construction going on and is quite a bumpy ride to access their parking garage * \"exercise room\" consists of 2 or 3 treadmill machines next to the sun-drenched pool, with no tv or anything. Needless to say, it gets very steamy with the sun and the pool heat, at least in summer. * breakfast is all foods from the supermarket, e.g. kind of stale croissants, cereals, yogurt with lots of sugar and fruit. If you are looking for food, rather than food products, this breakfast is not the best. * Building is under-elevatored (i.e. you have to wait a long time at times) but so is every hotel I have visited here in Montreal. * No ramp up to building, so if you are in a wheelchair or have a stroller (we have a stroller), it is hard to get in. This is apparently true of all of Montreal though; they barely have curb cuts here - forget about ramps. Who knew the US could be more progressive than Canada! * No dishwasher in our room, don't know about others...", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cJust Right!\u201d", "Author": "Readmytrip", "ReviewID": "UR17389196", "Content": "I booked this hotel to coincide with a trip to the Montreal Jazz Festival this past weekend, and my friend and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!

Even if you aren't going to the festival, it's right in the middle of downtown, and we were close enough to walk to the park, the Latin Quarter, the old town, and to some of the coolest streets in the city. The hotel served a good continental breakfast- cereal, fresh fruit, juice, toast, bagels, etc. We stayed in the basic room with one bed, and the best part was definitely the small kitchen area. It had a refrigerator, stove, microwave, and also included bowls and plates and cutlery. There is a grocery nearby, and we went there one night to make our own dinner. The front desk staff were very helpful when we asked about side trips from Montreal, and they even called a few places for us that we wanted to visit. We had a balcony room, which was a nice surprise. The only drawback, and it's a minor one, is that there is a single computer available for use, so you might be waiting depending on if there's a line. We had rented a car, and they gave us daily parking tickets to park at a nice hotel garage across the street. It cost $18 a day, and we could come and go as we pleased with no additional cost. I would stay again at this hotel if I went back to Montreal! If you book it, check out the visit Canada website (or tourism Canada, I can't remember the exact site) for a discount.

Last year we had a wonderful experience at the (jointly owned) Square Phillipe, and I had these grand ambitions of single-handedly raising the TA ranking of this poor overlooked hotel.

However only one of the bedrooms had air conditioning (and a small window unit at that) There was also only one television, and that was in the living room. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed (A grocery store is a short 2 block walk) and the dining area was large enough for a pack-n-play for my toddler. We slept 5 people no problem. (I thought the pull-out sofa was uncomfortable but my 9 year old didn't mind it) The biggest con of this hotel is the elevators. There are only 2 very small elevators to service 17 floors. Our wait at peak times was often 10 minutes or more. I found the breakfast to be very adequate (bagels, cereal, coffee, juice, muffins, fruit) for a continental. Additionally the breakfast room had a computer with internet and a printer available 24/7 for guest use. The rooftop had a small inddor pool and laundramat which was also a nice added feature.
