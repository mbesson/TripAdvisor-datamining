We chose this hotel as we thought it would be a quiet haven after a hard day's sightseeing and were told it had restaurants near-by, a delightful pool set in its own gardens and was an easy journey into the city centre, so it sounded like an ideal base for a holiday which was relaxing as well as city centred. We were misled. The rooms were clean but basic and the bathroom quite large. Satellite TV means Italian TV plus CNN news. The breakfast is acceptable if you stay for one night, but mundane is the best description as it is the same uninspired selection of sweet croissants, hard rolls, prepacked cheese and luke warm coffee every day, only available until 9.30 at which time the manager takes great delight in putting up his closed sign whilst the waiting staff manage to make you feel as though you are eating in a canteen by clearing tables noisily around you. There is no lounge area and trying to get so much as coffee after 9.30am is impossible. The bar was never open. The pool looked neglected, black on the bottom and set in a scrubby grass area with a few plastic chairs and a couple of recliners. Beware the mosquitos. It was closed for a day when we visited. This hotel is for overnight stays and emphatically NOT for longer. Imagine staying in a Travelodge for a week and you get the idea. It is in a very ordinary suburb and you can find one or two ordinary restaurants within walking distance. At least a 20 minute walk helps the appetite but, like us, you may have imagined the area would have some cafe life nearby. Not so, hunt the pizzeria. The bus stops are a five minute walk away and the bus takes a not very pleasant 25 minutes on a good day, depending on traffic. Taxis cost approx. 12.5 euros depending on the driver. It's a significant additional cost in tiem and money.Staff spoke english and smiled but welcoming would be an exaggeration.I can not recommend this hotel other than for an overnight stay on the way to your next destination.

The directions from the hotel website and Mapquest which we normally use were hopeless so it took us some time to find it. Like a previous review we were also concerned as we seemed to be a long way out of the city but the location is good. We had a car so we drove a short distance to an underground car park and then it was a 15 minute walk into the city.The first room we were allocated was next to the lift so we asked if they had a quieter room and I think we were probably upgraded to a more superior room as it had double aspect windows and was the best room we had on our whole trip. \u62e285 a night with Expedia. It was clean and the king size bed was comfy.The breakfast was basic and we did find it difficult not having any other food available in the hotel. There was a buffet served on a Thursday for 8 euros including a drink which was ok but nothing special. On our second night the receptionist directed us to a good pizzeria in the small town which was excellent.The staff were helpful but don't rely on a wake up call if you have a flight to catch as our call was 20 minutes late.We would recommend this hotel for a stay in Florence.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR328744948", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Travel2Uk"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel We stayed 2 nights in this hotel in August 2007 - At first, en route in the taxi to this hotel, I was a little surprised at just how far out of Florence this hotel was. It said 3km but it certainly felt longer than 3kms in a taxi (I think it probably is). It cost about \u9227?5 to get there in the taxi from the train station. From the hotel into Florence we had to take buses both ways \u9225?these ran on the half hour and cost \u9227?.10 each way \u9225\u641aou can buy bus tickets at the hotel reception. The hotel was very clean and tidy and in the middle of summer, having a pool was a godsend (this was the main reason I chose this hotel). It is not a flash pool but it was great to have somewhere to freshen up in the thick of the heat in the afternoon. The pool was also very clean. The hotel staff were very friendly. The hotel bar is not at all busy. Most of the time we had a drink, we were the only ones in the bar. If you need internet\u9225\ue6dfou won't enjoy the internet experience here \u9225?it's very slow and the computer is possibly off Noah's Ark. All and all I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to others. I knew the location was out of town and the buses really were not difficult to use.

We stayed here for 150 Euros a night with the 6th and final night being free.The location was exactly what we were looking for - about 5 miles out of Florence but 100 yards from a bus stop that takes you right in to the centre in about 20 minutes. After a long day with the crowds of Florence, coming back to this quiet haven was lovely.We enjoyed the breakfasts (standard Italian fare), the reception staff were very helpful and we had a huge room overlooking the pool, where we spent a couple of days relaxing by.The best place we ate in Florence was Baldovino ([--]) a great value trattoria with amazing food.
