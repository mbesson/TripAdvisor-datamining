The hotel is cozy, charming and immaculate. The d\u00e9cor of the breakfast room is lovely and makes you realize that you are in Paris. The breakfast was more than adequate and provided us with a great start to our day, and the women serving coffee and replenishing the buffet were sweet and efficient. Rooms are decorated very simply and the size of our superior room was perfect. Although our room faced the street, it was extremely quiet. Our package included private transfers to and from the airport, which lessened any stress we might have had. As we are walkers, we were able to walk just about everywhere, but we were thankful for the metro stations close by when at the end of the day, we ended up several miles away and needed to return to the hotel. An abundance of cafes and the lively Rue de Buci were in the neighborhood.

The hotel location is superb, within walking distance of many of the major sights and very conveniently located to several m\u00e9tro stops, wonderful restaurants and shopping. The hotel website offers a number of promotions for longer stays that include some combination of breakfast, airport transportion, a cruise on the Seine, museum tickets, etc., depending on the length of stay.

I can't wait to take our daughter for her senior graduation and let her meet these charming people at this lovely hotel. I hate to give away such a great secret - but since I found it here on tripadvisor - I have to share it with my friends!

Josette was a wonderfully friendly personality to wake up to each morning! Yes, the best part of this place is the staff. Our French is pretty bare-bones, and everyone we met at the front desk spoke excellent English. We particularly want to thank Konstantin and Giada for their help and recommendations. The Millesime is located in Ste. Germain section, which we found to be perfect for us as first-time travelers to Paris. There were all sorts of shops, cafes, and restaurants within short walking distance, as well as 3 different Metro stops. Also, you can easily walk to the Louvre, Orsay, and Notre Dame. We would recommend Au 35 down the street for dinner and Amorino on Rue Buci for gelato.

Even an issue with the air conditioning was dealt with in the most professional way. Thank you so much, all of you!!! The hotel itself is in a perfect location. On a quiet street but very central to everything on the Left Bank and St. Germain de pres. The metro is a three minute walk, the Musee d'Orsay a 15 minute stroll, Notre Dame, the same. The Delacroix Museum literally around the corner. And restaurants and cafes galore! The room was delightful, clean and not cramped at all. On the 4th floor, it had a wonderful view of Paris rooftops. And the best shower we've ever experienced in Europe! The \"Tete a tete\" package the hotel offers was an amazing bonus. Breakfasts, museum passes, boat rides, and the airport drivers...an incredible deal! All in all the Millesime Hotel (and its wonderful staff) made for the best birthday present ever!

We chose to go with a classic room which I have to say was larger than I expected - king bed (2 twins pushed together), large closet, desk and a large bathroom. We were on the ground floor off the courtyard which may not suit everyone since it didn't really have a proper window (the door was the window and there was a small window above the door that could be opened) but we didn't care since we were out from morning till night. When we arrived they did offer to move us to another room on the first floor but it wasn't ready yet and we really just wanted to check in and explore the city. I think all the classic rooms face the courtyard so if you are really worried about the smell of smoke from people in the courtyard maybe ask for a room on a higher floor or chose a superior room since those face the street. There was only one morning that we actually smelled smoke but it wasn't overpowering. We did get a package deal which included breakfast, one way airport transfer, Seine river tour and a one day unlimited metro pass which was great. The breakfast was quite good - besides the usual coffee and croissants there were a selection of meats and cheeses, fruit, fruit salad, yogurt and cereal.

The room--#22-- exactly matched the photo in the promotion material. it had a desk, a little round table under the window, two side chairs and a small arm chair, good lighting, bedside tables and lamps, a mini bar and a flatscreen TV. It lacked charm but it was tasteful and spacious for a three star. The bed, two twins pushed together, was firm and comfortable. The linens were good quality and the bed was carefully made each day. Two good size windows overlooked the charming street and provided a fair amount of light. It was hot so we kept them closed and stayed cool with the central air conditioning. I did open them each morning to get fresh air and to watch the street cleaners and morning delivery men at work. and peek into the second floor library of the book store across the street. Even at this busy time, the noise was not objectionable with the window open and inaudible when they were closed. The closet was just arge enough and supplied with sufficient hangers for our clothes. Our suitcases fit easily into corners of the room. The bathroom was modern and immaculate. The floor was white tile, the somewhat narrow but deep bathtub had a shower head that could also be hand held. The pedestal sink was large with a rim that held a few items. A shelf above the sink would have been helpful but there was a small glass table next to the toilet and under a magnifying glass that held overflow items. The concierges were helpful and spoke excellent English. The computer in the lobby was available for all guests and never too busy. The concierge even printed out our return air tickets. They also called cabs for us. The breakfast room was attractive and free newspapers were available. There should have been a larger selection of food for 16E but it was adequate and the brewed decaf was refilled graciously. Alternatively, it would be easy to run out to a nearby bakery or deli and buy a croissant and juice and eat it in the patio off the lobby. The famed candy maker, Laduree, is across the street and serves breakfast but it would probably cost more than 16E. The hotel's location is tremendously convenient and delightful. Walking quite slowly we were at the St. Germain des Pres metro in five minutes, the Louvre in 15 and the D'Orsay in 20. Art galleries, bookstores and high-end boutiques with beautiful clothes and jewelry provided great street window shopping. A small Lebanese restaurant two blocks down the street was fine for a light, inexpensive meal. Better, was Jadis, a taxi cab ride away and L'Epi Dupin, a slow 25 minute walk. Both were \"hot\" neighborhood restaurants manned by up-and-coming chefs. Each had a 33E prix fixe that was excellent. One important tip: Find out which terminal your flight departs from. Taxi drivers do not have this information and there are no signs with it on the entry roadway. We had a terrible experience finding Continental because it moved to a new terminal recently.

It was in a great location, minutes away from the metro and the Seine river. Overall it was a good hotel, they tried, but it wasn't great and wouldn't get my return business. The maids came in all the time, would knock and come on in.... to deliver something as little as 1 washcloth. The toilet wabbled and she tub shower was either hot or cold and would never stay where you put it. The curtin rod broke off so we were down 1 curtin. The maid took it assuming trying to fix it, then the front desk called us and asked us where the rod went. Uh, ask the maid, it was here when we left and isn't here now. It was never fixed before we left a few days later. The bed was 2 twin beds pushed together. The hotel is so old that it's impossible to get anything bigger up the stairs, which is totally fine. But when you book a room thinking it will be a king bed, only to find out someone is going to end up in the crack of the beds in the middle of the night, is misleading. They should book it as 2 twins, with the option of putting them together. Breakfast was actually pretty good even though the staff was very French and a little blunt. The front desk boys were pretty helpful, and the laptop in the front made it easy to check in with family. They really tried, but this hotel had a little too many quirks for my taste.

Steps from the door and you are amongst St Germain and across the river to the Louvre, so top location too.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cVery bad experience\u201d", "Author": "AmFromDC", "ReviewID": "UR10170812", "Content": "When I arrived at the hotel, I was shown a room that was completely unacceptable - - on the ground floor next to the reception desk, very tiny (not the main problem), with a large window right on the street so that you could see and hear everyone walking by only a few inches away. But the worst part was the overwhelming smell of some kind of disinfectant that made the room uninhabitable. The receptionist opened the window (making it louder and unsafe) and said the smell would go away soon. I couldn't stay in the room and waited outside. After a half an hour the smell was just as strong. The hotel refused to give me a different room, even though there was one available (a higher priced category), despite even asking for the manager. So I left and stayed elsewhere. The rudeness of the staff was matched by the miserable room they tried to give me. This was my 15th trip to Paris, so I am used to small rooms and a bit of an attitude but this was way into the unacceptable range.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value and service\u201d", "Author": "tennismom710", "ReviewID": "UR10057773", "Content": "We have just returned from a week in Paris, where we stayed at the Hotel Millesime. We were very pleased with this hotel and would recommend it to others without hesitation. First, it is in a great location for visiting the central sights of Paris, with great access to shopping, restraurants, Metro, etc. More to the point, however, the \"tete a tete\" package they offer for 225 euros is an unusually good value for the area. It includes transfers to and from the airport, breakfast, a one-day Metro pass, two drinks at the bar of their sister hotel, a welcoming bottle of Champagne and a departing bottle of wine, along with macarons from Laduree, and a boat tour of the Seine. The room is generous for Paris standards, with plenty of closet space, and the bathroom is more than adequate. In addition, we found the staff to be helpful and friendly; we have a hard time believing the complaints from the Australia guest concerning unauthorized credit card use. The desk employees were helpful in every way, printing out maps, making and confirming dinner reservations, following up on housekeeping requests, etc. We wrote a letter to the manager specially remarking on the good service we experienced. The breakfast was also very nice, and the woman in charge did whatever she could to accommodate special requests. The rooms were spotlessly clean and were made up timely each day. The only thing negative (and it did not bother us particularly) is that the street noise on the Rue Jacob starts early in the morning with the garbage pickup. If one is a light sleeper, it is probably a good idea to request a room facing the courtyard instead. Also, this is a three-star hotel, so one should not expect bell persons, etc. Usually, the desk person is the only one on duty (also not a problem for us). We think this hotel deserves a far better rating than it now has, and we will definitely stay here again when we return to Paris.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDon't Give Them Your Credit Card Details\u201d", "Author": "Critic1", "ReviewID": "UR8686963", "Content": "Do not give your credit card details to this hotel.

We decided to give it a second go because it is a lovely hotel, and the package we booked was an excellent value. We couldn't find another hotel in the St Germaine area that could beat their value, and we knew the superior rooms were actually lovely and very spacious. We were given the room right next to where we stayed the first time 2 years ago, and we were just as happy with the room - quiet, clean, large, room for our stuff and a more than adequate bathroom. It's a really terrific location. We always felt safe on the streets around it at night and it was pretty quiet. This stay at the Millesime was significantly better than our first. We were picked up at the airport, we had a bottle of champagne and macaroons waiting for us and the staff was quite nice. The continental breakfast was fine - the location downstairs is lovely - and the private courtyard is a nice place to read the paper in the morning or relax in the afternoon. We love the neighborhood. It is walking distance to everything and the bus and Metro (2 different lines!!) are a block or two away. Our package included a Seine River cruise that we did at sunset - that was really a great time to go. We also had drink vouchers at the Jazz bar at the sister hotel - the Hotel D'Aubbusson (beautiful hotel if you can afford it!). That was fun, but we didn't read the coupon, and I ordered a Kir Royale - my first yummy one ever - but it was really pricey (It was 30 Euros) and not included. Oh well. We sat in the courtyard and had a nice time. They also included 2 all-day Metro passes, but we walked everywhere on this trip and never used them. Would have been good if it had rained, though. The Rue de Buci and the famous ones - Cafe Flore, Les Deux Magots and Brasserie Lipp - are nearby and the ice cream on Rue de Buci was better there than on Ile St Louis at Berthillon. REALLY!! I wish I could remember the name. But who cares - the house wine at cafes is usually excellent, and a lot less expensive than Coke. So grab a chair at a cafe, order a half carafe of red or white and have some French bread and cheese and people watch. Life doesn't get better than that. You walk so much in this city that you can eat just about anything you want. We did get to see the Monet murals in L'Orangerie this time. Don't miss it - definitely worth the wait!!! And the renovation at Le Petit Palais is beautiful. And don't miss a picnic lunch in the Rodin Musee garden. And if you want to see the city from up high - go to the Tour Montparnasse. You get a view with the Eiffel Tower instead of with the hideous Tour Montparnasse. Plus, that was a great walk - we hadn't been to the neighboorhod before.

We stayed at the attractive and delightful Millesime Hotel in May 2007 and very much enjoyed our experience. Rue Jacob is the perfect, quiet street located in the heart of the action with easy access to virtually anything. Situated across from Laduree is a sweet bonus! I\u2019m familiar with Paris and am partial to staying in this this area, in the 6eme, and so I've stayed in many of the small boutique hotels nearby. I enjoyed this hotel the most due to its warm style, d\u00e9cor, and charm. Our Standard Chambre was cozy for two, but would be perfect for a solo traveler. The bathroom was tremendous in size, modern, sparkling, and had a shower attached to the wall which I know is important to many. The Superieure Chambres were already booked, however, we did see one while there. The Superieure was significantly larger, much more spacious, very comfortable, and I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend it. I wasn\u2019t able to see a Suite. I\u2019m not a breakfast-in-the-hotel person as I\u2019d rather be out in a cafe, but did take advantage of it one day and it was lovely. The dining area is in a rustic cave and served is a nice selection of breakfast options.
