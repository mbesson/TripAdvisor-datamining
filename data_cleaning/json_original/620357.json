Of course I gave a flat rifusal. I booked one triple room and I was going to check out at 7am next morning. Anyways, the receptionist reluctantly gave us one room, then we were guided to our room by a lady who doesn't speak a word in English. After 5 minutes, we found out we were not able to open the extra bed and called the reception to send someone to fix it. The lady from before came back with a bunch of keys.. didn't work. It took her almost 3 minutes to understand that we'd like to move to any other room and get in bed asap. She left our room saying to wait for a call from the reception..... went up and down several times to finally switch our room. Rooms are very small for 3 adults.. I told the hotel to edit their room information immediately on the booking agency. I find the price very good, but I can't help a thought that the receptionist kind of tested us so obviously.

The hotel is very basic (as you would expect), but does its job for a sleepover. The Barajas metro station is a good kilometer or so away along the road past a fountain opposite the hotel. Reception staff claimed it was 500 meters away, but, having walked definitely more than 500 we finally came across a sign \u201c300 m to the metro\u201d. Not exactly doable with bags, so their airport shuttle (quick and timely) was very helpful. The center of Madrid is about 1.5 hrs (and 2 transfers) from Barajas on the metro, get ready to climb lots of stairs (tip, some transfer stations, like Nuevos Ministerios, actually have lifts, which saves a lot of time and energy). The neighborhood itself appeared quite grim at first sight, didn\u2019t feel too comfortable walking back from the metro station at night. There might be a bus from the metro to the hotel, but I was not aware of it. On the positive side, there\u2019s a supermarket in the same building, to the left of the hotel\u2019s entrance (if facing the hotel). The triple room we had for two was so tiny we could hardly fit two big bags. I can\u2019t possibly see three people fit in it. The room was poorly designed: you had to be left-handed to at least partially open and close the window, the coat rack was placed by the bedside in the far left corner of the room, so you had to walk the room fully dressed. Bathroom size was generous in proportion to the room size, however. Breakfast was mostly edible, though the soft cheese, which was good on the first day turned sour on the second, presumably, having sat in the warm room for too long as they serve from 4.30 am to noon. Wi-fi at EUR 5 per day is a rip-off in my view. There was a desktop computer, however, I am not sure how much it cost to use, if anything.

There is a car-park behind the hotel, or you can park on the streets around it, but you'll probably have to drive around for a while, though, before you find a space. There are supposed to be a couple of spaces in front of the hotel for momentary guest parking, but they were permanently occupied while we were there, and the front desk clerks did absolutely nothing to remove these cars, eventhough we brought it to their attention. Overall, the front desk staff was less than friendly, bordering on rude. I sat in the lobby for a while, waiting for my husband to find a parking spot, so I witnessed the staff's interaction with several guests and they were less than willing to go out of their way to help anyone.

Everything around the airport seems to be based on \"grab their money and get what you can. They won't be back\". My first was a real looser with a three hour wait for the hotel shuttle in the burning sun. I chose the Ibis on our second visit because, although not high quality, the Ibis chain does have some thought to giving a clean hotel with a fairly comfortable bed. The shuttle was late, but not as bad as that other hotel. The reception desk was quite indifferent and mechanical. However, the room was fairly good and certainly clean. When we wanted to visit a few sites in Madrid that Sunday we found no interest whatsoever from the front desk. They had no map that showed the hotel and Madrid on the same page. When I asked directions to Mercado San Miguel (one of the top of the top sites in Madrid) the girl on the desk said she had never heard of it. She backed that up by asking someone in the inside office who had lived in Madrid all her life. She confirmed that no such place existed. So we had to find it on our own. It did turn out to be a wonderful experience and probably the only thing we would find of any real interest in the city. For that reason I have chosen to show some photos of this market rather of the hotel. Please don't miss it. It's a bit of History that comes aliive.

When I arrived in the hotel at around 22.05h, while signing papers at the reception, my small backpack being next my foot and next to the reception desk was stolen by a thief at 22.08h. I was devastated because the backpack contained my laptop (with many personal and working details) and some clothes. I started panicking, and run outside the hotel, but the thief had gone. The hotel staff called the police and the hotel manager to check video cameras. Two policemen arrived very soon, took my details in Spanish and left. Later the hotel assistant manager Mr Fracais Toubas arrived and we inspected cameras. I could not believe what I saw. The thief (or probably three thieves working as a team) get in the hotel and stood behind me. While I was signing the hotel entry papers, the thief calmly took my backpack in front of at least three cameras and gone. Everything was recorded by the cameras. Mr Fracais Toubas managed to calm me down a bit, and offered me free room for the night. But the manager explained to me that the hotel could not be held responsible for my stolen belongings, even at the hotel lobby. I usually look after my luggage when at the public places, but am more relaxed when in the hotel. But not in the hotel(s) any more. Later the English speaking police officer called, so I could give my version of what happened and could get the police report for the insurance purposes. But the emotional loss was much greater than the material one. Plus all my work and personal details saved in the laptop hard drive. As the police has not called me so far, I believe that they have not found anything. I am also surprised that the hotel Ibis does not have any security, because it seems that the area and the hotel are very often visited by thieves.

I was there for the UEFA Champions League Final. My three night stay was excellent value at \u20ac59 per room per night. Clean rooms and beds with good shower facilities. The downsides were not having tea or coffee making facilities in the room and only SKY News in English on television. On my third night, at 720pm, I heard a gentle knock on the room door. As I approached the door, it opened from the outside. A Spanish looking male seemed surprised that I was in the room. He clearly pretended that he had the wrong room as he spoke to me in broken but understandable English. I waited a few seconds and then opened the door again. I saw this man and his friend walking along the corridor, trying the door handles of the rooms, as they moved. I called after them and asked what they had wanted in my room. At this point, his English seemed to disappear. He pretended not to understand me. I went to the reception and advised the male receptionist that I had just had an attempted burglary in my room. I pointed the two males out to him, as they left the hotel via the front door. He did go after them and had a short chat with the one who had opened my room door. The duty manager was called and I was taken to the office to view security tapes. After a few minutes, we had a clear image of the man on the screen. The police were called and I was advised that they would be at the hotel the next day. This was of no use to me, as I was leaving the next morning. I was staying in room 126. The manager quickly advised that he would move me to a different room. He then moved me to room 124. Next door to the room I had just left. That seemed an odd choice. He also offered me the final night of my stay free of charge. The hotel is a short train ride from the airport. It is in a good area and aside from my burglary experience I would normally recommend it. The manager telephoned my room one hour later to advise that he had checked the records to see what time the room door had been opened. He had a record of my return to my room at 630pm but no record of the 'break in' at 720pm. So that means the burglar was able to open the door without there being any record of the opening. I contacted IBIS after I returned home. An email soon followed to advise the police were dealing with the matter. I will avoid Ibis hotels in future.

It was fairly convenient to the Barrabas Metro station (~5-10 min. walk). The area seemed safe and there were plenty of restaurants nearby. The hotel now offers a shuttle service to/from the airport for 7 euro/person. My only complaint is that on my second evening the electricity in my room went out. A circuit breaker flipped. The evening staff tried a few things, but couldn't figure out how to fix the problem. They unfortunately told me the hotel was completely booked so I couldn't move rooms, but did offer to move me to another hotel. It was already 11pm, so I decided against this, figuring that I really didn't need the lights in order to sleep. The evening was OK, but I struggled between keeping the window open to cool the room down, but wanting to keep it closed to keep the street noise out (the room was very quiet with the window closed). My disappointment followed the next morning. Having told the evening staff and the night shift worker about the power being out, they assured me they would fix it \"first thing in the morning\". After leaving in the morning and returning to the hotel around lunch, I thought for sure that the electricty would have been fixed. Nope! I inquired at the front desk, and it seemed like this was the first they had heard of the problem. There just didn't seem to be any follow up. After explaining the situation to the day staff, a front desk person came up to my room, jiggled a light above the bed and instantly the problem was fixed. What really annoyed me was that he told me that this problem had occured previously, and that they knew how to fix it. Unfortunately, this didn't get communicated to all of the staff. The remainder of the stay was fine. However, other than offering me some free drinks at the bar, they did not offer any refund, discount, or any other courtesy after what happened. It seemed they simply didn't really care.

I know others took a train to near the hotel, however, given the time of night, and the amount of our luggage, this wasn't an option for us. The hotel was modern, and perfectly OK for a very short overnight (which is I am sure what most of the patrons are). They have a deal with a local taxi company to bring people back to the airport, but we still paid 15 Euros.

We'd read on the forum that it was brand new, which also usually means clean and fresh. It was also inexpensive, which is what one expects of an Ibis. For the money, it was a pleasant surprise. Clean and fresh, with helpful (if a little overstretched) staff. The room was clean and comfortable for a one night stop. Furnishings were cheap, but well designed. The early morning call came on time. No airport shuttle, but they called a taxi for us and that, also, came on time. We'd done a lot of walking and were pretty tired when we arrived. We followed the instructions we'd read on the forum and got off the Metro the right stop (the middle of the three Airport stations). But surfacing from the station, we were a little confused. The address says Avenida General, but it's actually on signposts at this point as Avenida de Logrono, which becomes Avenida General. We'd already eaten as we thought the neighbourhood might not offer much in the way of bars and restaurants. In fact, there are a number of restaurants as it's a proper suburb. We can't answer for the food in the hotel, but the restaurant looked fine and the small bar was pleasant enough to sit in for a glass of wine and a few nibbles. But check out the deal on breakfast. Ours was included, but, as we had to leave earlier than breakfast started, we assumed we would have to skip it. Then we noticed a number of signs offering early breakfast. The lights were off in the restaurant in the morning, but the food was all laid out ready... which led to us incurring the wrath of the one desk staff when we attempted to pick up a bread roll. Overall, for the money, it was a good choice.
