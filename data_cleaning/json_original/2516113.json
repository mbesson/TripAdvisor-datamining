I wanted a location that was close by. The Azul Inn is just down the road from Century City on Santa Monica Blvd., a few minutes drive. The location was convenient. I got an affordable rate on Hotwire, which mentioned free parking, free breakfast and WI-FI available. Good value. The Azul Inn is basically a renovated motel. The building's exterior isn't in great condition and it looks like a motel. However, the rooms are newly renovated with mid-century modernesque furnishings, flat screen TV, and are in good condition. This was a convenient home base from which I did a lot of prepping for my interview in the hotel room. The Asian female hotel desk clerk at checkin was busy, stressed and not in a good mood. Guests did not receive a friendly welcome. The free wi-fi was not working when I got to my room. I went downstairs to the lobby, they said they had recently reset the connection and to try it again in a few minutes. Then it worked fine. However, late that evening it stopped working again and wasn't working when I woke up the next morning. I asked them to restart the router again, waited, but it still didn't work. Fortunately, I was able to access the internet using my smartphone. I requested a quiet room away from the street noise. They accommodated my request, however, a large building was being constructed behind the hotel. Due to this huge erection, enthusiastic jackhammering took place beginning at 7 am and they were still going at it strong when I checked out. The mattress was a very comfortable and high quality Simmons Beautyrest WorldClass. I only know this because I accidentally yanked the sheet off the mattress during the middle of the night ;) There were a number of eateries within a convenient distance. I walked 5-10 minutes to a healthy chicken / Indian restaurant near the corner of Westwood and Santa Monica Blvd. for dinner. I didn't partake of the free breakfast in the morning because it was coffee (which I don't drink), tea (didn't like the quality of the tea), carbs (which I try to avoid, especially when I don't want a food coma), Minute Maid juices from a machine (I prefer fresh squeezed or not from concentrate juices), and non-organic fruit. I don't expect a free breakfast to be gourmet, and I was fine driving down to Westwood and Pico to Junior's where I ordered breakfast and lunch to go. The desk clerk at checkout was accommodating and agreed to let me to check out later than usual since I didn't need to be in Century City until 2 PM. I would recommend staying here for convenience and value, if you don't mind the temporary daytime construction noise. Don't count on the WI-FI working the entire time. Bring your smartphone if you need internet access.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant experience\u201d", "Author": "5estrelasTT", "ReviewID": "UR127146791", "Content": "I spent 3 nights here and I was very surprised.

I certainly did not look forward to living in a motel for 2 weeks. This is a GREAT locale because it is a quiet, safe, upper middle class neighborhood near UCLA and Santa Monica.

Century City is up the road. If you are coming from out of town and are on a budget, you might want to consider this motel. It's central location will allow you easy access to wherever you want to go, although it is NOT near the metro. There are buses running up and down Santa Monica Boulevard, however. I had zero problems with the parking, which is free. The room I stayed in, #241, was a non smoking, queen bedded room. It was completely new. In fact, it had that new carpet smell. Everything, including the wallpaper and all the furnishings were in perfect condition. It also has a small refrigerator with freezer tray and Free HBO and basic cable. I did spot one roach, but that is to be expected in a motel. It didn't \"freak\" me out as I normally would be, primarily because the room could not have been any cleaner. The overall condition of the building was very good. Not the Paris Ritz by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are new to the city and don't want to be looking over your shoulder every time you walk out the door, I recommend staying here.

I chose it because it's not the LAX Motel 6, it's near bus lines on Westwood and Santa Monica Blvds, and it's pretty much the cheapest rate you can find in LA. The downsides: The property is badly in need of refurbishing, and nearby Santa Monica Blvd is basically a raceway. My advice: ask for a second-floor room when you arrive. The rooms get very warm and usually don't have enough windows, so you'll be running the air conditioner most days out of the year. You can generally leave the AC on during the day while you're out, without the maid turning it off, if you leave the temperature set to \"normal.\" That helps keep it cooler. Depending on how loud the AC turns on and off, which varies depending on the room, I've generally found I get a restful night's sleep only when wearing earplugs, but I'm a fairly light sleeper. The shower heads are pretty searing and positioned too low. They do indeed have a pool, but it's never available when I'm there, before or after business hours. They lock it up, for obvious reasons. The upsides: Although it won't look it when you arrive, the surrounding neighborhood, near the Mormon Temple, is actually pretty decent. I jog during the mornings southward down Overland Ave, past an elementary school. There's a Seven Eleven right across the street. Each room I've stayed in also has a mini refrigerator. Santa Monica Big Blue Buses troll along Westwood and Santa Monica up to Westwood, but that's about a 4 block hike. It's incredibly cheap for LA, which is no doubt why the place is in disrepair. You get free bagels/danishes/coffee in the mornings until 10am. The service tends to be pretty good, although the morning guy is a little odd. And best of all, they frequently have rooms available, and you can cancel up until 4pm day-of. They claim not to guarantee parking, but I've never had a problem with it. You probably will want a rental car in this location, since it's far from anything including Westwood, unless you enjoy waiting for buses. (I kind of do!) Bottom Line: Cheap!
