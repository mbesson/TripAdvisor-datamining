The result could not have been worse. The room was really tiny and the bathroom was ridiculously small. Worst of all, there was no heating in the entire hotel, not even in the room. The first night we could not sleep because we were freezing. We called reception and asked for to put the heating on, but they just answered it was turned off for the entire hotel and all we could do was turn on the towels heater in the bathroom and hope it could heat up our room a bit. We got no sleep at all. The bed mattress and sheets are so old, it is really uncomfortable to sleep on them. And also, it was really noisy from our room at night. The bell-man didn't even help my wife with her luggage - quite interesting at a 4 star hotel. It's true location is perfect, and breakfast is quite nice, but it is by far the worst hotel we've ever stayed at in Paris. However the rates correspond to a fine boutique hotel.

They said they couldn't guarantee anything unless I booked for an additional day, which is fair enough. When I got to the hotel, which is conveniently located about a block and a half from the Metro, I was very pleasantly surprised that my room was ready and accessible to me at no extra charge! I had booked the romance package, which sounds a bit cheesy, but I liked the idea of a bottle of champagne to kick off the weekend properly. The staff was very thoughtful in asking me when I would like it delivered to the room, and they kindly dealt with my changing my mind a couple times. They delivered it when we were out, and we came back to a cold bottle of bubbly, candles, and rose petals. Very nice. The staff was also instrumental in keeping us well fed throughout the weekend. We hadn't made any reservations and changed up our dinner plans a number of times. The front desk called up multiple restaurants for us and dealt with all the changes. One night, we opted for late-night room service, and hotel staff informed us that the menu item we were trying to order was not available because of the late hour. We placed an order for something else, but he called back in a couple minutes and said that he had found a way to get us the food from a nearby restaurant!

However, the shower head was awkwardly placed, which made the shower seem tiny. The staff placed rose petals in our bathroom prior to our arrival which was a nice touch. I assume it was because we were there for our honeymoon. Co-workers sent over a bottle of champagne (the real deal!) and fruit as a honeymoon gift, which was beautifully set up by the staff.

After surfing through a number of hotel websites with reviews I finally booked our holiday with the hotel Elysees Regencia. The most appealing reviews from other guests being the cleanliness and location of the hotel, we rated both these aspects ***** five stars. Being South Africans, this was a once in a lifetime journey and I wanted it to be perfect. We had a rather large list of things to do, but had no idea how we were going to fit it all in seven days. I contacted a lady named Olympe at the hotel concierge who had dealt with our hotel booking and asked if she could help us with advice on our tour plan. She confirmed that the hotel worked hand in hand with accredited tour operators and assured me that I could leave our tour plan in her hands. Clearly the best choice. We felt much safer knowing that my card details and dealings were with one party on the many excursions. It was also an additional safety feature that the Hotel knew our daily whereabouts. This was definitely one of the best holiday's for my mother an I.

The breakfast provided is great with an excellent selection of pastries, cereals, cheese/meats, bacon, eggs, sausages, pancakes, fruit, yoghurt, juices etc. It was a help yourself set up, although there was a member of staff on hand who offered tea/coffee/made sure everything was stocked up. We had more than enough choice to see us through the day of walking around Paris. The location is great, we choose to walk to most things as it was nice to take a leisurely stroll and take in the sights although there is a subway station very close by.

There was four of us and we were having a hard time using the Internet to find a hotel that supported four people, as we needed additional beds. At first their website recommended we get two adjoining rooms which ended up being outside of our budget, so I emailed them asking if there was anything else we could do since we were willing to cram into one room and sleep on a couch or floor if need be. I got a response in less than a day saying they would upgrade me from the standard double room to a deluxe double room and add two roll-out beds (sweet!) for just EUR35/each. I sent back the booking form no questions asked, as this option was more than half what other hotels wanted for either a suite or something else compatible. Upon arrival it was just as I remembered, friendly staff that spoke great English, awesome little hotel. Our room was also fantastic with very nice design, extremely clean, and L'Occitane amenities. Wifi was also free and the mini-fridge didn't charge you to take things out and look at them. My only note on this aspect is that I think food (specifically the breakfast) and the items in the fridge are high priced, more so than you would expect from a hotel, even fancy ones, in general. While we were out in evening the staff brought in the two additional beds. The completely rearranged the entire room and did a full turn-down service complete with chocolates which was cool. The fact that they made a lot of effort to properly arrange the room in a comfortable way to fit all the beds was really nice from a service standpoint. They also stocked us up with extra bath supplies and towels. The hotel is in a great location two avenues away from the Champs Elysees. It took us 5 minutes to get to the main avenue and 10 minutes to reach the Arc du Triomphe. Major metro lines are also close; Eiffel Tower was a 15 minute walk. The whole area is very nice and safe, and has a lot of shopping options. The bar at the hotel is small and was served by the door man which was cool.

The Odeon hotel room was very small and the lift was only large enough for two people, but it was clean and convenient and the service was wonderful. We were hardly in the room so size was not that big of a deal. It was also very, very quiet, on a side street near the L Odeon Opera, but very convenient to St. Michel and St. Germain and Odeon metro stops. We used the metro easily and walked a lot, of course. The Elysees Regencia, was much more luxurious, along the line of a 4 star hotel in states, and higher priced, but a larger room by far, and again, wonderful service. It was noisier in the morning, as closer to the main streets, but if you want to be in the ARch de triumph area, near shopping, etc, this is the place to stay!

Set in a leafy neighborhood surrounded by restaurants, fruit markets, stores, patisseries, and embassies, the hotel is a small, boutique-type establishment with contemporary furnishings and six floors of rooms. The first floor offers a small bar area, a reception, and private lobby with complementary magazines and newspapers. When I arrived from the U.S. on an overnight flight, I hoped to get right into my room for a nap. The front desk manager offered me a seat in the quiet lobby and asked if I would like something to drink while I waited. Very quickly and efficiently I was brought a pot of hot tea to sip. While I had my tea, my room was readied and I was able to check in at 8 a.m. rather than the conventional 2 p.m. My quiet room overlooked a back street where I could open my windown and watch Parisians walking to work or listen to the nearby church bells. As the week turned warmer, I turned on the air conditioning. Nice, small gestures abounded. An array of rose petals were laid on the bathroom towels, lovely scented shampoo and bath gels awaited, and a cluster of delicious sandwich cookies tempted me in my room. Each morning, I had breakfast downstairs at the hotel's buffet. While some people complained about the 19 Euro price, I found the breakfast to be delicious and worth the cost. The servers were very friendly and remembered each morning that I preferred tea to coffee. My choices ran from scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage, to cold meats, fresh pineapple and watermelon, cheeses, several fresh-squeezed juices, and an array of freshly-baked breads. The hotel staff are superb! After I checked in early Monday morning, the front desk manager called me in the afternoon to alert me to a fire safety test. Since I had been sleeping, I appreciated the call and knew not to change into clothes and leave the hotel in a rush. Each time you leave the hotel, they ask you to give them your room key. Everyone at the front desk gets to know you and remembers your name and room number. One night my daughter and I decided to return to a restaurant on the Left Bank but wanted to be sure it was open. Our front desk manager called the restaurant and arranged for a hard-to-get outside table reservation. Everyone was courteous, efficient, and kind.

We had the pink room, which is a double but they added a cot to accomodate us. My overall opinion is that I would definitely NOT stay here again. Here is why: Cleaniness 1: The beds were clean with the exception of mine, sort of. There was a huge yellow stain on the bottom sheet. It probably was clean, but I was pretty put off by sleeping on stained sheets (expecially when we were paying 350 Euro a night). My sister had to get another sheet from housekeeping to put over the stain for me. Cleaniness 2: The towels smelled awful!!!! Again, I had to assume they were clean. However the detergent they use must be a mix of French Tide and cow poo- not joking! What is up with that??? (If you have stayed here also, please respond to this one because I'm really interested in hearing other people's thoughts), Random 1: The hotel tries to be green by making you put a card in a slot to turn any lights on. This includes toilet lights, shower room lights, overhead lights etc. Maybe my sisters and I are stupid (although we are 3 successful women with advanced degrees and credentials) but there were a couple lamps that neither of us could figure out how to turn off without just unplugging. Since we didnt want to be crawling around on our knees unplugging and re-plugging these lamps we just pulled the card out at night which turned off ALL lights. Which meant that when I woke at 3AM to go to the loo, I had to do it in the pitch black. I bruised my shin and ended up waking up my sisters with my \"French\". Hotel Staff 1: They seem polite and nice at first. However, they are not very helpful. One of the nights there were 2 random sketchy-looking men in the hotel lobby (I'm pretty sure they were NOT guests) playing the piano. They were hitting on my sisters and I as we searched for a restaurant on the lobby computer. They completely grossed us out and made us feel uncomfortable, being that we were 3 women by ourselves. The front-desk person watched this entire scenario unfold and did not say a word and let the men stay. Hotel Staff 2: As my sister noted in her previous review, both she and her husband got diagnosed with Swine Flu 2 days before we were to leave for Paris. Her 3 year old son also had a flu although was not tested for Swine. Therefore we were forced to move our trip 1 week later. We called the Hotel over 48 hours in advance to reschedule for 1 week later. They told my sister over the phone that they would discuss the situation with us when we checked in. Then they sent an email saying they would charge us 1 extra night as a cancellation fee. We figured this was open to discussion, especially since we were still staying at the hotel. When we checked out, they did indeed charge us an extra night (besides charging us the Suite rate when we were stuck in a converted triple). The front desk man said we did not cancel within 48 hours. When we said that we called to cancel, he admitted that we called within 48 answers, but the cancellation had to be in email. Our email correspondence was not within 48 hours. Then he said that even if he did go by the phone call, the cancellation policy was really 72 hours. Then he changed it to 5 days in advance since the suite is difficult to rebook. So in a timeframe of about 10 minutes we were told 4 different cancellation polices. When I asked if they had ever managed to book the suite that we were charged an extra day for, he refused to answer. I take that as an affirmative. Elevator: We were on the the 5th floor, and the elevator happened to break on the hottest day we were there. We had to use the staircase, which is a beautiful winding staircase. However, after walking up and down it several times, you start wishing it was just a regular staircase. I noticed another review about the being elevator broken. This must be a regular occurance here. Location: True, the hotel is within walkin distance of the Eiffel Tower and some other touristy locations (my sister was VERY excited about the proximity to Louis Vuitton and other shopping). However, this is not the hip area to stay with tons of restaurants and little shops. We had to take taxis to get to any decent restaurants for young crowds, and found that getting a taxi home was exceptionally difficult. Final thoughts: When the hotel charged my sister's credit card, we were shocked to discover this is actually an American hotel- a Westin. I travel a great deal with my job and am therefore a Diamond level Hilton member. Had we wanted to stay in an American hotel we would have stayed in the Hilton. We wanted a French Boutique and all we got was hassle. I am regretting the fact that I could have gotten us a free room at the Hilton with exceptional service, and lovely smelling towels.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "getarounds", "ReviewID": "UR32764287", "Content": "We stayed for 3 days and nights in early June.

Especially considering the fact that the hotel's website would not allow me to select two guests for the room (it was a superior room with two twin beds pushed together for two people). Green - we were impressed with (what we thought) was the hotel's energy saving system (you have to put your room key in a slot in the wall to turn the lights on - and when you pull the key out of the slot to leave your room, the lights turn off). The hotel did not have dual flush toilets - which we saw everywhere in France (perhaps one day these dual flushers will make it to America?). We forgot to ask if the hotel uses earth friendly cleaning products. Eating - we asked for a restaurant recommendation (for dinner) from the guy at the front desk. He recommended one restaurant. We tried to squeeze more restaurants out of him (him being a local and this being Paris and all) but we were unsuccessful. We checked out his recommendation, however, nothing on the menu caught our eye. We ended up at La Casita across the Champs-Elysees and had a delicious meal. Location - this hotel is approximately 4 or 5 blocks from the George V metro stop which is on the Champs-Elysees (not far from the Arc de Triomphe). We walked from the metro stop to the hotel (with baggage).", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ammalgam", "ReviewID": "UR26860857", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 4 days.

This was our first stop on a wonderful whirlwind tour of France, Italy, and Switzerland. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel immensely. We stayed at nice hotels in all of our cities, but this was one of my favorites. What I LIKED: SERVICE: Overall the service at the hotel was very good. The front desk staff (which is also concierge...as was typical in our hotels) were all very good. I also liked that there was turndown service. BREAKFAST: This was the best breakfast we had in any of our hotels. The staff was very attentive and on top of getting us our coffee. It helped that it wasn't very crowded when we were in the breakfast room. The selection of breakfast items was also very nice. Eggs, of course, and a very nice selection of yogurts, pastries (including little crepes), etc. The room was nice, but it was in the underground, so there wasn't any natural light. ROOM DECOR: Very nicely finished room, though smallish (though that's typical for many European hotels). I thought our room was actually nicer than the pictures of their rooms on the website. QUIET: Our room was quiet. It helped that we faced a small street behind the hotel and that we did not have a room facing Avenue Marceau. If quiet is important to you, then make sure you request a room facing the smaller street (the name of which I can't remember). The side facing Avenue Marceau (which is where the main entrance is) would probably be loud as that is a major street. Additionally, from our window we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower (we were on the 5th floor), that's a view you wouldn't get on the other side of the building. Note, however, that there is another hotel/residential building across the smaller street, so with your window open someone across the way might be able to see into your room. We never saw any peeping toms, but just an FYI for you. What could have been better: SHOWER: This is a ticky-tacky complaint, but the shower door was completely ineffective. We had a shower/tub and there was a little half door that was supposed to keep the water in the shower. It didn't really work out that way and we had a floor that was sopping wet every morning. It wasn't a very big deal, just a small thing that we contended with. ROOM SIZE: While I didn't expect the room to be any larger than it was, this room is fairly small as compared to most American hotels. This was also our smallest room through the entire trip. Again, this is a small thing (we managed just fine). LOCATION: Again, somewhat of a small thing. The good thing is that you're really close to the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elysees, and the George V metro. However, it's a bit of a long way to some of the major sites (e.g. Louvre, D'Orsay, Latin Quarter). However, if you eat as much as we did, you can definitely use the walking! OVERALL...

Had two adjoining rooms which their website calls the \"Family Room\". I was booking late and found that nearly all Parisian hotels use a service that does not not confirm an on-line booking but sends you an acknowledgment which is then confirmed or denied 24-48 hours later. Kind of frustrating so I just called the hotel directly and everything was completed within minutes. A tentative, \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" will result in a quick change to the English language so don't be intimidated! The location is excellent with easy walking distance to Champs Elysee and Eiffel Tower. George V Metro stop a 3-5 minute walk and this is on the line which runs to Louvre, Notre Dame, Le Marais and a stop across bridge from Musee D'Orsay (Paris Visite Metro passes best bargain in the city). Single subway change to get to Montmartre. The staff are very helpful, friendly, fluently bilingual. The property itself on beautiful, treed, quiet street. Rooms very nicely decorated and spacious. Two large (essentially floor to ceiling with \"mini-balcony\") windows in each room open onto the leafy street. Very comfortable beds. Bathrooms very nicely appointed with L'Occitaine toiletries. Easily set up in-room safe for passports, laptop etc if you wish to use. Free, easily set up, high speed, WiFi in rooms. The buffet breakfast is somewhat expensive by North American standards (19 Euros for adults) but very standard for Europe and was great with excellent scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon, french toast and crepes, cereal, croissants, addictive pain au chocolat, fruit etc etc. Also great bottomless coffee, cappuccino, hot chocolate for kids etc. We essentially used it as a main meal to start the day, then small \"snack\" in mid-afternoon and then out for a late supper. My kids already missing it after returning home. Did not use the service but they will do same day laundry too. Staff arranged a car (VW minibus) for transport to DeGaulle airport for the four of us with bags for 75 Euros which was very convenient and cheap relative to other choices (for 4 people). Not sure if hotel would arrange pickup using same company but suspect yes. I would recommend this hotel without reservation and would plan on staying again whenever in Paris the next time. It felt like a \"home away from home\". Think it is great value relative to many other hotels. Would recommend for families with teenagers, couples looking for romantic location/experience. Also families with small children although I found all of Paris very tolerant and welcoming of kids in strollers. Just might have to be careful to keep those windows locked (they are very secure actually) but think this would be true of nearly all hotels anyway.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "MikeWebb", "ReviewID": "UR18953533", "Content": "I would just like comment on how impressed we were with this hotel.

We found this better than going there on a \"tour\" as you can stroll the wonderful gardens at your leisure and see the petite trianon. The tours generally don't allow for that much wandering on your own. I highly recommend that you check out the bicycles that are right outside the hotel steps about 30 feet to the left. Paris has this great bike rental system. You pick up a bike at one of the many bike stands and return it at ANY bike stand around the city. Be aware that you should return a bike to a stand if you plan to stop off at a place instead of locking it to a post. That way you won't incur usage fees. Simply return the bike, do your thing and return to the bike stand to rent another one. It was a great way to see Paris as a local as we went into neighborhoods that we would otherwise not have seen.

So we turned around and asked Hotel Elysees if we could book another night in the hotel. Unfortunately they were already booked solid and had no rooms available.

We booked a deluxe double on the fourth floor, with two large windows overlooking Avenue Marceau (a note: Avenue Marceau is a busy street and, while the dual-glazed windows keep out the worst of the noise, lite sleepers should request a room at the back of the hotel). The room was quite large by European standards, with a comfortable king bed, a desk, an armoire/entertainment center and two club chairs. The rooms are very nicely furnished in a clean, contemporary style with dark woods and bright accent colors (our room was aniseed). The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, and the bath was well-stocked with soft towels, shampoo, soaps and even shaving and nail care kits. Breakfast, served under the stone vaults of the basement, featured a good selection of pain au chocolat, croissants, breads, crepes, cereals, fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, juices and coffee. The price is a bit steep at 19 euro, but is well worth it for the excellent quality and convenience. But the best feature of the Elysees Regencia is its superb young staff. From the front desk (especially Kathrin, who made all our dinner reservations, and Pascal-Arthur, who arranged for a car to take us to the airport) to the breakfast room to the doorman, the hotel staff are wonderfully friendly, polite and professional (not to mention fluent in English). From the moment we walked in we were made to feel welcome, and every request or question was met with a smile and a prompt and efficient response. It is the staff that makes the Elysees Regencia so special. We will definitely stay here again when (not if!) we return to Paris.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cThe Best little 4 star in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Bellefast", "ReviewID": "UR15375223", "Content": "Returning to Paris for the 5Th time I wanted a small boutique type hotel rather than the large 5 stars I had used before.

Although we were originally booked at the sister property, The Hotel Bassano, we received an e-mail in London from our travel agent that the hotel was not ready and we were being transferred to the Elysees Regencia instead. A little hesitant at not knowing what to expect, any concerns we had were quickly put to rest once we checked in. We had two rooms, a standard with two twin beds for the kids and a superior for us, and both were lovely. Freshly renovated, immaculately clean, very spacious by European standards and decorated in a pleasing aniseed colour palette, they exceeded our expectations. The location of the property is superb - a block from the Champs d'Elysees, and walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Metro station etc. As well, Rue Marbeuf, a street of amazing cafes and bistros, is only a couple of blocks away. We ate breakfast at the hotel on 3 mornings and found the variety and quality of the food very good. It was also very convenient as they start serving very early and you could just walk in, help yourself and be off to start your day of exploring Paris. The price was very comprable with the neighbourhood bistros where we ate on our other 2 mornings. What really stands out about the Elysees Regencia however is the staff - most particularly for us, Kathrin and Nicholas. They were fantastic!! Kathrin, no matter how busy she was, always had time to offer advice regarding tours (\"Don't book a tour of Versailles - just buy train and admission tickets at the Metro and go on your own\" - THE BEST ADVICE!!!), restaurants, shopping areas and attractions.

Using the TripAdvisor 'best offers' system, we got a very good price for a three-night stay. Although it still couldn't be described as cheap, it was a lot cheaper than the highest quoted price, and value for money. The hotel is in one of a number of charming boulevards radiating from the spectacular Place Charles de Gaulle, home to the Arc de Triomphe. It is therefore within easy walking distance of the Seine (Pont d'Alma) and the Arc de Triomphe. Several Metro stops a few minutes walk away, nearest George V on the Champs d'Elysees itself. The hotel is surprisingly intimate, the reception area small, but it has a restrained elegance. A charming spiral stair (and a lift ) leads to the floors above, and each floor has only a few rooms - ours (the 4th) had only three other rooms on it. Our room was not huge, but combined graciousness with tasteful designer features, a very pleasant bathroom and separate loo (with proper doors that locked from the inside). Toiletries were by Occitaine, bath robes and complimentary slippers. Bed with extra cushions was comfortable and warm, the room was quiet with no traffic noise. We had room service (there is no restaurant) and my wife's simple omelette was fresh, nicely presented, and inexpensive. Room service was friendly, courteous and prompt. Every enquiry or request was handled professionally and as if we 'mattered'. Attention to detail is a real feature of the ethos of service at this hotel. On our last evening we had a handwritten note from the manager with a small gift. On arrival the bathroom contained a sprinkling of freshly picked petals, and there was a little tray of confectionery on the dresser (we noticed the same little meringues on sale at MacDonalds in the Champs d'Elysees, but it didn't spoil the effect!). When we left the concierge offered to safe-keep our bags while we strolled around the city before catching our train home, another considerate touch that added to the sense of being cosseted. Altogether a fine hotel with staff who can feel proud of the result of their efforts with guests, and every centime of the price we paid was worth it.

The Arc de Triomphe, at the top of the Champs Elysees, is a 7 or 8 minute walk slightly uphill from the hotel. The nearest Metro station, George V, is a further 2 or 3 minutes down the Champs Elysees. The station is on Line 1 of the Metro system which stops at many of the popular destinations including Louvre, and Concorde, and Chatelet Les Halles where you can switch to most of the other lines. The Trocadero is a 10 to 15 minute walk and offers great views of the Eiffel Tower, as well as a number of interesting places to eat. The Tower itself can be reached in 20 to 25 minutes on foot but be prepared to queue for a long time if you want to ascend the Tower. There are many restaurants and cafes in the vicinity which should cater for most tastes and wallets. A quick note for foodies: The 2 star Michelin restaurant, Alain Senderens, which is located in Place de la Madeleine, is excellent and only a 10-minute taxi ride away. There have been some comments on this site about the roads outside being busy at night. On one side of the hotel there is a main road and, of course, there will be traffic noise - it is a city after all. We were not troubled by traffic noise and the hotel is the quietest in which I have stayed in Paris whilst remaining close to the action. I think it is also important to note that at no time did we feel uncomfortable strolling the surrounding streets, even in the early hours on the way back from restaurants. Now for the hotel. Inside, everything looks very good. The chic d\u00e9cor is nicely done. It certainly has the feel of a quality establishment. We stayed for two nights in a standard double room which was well-presented and very clean. Although the entire hotel has recently been fitted-out, there were signs of early wear-and-tear: a large tile was loose in our bathroom; there was some sort of duct-tape covering damage on one of the edges of the desk; and one of the bedside light fittings was loose and a little battered. On the plus side the shower was excellent (a rare thing in hotels these days), and the Sharp Aquos LCD television was a nice touch. I should also echo other reviewers' comments that wardrobe and storage space is very limited. The main draw of this place is the staff who are all very helpful spoke excellent English. They were happy to assist wherever they could, be it in recommending sites to visit and places to eat, or simply arranging for an ironing board or power adaptor to be sent to the room. Everything we asked for was dealt with immediately and to our satisfaction. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel. The main reason for this was that a) we tend to eat late breakfasts (or none at all) on our travels exploring the city, and b) 19 Euros for a basic continental breakfast seemed expensive. There are countless cafes and bars everywhere, most of which will offer better value for breakfast. Now the minus points\u2026. On arriving at the hotel at 2pm (1 hour after the hotel expected us) we were disappointed to have to wait nearly 30 minutes for our room to be readied. Being a weekend break time is precious. This wait ate into our valuable holiday time and we were a little disappointed. And the 'welcome' drinks we received? I'll come to that later. The prices for room service were extortionate, even for Paris. The cheapest bottle of (mediocre) wine was 23 Euros. You want a quarter bottle of average champagne? 30 Euros. Fortunately there is a small store almost adjacent to the hotel where I bought a couple of nice bottles of Macon Villages for less than 6 Euros each! I might have given this hotel 5 out of 5, but I am not going to do so. Why? Well, on checking out I was presented with the bill which included a charge of 10 Euros for the \u2018welcome\u2019 drinks we received on our arrival. Taken aback, I questioned this with the receptionist and the response was a simple shrug of the shoulders \u2013 an entirely inappropriate response. (Unfortunately I had a plane to catch and did not have the time to take it up with the management.)

They and the hotel did not dissappoint! We stayed for over a week, probably longer than the average stay. The room was kept clean, with fresh towels, and the bed was even turned down most nights. I particularly liked the ability to control the air conditioning by thermostat in my room. Probably their most special asset is the front desk staff - always cheerful and helpful. After a few days my daughter kept commenting how she felt we were going \"home\" to our place in Paris. They have an odd system of making you turn in the front desk key when you leave, but we never had to wait to hand it in or retrieve it. The front desk also sells the two or four day Paris Museum Pass, which I highly recommend for adults in order to bypass long lines at the popular places. Our room did overlook the Avenue Marceu, which I was somewhat concerned about because of the noise experience from other reviewers. We did hear some noise, but most of the time we had no trouble sleeping - sometimes until 10 am. The room has a small safe, which was big enough to hold my 12\" laptop with other items. There is free WiFi in the lobby only (but it will sometimes reach the rooms), and one free laptop permanently in the lobby which was usually available. I was able to print my return boarding passes by saving a pdf to a USB drive and taking it to the front desk (they will lend you one if needed). The location is great - not next to anything particular but in the middle of everything if you don't mind walking and taking the Metro or RER. The only time we took a taxi was to and from the airport (we had heavy luggage for a long stay). It was about a 5 minute walk to the Champs where we could catch the Metro, or a 10 minute walk down Marceu and across the bridge for the RER to Versailles. I am sure the hotel management watches TripAdvisor like hawks, so I will make a few minor suggestions. Some type of chest of drawers or even shelves would be nice, as I wound up having to leave small/folded items in my suitcase. An alarm clock radio in the room would be useful.

I stayed at this hotel because of the high TripAdvisor ratings and I was not disappointed. The Regencia is everything positive that is written about it in the reviews and the high popularity ratings are well deserved. Quality: The rooms are all tastefully decorated in a contemporary style with high quality furnishings. All the pictures on their website are accurate. The rooms all appear recently refurbished and everything appears new. Beds are comfortable with new linens. Bathrooms appear new and immaculate. Rooms are small by US standards, but large by Paris standards. Staff: The staff all spoke excellent English and were very helpful and accommodating. There was none of the legendary Paris attitude. In fact, I never saw this my entire time in France and I don't speak French. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and offer any assistance and also made me feel very welcomed and relaxed. Location: 5 minute walk to Champs- Elysee and Arc de Triumph as well as George V Metro station. 20 minute walk to Eiffel Tower. This is the perfect location for first time Paris visitors looking to do the tourist activities as there are lots of tourists and restaurants on this end of the Champs Elysee. 10 minute walk to the Air France bus stop providing easy and cheap transportation to CDG airport. Recommend red tour bus (Les Cars Rouge) for sightseeing combined with Metro. The tour bus stop is near the Arc de Triumph on the Champs Elysees. Price: Paid 190 Euros per night for a standard single (full) bed room. This was a good value for the area, especially for such a high quality hotel. Miscellaneous: Room safe large enough to hold widescreen laptop. Wifi internet service was spotty, but free, as I believe I was picking up the lobbies free access point from the fourth floor. Paid WiFi internet service is available. The 18 Euro Regencia breakfast via room service was excellent and is sufficient to feed two people. There appeared to be mostly American couples and families in the hotel. This was my first time in Paris, so I had to trust fellow TripAdvisors on this hotel. I truly enjoyed this hotel and will stay there again on my next visit. I slept until 12:00 PM one day as the bed and room were so comfortable.

As it was booked last minute, and it has been a while since I leisure-traveled in Paris and London (and, thus, chose my own accommodations), I decided to give the TripAdvisor community a test with my money by selecting, based on the reviews and comments here, my hotel in both of these places. My review of The Parkcity in London appears elsewhere. The Hotel Elysees Regencia Paris lived up to, and actually exceeded, my expectations. The staff was extremely communicative, from confirming my reservation to setting up transfer to and from the airport; providing me with restaurant reccomendations; assistance with booking reservations; as well as subway directions to nightclubs, attractions, and said restaurants. I found all of the staff to be quite friendly and patient with my merely okay French. All of their communication was in English, and though I apologized for my poor French, it was unnecessary. They were all pleasant, informed, and able to answer questions and assist me with any issue that came up during my stay. Fortunately, no issue did arise. I was placed in a spacious, air-conditioned, Fuschia room with views of the front of the property. Although facing the street, it was quiet at night and sleeping was not a problem. The room was well-kept, turndown service provided, and contained all of the creature comforts (nice toiletries, large soaking tub, mini bar, small flat screen television, and - very important- good task lighting!) I needed. I thought the shower head was too low and ill-placed (I'm 6'2\"), but otherwise the bathroom was great. I also never heard any noises or sounds from other rooms, and the property was fully committed my entire four days there. I did not have the breakfast (it's not included), but may do so when I return. I also did not try their massage services. They have wifi capabilities in the lobby, and a computer for checking email and web browsing. There are also several comfortable sitting areas (non smoking) and a bar for coffee and drinks that I found most pleasant. Overall, the property is a real value - close to several top attractions, and a short walk from the subway. The one thing that was, I don't know, troublesome, was that the place was probably 80+% filled with English speaking travelers. This shouldn't be a problem for me, but it did take away from the feeling I have when traveling abroad and hearing the language and soaking up the flavor of the country I'm visiting.

After a traumatic journey (flight delays, problems on metro etc) we eventually arrived at the hotel. From the outside it is very pretty indeed, with flower baskets in bloom spilling out over a beautiful fa\u00e7ade. Once inside the hotel is very calm and very modern, a real oasis from the busy main road out front. We were greeted in English, very quickly checked in and on our way up the small lift to our room which was on the 4th floor. I just have to say that the halls and stairs are really nicely done, very modern but mixing so easily with the obvious age of the hotel. We were in Room 45 (one of the green rooms) and were very pleased with the whole feel of it. I have been told that most rooms in Paris are very small which is why we booked an upgrade and it was worth every penny. Pristine white sheets, a MASSIVE bed, very comfortable pillows, plenty of storage space, a flat screen TV with English channels, Tea making facilities and two HUGE windows which opened out on the street below. The bathroom was wonderful too, very modern and classy, with an excellent supply of toiletries and extras that go towards making you feel so special. There were also robes and slippers provided as well as clean towels every day. The shower was the only slight odd thing as it was over the centre of the bath and not very high up so my hubby had a bit of bother as he is over 6ft. The room was serviced every day and turned down at night with little chocolates on your pillow which I am sure is the expected but for me was lovely. The hotel is 5mins at the most from the Champs Elysees, the River Seine and the Arc de Triomphe so is exceptionally situated for a short break. The only issue I had was the traffic outside the hotel, the road is very very busy but I suppose that is Paris for you and nothing that can be done about it \u2013 the windows are pretty good at blocking it if you keep them closed! We didn\u2019t take up the Breakfast option, as it isn\u2019t cheap and Paris is so full of little cafes that serve wonderful coffee, fresh pastries and eggs that it is much more fun to go out and eat. We did have a drink in the hotel bar, which was quite reasonable and the service was exceptional (the service for everything in the Hotel was exceptional). All in all, it is perfect for a City Break, where you want to be in the thick of things, aren\u2019t bothered about busy roads and streets and want a little bit of luxury as well. We would definitely return to the Hotel Elysees Regencia if we were only in Paris for a couple of days, if you are coming for a longer period of time I would advise staying in the outskirts and travelling in to see the sights as it is much quieter and cheaper!", "Date": "June 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cmarvelous stay\u201d", "Author": "peter_SFSanFrancisc0", "ReviewID": "UR7838606", "Content": "We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Hotel Elysees Regencia and we had a marvelous stay.

First thoughts....WOW! The hotel was exactly as it appears on its website, it's absolutely beautiful. We made our own way to the hotel after flying into CDG. We got the RER at a cost of \u20ac32 return and found it very easy despite getting a little disorientated at Gare De Nord. We took the train from CDG to Gare De Nord then from Gare De Nord to Chatelet Les Halles on the 'D' Line where we changed on to the 'A' line to Charles De Galle Etoille. From here we encountered the Arc De Triomphe and found that our hotel was on the exact opposite side from the RER station, just a 5 minute walk from the Champs Elysees. The hotel was in the most perfect location. Literally one street from the Champs Elysees and at the bottom of the road and across the river was the Eiffel Tower. You could not ask for a better location to explore the city and to top it off, the weather was glorious. The room was clean and spacious and absolutely gorgeous. The bathroom was fantastic with huge white fluffy towels and bathrobes. The mini-bar was well stocked but expensive. The bed.....well, probably the comfiest bed we have ever slept in! What really made the hotel outstanding was the special touches such as the L'Occitane products on our bed on our last night with a handwritten note from the manager saying she hoped we enjoyed our stay. Each night we came back to the hotel to find our bed had been turned down and the curtain closed ready for us. We were given clean towels twice a day and the bins were emptied daily.

We went for a deluxe room, which was quite large, with a huge and very comfortable bed. We had told the hotel about my 'special birthday' and there was a half bottle of champagne and fruit in the room when we arrrived, which was a nice touch. Lovely bathroom, with fluffly robes and up-market toiletries (Occitane). Breakfast was served in the basement, which had a character all of its own! We had breakfast there on the first morning, I have to say it didn't seem very well organised. No-one told us what to do, it was unclear as which items were included in the continental breakfast, which was 12 euros, and which in the full breakfast, which was 18 euros; we were offered tea or coffee from a communal pot but no-one came to offer refills although I'm sure we could have had refills if we'd gone to find someone. We decided after that to have breakfast in the room for the other two days and that was lovely, particularly when we were given a complimentary glass of champagne and smoked salmon on the morning of my birthday! The full breakfast at 18 euros was very good value. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, especially Kathrin, who seemed to be on duty almost the whole time we were there! She speaks excellent English but I was disappointed not to use my French, as I speak it quite well - my efforts to speak in French were answered in English, so I gave up after a while! Room service was excellent - we ate in the room on the Sunday evening and had pizza and tapas, with a bottle of wine. There were a couple of minor problems, one was the total lack of drawer space in the room - there was a bit of shelf space but it was not enough, and the hanging space in the wardrobe was just about long enough for a shirt - not adequate for skirts or dresses. The furniture rather let the room down, it seemed rather cheap and basic. The other problem was the lift. There was only one, which is fair enough as there is limited space, but it broke down on the Saturday and was still not working when we left on the Monday. Being on the fifth floor, we found it quite a hike, and my husband has a heart condition (although to be fair the hotel could not have known that). Had we known the lift was unreliable, we would have asked for a room lower down. The staff were very apologetic though and did everything they could to help, they brought our cases down on the day we left. I felt very sorry for the staff member who had to carry a heavy dinner tray up from the basement on the Sunday evening. I thought the hotel was a little on the expensive side but it's in the Champs Elysees area, so that's hardly surprising; it would have been nice to have had breakfast included for what we paid, but having said that, we did get a few freebies in honour of my birthday! Just a quick word about the area - the restaurants are plentiful (except on Sunday evening, when just about EVERYTHING is closed, hence the pizza in the room!!) but they are very expensive and the ones we went to weren't particularly good either. I stayed in the Notre Dame area last year and it's much cheaper to eat there.

As this was a break to celebrate our anniversary, we decided to splash out on the Lavender Suite, which looks truly beautiful on the hotel website. We arrived at the hotel and were welcomed by Aline who was extremely helpful and were very impressed with the reception area and bar, where we enjoyed a lovely glass of wine while our room was prepared. Five minutes later we were shown to our room, which was beautiful. We were particularly impressed with the champagne, fruit plate and hand written note from the staff, welcoming us to the Elysee Regencia and hoping that we had a lovely anniversary. We were also impressed with the rose petals on the bed, although a little disappointed when they turned out to be fake! We can\u2019t fault the quality of the room on any front apart from one. Having booked the best suite in the hotel we had hoped for a view, however, the suite is on the ground floor, and not only does it not have a nice view, it doesn\u2019t have any view, as the glass windows are frosted over. You could not even open a window to let air into the room. Temperature wise this is not a problem as the air-conditioning was more than adequate, but it was slightly disappointing and the room did feel a little dark and claustrophobic. Apart from that, the room was wonderful, with a gorgeous bath, which we enjoyed with the lovely toiletries and champagne from the mini-bar. The bar in the hotel, although quiet, does make a fantastic Mojito, the wine is lovely and the service first-class. We never ventured to the breakfast room but did enjoy breakfast in our suite one morning, which was good. The area itself, although beautiful, and quite central, is very quiet and not the place to stay if you are looking for a more lively atmosphere. The only final issue with the Elysee Regencia was a problem with a restaurant recommendation on our second night. A booking was made for us at the Bistro Olivier at the recommendation of one of Elysee staff. We were a little unsure when we first arrived at Bistro Olivier, being the only customers there, but considering the quietness of the area, thought that perhaps we should give it a shot as the hotel undoubtedly knew the good restaurants better than we did. After ordering our meal, we became more worried with the musical choice of the restaurant (Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u2018I Will Survive\u2019) and the distinctive sound of a microwave in the background. We were treated to a dubious, complementary asparagus soup, of which we sampled half, before our starters arrived. One bite of the microwaved goats cheese and soggy tinned vegetables in front of us convinced us that it was time to make a sharp exit, so we paid for what we had had, and left. Whatever you do, don't go there!!!!! The next evening, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage to make up for the terrible meal of the night before as planned, as a bout of food poisoning ensured that we were kept to our suite at the Elysee, with one of us ill. However the room service enjoyed by the other was apparently very good, although it didn\u2019t make up for missing our last night in Paris.

This was our first time in Paris so we searched lastminute.com for somewhere close to the Eiffel Tower / Champs Elysees and this came up as the highest rated hotel in the area on Tripadvisor. The reviews are spot on, what a find! The hotel decor is a bit unusual but it's very nice and really works. We stayed in a room on 5th floor which had a small balcony and view of the top of Eiffel Tower. As far as I can tell most of the rooms do not have a balcony, only those on the 5th, the ones below and above have windows so the balcony is a real bonus if you can get it - nice to stand out and watch the lights on the top of the Tower. The room wasn't huge but I gather this is normal in Paris, nevertheless it was well laid out with lots of space. A minor problem is the lack of draws but there is ample cupboard space. The bathroom is a good size and the toilet is separate which is a good idea. Towel changes are twice daily and we came back to our room every night to find the duvet turned down with a chocolate on the bed for each of us. The hotel staff are very friendly and their good grasp of English more than made up for our lack of French. One thing we found a bit weird is that they ask you to drop your keys off whenever you go out, it's a bit annoying at first, especially if you keep forgetting things! But you soon get used to it. The room had pretty much everything you need, hairdryer, TV, minibar, safe, toiletries, tea/coffee making facilities. I didn't notice an alarm clock but we had one with us anyway so not a problem. Try the buffet breakfast service, it's not cheap at 18 Euro each but it includes a glass of champagne and all you can eat. The service was great and it's held in the hotel cellar which is very nice with a great atmosphere. Bit of an expense but how often do you go to Paris? In terms of location the hotel is perfect. Arc de Triumph is less than 10 mins walk, Eiffel Tower less than 15. Nearest Metro is 5 minutes away on George V Ave and you are pretty much spoilt for choice for restaurants in the area. Girlfriend is a very fussy vegetarian but we found 3 great restaurants with good vegetarian choices within easy walking distance of the hotel - Findi on George V Ave (5 min walk), Ziti on Rue Pierre Charron (less than 10 min walk), Trattoria Dell'Angelo on Ave Rapp (just over the Seine, 15 min walk). A couple more tips - there are quite a few good shops in the street next to the hotel (out of hotel, turn left, then first right), here you'll find a supermarket, wine store, bakery, and a cluster of other useful places. There's a very late opening supermarket on Rue Galilee (off Ave Marceau where the hotel is located, turn left out of hotel then 2 or 3 streets on the left) - very handy for late night shopping for drinks and snacks. It was open until at least midnight, possibly later. If you get a chance, go up the Arc De Triumph at night, the views are great and if you're there when the hour passes you'll get to see the Eiffel Tower twinkling. Beware the 280 stairs though! The next time we go to Paris we'll definitely be visiting the Elysees Regencia again.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cFabulous boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "English_Al", "ReviewID": "UR7301933", "Content": "Wow, what a find this hotel was.

I still thought there had to be something wrong so I waited tentatively to see our room. Once again, I was most pleasantly surprised. The d\u00e9cor was lovely (we had a fuschia room), the room was spotlessly clean and even the bathroom was superb.

They went out of their way to give us a truly romantic experience of Paris (assisting with Lido reservations, dinner cruises, champagne excursions). Location: The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Metro (at a quick pace). For our purposes, it was very centrally located, close to the Champs-Elysees (and therefore the Lido), the departure for our dinner cruise and the metro station that goes directly to Versailles. Some may prefer to have a Metro on their doorsteps. The hotel is on a one way road and is not noisy at all. Room: We stayed in a suite on the 6th floor and therefore had none of the typical complaints about small Parisian rooms. Rooms were clean, well stocked mini bar, good quality linen. The towels were changed twice a day. The TV channel had a few English channels (Sky, BBC, MTV), but no inhouse movies. The bath and shower were a good size. The bed was comfortable and there was ample cupboard space. The staff don't kick you out early to start cleaning the room - they wait for you to leave before entering the room and you are hardly aware of them. The champagne and note on the ocassion of the anniversary was a nice touch.

A very short walk to some lovely restaurants \u2013 just ask at reception. As it was our honeymoon the hotel had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be in the room for our first night with a hand written message congratulating us. There were a couple of negatives but they were mostly minor. The sound insulation of the room wasn\u2019t great, and unfortunately on the first night there was a group of lads in the next room who woke us up at 1am. However, a quick phone to reception and all was blissfully quiet. After they moved out, we weren\u2019t bothered by next door noise at all. Although the bed was comfortable and large, I think it a shame that it\u2019s 2 mattresses pushed into one. Although it was very well put together, and didn\u2019t actually bother us much, I would still prefer a large single one \u2013 especially on honeymoon. Final niggle was the shower. It\u2019s great but, unfortunately, the drains can\u2019t quite keep up with the water flow if you have the side nozzles on as well. All this means is you have to keep a careful eye on water level in the shower and turn off the side nozzles before water cascades over the edge.

The facility has recently been completely refurbished. We took a Deluxe room, which was not overly large but certainly adequate by Paris standards. The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained, with a large king bed, and an attractive modern bathroom with all new appliances. Separate toilet. Good WiFi connection (with cards purchased from reception). The lobby is compact, but there are three pleasant rooms for drinks and a light meal. The staff were exceptionally polite, efficient and helpful at all times. Breakfast choice was a little on the modest side, but quite sufficient. In a city where hotel tariffs generally range from exorbitant to plain outrageous, this little hotel is a real find. The location is excellent, the rooms are clean and attractive, the staff courteous, and the rates very reasonable. All in all, this is the best value for money I have yet to see in Paris.

It is a traditional Parisain building that has been given a very classy modern refurb. The staff are a great asset to the hotel very friendly and helpful and if your French is not up to scratch, they ALL spoke ecellent English. Everything was very clean and effecient and also quiet. We had a wonderful relaxing time, we are used to walking everywhere so its location on the edge of the main area was not a problem. If I had one complaint with the hotel which for me was unexcusable it was trying to get a taxi. I have to say all weekend we had diffuculty getting taxis in Paris apart from when we went to two great restaurants that had cabs outside in 5 minutes of our request. Whilst I understand that there was some kind of convention on in town the weekend we visted, I have never experienced being told that there are no taxis even though we had asked the front desk to book us one a couple of hours in advance. The receptionist who was so apologetic ran out into the street and virtually comandered one, going beyond the call of duty. As I said earlier, the staff are a great asset to this great hotel. I would have no hesitation in recommending it (as long as they sort the taxis out!)", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel and its Staff.\u201d", "Author": "D&LPiver", "ReviewID": "UR5984518", "Content": "This hotel is well located near the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees and gave us ready access to the city of Paris and its environs (e.g. VERSAILLES).

With only 43 rooms you become more than a quest, you become their responsibility.
