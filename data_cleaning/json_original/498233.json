I am still searching for that perfect hotel there... to no avail. This year we had more folks so I went with this hotel. I called ahead and spoke with Andrew at the desk who assured me I could get 2 suites next door to each other. I was crystal clear about what I needed. I reserved, and upon arrival learned this was not physically possible at this hotel. The first night my husband and I were at one end of the floor and the kids were in the other. BTW Andrew neglected to tell me this was an \"interior\" suite; which is close to a small prison cell. Day 2 we got moved to a standard room, but closer to the kids. This is where the maid took the cash off of our desk and then looked surprised and said \"oh, that wasn't my tip?\" Mind you the cash was attached to a safety pin! Fast forward to the \"waterfall\" in the kid's suite (#239) bathroom, leaking from above (toilet??? ewe) and they had to be moved as well. Oh, did I mention the maids did not clean their room for 2 days, then came in and took all of the snacks and alcohol and bottled water from the room? It was like something out of the Twilight Zone. I mean, who does that??? Tami, one of the managers assured me prior to checking out that the change in cost on our room would be recorded and that she would call me; BUT she did not make the needed changes nor call me. Heather at the desk had to do this because Tammi had done nothing. I am still waiting for the money difference on my CC. Heather was very nice and it remains to be seen if she comes through.

Most of the rooms go up 4 stories over an attrium above the lobby/bar/breakfest area and the sound from there can be loud and it echos up to the rooms badly.

This was our 32nd hotel stay in five months travel across North America. We stayed six nights in a room with a king bed, for an average of $84/night (including tax), on the Carlson Family & Friends rate. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good: Our room was on the fifth floor, tucked away from overlooking the foyer area, and with only 9 rooms on this floor we heard very little noise from the lobby that other reviewers note. Our room had a mini-fridge, microwave oven, coffee machine and flatscreen tv with usual selection of cable chanels. Breakfast included in the rate was a great choice of the usual continental style along with a hot dish and fresh make-it-yourself waffles. The breakfast area can get quite busy and a little crowded. Coffee/tea and small snacks (fruit and nut bars) were available after hours near the bar. Free cookies available daily from the reception desk. Washing machine and drier on 3rd floor for a small fee. Drink and ice machine also available. A small selection of grocery items are available next to reception. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small bar on ground floor that opens in the evenings. The large foyer with plenty of seating makes for a nice place to relax. And there's a small pool on ground floor though not used by us. We saw no evidence of bed bugs in our room, had no problems with them either but noted two reports for this place on one of the bedbug registry websites. In a first not seen anywhere else on our travels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel places signs near elevators in the evenings, asking people to be quiet between the hours of 11pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7am. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfortunate though that some people can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read, but we love the idea of asking people to be considerate. Minor annoyances: The room was very small and the window more a porthole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up high with no view or light, but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there for a view. Valet parking (outsourced to another provider) was quite expensive at $32 per night. Whilst we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be certain it was caused here (but with a high likelihood it was), our hire car was returned to us the next morning with a small dint in the rear bumper following its overnight stay here. I note they limit their liability on the valet parking voucher to $10, so best to inspect your car before and after it returns from valet. Initially our mini-fridge and room safe were out of order, however both issues were resolved quickly once raised. Staff service was efficient and attitude depended on the individual, but sometimes was a little aloof. As other guests have commented, the explanation of a fee if you smoke in your room was emphasised quite harshly. The hotel has obviously had problems with this in the past. Whilst the bed was comfortable, our linen had some holes in it, and some rubbish from a previous guest remained next to our bin for the entire duration of our stay, so cleaning could be more attentive. Nearby: The French Quarter is around three blocks walk. In the same street as the hotel you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also find several small convenience stores. Streetcars leave from two blocks away on Canal Street (St Charles Line). The start of Bourbon Street is around 6 blocks easy walk. Try Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant (for great Louisiana style food) a few blocks away on Poydras Street, and the Palace Caf\u00c3\u00a9 on Canal Street for old-style qaintness.

Now this isn't a bad thing for business travelers because they have to be up early anyway.

The room was exceedingly comfortable though somewhat narrow for a family and had a pullout couch that comfortably slept 2 kids and room for a large cot for another. The King bed was in a real bedroom separated by a door, its own chest of drawers, TV, and nightstands which made things nicer for Mom and Dad. There was a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. 2 blocks from Canal Street in a well traveled area the hotel is in walkable distance from the Quarter, the streetcars, the river, the WWII Museum and a slew of other locations. The staff was polite and helpful and the complimentary breakfasts satisfactory. The pool is outdoors and very small but our sons (ages 11,10,8) enjoyed it anyway and swam everyday. Delicious cookies were always available in the lobby and they maintain a nice lending library of books geared mostly to young readers (great idea!!) The concierge was a bit disappointing steering guests to obvious tourist trap restaurants (Bubba Gumps, Margaritaville,) and expensive swamp and ghost tours from which she receives a commission. I'm sure some won't mind this but I prefer to know about more unique, local restaurants that can be researched and found here on tripadvisor. The breakfast area is well maintained but sometimes stressed to keep up with food demand when the hotel is very full or tour groups try to eat all at once.

On the plus side the staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was ample and well-stocked, the building was unique and had charm, the location was fantastic, they allowed us to do an early check-in, and our room (king bed suite) was a good size. However, these great things were overshadowed by three negatives. #1: The room (309) had a dank, musty smell from the momment we walked it. You didn't notice it after a while but every time you entered the room it was apparent and kind of made you feel like you were staying in a dirty place (even though the facilities were very clean). #2: Our room only had one window (in the sitting room area) which looked out on the atrium. As other reviewers have noted, noise from the lobby up the atrium is a real issue. The hotel does put out signs reminding patrons to be quiet at night which is helpful. However, if you wanted to use the pull-out couch provided in the sitting room area for someone to sleep I think this would be problematic as you are sure to have noise. #3: Our biggest issue was the fact that during our three-night stay there were two nights where a junior high/high school group was also staying in the hotel and the noise from their rooms was absolutely horrible. I was woken up at 1, 2, and 4am to conversations that I could hear clear as day through the wall. When I mentioned this issue to the front desk after the first night they said they had special security onsite to manage this group of students and that I could call the front desk if there were any additional issues. I did call the front desk when I was woken up at 4am the next night by the students. I appreciate the fact that the were responsive, but honestly when you are woken up multiple times two nights in a row it just puts a real damper on the stay. I get the impression the management does try very hard to make their hotel a great place to stay so my recommendation to them is to do more on the front end to make sure any school groups they take in are monitoried and checked for noise throughout the night, not only when another patron reports a problem.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warren, Michigan, United States", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Pre-cruise Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Renee R", "ReviewID": "UR124601303", "Content": "We stayed two nights at this hotel prior to our cruise and cannot say enough about the hospitality of the staff.

I liked that the hotel tried to vary the way to serve eggs; one day we had eggs burrito style with cheese, green peppers & salsa; another morning we had fried eggs instead of the usual scambled.

That didnt bother us, even at night when coming from Bourbon I never felt uneasy about the walk. It is a ways from Bourbon though,so if you don't like walking or arent able to walk far get a cab.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Sunnysideoftown", "ReviewID": "UR123794206", "Content": "This was a weekend getaway for my husband and I for his birthday.

Safe neighborhood to walk around in during the day and at night as well. + Clean, spacious and well appointed bedroom with all the amenities, i.e., refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker, large closet with safe, roomy bathroom, free in room wi-fi, etc. + Quiet bedroom. Ours was on the 3rd floor facing the parking lot so although the view was not exciting, the silence was greatly appreciated. + Close to restaurants and cafes nearby, plenty of hotels in the area as well. + Hotel staff was friendly, personable and professional at all times. + Price was fair and reasonable. * Hotel Minuses: - We did not receive the free daily USA Today newspaper as was mentioned in the booking. Although I suppose we could have inquired at the front desk for it, we didn't bother since it was the holidays after all. - The small breakfast room is wholly inadequate to cater to large number of guests so during \"rush hour\" in the morning or during the holidays, the queue and wait time for a table can be quite long and tiresome. The first and only time we tried breakfast at the hotel, the breakfast sausage patty turned out to be totally 100% frozen still. I guess in the hurry to get the breakfast out as quickly as possible, the breakfast chef forgot to cook it! Well, since this is New Orleans and there are no shortage of places to eat, we recommend the Ruby Slippers Cafe across the street or the Commerce Restaurant around the corner for excellent breakfast.

The bathroom was good and the sleeper sofa looked brand new and was the best one I have ever layed down on. The kids were in there and the mattress on it was almost as comfortable as the bed. I guess my only criticism was that it could be a bit noisy from the ground floor where the lounge was but it could only be heard if you were in the sleeper sofa, not in the master room further back. And to their credit, when we rolled in after midnight one night, there were signs posted on the way to the elevator to please be quiet, that guests were sleeping. I thought the breakfast was very good, they even offered cut up fruit, instead of just the usual banana or apple. The front desk was very helpful and efficient. The rate was fabulous. Somehow I stumbled on to their promotion that if you opened one of those points type account with them and clicked \"like\" on your Facebook page, they would give you a special rate.

Check in was quick and easy. Getting to my room was a little more difficult. I was on the 3rd floor and had to go up and down (after taking the elevator to the 3rd floor) 3 sets of short stairs to get to my room, bags in tow. This was inconvenient. I found a closer elevator later, which required only one set of steps, but still annoying. The room, with a single king size bed, was small but very clean. The television was at an odd angle and thus difficult to see, but I didn't watch much so it didn't bother me. My first morning I signed off on \"no room cleaning\" because I had work to do and didn't want to be disturbed. I went out for lunch and when I came back somebody had cleaned the room anyway, and that was bothersome. I also don't understand why hotels put out the \"save the environment\" cards regarding towels and linens, I returned towels to the towel-bar, but they were changed anyway. Really don't need the greenwashing. The hotel advertises free breakfast; I went once and it wasn't good. Micro-waved bacon and not very good biscuits and gravy.

There was plenty of seating in the breakfast room, outside the breakfast room and even in the courtyard area by the pool. Service was great and everything was replenished quickly.

This one stood out because the staff was always pleasant and willing to help and the buffet areas was kept clean even with the steady flow of guests. While we did not experience any noise from the other rooms and we were far away from the high traffic areas within the hotel our room was opposite a housekeeping room and one night there was such a racket in there.

Lots of noise drifted up to the room from the lobby (to the front/sitting room) and from the street (to the bedroom in the back). I suspect that rooms that don't overlook the lobby would be less loud. I was in New Orleans for a wedding and shared a suite with friends, and even though I drew the short straw and got the foldout couch, I slept well (it's a very comfortable foldout, even for grownups). I did have to wear earplugs due the aforementioned noise issues, but that's standard travel procedure for me anyhow. Next time I visit New Orleans, I will definitely consider this hotel, though I would request a less-noisy room (and still make sure I had my earplugs!). I would totally recommend it, especially if you're planning on spending a lot of your time in New Orleans out and about, not hanging around the hotel.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "roadtrip411", "ReviewID": "UR120165968", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and got the last minute upgrade to the king mini-suite.

Here's the disappointment. The concierge staff are employees of the tour companies and we know, in retrospect, that we were not given the best advice on how to see the city. Without going into all the details of our troubles, here are the lessons we learned. If you want an overall tour of the city, - or - a specialized tour to a specific area, find a veteran cab driver and arrange him to drive you. This is tricky as lots of cab drivers are new to New Orleans (at least post-Katrina) and do not know their way or the history. But there are veterans who will give you a wonderful personalized tour. The bus tours can waste 1.5 hours of your day as they pick up and drop off people from other hotels. Next, Tripadvisor reviewers have it right --- Confederacy of Cruisers bike tours are super. Jeff and his staff are full of history and information and advice and humor and his tour was the highlight of our trip.

The room had large LCD tv's, microwave and refridgerator. My only complaint was the shower nozzle was pretty abrasive for me, but to be fair, my wife thought it was fine. I rated this hotel a 5 more because it was a nice hotel with a great location for a very affordable price ($100). A really great value. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a value hotel. One thing to note, if you drive, there is a $25 per day valet parking charge.

The location, just a couple of blocks outside the French Quarter, meant we had a short walk to almost everything.

We particularly enjoyed the Bon Ton Cafe right next door, which can compete with the best in this food-crazy town. The people at the hotel were friendly, most with the sort of wry humor you often find in NOLA. We might not have felt we were familiy, but we certainly felt they were letting us in on their jokes. Breakfast was more than adequate, though not a match for what's available outside. A tip: walk over to Conti Street and try the Somethin' Else Cafe for breakfast at least one morning. Wow!

We booked a 1 bedroom suite and there was plenty of room in it, the beds were very comfortable (I travel alot and am very picky with the bedding), and it was very clean. Don't get me wrong--it is not a Westin or Waldorf--but you are also NOT paying $300+ a night. Considering the cost of a room here and its location (walking distance to most everything in the french quarter and the warehouse district--very convenient), I was more than pleasantly surprised--in fact I was apprehensive about booking it because i can be a hotel snob--I've stayed in many really nice hotels and because of that have certain expectations. I had my children with me (teenagers) so it was nice to be close to everything and to feel like I was in a safe neighborhood when walking back to it at night. The breakfast had a good variety (but not my favorite comparing it to other hotels in a similiar price range) and was fresh but I really can't complain when it's included with the room. My only complaint is one evening at 11:30 pm, we went into the courtyard to unwind and I put my feet into the pool to relax them after walking all day. After being there for 5 min, a security guard rushed out and said that the pool closes at 11. (You are allowed to be in the courtyard but a sign says the pool closes at 11--I didn't think putting my feet in 4 inches of water while sitting there quietly and completely sober would warrent the security guard to come rushing out but I guess technically I was breaking the rule of no swimming after 11.)

Canal Street divides the French Quarter from the Central Business District, and this hotel is located about 2 blocks away from Canal Street. It's only a couple blocks from the Audubon Insectarium, to which my husband and son walked because it was so close. The hotel is about 7 blocks away from the Louisiana Children's Museum, and we walked there, as well. Once you reach Canal Street, you can take the Canal Street cars down to the Mississippi River, and take another street car from there--right in front of the Audubon Aquarium. Or you can take the Canal Street car down to the St. Charles street car down to the Garden District. The swimming pool is kind of small because it's tucked into a charming little courtyard, but it does the job if you just want to take a quick dip for cooling down from the New Orleans heat. It's a nice little spot with lots of greenery and waterfalls. As far as parking goes, this hotel has valet parking only. So you will have to pay hefty charges for parking in this city. I forgot what we paid to park; you might want to call the hotel for that info. But better to pay for parking and walk or ride public transportation where you can. Don't drive here if you're from out of town.

So voices carry easily within the rooms. We had two problems during our stay: 1. The small refrigerator in our room, so all the food we had in there spoiled. 2. The toilet overflowed because the ball inside the tank kept getting stuck whenever we flushed it.

They put us up at another hotel of their choice for the first night at their expense, and refunded the first night. Nice, but if we had been offered this option up front, we would have declined - we wanted the room we prepaid for. We spent a good part of the next day dealing with the fall-out, from checking out of the other hotel, walking our baggage ~1/3 mile to the original hotel, leaving bags because it was too early for check-in, then returning later in the day (but not too late) to actually check in. They were aware that their solution to the problem did not make things right for us, but making things right was apparently not important to them. No other options were offered. This apparently happened to another guest (the manager confused me with someone else who was apparently a victim of a similar situation) so it appears that this strategy is not uncommon for them. I suspect that rooms were available, but not 'standard' rooms, and it was cheaper for them to move us to another hotel for the first night than to upgrade us for 4 nights. During the course of the conversation, the manager said that if we had not used a 3rd party, the outcome would have probably been different. The hotel itself was fine - not great - and the customer service aside from resolution of this problem was good. But their attitude in resolving a major problem - no interest in making up for a huge mistake on their part that caused their customer tremendous inconvenience - would keep me from ever staying in this hotel in the future. If we could have easily changed hotels, we would have ... but as this would have required yet more effort and made a bad situation worse, we decided not to leave.

The Country Inn & Suites was a nice place for us to stay--the converted warehouse-to-hotel was very unique and the court yard was picturesque and beautiful. The free morning breakfast was decent and the hotel was conveniently located to walk to most attractions nearby. The staff was very helpful and friendly, especially the concierge Kathy. She was extremely helpful with making suggestions for dinner, activities and warning us NOT to take our young teenage kids down Bourbon Street after dark (very good advice :o) ). The only negative part about this hotel was the view from our room. We were on the ground level with ceiling to floor windows that overlooked two trash dumpsters in an alley. To make it even less appealing was that cars were parked in the alley only 5 feet outside our window, so we were unable to keep the curtains open. And both nights in the early morning, loud arguments broke out between couples in the alley which woke me up and continued on for 30 minutes or so. I realize the hotel had no control over some of this, but this negative situation was a result of the hotel's location.

I stayed March 2-5, so it was slightly before. The hotel is pretty in an old school warehouse. We spent the extra to get a suite so my parents (who decided to join) could have the bedroom and I would sleep on the pull out bed. The first night they placed us in a suite with a couch that did not have a pull out bed. I had to sleep on the most uncomfortable couch and all they did was give us a measley $20 which really wasn't enough for the price we paid for that night and the discomfort. The moved us to another room, but it was quite annoying and a waste of two hours to do the switch. The breakfast is great; the bartender (forgot his name) was also really nice. The worst part is that the hotel FAILED to tell us that if we left the hotel, we would not be able to come back to it until the next day. On March 4th, the day of my conference, we left the hotel at 8am and when we tried to come back around 7pm, we were told to leave the city and come back at 1am. UH WHAT?! The staff alerted us that there would be valet delays and limited access at time, but they really should have said NO ACCESS. When I called, stuck on a street three blocks away, they were no help with directions. Thankfully we found street parking and didn't have to pay to park in a garage. With all this, the staff simply did not care. They ended up not charging us for valet parking for that day, but we have to tell them not to. I wish for all the trouble they put us through, they at least compensated us. The hotel is in a great location, but they need to work out their kinks.

This is even more the case during Mardi Gras where poor service is abundant with the excuse \"it's mardi gras\". That is not the case at this hotel. The housekeeping, breakfast service, bar service, front desk service was better than what I see at the higher end hotels during non carnival stays.

No problem with check in when we arrived back at the hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the atrium. Although we heard some noise from downstairs earlier on (that's the area where the bar is), by bedtime it was quiet and the hotel posts requests for quiet after hours. Even the night of the game, when everyone was coming back kind of hyped (especially the winners-yay!) it was peaceful. They have coffee in the lobby 24 hours. The only suggestion I would make is that they make hot water available too. We were able to brew tea in the room, as we had a coffee maker and a refrigerator, which came in handy. We had free internet in the room that worked with no problems. We had a suite with 2 queens, a pull out sofa in the living room, TVs in both rooms and a vanity area separate from the bathroom, which was good because there were 3 of us.

We stayed because we had prepaid and because we were so tired and hungry by then that finding another room was just too much stress. When I told the desk about the smell, they gave me a can of air freshener. We were on a 20 day trip and made many reservations through Priceline. This was the only one that gave us problems. We had also stayed in Country Inn and Suites in other cities with no problems. However, after this experience, we will never stay in one again. To make matter worse, when we got home we discovered they had double charged us for the room. Still trying to resolve that problem. Note: Thanks to Frank, the clerk who tried to solve our problem, and for recommending a really good restaurant for our first meal in New Orleans. I have been looking forward to this trip to New Orleans for years, and only his action saved it from being a total bummer.

They have fixed rates around the city (as airport to hotel and back, and from hotel to cruise). Some idiots think that only rich people can cruise. Wrong. We are on the budget, but we cruise (4 people for $2K, tax included, 7 nights cruise, NCL! check for offers). It is cheaper than to stay in a hotel and buy food. So, about taxi. They charge 11 dollars/ person... for the trip that less than 1 mile. Good that we check maps. We walked there with suitcases just 15 minutes... Saved close to 50 bucks. Keep in mind that hotels make money on taxi (regular price from there to the cruises is $7/person). Hope, it helps. Ah, we also had microwave, ref. It helps. And their breakfast was OUTSTANDING.

When any of us pooped, the toilet got stuffed. No matter how little nor if we even gave a courtesy flush. We called the front desk and someone would come up with a plunger or snake.

They were going to move us after 2 days but maintenance said there was no need because he was going to snake the toilet while we were out.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our needs didn't extend beyond the basics of check-in/out and a few questions about directions, but I felt they could have handled anything. Rooms are clean and updated. It's not a five star/luxury hotel, but it had everything we needed - modern bathroom, nice toiletries, comfy bed, tv, desk, reading area w/ chair/ottoman. We were on the first floor straight back from the entrance, so our view was nothing to write home about. I recommend asking for one of the upper floors. On Tuesday morning around 3 a.m. the garbage men were busy/loud clearing dumpsters. Lots of beeping from the trucks and yelling. I confirmed with a friend who's visits frequently that this is a regular occurrence. Two of the best things about this hotel are the free breakfast & free internet. Great spread of some hot items (eggs, sausage, french toast), and the basics like cereal, yogurt, bagels, muffins, etc. It was a great way to start the day. All rooms have free internet. We had free wireless in our room too, but that may have been because we were on the first floor. They advertise that the lobby is a wifi area, and we may have had it too just because of proximity of our first floor room. Location wise, this worked well for us. It's an easy walk to Canal Street and the French Quarter. Had it been warmer (was in the 40s and WINDY), I think we could have walked to most of our planned destinations. We skipped a lot given the bad weather. But it resulted in more time relaxing at the hotel, and that was okay too. Our three night stay totaled about $305. This was the deal of the century!

The water being available was nice as I just refilled my empty bottles and that saved me buying it all the time. The location is excellent. The breakfast is good for it being free. I don't go somewhere just to eat so having breakfast in the am provided is great. It saved me having to spend time and money getting fed in the am. I also took some apples and oranges for later. They always have free, home baked cookies at the front desk as well. I only had one once but they were good and a nice bonus. There are free USA Today everyday in the lounge.

I don't know if it was the paint they used or a smell coming from the air conditioning but every time I opened the door I was hit with it. Lastly, I left a tip for the maids every day but it seems like they did the bare minimum in cleaning. I noticed the walls had quite a bit of dirt on them and also a kind of black handprint residue on the back of the bathroom door. I called and asked for the walls and door to be cleaned. It never was and I gave up on asking. I don't think they really vacuumed the room once while I was in it. I don't think they wipe down the furniture either as there were handprints on the glass table from previous people who stayed there. It was just overall a bit dusty and could have used a deeper clean. I also don't think any attempt was made to clean the toilet or sink basin once I was in the room. They did the tub, this I know since my dirty footprints were gone! But, the toilet could have used a clean et et.

Not everyone wants waffles but no one wants to skip in line so they wait and wait for the line to move down to the rest of the food.

The first time I was told that Rouse's Market was about five blocks from the hotel, when it was really six blocks past where the woman had marked it on the map. I had to walk back almost a mile with four bags of groceries. But the really eggregious event happened later that evening when I needed to have a prescription filled for my daughter. The same woman (I do not know her name) told me that the closest 24-hour pharmacy was a Walgreens in Metairie. When I got into the cab that night at 11 p.m. the cabdriver asked me why I was going all the way to Metairie since there was a 24-hour Walgreens seven blocks away on St. Charles Street. Needless to say, I was furious and frustrated. I spent $40 round trip cab fare getting this much-needed prescription for my daughter. When I told a manager about both these incidents on Thursday afternoon (again, I do not know his name), he took notes, told me how sorry he was, gave me a hug (which I thought was weird) and asked if there was anything I needed, like towels. He also said that \"They would be talking about this.\" What I'd really like is my $40 back for a cab ride that I didn't need to take and an assurance that this staff member was spoken to. I thought there might be some mention of my terrible experience at checkout, but there was none. I did, however, have to point out to the front desk that the room charges for each night of my stay were $5/night more than what had been quoted to me. They did make the change, but this mistake, after my other experiences with the front desk, did not leave me with a overall good impression of that property. The free breakfast is pretty standard fare--nothing special or particularly nutritious. My daughter and I bought some high-fiver cereal, milk and fresh fruit after going to breakfast the first morning. One example of poor quality: The assorted fruit (grapes, melon, peaches) they put out was mushy and tasteless, as if it had come in a frozen package which had been left to defrost too long so that the fruit absorbed much of the water as it defrosted). Room location is key in this hotel. Our room was great--#501. But I had asked for a room on a high floor, away from the elevator, as I always do. We had no view, but I didn't care about that. Our one-bedroom suite was so, so quiet (at least the bedroom part). Part of the problem at this hotel is that the open lobby extends up all five floors, so if your room is off the long hallway over the open lobby, you're going to hear everything going on in the lobby. Ask for a room away from the open lobby. 501, for example, was at the very end of this long hallway, the bedroom was in the back of the room, off the living area.

The 2nd day, our child became very sick, so we could not leave when they came to clean. Instead, we just swapped out towels with them. They were very nice about this. The rooms are spacious by NO standards, but they are noisy. You can hear through the walls and ceilings, and sometimes, it sounded like a herd of elephants was about to fall through our ceiling. Luckily, we travel with a sound-machine, which provides white noise. This did help in the bedroom, but it was still loud above and around us. There is a small swimming pool that our son enjoyed quite a bit. It really is small--more than one family at a time would fill it up. Still, it's in a nice courtyard setting and is a nice treat on a hot day. We did use the valet parking and had no problems at all with this. They recommend calling 15 or 20 minutes before you'll be down to get the car, and our car was always waiting on us. This was easier (to us) than trying to self-park somewhere else in the area.

There are elements of the building that are lovely - the architectural detail is just beautiful in the lobby area. But, we were not impressed with the front desk staff at all - my husband said that he thought the best word to use was \"surly\" and I would agree. They didn't even bother to make eye contact when we checked in, and were downright rude when we checked out. There was a charming bartender at the small lobby bar, and he was a breath of fresh air. The rooms are very very small - without the tall ceilings you would feel like you were in a closet - and we had a two room king suite! I can't imagine how small the hotel rooms felt. The valet parking staff has their work cut out for them, as there is construction going on at the front of the building (beware the noise on weekdays) but they also were indifferent to anything but what hand their tip was in. On the day of checkout we called down and asked if we could get a luggage rack and my husband was told \"we don't have any right now\" and the valet hung up. So my husband spent 20 minutes scouring the hallways for a rack. The televisions dated from the 1980's and the signal was dreadful. Come on people, this is 2010, get a decent TV hookup please. Finally, there was the noise issue. For three straight days we were awakened at 6:30 a.m. by a clock radio turned up full volume coming through either a wall or a hole in the ceilings where the historic beams created kind of a space into the floor above. We called down to the front desk for help all three mornings, but they claimed they could not find the source. Did they continue to look throughout the day? No. Did they offer to move us? No. Did they seem even the slightest bit interested? No. The radio managed to turn itself off via a timer each morning after about an hour of blaring music and advertisements, and of course not until it had ruined any chance we might have of sleeping in.

We only paid $50 and we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and comfort of the room along with the complimentary internet access. It is three blocks west of Canal St, so it is still within walking distance of the French Quarter in good weather. So I recommended it to my friends.

No one was designated to hail a cab. Rather, the front desk would call a cab, but would not give any indication of how long it would take, so we wound up just standing out in the rain to hail a cab ourselves. In addition, we had to make all our requests twice, and it took a long time for them to be fulfilled. We asked for extra blankets and when they did not show up, we had to call back and it took 30 minutes to get them. We asked for an extra roll-away bed, and they didn't even call to request it until our second request. Finally, the valet parking this time was very bad. We called 20-30 min prior (as they instruct you to do) and came out to the door on time (within 20 minutes) to find that our car was there, but the valet with the key was not there and no one at the front desk could be bothered to help us. So we waited for the valet for an additional 15-20 minutes, only to find out that he had left the key at the front desk and not told the other valet attendants and no one at the front desk seemed to know that the key was there. (Note that the valet parking service seems to be contracted out to Central Parking System, but the front desk does not seem to be able to interact with them effectively).

You pass the bar and little breakfast eating area on the way to the elevators, making it convenient. (Free breakfast in the mornings, which would be great if you were pinching pennies or with a family. We chose to eat out both mornings, so I can't speak to the quality of the food.) There's also a small courtyard just off this area with tables and chairs and a small plunge pool. From what they told us, the hotel is made up of several old warehouse buildings renovated to make one big CI&S -- which made it a tad confusing to find our room, but the cleaning lady pointed us in the right direction. The rooms, although not overly large, were perfect for our needs (and clean!) -- just a place to leave our suitcases, shower and sleep. We were on the back side of the hotel so our room looked out over the valet lot and some apartment buildings, but when you're in the middle of the city, you can't expect much more than that. The bathroom was just fine as well. We booked our room for $120 a night, which was a good deal for the quality of the overall hotel and the rooms, especially being so close to the Quarter. Everything in the Quarter that I saw was much more expensive. This hotel is a great choice if you're not dead-set on being in the Quarter and you need something affordable.

The next day we were upgraded to a queen suite (room 302), free of charge. The front desk was concerned about heavy rains (which never came) and a possible leak in our room.

I also spoke with Karen in the reservation dept. prior to our arrival. She was kind enough to fix an error that was made when booking through Travelocity. Everyone at this hotel was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay. Food/Drink: Breakfast was standard, but enough. There were some eggs and make your own waffles. There were also danishes, English muffins, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, etc. The coffee machine was accessible 24 hrs. a day. It was nice to be able to sit outside in the pool area or at extended lobby area at breakfast. Though, the pool area seemed to be a place were all the smokers seemed to congregate.

The maintenance engineer told us that the hotel contained some 8 original buildings to make up the current space. There was a lovely courtyard with a fountain and dipping pool; with lovely blooming vegetation, however, every time I wanted to go in and enjoy the scenery-there were smokers hanging out- so we avoided it...

Beautiful floor to ceiling (12ft) windows! Very clean. Bed was very comfortable. The furniture was not especially fancy, but for the price it was fine. The only suggestion I would make to the hotel would be to upgrade the paper products used in the bathroom- both facial & toilet paper were a bit scratchy. Towels could have been a bit softer. The free Continental breakfast was typical- make your own waffles, breads, bagels, pastry, fruit, etc. I really liked the Mocha in the Coffee machine- they also had Latte and Cappuccino.

We spent the first half at the Country Inn. I think most of the review are pretty accurate. The thing I like best about the hotel was the 5 story atrium with exposed beams, it really helped give the location character and charm. It was an especially nice place to sit in the morning for breakfast instead of in the somewhat cramped breakfast room. Contrary to the previous poster, we didn't hear any noise from the atrium area when we were sleeping. They do post signs in the evening asking people to be quiet as guests are sleeping, but I believe in all the rooms on the atrium the \"sitting area\" is closest to the door with the bedroom at the back part of the room. I would think it would be very difficult to hear noise from the lobby if you are in the bedroom, especially if you close the bedroom door. If you book a one bedroom suite, be warned that you will have two options. The first is a room where there is no window in the bedroom. Great if you want to sleep in, not so great if you are at all claustrophobic, which we discovered we are! The front desk was absolutely great about moving us into another suite, with a window on the street.

It would have been nice to have a white noise machine in the room or the offer of ear plugs though. Never heard any noise from the lobby. The bathroom is a small, typical hotel bathroom but with nice updates such as granite counters. Much too small for the two of us to both get ready in the morning. The mini bar area had a mirror, but not good enough lighting for putting on make up. Housekeeping was not exactly great, only seeming to make the bed and empty the trash. Mini bar counter wasn't wiped down, half empty cups were left, etc. Other than that, the staff was very friendly and helpful.

I booked directly through the website and got a decent price on their suites. I figured since we were traveling with family it would be nice to have a two room suite to congregate in at the end of the day. Even though I booked in advance and directly through their website we were still given room's far away from each other. I will give you some pro's and con's of staying here. Pro's: Yes, it is in a decent location. But in my opinion, their were several good hotel's close to the main attraction's and Bourban street. We walked almost everywhere. Alway's felt safe. The police were out in full force during our stay. The hotel is set-up different than most hotel's. It consist's of several wharehouses grouped together. Had a lot of charm. Check-in was very fast. Had a decent breakfast selection, but was very crowded with limited seating. Yes, the bar area is very small but there is plenty of seating at tables nearby. The bartender was friendly and made some great drink's. My husband got hooked on the so-called swamp water special. Was actually a very tasty mixed drink.Had beer special's as well during happy hour. Con's; The suites were not all that nice. Room's needed a fresh coat of paint and the bed's were just average. I had read where the bed's were supposed to be really comfortable. Was disappointed to figure this out at the end of a long day. That is one of the main thing's I alway's look for at a hotel. The friendlyness of the staff and housekeeping was hit and miss. Alway's had to request extra washclothes and towel's. Would have been nice to have had room service. Most of the restaurant's near the hotel were closed by 10:00. Our room was near an exit, which became very annoying first thing in the morning when housekeeping was in and out talking and slamming the exit door. You would have thought that the suites would have been in a better location. Overall, this was a decent hotel for the money. We will be staying at the Intercontinental at the end of our cruise.

The pool is small but fits the ambiance of the hotel. It is really a large hot tub but without the jets. Nice just to unwind before going to bed.

Negatives (sorry!): Room air conditioning units work almost too good, noisy garbage trucks collects between 3-5am - request an inside room if this will affect your stay, though there are plenty of sitting areas, the hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge and when large groups stay it seems like they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the entire hotel. I almost forgot I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying in a place that Zagat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t classify as a luxury hotel. CI&S offers the same services but with a personable staff, cozy atmosphere and affordable rates. Forget the fact you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford a room somewhere else or there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any availability. CI&S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sophisticated charm will make you forget you wanted to stay elsewhere. This is truly New Orleans best kept hotel secret, which is why I hesitate to write a good review, though well deserved. I have no idea how they stay in business, being such a great hotel of extremely high quality and service, at such a low price.

Not sure if it was trash pick-up or some sort of construction, but it was impossible to sleep through. Also, you must keep your curtains closed because people on the street tend to look right in. The hotel location was okay. We didn't want to be on Bourbon St. because of noise, but it was a bit farther than I thought it would be from the Market and the heart of the French Quarter.

The hotel concierge was nice and helpful, and the front desk staff was okay, depending on the day. The Cuban restaurant next door is excellent, but there are no other places to eat very close by that we could find. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was quite good, considering that it was free. Parking was $25 a day, but that's standard for NOLA. The pool was TINY--really not a pool at all. Since there was a family and their child there everyday when we visited, we couldn't get in, but that wasn't their fault. They were hot just like we were. If you're not a smoker, you might want to stay away from the pool area anyway, since that is a smoking area and the smell was horrible and we couldn't stay out there because it is very small and people were smoking.

Unfortunately, I hardly think it deserves the high ratings it has received aside from the price factor. Certainly the hotel is a real bargain - we paid in advance on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Web site and nabbed an average nightly rate of $76 + tax - hard to beat that! Had to laugh when I saw the rate posted on the door in our room of $339 + tax - I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay that for this hotel under ANY circumstances, but at the rate we got it was fine. The hotel is a nicely done renovation of old warehouse buildings so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a boxy cookie-cutter. It is very clean and very attractive. We had a standard room with a king bed. Slightly small, but adequate. Specifically requested a room facing the front with windows based on recommendation here. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how I would have felt not having windows, but the truth is our drapes were always closed to keep the sun & heat out. Our toilet wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed to the bathroom floor & was wobbling. It was fixed immediately, but not level - worked fine, but looked silly. Very small bath tub. Someone had written the A/C was cold. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adequate. It feels nice and cold when you come in from the street, but we were sweating during the night even with the thermostat at its lowest setting. The biggest problem we had was with the bed. They have good quality, thick, pillow-top mattresses, but the sheets do not have deep enough pockets to fit the bed. Every morning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wake up with the bottom sheet \u00c2\u00bd way down the bed - very uncomfortable & annoying. Also, the bottom sheet was put on the bed inside out. Three complaints to the front desk staff did nothing, though one day the chamber maid tried to pull the sheet a little lower - she never did turn it right-side in. Generally, the front desk staff have an attitude as if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing you a favor. Day time staff were indifferent and unwelcoming. Night staff much better - helpful & friendly. The concierge girls were helpful & pleasant. The cookies are a nice touch (no one offered them to us & I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have noticed them if I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read about them here), but they are WAY too sweet. The included breakfast was bearable. The counter set-up in the breakfast room in inadequate - too small a space for the number of people. Bagels, English muffins, mini-muffins, cold cereals, yogurts and fruits - can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything wrong with them. Coffee was ok - not terrible as some had written. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not into waffles, but they were a big hit with the crowd, and I do mean big crowds hoping for a chance to make a waffle. The eggs & sausages were absolutely revolting. Give me those runny, dehydrated eggs any day over these dry, cardboard, imitation omelets - disgusting. Sausages looked too disgusting to even try. The courtyard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very pleasant & the mini-pool a life-saver after the broiling heat of the city. They need to empty the courtyard trash and ashtrays more often. This is the only smoking area of the hotel (they only have 3 smoking rooms) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncovered so smokers (me) have no place to go out of the rain. And lastly, the location. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the location and yes, it is less than 3 blocks to the Quarter, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to the EDGE of the Quarter, not its center.

When we arrived we were struck by the beauty of the hotel, especially the lobby area. It has an old world charm appeal. We checked in and even though we were very early we got a room. Unfortuantely it was on the 4th floor and the noise from the AC unit on the roof was unbearable. The front desk graciously allowed us to check out other rooms and we decided on one on the 3rd floor. Much better! The good news: the free breakfast has a good amount of options. There is a computer with high speed internet in the lobby where you can also print. On the downside, if someone is using it you'll have to wait. We found the concierge to be very helpful and informative. The room was small but comfortable. Now for the bad news and there's a lot of it: There were no sheers on the windows in the room, so either the shades had to be open or the room had to be cloaked in darkness. The TV is in an awkward position which makes it difficult to see from the bed. Our iron leaked black stuff on my boyfriends pants. We requested a new iron and it never came. We told the front desk about the stained pants and they agreed to pay for the cleaning. However, when we went to retrieve the pants they were sitting in a bag on the floor because the front desk forgot to give it to the dry cleaner. This happened the day we were leaving so the manager (thank God for Karen, probably the only professional acting person I met there) said we could mail in the cleaning receipt to get reimbursed.; The cleaning person took my personal soap from the bathroom. I don't know how you can mistake a large bar of soap for the dinky bars they give you. One day we forgot to request room service so we asked for some sheets and towels. The front desk told us they could not access the sheets but could send up towels. How can a hotel not be able to access its own sheets?! So we called back a few hours later and lo and behold they brought up sheets. On the whole I found the front desk staff to be unprofessional and downright rude at times. If we approached the desk and they were already helping someone else they would not even look at us to say, \"i'll be with you shortly.\" In fact they avoided all eye contact and acted as though we were not there. Also, when we entered the hotel after being out all day the front desk staff would barely acknowledge us. They were too busy joking and talking with one another. Overall, the hotel was fine since we did not spend too much time there. There is just too much to see and do in New Orleans.

All things considered, this hotel can not be beat. The price is very reasonable, it is amazing to me how inexpensive this place is compared to how nice it is. It is architecturally interesting -- the hotel is made up of 5 renovated buildings and features very tall ceilings, exposed bricks and beams. The rooms are very large (we opted for an upgrade to a suite for $20 more a night). The beds were very comfortable and everything was very clean. It was clear that the employees care about their hotel. At the hotel desk, they keep a constant supply of freshly baked cookies and they are wonderful. The continental breakfast in the morning is certainly above average and features freshly made waffles. The hotel also has a small shop where you can purchase convience items at normal prices (e.g. a package of tylenol for 75 cents and a water for $1). This is a nice convenience to have. The bar was small, but more than adequate. It also featured good happy hour specials. Same could be said for the pool, small but nice and more than adequate. The hotel is located about a 5-10 minute walk to all of the areas of the French District you would want, including Bourbon St, Cafe DuMonde, the Central Grocery, the river front. It is also around the corner from Mother's Restaurant (which is a must). In the opposite direction is Emmeril's resaurant NOLA. The area in and around the hotel is very safe and I never once questioned my safety. Actually, I was very pleasantly surprised how nice everything was in and around the hotel. Certainly very few traces of Hurricane Katrina here. (However, I do suggest a Katrina tour to see how much other parts of the city still need significant amounts of recovery).

Lobby is well lit and extends to the sky lights in the ceiling, 5 floors up. Staff was very accommodating. Helped us find a a 24 hour pharmacy to get some prescription medication for one of my kids. New Orleans is still getting back on its feet and there are not many 24 hour pharmacies available. Had to take a taxi to this one at 6 AM. No problems calling for taxis at hotel--we did not rent a car. Happy to not have a car, most places can be reached by foot and the street cars on Canal street are only about a block away. Parking available at hotel for a fee. As we were there around time of Sugar Bowl and BCS bowl, traffic flow was restricted in the French Quarter. Suite room had two TV, wall safe, small frig, microwave and two queen beds and a full sized pull out sofa bed. Slept our family of 5 very comfortably. Internet is free, requires a cable in room, but wireless available in lobby. They also have a computer with printer available to print boarding passes--nice touch. Small pool and bar also available, but did not use either one. Breakfast was OK--hard boiled eggs, frozen patty sausage, pastries, bagels, toast, cereal and beverages. Sugar cookies all the time at front desk and a copy of USA today available in the morning. Fortunately, the rest of our meals were outside. We had coffee and beignets at Cafe du Monde, muffulotta sandwiches at Central Grocery and two very good dinners at Bayona and Isabelle's. Ate way too many praline candies. Still trying to work off the calories. Had a good time in New Orleans--wandered around the French Quarter, listened to jazz at Preservation Hall and shopped for gifts on Royal street. Took a tour with Tours by Isabelle--specialized in small tours--ours was 10 people and we went to see two plantations and the Cajun swamp country. This was a great tour with very good guides and I would highly recommend it to see what else there is outside of New Orleans. Saw areas still waiting to be rebuilt post Katrina.

The smaller size of the hotel was more desireable than the tall high rise. Although the C.I.& S had good elevators, we opted to use the stairs more often because it was not too much effort for just one floor or two floors. We did not use the small pool or the fitness facility which looked clean and well-maintained. One of the best restaurants for Louisiana cooking, the historic Bon Ton Cafe, is just a half block from the hotel. A well-established Cuban restaurant with a good reputation is next door to the hotel. There are many fine restaurants and stores and malls within easy walking distance.

It is an older property with very unique architecture including exposed beams and brick. Check-in/Other Painless and easy. All requests that had been made prior were accommodated. Free cookies at all times was a hit! The lobby area was light and airy with wooden beams (and really the whole ceiling exposed). There were a few tables available for those who wanted to conduct business and plenty of chairs. There is one computer in the lobby that has a printer attached, but someone was always on it. It was bitterly cold in the lobby and interior of the hotel, they need to tone it down a bit. Courtyard was pretty, but there was a lot of algae/moss on the walls that just made it seem unclean. They should probably power wash it a bit. The valet is about $24/day, but we paid it on the company dime. If you are on your own, might want to find a garage. There is a small fitness center that had two treadmills, a bike and I think an elliptical, which lead out to the outdoor spa. There is also a small outdoor pool that appeared to be heated. Breakfast was in a room near the lobby, had mostly continental fare (muffins, Danish, cereal, juice), but also waffles. My colleagues said that coffee was the pits. Rooms Had a room facing the courtyard and was not real impressed, especially for the money we paid. However, you want to face the courtyard, as my colleagues were on the 1st floor street level and said it was noisy. The view was to a building that had not been restored and had a lot of kicked out windows, wooden panels over windows, etc. The very small room starts with a closet that had ample hangers and a clean iron and ironing board. The bathroom was normal sized with decent room for your toiletries. They only give you very basic shampoo, conditioner and soap, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to get the other items from downstairs or bring your own. Water pressure was not very firm. Bathroom was moderately clean. As you walk in the room the desk and chair are immediate with your wired internet access (which did not work until I called Tech Support and they manually logged me in, had to do this both nights, this happened to everyone in my party). The bed is about 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind the desk and chair and was decently comfortable. However, they only had feather pillows. When I called to get foam, they brought me a pillow that said it was cotton, but was obviously feather. I called again and was told they had no foam pillows. For the money we paid, was pretty angry about that. Think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to have to buy an inflatable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The TV is on an odd spot to the right of the bed on top of the dresser. Had adequate channels but poor reception a lot of the time. The bed sat in front of a white exposed brick wall that really needed some work. I think I even saw a piece of gum on the wall. Was supposed to be historic looking, but just looked like it has been painted so many times it was not a pretty site. The pictures they hung on the wall were pretty and provided a good cover-up. Room noise was so-so. I did hear a TV blaring somewhere, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure where it was coming from. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear a lot of walking around or anything like that and outside noise was nothing thanks to facing the courtyard. Location About a 15 minute walk to the heart of the French Quarter. Was only a 5 or so minute walk to the Casino. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a whole lot of food options in feet, there was a diner and a Cuban restaurant within a block and the Everything Shop, which did sell almost everything was about 2 blocks. Overall This is a good hotel if you only have one person in your party. The room was just really small by my standards that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been comfortable with anyone else in the room. If you plan on just using the room to sleep, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine. If you like to be able to relax in the room, I would suggest a suite style room or another hotel in general. Was just shocked that the Hampton Inn where I stayed last time, had rooms that were 2 to 3 times the size of this one. In reading other peoples reviews here, they all had suites. I had a regular room, that seems to be a big factor in why my stay wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as pleasant as theirs.

The street that the Hotel is on, Magazine Street, is a one way and when you cross Canal Street it's name changes to Decatur, the main drag running along the Mississippi.

I'd requested a quiet room and ours had no window to the outdoors, but we had a window over looking the hallway and open air lobby (well, almost open air, there's a glass skylight keeping the elements out) My only complaint was that the walls were a tad thin. We could hear (faintly) the people in the room next to us. Fortunately everyone was well behaved so noise was not an issue, but if you were unfortunate enough to get partyers as your neighbours, it might be. The buffet breakfast was very satisfying and included a do-it-yourself waffle station.
