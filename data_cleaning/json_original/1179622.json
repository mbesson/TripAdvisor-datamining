None of the problems we had were so egregious as to ruin our trip, but we ended up being pretty annoyed several times. Being nice and speaking spanish didn't seem to help with anything. On to the negatives. 1) When we arrived, they didn't have our reservation. Never happened to me with Expedia before, and from the reviews here it seems to be a common problem at this hotel. Makes me think it's their mistake. 2) When they found us a room, they told us it would be ready at 3pm (check-in time). We went for lunch and when we got back at 3:30, we had to wait until almost 4:30 for the room to finally be ready. 3) On our second morning, we had a tour booked that left at 7:30am. It was a full-day tour, so we asked to have our water bottles for the day that come with the room. Apparently we were not allowed to have the water bottles until 9am, so we had to go buy those on our own. For some reason, they are very stingy with the water. And we weren't even asking for anything extra. 4) The wifi was weak for most of the trip, but for the last two full days, it did not work at all. We told the woman at the front desk who said she couldn't reset the modem because she didn't know where it was. I guess nobody knew, since it didn't get fixed. 5) The beds were hard as rocks. 6) We had to get our keys reset about 4 times during our stay. 7) On checking out, the woman at the desk tried to charge us for 2 breakfasts. When we had checked in, the guy at the desk said, \"Your breakfast is included. Here are your wristbands.\" And he put the wristbands on us. Only one of us had breakfast, just once, the entire stay. The breakfast was so-so, and we decided we'd get it elsewhere, so we took the wristbands off. The woman who was helping us check out actually did not believe that we had been given wristbands. She said things like, \"Well, where are your wristbands now? Why would you take them off? If you took them off, where did you put them?\" In the trash. We didn't know we would need to present them as evidence in the breakfast hearing. This was the last annoyance, and I'll admit, I stopped being nice. Luckily, they didn't take any of my credit card information on check in, so after refusing to pay extra for breakfast and telling her we were about to miss our bus, she coldly said, \"Fine. Go.\" I won't stay there again. I certainly don't expect to be treated like royalty at a hotel like this, but a little courteousness could have gone a long way.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cToo many problems...\u201d", "Author": "Harry M", "ReviewID": "UR126201181", "Content": "The hotel itself makes a nice impression, an attractive building, clean and well-kept. However, it is poorly managed, and there were problems. The rooms were spacious and nicely furnished, but our floor was quite dirty, and was never cleaned during our five-day stay. The water pressure was very poor. At one point the shower and faucet stopped working all together. After arguing for some time with the woman at the front desk, we were told it would be fixed in about 15 minutes. It was more like an hour and a half before it worked again, but the pressure remained very low our entire stay. At one point the heavy glass shower door fell off. This could have been catastrophic, but my daughter happened to be there to prevent it from crashing to the floor. Fortunately she wasn't hurt. Our phone didn't work. As others have said, if you are at the front of the hotel, it is quite loud at night well into the wee hours, so be prepared. We had a white noise machine which helped quite a bit. On the plus side, the building is very attractive, and within walking distance of everything. The pool is very nice.

The room was clean and comfortable. The air-conditioning was effective and there was plenty of closet and storage space. We had a corner room on the 3rd floor, with balconies looking out on both sides. We were able to get extra towels when we needed them from the maid, and our room always had 2 bottles of fresh water. I was wary at first because I had seen reports of the hotel being noisy, but it wasn't that bad in my opinion. You are in the middle of a downtown area with an active nightlife, so you have to expect hearing some noise from the street outside. Pack some earplugs and you should be fine. The pool was beautiful, and comfortable for lounging and resting. The biggest selling point for this hotel is the location. You are 2 blocks from the beach, a block away from Av. 5, and a short walk from Wal-Mart if you want to stock up on snacks or cervezas. We never had to take a taxi the entire time we were in Playa, which was nice. The only complaints would be a lack of water pressure in the shower at times (only happened on our last day), and our safe did not work. We don't generally travel with valuables, but locking luggage can come in handy. Service was sometimes slow from the front desk and the restaurant. It is important to remember that you are in Mexico and to set your expectations accordingly. A friendly attitude and a little Spanish can go a long way, most people are very happy to help, but things do not happen at a pace that most Americans are accustomed to.

NO hot water, not really even warm, a cool shower was the best you got. Water pressure was weak, it came out of spray head in shower about 6 inches. One day there was no water pressure at all. The cable tv quit working for one day. Upon our arrival to check in we were told we did not have a room. They had us walk to their sister hotel on 4th.

Before our trip, I contacted the manager to book a two extra nights there. He said it was no problem and we could pay the balance when we checked in. At check in, (we arrived at 5:00pm on a Wednesday) we were told our room was NOT ready and would have to wait. I also asked about paying for our two extra nights and she said needed to pull it up on the computer and would call us once it was straightened out. 2 days went by and we never received a call, so Saturday we went back to the front desk and there was someone different working there (Pedro). I explained to him that we had booked 2 extra nights and needed to pay. Pedro was not able to pull up the reservations in the computer and said he needed to call the management office, which would not be open for another hour (This was around noon on Saturday) and were told to come back. We went out to eat and stopped back to check. Pedro told us he was able to get a hold of his manager and that everything was taken care of and our two extra nights were booked, but there was no vacancies for that night. I said that is fine...we are already booked here thru Sunday through Living Social and just needed Sunday night and Monday Night added and paid for. Pedro told me we could pay at check out on Tuesday morning. All was fine until 6:00 Sunday night. We came back from the beach to find the Maid service was only just then cleaning the room. We had to wait 40 minutes for her to finish before we could shower. While showering, the phone rang--it was Pedro asking us why we were still there and if we were staying, we needed to pay right away. We went down to the front desk and told him we talked to him yesterday and he said everything was booked. He told us he didn't remember. I repeated, we came down and talked to you yesterday afternoon. You called the manager and said we were fine and could pay the difference at check out. Again, conveniently, he didn't remember. He said if we wanted to stay we would need to change rooms. He showed me the computer and no one was booked in our room after us until Tuesday Night. I said, if no one is here until Tuesday, the day we are leaving first thing in the morning, why do we need to change rooms? After arguing with him for about 10 minutes, we were able to keep our room. When we asked how much we owed. First he tried to charge us for the entire time we were there, even though we had already paid. Finally, he figured $95 USD for the two nights. My boyfriend pulled out his card to pay and then Pedro said, \"oh no, that will be an extra $40. I'm sorry.\" So we paid $135 USD and thought all was taken care of, until... Check out Tuesday morning. We had purchased bus tickets for 11:35. We were told check out was noon. We spent the morning walking around and went back to the room around 10:30 am and our keys did not work. We had to go to the front desk and get them reactivated and asked why. Pedro told us that we were checking out today and the keys were shut off. We asked why, if check out was at noon, would our keys not work at 10:30am? No answer. We went back to the room, packed up and went down to drop the keys off. When we checked out, Pedro told us he made a mistake and it would be an extra $80 USD for the room. Conveniently again, the managers office was not open and because we had to catch our bus to the airport, we handed over the debit card. He handed it back with a charge of $160 USD. I said to him, \"You just told us $80 more... why are you double charging?\" He said, \"Oh, I meant $80 more per night.\" So all together we were charged $295 for only two nights. Now, I can't even get on the website to email or get a phone number of someone to speak to about this. We should have been told the amount we owed from the very beginning and not been given the run around by the employees. There were numerous other hotels around that would have been much cheaper for us to stay in. Next time, we will avoid this place and stay elsewhere. Like I said, if we would have been told an amount from the beginning and not had to fight almost every day of our trip about whether or not we had a room, this would have been a great experience. We've already complained to Living Social about it, so hopefully, they too, will take their business elsewhere.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "mctdenver", "ReviewID": "UR124234819", "Content": "Only stayed one night at this hotel, but it was a very pleasant experience.

After seeing the room, and repeated calls to Expedia (which were consistently dropped, btw), my husband was able to convince Expedia to convince the hotel to find a room. We retrieved our bags and checked in. We were blown away by how nice the Hacienda Real was in comparison. The happiness ended there. First, our shower smelled of sewage. Second, the housekeeping (although pleasant) was inconsistent. Most nights the room was cleaned when we were at dinner. We had to ask for, then later just take, towels. We also retrieved our own tissue and toilet paper when needed. Third, the restaurant staff was unhelpful. We paid for the American Breakfast upgrade.

The staff was accomodating and helpful and the cleaning was first class most of the time. When we checked in, our booking at Hotels.com did not seem to be recognized by the receptionist. She needed a print-out of out reservation (which was in Danish!) and when she checked us in, she missed the fact that breakfast was included. This mistake, however, was cleared out before the breakfast the first morning. After that, we had no further problems with the reservation. The first room they gave us was on the first floor. It only had a single window facing the passageway and smelled really bad of mold - probably due to the lack of ventilation and light from the outside. This was really a pity (we actually asked for a room with a balcony in one of the upper storeys when reserving through Hotels.com). Fortunately the receptionist agreed to give us a new room that met our expectations - on the second floor with a balcony facing Avenida 10. The room, the beds (two queen-size beds), the bathroom etc. were comfortable and in good condition. The location was great with 5 minutes walk to the beach and with a view from the balcony over Avenida 10. Not surprisingly, the air on the balcony was thick with exhaust and cooking fumes from the busy avenue, and the noise from the bars and the huge discoteque \"Coco Bongo\" could keep most people awake every night - prepared as we were, we brought earplugs and slowly got used to it. Without notice, the function rooms on the hotel's roof were used for a \"special event\" one Friday night - seemingly a really fun private party with a live salsa band, which probably kept a lot of hotel guests awake until 3 am. Our room was just below the function rooms, so we could not only hear the live music but also the high heels on the floor. Breakfast was served in the affiliated restaurant. We had ordered (and pre-paid) a \"complete American breakfast\" all mornings, which turned out to consist of toast with butter and jam, orange juice, coffee and an optional hot meal (hot cakes, scrambled eggs with bacon, Mexican scrambled eggs or \"rancheros\"). The breakfast was tasty and the service was generally good. Despite the complications upon arrival we were pleased with the stay and we had two really good weeks in Playa del Carmen. If you are sensitive to noise, however, we would recommend choosing a hotel with a less central location.

The hotel's design is architecturally flawed, there is a courtyard in the middle with a pool, surrounded by hotel rooms on all four sides, three floors high. Any sound is amplified when it echoes off the four walls. We asked for the quietest room because based on previous reviews we did not want a room looking out to the street. We were placed in an inner room on the first floor. Although there are posted pool hours, they are not enforced. Kids splash and jump into the pool until about 12am and then the drunks come from the clubs and socialize there until 4 am. Then, night employees of the hotel hang out in the laundry area, which is right next to the guest rooms on the first floor and talk until about 6am. From 6-10am is when you should expect to sleep. After complaining to the management, nothing was done. In addition to the noise, the doors do not fit properly into the door way and there are cracks about half an inch wide in some spots, this obviously adds to the loudness at night. The towels are in bad shape, the beds and pillows are hard as bricks. The bedsheets had old blood stains on them in one of the beds, they clearly do not throw out old linens and they smelled like they do not bleach them. This hotel is pretty at first sight, but the craftsmanship is poor. Also, the floor in the bathroom of our room was always hot because a sewer ran under it and the open run-off drain stank like sewage.

I like that style! We dined lunch at the pool and enjoyed, very much, the food and service. Meals: the continental breakfast included is coffee, OJ and toast. Some mornings we would have a full breakfast on site and, again, service is exemplary. Front desk service is accommodating, cleanliness of the rooms above average. Beds are the usual hard beds but linens are very high quality. There is an assortment of pillows available, as well. Bathrooms include shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion, hair dryer, magnifier mirror. There is an in room safe, iron and ironing board. On another note, the rooftop would be a lovely spot for a destination wedding or celebration. There is an enclosed solarium, which looked quite large, and has a wonderful sea view. The high season price is a bit high, but considering the location and hotel amenities Hacienda Real del Caribe is a good value, especially for families or friends sharing a suite.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, good value\u201d", "Author": "reginaldleeadams", "ReviewID": "UR23087966", "Content": "We lucked into the Hotel R d Caribe after a night at another spot that didn't work out for us. My girlfriend just walked in and they had rooms available for us at a good rate. The hotel has a nice pool, and seems brand new. It is \"international style,\" ie, big rooms, lots of faux marble, not a lot of Yucatcan cultural touches. The room was very comfortable and very clean, and the bathroom was huge. We found the desk to be very helpful and personable, and the free loaner towels saved us money when we went to the beach clubs. The hotel is just a block off of 5th Av, and we liked the fact that it was a bit quieter, while still being very close to the action and to a number of good restaurants. If you want a quieter room, be sure to ask for one not on 10th Av, but instead on the inner courtyard. The free breakfast was pretty skimpy, but there are lots of good bfast places nearby, so we just used it as a way to get some toast and a first cup of coffee before heading out to the beach. Our only issue was on our last day there, when we had them hold our passports for safe keeping, and when we arrived at the agreed upon hour in the afternoon, the manager wasn't around, and they couldn't enter the room with the safe. They ended up taking apart a window and getting in that way, but we spent a nervous 45 min worrying we'd miss our flight back to Mexico City.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Hacienda Real del Caribe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1179622-Reviews-Hotel_Hacienda_Real_del_Caribe-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$64 - $480*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av. 10 Calle 10 Norte</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
