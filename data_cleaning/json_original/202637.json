Everything was perfect, from our arrival, to the accommodations, to the location, to the breakfast buffet, to our departure. The hotel is half a block from the S-bahn, next to a park and playground and shopping is within two blocks. The area is safe and easy to get to, just 15 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from downtown Frankfurt.The hotel staff were professional and very accommodating. They kept our luggage while we traveled to other parts of Germany and received parcels, which we were able to easily retrieve when we arrived. The breakfast buffet was first class.

Location is somewhat city environment. Relatively easy to find by car because detailed MapQuest map was accurate and traffic volume was low at the time. Easy to park at registration area in front of taxi stand. Underground parking garage easy to access (many auto doors and room key for security), but 16 \u9227?and tight spaces. Location and exterior were not as impressive as web pictures. Interior was as nice as web pictures. Fourth floor room was ample and excellent, especially by German standards. It was quiet, appeared to be newly refurbished. Bed was very comfortable with quality linens. Bathroom was small, but quality. Front desk was extremely friendly, and helpful with information and directions. Had to leave before we could enjoy the provided breakfast, but staff volunteered to provided a box breakfast for us to take. It was very tasty and plentiful, although we had to finish the liquids before going through airport security. Local area in one direction takes you to the Elbe River for comfortable walking on paths along the river. In the opposite direction, you can walk to numerous shops, restaurants, and fast food. Easy drive to airport took about 20 minutes or so, and could gas up just before entering autobahn.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR484960285", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Marylanderkj"}, {"Content": "Excellent service and nice location Great breakfast spread!

Its located south of the river and about 10 minutes from Frankfurt city center. Close by there is a shopping area with many restuarants. A five minute drive will take you in to the Sachenhausen(hope I got spelling correct) area where the night life is very good. The rooms are very modern and well maintained, however the winner was Juillard's bar. Very nice atmosphere to relax, and the bartender --- NINA is great. She will entertain with her skills in making cocktails. Be careful because if you drink her special shots, you will get very drunk!! Nina and other hotel staff were very friendly offerring advice on places of interest etc. --- Nina even made dinner arrangements for us at Bombay Gate one night. Just outside Juillards is a nice park where you can dine outside to take in the ambience of the park.This is a nice quiet hotel away from the hustle of the city center.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR219197415", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Trinivaltraveler"}, {"Content": "Excellent conference facilities.
