The location is excellent. We could see the spires of Notre Dame from our room, and hear the bells. Unbelievable! The room was large enough to fit a cot in addition to the large bed, and the bathroom was fine. The skylight opens, so you get some nice fresh air. It's a bit worn but very comfortable, and the staff is pleasant and helpful, with good English. Finding your way to the proper wing is kind of an adventure--the building is very interesting, but a bit of a maze. The elevator wasn't working well when we were there, so we had to make a long climb a couple of times. As long as you're not elderly or handicapped, that should not discourage you--Paris involves a lot of walking. It's such a cool place, with the beautiful courtyard garden and the open walkways.

Turned out to be an excellent choice. The location is unbelievable - you walk out the front door, turn left and you look straight at Notre Dame cathedral. A short walk to the Seine where you can catch a Batobus to take you to the main attractions of Paris. There are also a couple of free walking tours that leave from outside the Notre Dame. Loads of restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops within a close walking distance. The entrance to the hotel is totally separate to the main entrance to the hospital and the courtyard on the ground level is like an oasis in the centre of the city. There are about 20 steep steps which take you to where the lift is that takes you to the 6th floor, where the hotel accommdation is. We saw nurses and doctors on their 'smoko' breaks and some hospital equipment but at no time on our 5 day stay did we see any patients. The hotel staff speak English and are just lovely. They always have a welcome smile when you walk passed and go out of their way to assist should you need it eg we wanted to organise a shuttle bus to take us to the train station and that was organised for us quickly and efficiently. The rooms are large (for Paris) and very clean. Not flash by any means but very comfortable - large comfortable bed, wardrobe and a big bathroom with shower and bath. The highlight though is the skylight (which is adjusted by remote control). It was a magic moment for us to lie in bed at the end of a long day and listen to the bells of Notre Dame (don't worry, they don't chime all night - the last one is 1am and begins again at 8am). And in the morning you can gaze out of the skylight at the skies of Paris - a great way to wake up. I would definitely stay here again should I return to this beautiful city.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Augustine, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe only place I'd stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Nole78", "ReviewID": "UR122591213", "Content": "I have been twice to Paris .

The hotel is actually a small wing of an operating hospital. So that means there will be people wandering the premises who are there for medical treatment. The rooms are small, but fully functional. This is a clean hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. They make an excellent coffee and croissant for breakfast. The big issue I have with this hotel was the AC. We arrived in Paris during an odd warm front in early October. And unfortunately, the AC in our room did not operate. The only window was a sky light. Consequently, we were not too comfortable. If the AC had worked, I would definitely give it a 4 star rating. I did find the location made it easy for my early morning swim at one of the many nearby indoor pool that Paris is famous for. And I was able to go to the Notre Dame before any of the tour buses arrived. And they arrive early, so you must get out at the crack of dawn.

We arrived at the smaller Orly airport from Venice and the hotel had offered to arrange for transportation for us but we decided to take care of it ourselves and it was pretty straightforward. We got onto a shuttle bus at the airport that transported us to a RER station and we caught the RER to the Notre Dame stop and you are pretty much there.

The location gives you easy access to both banks and most everything is within walking distance. The hospital garden is beautiful. Unfortunately, one of the nights of our visit was during Nuit Blanche (an all night arts festival) and the noise coming from below all night long was horrific. This was not the fault of the Hotel Hospitel, of course, but if you are visiting during any kind of a noisy event, you may wish to be on the non-Notre Dame side.

An unmatched location, clean rooms and friendly staff make it very good value for money. We stayed for 2 nights in room 12 in May 2009 for 129 euros/night (remember this is Paris). There are 14 rooms in the attic on the 6th floor of block B1 of the hospital. The even numbered rooms are on the right as you walk down the single corridor from reception - the even numbered rooms \"look\" out onto Notre Dame (so odd numbered rooms are probably a little quieter). The room compares favourably with 3 star hotels in Paris we've stayed in before. The room is a reasonable size (small compared to rooms elsewhere in the world, but good for Paris in this price bracket). There are single and double rooms, and camp beds are available to allow you to sleep 3 to a room. The staff are friendly and speak English - most guests are from English speaking countries rather than from France itself. The \"hospitel\" (HOSPIT-al/hot-EL) is a private enterprise - it is not directly related to the hospital. It was one of five such hotel businesses in hospitals but the other 4 have closed. The owner lives out of Paris, but the employees have been there for some time. Relatives of in patients also stay there. We enjoyed staying in a hospital. If you don't like hospitals, stay elsewhere. It's a busy working hospital with 349 beds (224 acute/emergency beds). Block B1 (where the hotel is located) contains a day cardiology unit and a gynaecology ward (including cancer patients) and an emergency department. Unlike many French hospitals, this is still based in lovely old buildings - as one reviewer put it, the ground floor feels a little like a monastery. For medically minded visitors, the hospital has an illustrious history - it was home to Dupuytren, Duchenne and Claude Bernard amongst others. Some reviewers had problems with too much light coming on through the skylight. In our room, the skylight had shutters operated from the same panel as the one which opens/closes the skylight itself. As such, day light wasn't an issue for us as it has been for some other reviewers. As previously described, the bathrooms have a shower but no shower curtain. Fresh towels and basic toileteries are available - 2 plastic cups (wrapped) are left out each day. So, this is not unbridled luxury but a functional hotel. Wireless access is available (at 4 euros/day or 8 euros/3 days or 10 euros/week or 20 euros/for over 7 days) for those of you bringing your own laptop. Note that the safe is too small for a 15.4\" screen laptop. The air conditioning worked fine. Coffee and tea and cold drinks are available at reception until 10pm (you pay extra for these). The reception to the hotel is open until 10pm, after which you pick your key up from the reception to the hospital. There are a few guidebooks and a daily paper are available in reception. There is a Relais cafe in the basement (sous sol). We didn't eat there as there are so many places to eat within a few minutes' walk from the front door of the hospital. There's a lovely balcony like area on the 4th floor. I know other have described the location before - but it really is outstanding. Notre Dame Cathedral is the topographical centre of Paris, The square outside the front of Notre Dame is lined by the Cathedral on one side and lined on one of the other sides by the Hotel Dieu. Exit 5 from the RER metro (line B) from Charles de Gaulle airport is about 20 metres from the entrance to the hospital - go out of the front of the hospital and turn right. A great location.

It was a very good value for our money and we would return if we ever get the chance.

The positive points: Excellent location - literally in the shadow of Notre Dame Next to an RER station - easy access to CDG Very helpful and friendly staff - they were outstanding Quiet, very quiet rooms Very clean The negative points: Is it really a 3-star hotel? I would think it is a good 2-star. It is weird staying in a hospital Although the location is excellent, the area lacks a \"neighborhood\" feeling The only windows were skylights Conclusion: I really enjoyed staying here - I really did. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable and quiet place, this is it.

We took the train from Charles de Gaulle airport and had a bit of trouble with our huge luggage. Why would they put an escalator to exit the metro and then 2 flights of stairs afterwards? Cruel. Nothing to do with the hotel though. Word of advice. The entrance is right on the square with Notre Dame. Some tired travellers missed it and walked completely around the block (and a large block it is) before finding the entrance. The emergency department reception is there and you have no choice but to go to the right. After that take a left and you'll enter a lovely courtyard. There are several stairs up and a few stairs down. If you're tired and have heavy bags take the stairs down, go right and then left, past the cafe and the B lift is on the right. Take the elevator to the 6th floor and the hotel is right there next to Cardiology! Sounds confusing but really not bad once you've done it once. The rooms themselves are fine by Paris standards and definitely for the location. The only disappointment was no shower curtain which makes showering without washing down the bathroom a bit tricky. I have come across this elsewhere in Europe though. Lovely bilingual staff were very friendly and helpful. Windows in the roof allow you to see the stars from your bed on a clear night. It's a bit strange to walk past doctors in the corridor on your way in and out. I didn't see any patients on trolleys though. They must be in a different wing. Definitely a great experience. Cross the river to the Latin Quarter for a plethora of restaurants ideal for tourist but still providing excellent food. And don't miss a Nutella crepe.

The hotel is literally right next to the Notre Dame cathedral and is steps away from the metro. The hotel is on the top floor of a busy, public teaching hospital, built in 1877 which is pretty unusual, but we found it to be a very charming and a wonderful place to stay. We had a little trouble finding the hotel, but the main lobby of the hospital (who will point you in the direction of the hotel) is just across from the square in front of the Notre Dame. There is an elevator, which is helpful in getting to the 6th floor! At night, when the reception desk of the hospital is closed, we were given a key for the side door, or you can just walk through the ER! The double room was average size, clean and comfortable. We had a view (from our very high window) of the Notre Dame. The hotel is very safe and quiet (hey, you are in a hospital!) with the only real noise coming from the bells of Notre Dame (only during the day). It was such a charming and unusual place to stay. The staff was so helpful and recommended some great restaurants in Paris. We loved this hotel and would stay there again.
