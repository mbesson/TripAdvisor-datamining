Breakfast is so poor unlike other hotels in Sultanahmet which provides several types of ham, cheese, corn flakes, milk, coffee, tea. In this hotel, they only provide you with bread and jam, cucumber and tomato, tea and cofee! Even when my mom asked for water, they say you have to buy it with additional cost! But when a Turkish guest is asking, they give it for free. And they will watch you out if you're not moving from the breakfast place bcoz they think you're gonna eat more. What's the matter with them? There is a tram station downstairs so dont expect a quiet sleep coz it stops around 10pm and starts maybe around 7am. The elevator is the old-kind one so insecure.

Dust and flakes were all over my bed and bed side table. The curtains did not close as well and there were pistacho's on the floor from a former guest I suppose. Just a cheap place not worth one star. The Breakfast is poor compared to other places in the same price categories. All they offer for coffee is nescafe and the staff sat down next to me on a table having breakfast them selves.....so much for the guests. I ran from this hotel and looked for another place to stay in the same area, after they offered me as a single person a room with a double bed and a single bed on the street side, where noisy trams stop all day and night. I found a place 10 times better and for the same price nearby. This place pretends to be gay friendly as well, but I think they miss the boat what that is concerend. I did not feel welcome at all. It is cheapo place for people on a very low budget. The only nice thing is that the BF room, which is poorly appointed, has a view on the Agia Sofia, but it is not worth staying in this place for that.

The description of the hotel was excellent not only for its position, but for its facilities too (new elegant and spacious rooms, renovated and refurnished recently, supplied with air conditioning, etc.). At our arival the triple room was not available and the owner of the hotel told us they would give us a suite for the first night without applying any extra charge, ad then we should move to a standard triple room for the next two days. We agreed and he asked for the advanced payment of the ammount for the entire stay. After the payment we were informed that the room was not ready at the moment and that we should wait for two more hours until 1:30 pm. We had a walk and turned back to the hotel at 1:45 pm, but the room was still not ready. The person at the reception desk had changed - it was no more the owner, but a man that said he was the manager. He told us to wait for 30 more minutes and finally, at 2:15 pm he gave us the keys of the room..., but what a surprise!... It was not the suite the owner promised to us, and not even a standard triple room. It was a small, old and dirty double room, without air conditioning, where the distance between the beds was not more than 5cm and the third bed was a small camp-bed. Complete dakay in the bathroom, without a window and with no light: it was old and full of mold. The room was situated on the first floor and its only window was right above the tram station. Considered that the weather was very hot and the air conditioning didn'work, we should keep open the window and suffer the noise from the street all the night. We asked to change our room immediately, but the manager refused and he also refused to put us in contact with the owner. The only sollution he offered to us was an accomodation in another hotel nearby, which had a triple room available with air conditioning, but it was of a lower standard. He said he would arrange for the payment of the same amount to the other hotel (even thow, I'm not sure the price of the second hotel was the same, considered its lower standard). I will never turn back to that hotel and I also don't recommend it to anybody.

When no one was there to meet us, a kind man saw we were lost and arranged a transfer by shared mini bus for us. When we arrived in the Hotel, the location appeared excellent, as it was right opposite the Blue Mosque, with amazing views over the Bosphorus.

When we got in to the room there was a terrible smell of damp and mould, and we were horrified at the poor quality of the furnishings which looked like an Argos reject jumble sale! The beds were cheap divans resting on the floor, and there were tatty old blankets on them. The phone was not connected, just a loose wire hanging from the wall. The mini bar was full of rust and there was no safe deposit box in the room. The noise from the mosque was very intrusive as the windows did not block out the sound very much at all, and the air-conditioning unit barely functioned at all.

I had the top floor room, and its probably the noisest room I have ever had to stay in .. and I live in central London. The very loud belly dancing/guitar playing tends to start at 8ish at the restaurant directly above and goes on until late in the evening. The guy working for the hotel/restaurant drags people off the street and puts them in the lift (which stopped outside my room so that they could climb the few stairs upto the restaurant) so the noise from people passing was constant as well as the 'entertainment'. Then at day break you have the 3 very near mosques start with very loud morning prayer .. so not good if you fancy a lie in either. The whole place is shabby and unkept. The rooms were dirty and the linen old. And to be honest, I thought I had booked a gay hotel (as it was advertised).

I am backpacker myself, who stayed in a lot of tricky places and my requirement are really not high. I have not seen such a bad rip-off somewhere else in the world. First our reservation could not be found by the hotel. For some strange reasons, they did not have any rooms left and they wanted to put us in the basement of the house. The room the staff led us to, was a pure underground basement (raw grey walls, obviously not cleaned floors, old stuff standing around, small barred windows at 3m height, without any glass or light, but you could hear the traffic and the pedestrians and see pedestrians' feet, who were waiting at the railway station right in front of the house). The room was not turned into any kind of hotel room at all. They really had just put two camp beds inside (I am not kidding). As nobody of the staff spoke English I first thought they wanted me to store my backpack in this room until my \"real\" room would be ready. It took me a while that they seriously wanted me to stay in this dirty basement as a room :-) By the way, the wanted me to pay 70 EUR per night for this \"double room\". After some fight with the receptionist, I was able to get my money back and we took off and looked for another place to stay. Stay away from this place.

The website was pure fiction. 'Boutique hotel'? Ah, no. Honestly, against the international hotel ranking system, a 1 and 1/2 star rating would be generous. In the middle of summer, the room was not only not airconditionecontained, but only contained a small pedestal fan that had to share the one electrical socket in the room with all the other cheap and broken electrical appliances. A bathroom on a scale of dirtyness you wouldn't believe. Hot water not working. Towels falling apart from age, but I think they actually had been washed (wow!). This is a hotel blatantly ripping off tourists, requiring upfront payment on checking in and, thus, locking you in for an experience you won't forget.

Overlooking the tram line in Sultanahmet, you are walking distance from the Covered Markets, the Hippodrome, Topkapi Palace, the Cistern, the Blue Mosque and Aya Sophia. Then it's just a short tram ride to anywhere else you want to go - the Egyptian Markets, across the Bosphorus to the Galatea Tower, Istiklal Caddesi etc etc... The view from the rooftop breakfast room is also pretty gorgeous. We had a room on the third floor overlooking the tram line. If you like watching the comings and goings of the locals, you'd love this spot. Since we were there in Ramadan, our window overlooked the concert and night markets taking place just opposite the hotel. What an introduction to Istanbul! However, if you're not fond of music and madness, this won't be the spot for you, as the music shop downstairs plays music til all hours. Closing the window helps with the noise, but then the room gets very stuffy, even in September. The beds aren't terribly comfortable, and ours had a bottom sheet but no top sheet until we asked specifically for them. There was only one blanket, but that was sufficient at the time we were there. The bathroom was average - a little cramped, but OK.

The rooms are not tiptop, neither the building, not the whole staff speaks English and in general: there's a little funny feeling in the hotel. But I wouldn't go elsewhere next time and right because of this funny feeling. I give you the reasons: the location couldn't be better and it is something really important once in Istanbul, even if you trip around the Asian side. The staff has its own style and don't expect anything from a Western European standard 3star: no hostesses, no concierge and no big fuzz around you and your tourist status, but you are well served and you get a close impact what Turkish people really are. I prefer to spend most of the time in Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y on the Asian side and wouldn't really have meals in Sultanahmet, but the breakfast at the hotel's roof terrace is the place and style to start the day with olives, goat cheese and pickles. Summing up all: it is really Turkish, a bit Asian too and it's really worths to stay.
