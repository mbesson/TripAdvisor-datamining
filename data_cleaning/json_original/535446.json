{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice and cozy hotel I cannot argue at all with the previous writers. AM campus is a nice hotel offering comfortable rooms at a great price. High ceilings make the rooms bigger than they really are simply decorated but very nice. The breakfast is nice enough fruits and yogurts and a hot meal as well. The location is a bit far from the center but the train station is a short walk away. The sch\u679anefeld airport is nearby too. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Also, helpful staff giving any info yiu need about about Berlin", "Date": "Dec 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR243728214", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "finnmann"}, {"Content": "Am Campus       Excellent Reception", "Date": "Nov 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR740483976", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bhchua"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel near Shonefeld airport Having booked a 4* hotel in the central Tiergarten area of Berlin we were disappointed to receive an email a couple of days before departing saying that it was not available and that we could stay at the 3* Am Camps instead. We expected to be disappointed but in fact it could not have worked out better. It is a training hotel for the catering college students but we had excellent service throughout from the English speaking students and staff and the hotel itself is spotlessly clean and sparkling. We were allocated a disabled room (not by need, but about 10% of their rooms are disabled friendly) and it was huge with excellent facilities. The breakfast buffet was delicious too.The location is very handy for Shonefeld airport. We took the S-bahn to Aldershof and it was only a few minutes walk from there - in fact you can see the hotel's lit up name as soon as you turn left out of the station (behind the huge red Kaufhof shopping centre lights) . However, the bus no. 62 would have been even better as we got on right outside the hotel to go back to the airport. During our stay we bought daily bus/train tickets and used the S-bahn to get into the centre of Berlin (about 30 minutes) and buses around the city. Overall the location was OK for us but some people might want somewhere more central or lively. We arrived about 10pm, the restaurant was closed and the receptionist said the only bar possibly open was at the Ibis across the road, otherwise the area was deserted. The next morning the shopping centre and various cafes were open and it was much more lively. We just made sure to eat before we left the city centre.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR206424596", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "plamingos"}, {"Content": "An Excellent Hotel I stayed in this hotel in Aug 2006. I found the hotel very convenient for visiting the city. Near to the U-Bahn station at Adlershof. It was also very easy to get into the city on the public transport system. Easy to get to the airport ot Schonefeld too (only 3 stops away).It is a brand new hotel that opened on 22.07.06. All the room facilities worked, and it was very clean, quiet and comfortable.Breakfast was excellent. Great for people who want healthier options but you can also have a fry up, if you wish!All in all I think this is a great hotel and will stay there again on my future visits to Berlin.", "Date": "Sep 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR333254241", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "stwironbridge"}, {"Content": "Great hotel When we found this hotel we read the description and saw that it is a training hotel for students that are going into the hotelier trade. This made us a bit suspious but we went anyway.The hotel is located in the outskirts of the former east berlin on S-bahn line S9 Adlershof stop and it is about 30 minutes by S-bahn to Friedrichstrasse. The room was very much business traveller style, the food and service was exemplary. It cost us \u62e2185 for two of us to stay five nights so I would throughly recommend the hotel.If you do stay here make sure you go to the following.Cocktail bar on Dorpfeldstrasse - fantastic mojitos, caprinhino's and long island iced teas - we both got legless for 30 euros total.Communist freedon fighter memorial on DorpfeldstrasseSuzes cafe on adlergestell - good German food very well priced.Stuart", "Date": "Sep 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR147351284", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fidbod"}, {"Content": "IB Hotel Am Campus, Adlershof, Berlin", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR796235765", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kate_thirkell"}, {"Content": "ottima scelta       letti e finestroni", "Date": "Jan 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392697303", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "gabriele-ilaria"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d535446-r6316602-Hotel_Am_Campus-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "535446", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
