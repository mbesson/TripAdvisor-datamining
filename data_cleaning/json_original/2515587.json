Nice hotel with clean rooms and a fairly good value for what you get. The only negative is it is off strip.

My wife and I arrived after 6 PM on a Saturday night and walked right up to the front desk and checked in without delay. Oh, I do recommend parking in the North parking lot (no parking garage) because it is the closest to the registration desk. We arrived at our room on the 11th floor and found the only thing between the elevator and our room was the vending and ice machines. This was funny since I had specifically requested a room away from the elevator and vending machines when I made my online reservation. I'm assuming they either read the request wrong or I left out a word when I wrote it. We figured we weren't going to be in the room too much so we stayed. It was a very big room with a king bed, a small refrigerator, and the bathroom had a large soaking tub. There was no coffee maker, which is a Las Vegas tradition. We ate at the cafe, SNAPS. We had a very nice meal there previously but this time my wife's prime rib was very dry. My hamburger was fine and the service was very good. We had breakfast there in the morning and both of our meals were fantastic. After dinner we spent the rest of the night in Marilyn's Lounge listening to the band, The Fab, we came to hear. Marilyn's is a nice smoke free oasis in the middle of a casino filled with cigarette smokers. The place is no more smoky than any other casino. We had a very good time at Marilyn's. The only issue I had was there were signs (even a billboard up the road) that declared \"Bottles of Heineken $2 at all casino bars\". I didn't think Marilyn's was considered a casino bar until I saw three signs on their bar with this same advertisement. I ordered a Heineken and spent $3.50. Anyway, seemed like a little false advertising to me. Marilyn's is NOT a casino bar. To make a long story short we got back to our room very late and it was a very quiet night even being that close to the elevator and vending machines.

The casino floor has very high ceilings and is well lit with nice colors and decor. FYI- the side bet is \"bet the bust\" where you get different odds on the dealer busting. You can bet up to your original bet, but the minimum is $1. You make the bet after the dealer shows his up card. If it's a 4, 5 or 6 you get paid even money on the side bet. If it's a 8, 9, 10 you get 3 to 1, etc. Sucker bet, but cheap entertainment at a $3 table.

It is roughly about six or seven miles (15 minutes) down to the LV strip, but I understand there is a shuttle that stops here frequently.

We avoid strip hotels, and while we enjoy the downtown experience, we're not as familiar with driving around downtown on weekend nights, so we looked for something off strip. The great service started with reservations. I was paying for two rooms for 3 different people, and didn't want to confuse the reservation system with my name on both reservations with different rooms on the same credit card. I emailed the hotel and got a quick response from the Director of Hotel Operations, who painlessly made the second reservation. I was impressed! When choosing our hotel we looked for value rates as well as casinos that could provide good cocktail service at our low roller rates. We were not disappointed! Parking was excellent, with lots of available spaces which dramatically cleared up after 6:30pm. This really is a locals place, so the early and late crowd did not exist on our trip. Checkin was fast, efficient, and we had no problems at all. The elevators were awkward, as you must swipe your room key before choosing your floor. With all our bags and checkin paperwork, it was a bit of a challenge. I appreciated the safety idea of needing it, but we saw a lot of people riding the elevator who were lost as to picking a floor, and simply got off when we did. Which reduced the appearance of safety, in my opinion. The rooms were HUGE! We had two queen beds on the 11th floor. The room was well appointed, with great views of the strip (if you placed your face against the glass), mountains, a local park, the subarbian houses close by, and in general peace and quiet. My one issue with the room is that it could have used another trash can. (How's that for nit-picking?!) Plugins were readily available both on the bathroom sink area as well as next to the table/lamp area. We paid $85 a night per room before taxes. We had a fridge, two comfy queen beds, a raised top/bar area seperating the bathroom and the living area which was convienent for throwing phones and items on before passing out in bed for the night. The flatscreen TV did not turn on in a deafening volume mode! There were a few hangers, and the lotion, and conditioned shampoo were appreciated by my husband. (I bring my own!) Our one issue with the hotel was lack of ice. Our floor (11) did not have ice, nor did floor 10, or 12. We did not complain, but our travel-mate did. She was told it was probably because people were filling up coolers. We found this hard to believe on Thursday night, Friday morning/afternoon/evening and Saturday morning. However, after she complained a few times the ice machines were working on our floor. We appreciated the response, and will definitely let the front desk know next time, if there are any issues. The casino staff was FANTASTIC! The dealers were great, the tables were cheap $5 BJ 3:2 payout, $2 roulette with 50 cent chips, $5 pai gow poker, and a ton of nickle video poker. There were tons of penny and nickel slot machines, and the types of games seemed to be fairly new, and a lot of fun. We were impressed with the promotions going on, but for people who only visit Vegas every 4-5 months we will probably not get the same response as locals, as their players club seems to reset points every 90 days. But we all got a pint of tequila and a pint of rum for our 3 days of play, and we entered into their Saturday night giveaways and one of us ended up winning $25! Not bad for a weekend promotion clean up!! Drink service was AMAZING! We really enjoyed the coffee shop, though their special was not impressive in cost or food amount (though it was yummy). I loved their country fried steak and eggs and biscuits and gravy was a great deal. This is not a traditional \"cheap\" eatery, but the food was hot, drink re-fills were quick in coming, and the service was friendly. We did not try the deli or room service. The hotel is across the street (almost directly) from a Bank of America, and Wal-Mart Supercenter. Awesome for us to fill up on soda and water for the room.

Just two years old (as of 8/10), the casino in the Eastside Cannery caters mostly to locals, but the hotel is not overlooked.

So I didn't hesitate to stay here again. This time I came away a little surprised. First off, was treated rather rudely at check-in. Upon arrival on Thursday for a three-night stay I was told that the king non-smoking room I had reserved six months prior was not available; that they only had eight king rooms in the whole hotel (That would surprise me). I accepted a double queen but asked about any possible free upgrades. From this point on the gentleman actually got snotty. He said no because I was staying three nights and he could only give me an upgrade for one night. He then threw (yes threw) my credit card and identification back on the counter so that I had to stop it from sliding across and on to the floor. He then did the same thing with the room key packet and basically dismissed us by turning his back without bothering to tell us what our room number was, where the elevators were (we at least already knew that) or even wishing us a good night. Horrible! The room, as last visit, was wonderfully clean, roomy, and very comfortable. Strange thing, though. We left the room on Friday at approximately 10am and returned about 8pm and the room had not been touched by housecleaning. We had to call down to get clean towels. The room was cleaned on Saturday fine. Again, strange. The gaming as always is very fair. You get to play and sometimes even win. The casino is roomy and really not very smoky unless you are sitting right next to a chain smoker. The cocktail waitresses are abundant and very friendly. It makes for a nice gaming session. We ate at two restaurants while there. Snaps is your standard 24-hour cafe/diner. The food is a bit average but the service is great and the prices are very reasonable. But had another interesting experience at Casa Cocina. Although the food here was VERY good the waiter was about as attention deficient as I have ever seen. For the most part we seemed to have to deal with the bus boy, who was at least accommodating. The waiter on the other hand showed up only to take the food order, delivered the meals (there were six of us) in spurts, and never bothered to check on how we were doing. We wanted to order another round of drinks but were never able to. All the while he was running around like the proverbial headless chicken and ended up dropping a meal on the floor at the table next to us where it sat for 10 minutes. It also took over 30 minutes to get our check after we finish, again without ever checking if we needed anything else (drinks, more drinks!). Next time we're here and want Mexican food we may just go over to Willy & Jose's at SamsTown about a block away. We'll see. I also noticed that their nightclub, Club One-Six was no longer open. Wasn't a big deal to me but thought it seemed popular last year. Another casualty of the Vegas economy I guess. Overall, not a bad stay, just weirdly non-consistent this visit. I will stay here again but sincerely hope the rough edges get smoothed-out.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cGreat room for only $30\u201d", "Author": "JoeyH01", "ReviewID": "UR62118337", "Content": "Stayed here for five nights.

Definitely the biggest room I have seen in Las Vegas. And the value per night was excellent. Generally, the service was good. Our room was cleaned everyday. The casino is well lite with many games to play. My disappointment was the casino was very smokey, to which it is Las Vegas and I did not expect a health spa or anything. But a smoke free room with a single treadmill or elliptical would have been appreciated. There are few healthy food options throughout the casino/hotel. When it comes to nearby spectacles, be like a local and take the bus because there isn't much within walking distance. Upon checking out, I left my make up in the room and when I realized a few hours later, my hours trying to recover my items was useless despite my cooperation with casino security. Two weeks later they sent the make up bag to me but all of the contents were gone.

It was so bad that by the time you got to your room you felt dirty and contaminated which really detracted from the beautiful room. The elevator was horribly stinky as well.

We did eat at their sister hotel the Cannery and that was very good, one of the better one's and very reasonably priced.

Housekeeping is immediate as well is the room service. The buffet is one of the best in town and the hotel provides you with 2 for 1 coupons at the players club desk. delicious cuts of prime rib, italian, chinese and american food is always provided. On wednesday the seafood buffet is second to none. I earned enough points at a couple hours of gaming to get 2 free seafood buffet coupons. The gaming center is great too. the dealers are all friendly and the floor managers are very socialable and helpful. With many table games and slots to play you will always have something to do. They hae a small poker room but it is more then enough to host there nightly texas hold em tourney. $25 entry and a pretty good pay out if you cash. The bar also has a really good band to provide you with live music any evening. As a matter of fact the casino was so much fun I never made it to the rooftop lounge. (sorry). Traveling to the strip was never more then 10 minutes, even during rush hour. And for $30 a night this place is weel worth the short drive.
