This hotel is much smaller and less corporate than the other hotels in this bay. The service was outstanding. Although expensive, but cheaper than the other ones on the bay, our room was amazing-- very large, private, and stand alone. Once of the better rooms we had on the trip. Keep in mind there is no gym and limited business services.

The cottage walls were bright white, the tatched roof was light brown, and it really helped the overall ambiance (the resort we stayed the night before, the ahimsa, was very dark and gloomy with its ebony woods and black decor).The beach was private, which was good, (I hate large packs of tourists!) with white sands that was looked after and clean, and the ocean water was light blue! We had a free lunch that we made the most of (because of the reservation glitch) and the lobster was the best I had ever. The people at the hotel was super friendly-typical balinese-and really looked after our needs and looked like they were enjoying themselves doing it. I'm going back to bali on march and I'm for sure will stay at the jimbaran again.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR233760747", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cendut"}, {"Content": "Perfect, private place to stay We walked into the Jimbaran Puri Bali on the offchance they had available rooms, we were so pleased that they did.

This is a very well appointed, small and exclusive property with some superb rooms. We had a two storey villa (no 41) with its own pool and both floors are huge. The rooms are serviced 3 times a day, but never obtrusively with water, fresh fruit, tea and coffee and bed- time herbal tea are all provided. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. There is also a library and wi-fi in the lobby by the pool. The beach is one of the best in Bali and great for bodyboarding (provided free) or kayaking (also free).Staff were very good at organising taxis (very fair prices), trips to Ulu Watu temple (likewise), snorkelling trip (recommended) and transfer to Ubud. Very easy to get to Kuta for shopping and night life.2 things to watch out for - they are building some more villas and have the builders behind the property until the end of 2008. Well screened off ,but It meant we could not use our private pool or garden between 10 and 5pm, but they made up for this with free breakfast for 7 nights. Second is that the excellent restaurants are very overpriced - but you can eat really well from a multitude of beach places 5 mins walk along the shoreline.example live lobster in hotel R102,000 \u62e25.60) per 100g - same live lobster on the beach its R170,000 \u62e29.40) per kg!The local dance event though was fairly priced.Overall though we would highly recommend and its streets nicer than the Four Seasons or the Intercontinental on the beach.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR667802131", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "deskjet2"}, {"Content": "good       puri bali", "Date": "Jun 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR712548146", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "zanda18Birmingham"}, {"Content": "Fantastic if you want to splurge a little       morning view of pool", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR401974749", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "2005travel"}, {"Content": "Beautiful       bungalow nr 17", "Date": "Mar 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR281443788", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LindaNorway"}, {"Content": "not that nice... i wont agree with all i read... it is actually too expensive for what it is. it is a nice hotel but not worth the price. you get in bali much nicer hotels for half the price. also, i was there right between Christmas and New Year's eve. we had booked 7 nights, and as it was raining so much, we decided to leave the hotel the next day. they asked us to pay 7 nights cancellation fee, which i found not fair at all coming from a big nice hotel.the hotel itself is nice but still, the entrance lobby is very poor, the road leading to the hotel is horrible.

We went for our honeymoon and it lived up to all expectations. The staff were friendly, attentive (without being pushy) and very helpful. We had a great laugh trying to learn a few words of Balinees from them. The hut was spacious and airy with all the facilities you would expect from this standard of resort. It has a great pool area and location right on Jimbaran beach. The beach comes alive at about 5ish with locals playing football and generally having fun. Walk down the beach towards the airport and you can watch them launching the fishing boats and visit the local fish market. The food in the hotel restaurant is much more expensive than the places on the beach, but they are two different styles of food. The beach food is simple freshly caught bbq'd seafood which is very cheap and delicious. The hotel food is much more what you would expect in a decent restaurant and as such not expensive for what you get. I would recommend trying both.

We really enjoyed our stay even though it was very short (we were in transit to another part of Indonesia.) It is close to the airport (10-15 min by taxi), and made a convenient overnight stopover.The hotel is done in the traditional Balinese style. The resort has a very serene and peaceful atmosphere and is located on a nice beach. The grounds are lovely. The rooms are private and comfortable with beautiful wood and tasteful accents. The beautiful pool fits in perfectly with the ambience of the resort. It is large, inviting and warm -- perfect for either bathing or swimming laps. We enjoyed the beachfront fish restaurant at the hotel for dinner. It was considerably less than what we would pay for an equivalent meal at home, but may be more expensive than the local restaurants. We thought the beautiful setting and attentive service more than made up for the higher cost. The spa was nice and the Balinese massages were relaxing and reasonably priced.The atmosphere of the hotel is best suited for couples.

Jimbaran Puri Bali is set on pretty quiet beach. The best hotel to access the beach. It is so peaceful. The sand is soft and white and the hotel keeps it clean. The sea water is not aqua and it is not clear. It looks brown because of the back wash. At around 4pm all the village folk come to the beach to swim and play ball and the beach begins to light up with people and pretty tables lit with candles. The hotel looks beautiful at night with all the candles lit and very romantic. Really special. The best thing about the hotel is the cottages because they are private, so you have your own garden on the one side and on the other side a patio which isn't private. I think this is the saving grace of the room. You don't get conditioner in your room so bring your own. The bed is good and comfortable. There was blood on our sheets when we arrived but they changed it immediately. On closer inspection of the room you will notice that it is almost in need of a face lift. The woodwork in the room looks tired. Outside the deck is rotting. They don't provide mosquito repellent and they charge you for internet usuage. They do give you a hat, bag and slops to use while you stay there. The staff are on the border of being unfriendly, they actually look like they dislike their jobs, so i think that is the vibe you end up picking up on. We were really bothered by the ladies that do massages for the hotel on the beach. They are pushy and try to get you to commit to having a massage when all you really want to do is just chill on the beach. They also have a little business on the side and bug you to come and look at their hats, bags, bikinis etc. It got to the point where we opted to lie at the pool to avoid them. We ate at the hotel and the food was above average. Breakfast is terrible. At the prices they charge the meals should have been excellent. We are major fans of the Mandarin Oriental Group and always stay at their hotels, that is why we stayed here, but this hotel somewhat dissapointed me and i feel its not a true reflection of the Orient Express Group. The staff need the most work because this hotel is a gem but in my opion, not managed well.
