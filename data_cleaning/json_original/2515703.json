It's only about a 15-minute walk. I feel like the building must have one time been a retirement or assisted living center because the rooms were designed in that way. The rooms are very small with only a \"full\" size bed, which was slightly larger than a twin. The bathroom, equally tiny, has the toilet and shower and the sink is on a counter next to the bed. I found that strange, but whatever. The room was clean, which was a huge plus. Also, the addition of a fridge and microwave in the room was a nice touch. But there were other little things that were flawed. For one, there were a few outlets int he room, but they were stretched out so that my plugs wouldn't stay in them and fell right out onto the floor. Also, the room was very stuffy and had an old-school window air conditioner. The window did open, but when closed it provided very little sound proofing from the street. In fact, I was woken up through the closed window, through the sound of the AC, and through my ear plugs by a group of raucous college-age kids around 7:30am in another room across the alley from my room. Two reasons I selected this hotel was because of the free breakfast and the free transportation to and from the airport. The breakfast was standard and decent for a hotel breakfast (assuming you're OK with food-like substances that are made to look like eggs, sausage, waffles, and high-fructose corn syrup syrup). The transportation not so much. No where on the website or in communications with the hotel did it mention that you have to take a shuttle van to the hotel. Taking the shuttle van was fine, but it was very confusing upon arriving about what I was supposed to do and where I was supposed to wait for a shuttle and which shuttle. When I asked about the shuttle back to the airport, I was told by two different people at the front desk that they no longer provide transportation back to the airport but they could call me a cab or make a reservation for a shuttle for me. I told them both that the website said otherwise, but they insisted. So I just ordered my own shuttle and it was fine. But then, as I was waiting for my shuttle to arrive, the front desk manager was telling someone else that they have a voucher for a taxi included with the hotel! I asked him about it and he said that they indeed provided transportation to the airport. When I told him he might want to retrain the front desk staff since two of them at different times told me otherwise, he acted like it was my fault! Overall, if you're only one person traveling and won't be there very long (and won't be spending a lot of time in the room), this is an OK place to stay. But be prepared to get yourself back to the airport depending on who is working the front desk.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "High Wycombe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ikorel", "ReviewID": "UR124175302", "Content": "Its a comfort inn, so you kind of know what to expect, this one is in a central, down town location, sensibly priced, and it's a comfort inn.

It is 10 minutes from the airport. They do not have their own shuttle. Shuttle service is coordinated through Super Shuttle and/or taxis which are paid for by the property. This is a Choice Hotels property, so I didn\u2019t expect much. I stayed in room 409 which is a standard King. The room is small but well kept. From an entertainment prospective, it seemed fine. Good location near many restaurants and bars. Only two short blocks to Fifth Street. The room had it\u2019s own, window mounted A/C unit which was noisy, as was the overhead fan which hummed constantly. I shut both of them off during my stay. There was moderate street noise in the room, with an occasional police or fire truck going by. Typical large city noises. The room has a micro/fridge combo with coffee maker and small sink in the sleeping area. The bathroom is the size of a Chicklet , but was clean. It has a 32\u201d flat screen TV. If you\u2019re here for work, like me, this room falls short. The work desk is small and has a horrible chair. There is only ONE outlet for use with laptops, etc. The bed was good but the pillows were cheap and lumpy. The staff was cordial, but not overly friendly. Parking was $16.00 for a surface lot behind the hotel which is not monitored. Overall I would give the property a 78/100 and 90/100 for value.

This can be either a major plus or a minus. The upside to this fact is obvious: you can walk to any of these sites. In addition, you are close to trolley hubs, so one could enjoy several days without a car. The downside is that (1) like many downtowns, SD has a visible homeless population. Those who do not wish to come in contact with such people will be unlikely to avoid them. (2) the area is designed for major parties every night, and particularly on weekends and after baseball games. Those seeking a quiet experience on such nights are not going to find it. (3) when there is a major convention or a baseball game in town, prices will be high. Be aware of the area you are choosing, and try to time a visit when lodging won't be scarce. We stayed here for four nights during such a convention, and LOVED its location, despite having little interest in nightlife. The second thing to note is the motel's explicit statement that their rooms are \"boutique\" size. This code word means \"small.\" If you need a lot of space to spread out, this is not the lodging for you. The third thing to know is the number of amenities you will get for the price. They include full bath, phone (free local calls), AC, ceiling fan, clock radio, coffee maker, TV with 60 channels, fridge, microwave, hair dryer, in-room safe, and iron & board. Free perks include wi-fi, hot breakfast buffet, a newspaper, access to a local gym, and PC near the lobby. Parking is around the corner and costs extra, but it is nice to have 24-hour \"in and out\" privileges. The phrase \"wet bar\" means the sink is outside the bathroom, next to the fridge. Innumerable shops and restaurants are nearby. Drive north on 11th Avenue to find a few chain, fast food joints. With a drug store a block away, you can fill up the fridge with drinks and microwave some munchies for low cost, late night snacks. The room was quiet enough, clean, and well-maintained.

Being on a budget, the huge hotels were out of my price range. To make a long story short, the Comfort Inn Gaslamp was an excellent choice. Free HOT breakfast including eggs and make-your-own waffles...plus coffee with lids to take with you saved a ton on Starbucks at the convention center. The location, while all of Gaslamp is absolutely filthy and disgusting, is pretty good. It's a quick walk to the convention center just a few short blocks away. You are one block off of 5th (the main drag), so it is fairly quiet. There are some pretty good retaurants not on 5th that are just a block down and over from here (Smashburger being one)...and they are less expensive. There is a handy CVS just a one block away, and since the rooms have refrigerators and microwaves, it is nice to be able to pick up a two liter and some grub and keep it cold in the room. Grab some bottles of water or soda to take with you to the convention center, they are $4 there. Location gets a A. Yes, the rooms are small, but not short on amenities. Other than sleeping, how much time do you really spend in the room? There is a desk if you need one, big luggage area, a chair, and the bed. A flat screen TV hangs on the wall. The sink is in the room right next to the bed, but you get used to that quickly. No biggie. Bed and pillows are very comfortable and VERY clean (no BB, I checked). Staff was freindly and helpful. The hotel also has free wifi, while slow and weak in my room, it worked enough to get e-mails done. Just don't expect to stream anything. With all the smartphones and tablets around now, I suspect the router gets hammered with bandwidth on a nightly basis, though, so I'll give them a pass on this.

You are downtown and your nightly rate is affordable and so the rooms size will coincide, they're not huge. This is not a party hotel, it is perfect for two friends, a couple or a solo person.

I could sit on the edge of the bed and use the sink (only a shower/tub and toilet in the bathroom), microwave, and refrigerator. The bed was just the right firmness and I fell asleep quickly and had a restful night's sleep. The hotel and neighborhood around it was quiet; no loud noises even though it was on a busy street. The view out my window was of a wall a few feet away. There were bars, restaurants, stores, and San Diego bay attractions within easy walking distance.

I booked a last minute room at the Comfort Inn in Gaslamp expecting the same quality of other Comfort Inns I've stayed at, truth be told, I was sadly mistaken. When I made the reservations, they had mentioned that airport transportation was free, do not believe them, it is free from the airport not to the airport. I was forced to take a taxi that took $15.00 to get to the airport in the morning. Aside from that flagrant lie, it is not the only thing that went wrong. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby looked okay, there was a fish tank with a huge puffer fish in it which was kind of neat, little did I know upon checking out that I would feel horrible for the fish that have to inhabit that hotel. After checking in I proceeded to my room located on the 4th floor by taking the elevator which you swear was going to break down at any given time it was so slow. Upon arriving at my floor and walking down the hallway to my room, I had a lingering suspicion that I was walking straight into a dump. I got to my room and the first thing I noticed after opening the door was an unbearable odor of what seemed to be fecal matter. I could not locate the source of the stench but it seemed to emanate from the carpet. Wherever it came from, it was strong enough to keep me up all night feeling ill. The second thing I noticed was the window that had a air conditioner sticking out of it and upon further inspection, a large gap in between the wall and the window which the gap was large enough to let bugs in. The room was extremely small, very dissapointing as I've stayed at a nicer, larger hotel room for the same price in the past. The bed was tiny, taking up most of the room, the little room you had left to walk was cut short by the sink situated 1 foot or so from the bed, very strange as I've never seen a sink in the bed area, you'd think it would be located in the bathroom? As for the sleeping situation, I slept with my jeans, shirt and socks... Usually I sleep more casual in a hotel but I feared the worst and during the little sleep I did get, I was violently awoken by a horrible itching sensation, I have had fears that I had contact with bedbugs in this room yet nothing has been confirmed.

Sure you're going to hear more street noise than if you stayed out in less populous areas, but it's to be expected when staying downtown. The doors to the rooms loudly slam shut creating a lot of noise, so maybe the hotel could look into something which can retard that process.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice post-purchase: pay attention to reviews, articulate needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell the 3rd-party vendor in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found both Hotwire and Priceline highly responsive. Talk to management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.

Rooms have a tiny footprint, not unlike a New York hotel room; but are beautifully designed with obvious careful attention to guest comfort. Every room has a refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker. The vanity and kitchen counter are next to the bed; tub and toilet separate with a sliding door closure to the bathroom. Working window AC, baseboard heating unit. Hot and cold water spigots were reversed and unmarked, an odd but small problem that was cheerfully fixed within minutes of my reporting it. ONE THING I\u2019D FIX: Heat is supplied by a baseboard until, and the controls are awkward to find and locate; it\u2019s slow to respond. Small signage atop the unit would take care of this. AND: Ask to be placed away from large groups of young people. I wasn\u2019t bothered but saw potential for hallway noise based on the youth and exuberance of other guests.

Read on but be patient, I'v e got a lotta pluses plus some negatives... First off, let me explain that my husband and I are very simple people. We are 28& 34 with no children. When we travel all we really look for is a place to lay our heads. We usually expect The Comfort Inn to be just what any traveler would expect. A bed, a bath, a sink. Not much more. I do have to say that our experience here has been extremely below expectations. I have read plenty of reviews before (including this hotel) and have decided to stay anyway. I must admit of all the places that I have stayed, despite the negative ratings, I am sickly disapointed at The Comfort Inn here. ONLY because of the customer service. When my husband and I checked in on a Thurs afternoon we got a room on the 4th floor. The bed was a full sized bed. That would be about 6 inches above a twin. We nicely went to the front desk and explained that it was not a matter of convenience, but the my husband was 240lbs alone. I would have to sleep on the floor. They seemed to think i was joking and we were told no other rooms were available. At this point I called HOTELS.COM to ask (if i took a cancelation fee) what would my refund be if we decided to stay elsewhere. NOTHING. Because we had already checked in, we would get absolutely NO refund. (Needless to say I will NEVER use them again. ) The next day we were moved to a more sutiable room. Queen sized bed is the bigest your going to get here, no matter what you book. A few good things... Breakfast is actually really good. The cheese omlets are super cheesy. I usually made three tirps a morning. It included cheese omlest, bacon, sausage, waffels, hot cereal, cold cereal, bageal, english muffins, yogurt...Mmmmmm. I must say, all was good. FYI the maid carts in the stair well on the main floor. When you check in the tell you that botteled water and popcorn are free. But if you ever need 'extra' thats where you can find them. If you rent a car parking there is $16.00 a day. Unless you have children in car seats, you can take the trolley most anywhere. Now a bit more about San Diego in general.... It is beautifuland very clean. They are serious about crossing at cross walk signals! If your looking at staying in the gaslamp district I would recommend it for younger, single people. My husband and I (28 & 34). If you find a hotel somewhat around 4th or 5th street, most EVERYTHING is in walking distance. Plenty of night life. Check out The Shout House on 5th St., dueling piano bars. Pretty Cool. You can walk to The Seaport Village whice is about a 10 min walk. It has many neat shops as well as various free-lance vendors, such as character artists, jewlery artists, palm readers, baloon makers, mimes... a lot for kids. We also checked out the USS Midway. Definitely a must. But allow yourself a good 3-4 hours to check it out. Get there by noon, 1:00 at the very latest. It was $17 an adult to get in, well worth it. There is a cafe on ship that serves sandwiches and such. Yes, they serve beer and wine too. It was a self guided tour with individual ear phones. You won't speak much with who you are touring with. If you have children young enough to be in a stroler, I would not recommend it. Strollers are not allowed on 95% of the tour. If you want to see the upper most part of the ship (anything above the flight deck) you must be in line by 4pm. Even on a week day. That part of the trip is a guided tour by veterns. There are bike 'trollys' everywhere you turn in downtown SanDiego. We never took one, but from what we were told, they are not allowed to charge a fair. Only accept a tip. If you are planning a trip to Qualcomm staduim 'beware'...We bought tickets to a Chargers game on the East Coast. We took the trolley to the game...no big deal. BUT when we got to the game we were told our section was in an exclusive 'family section'. That means no beer. That might be great for some, but when you flu 3500 miles to see a football game, it's pretty discouraging. BUT the staff was really nice and let us sit one section over, as long as no one made us give up the seat.

That being said, however, the rooms at Comfort Inn Gaslamp are very efficiently put together and just the right size for a couple who does not mind close quarters or have a lot of luggage. There is more than meets the I in these rooms. There was a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, full size ironing board and steam iron (you just do not know how rare it can be to get a steam iron in a hotel sometimes), good water pressure in the shower, and plenty of drawers and lighting.
