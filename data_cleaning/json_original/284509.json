It seems that the Bar manager runs the place. He sends guys out to solicite people not from Hotel to rent lounge chairs. For $10 they get use of pool, outdoor shower and bathroom. Everyday there were at least 10-20 screaming children splashing, running around in the very small pool from 9-5 or later. A family from another hotel rented 1 chair and there were 15 people. They were in the pool and shower all day. We tried to sit on our patio but left for some peace. We twice could not get lounge chairs because all had been rented. For $150 a night I felt taken. I finally asked the bar manager if at some point we as guest could use the pool without the public. He did reluctantly and ordered me in the pool because he did me a favor!!!WHAT????

We love Playa, and I'm a creature of habit, so when we planned our trip, it was easy to choose the Mimi again. For affordability and rustic coziness, in addition to beachfront location, it's pretty hard to beat. I try to prepare myself for any potential snafus that arise when traveling, and certainly no vacation is perfect. There was some confusion about the room we reserved, but that was quickly resolved upon arrival. We checked in and started enjoying wonderful Playa. The work done on the beach in front of the Mimi is wonderful. It's been rebuilt, and the sand is beautiful. Since we arrived at the end of the high season, there were a couple of days where there were good crowds, a couple of days where we had it all to ourselves. The hotel was also in low occupancy, which I know isn't good for them, but it makes us feel like we are not part of a huge tourist crowd. Our room was very well taken care of. Service was daily and outstanding. Staff was friendly and courteous to us, smiling and waving every day we saw them. We bring our own blankets to hang in the large sliding glass window so we can sleep a little later - caution Playa newbies, the sun comes up at 6:15 and it's in your room if you don't cover the windows. The Mimi has small TV's with cable, which I love - because late at night, I'm a flipper and I love to watch Spanish TV. I also love the rattle and hum of the wall-unit A/C. It's cold, and the bed is firm, clean and was easy for us to sleep on. When we left, there was some confusion about our transportation to the airport, but that was also worked out. One thing that is important to me when I travel is customer service. If I have a problem, for my money I want to feel like I am taken care of and that someone is paying attention. Mimi does that, and when I explained to her what had happened, she made everything right by us. To summarize - for rustic, cozy affordability on the beach, the Mimi is a great place. Great food nearby, close to all the shopping of 5th Avenue and far enough away from the discos. Very good service. They could pay more attention to detail, but nobody's perfect. This is not a resort. If you want something fancy, I'm sure there's something else for you that's also way more expensive. For my money, I'll take the Mimi.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and beachfront room for the price but needs updated\u201d", "Author": "lovetovacation010", "ReviewID": "UR55675253", "Content": "This is a difficult review because the hotel itself is old and not well maintained but the room was clean enough and we had one of two oceanfront rooms with a huge, private balcony. We left the balcony door open all the time and had a breeze with the rear window open. It was quiet too. I don't know if there are other hotels with private, ocean front rooms and a kitchen for $170! But, there were tiny, tiny ants that came out in the kitchen if one little crumb was out and the kitchen furnishings were sparse. We bought dish soap and washed everything. You have to buy bottled water at this hotel but that was o.k. with us. The biggest problem was that the hot water was luke warm when we arrived and then went to cold and they even turned it off completely for several hours on two different days to repair. This was not acceptable service in our opinion and they offerred us nothing in return. You don't get breakfast included unless you book directly through the hotel but the one we purchase wasn't good anyway. We loved Playa del Carmen and this location on the beach. Since the beach restoration there is plenty of room on the sand and the small size of the hotel helps the beach area not be croweded. Bad Boys Beach Club next door has good food and the live music from 5-9 on Thurs. and Sat. was great! If you're looking for a no frills hotel in a good location for a good price, you'll like this. We had to move to the Alhambra hotel down the beach for one night. The rooms were much nicer but we were on a side street with noise and less privacy so had to keep the room closed up with the air conditioner running.

There was no hot water the first two days and then no water at all. When we went to the front desk, the manager was nowhere to be found. Instead he left a memo explaining that, in order to fix the hot water, all the water needed to be turned off.

It is on the beach, s few blocks from the ferry, but the room and the ammenities were minimal for what they charged. I think you could get better for the same price down the beach. The hotel is not accessable from the street, and you have to walk to the end of either 2nd or 4th and then walk across the sand to reach the hotel. When you are dragging two bags of dive gear and a luggage bag across the sand, it makes it a bit of a pain. But we wanted beachfront and we got it. We were on the first floor, and our patio faced the main walkway from the beach. The room was all tile, and had a kitchenette in the front. The only eating table was the patio table. The bathroom was very small, and the shower was small and has pressure problems. Because our room was at the end of the walkway of the hotel, everyone could look in as they approached their own rooms. Normally, this would not be a big issue, but our drapes were too small for the window, and only covered over half of our sliding door to our patio. So we had this big gap of open window into our room the entire stay. We could not change in the bedroom and had to change in the bathroom for privacy. The kitchenette comes with a fridge and an electric stove top. They have pots and pans and the utensils needed. There is a large grocery store about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel also has a restaurant (breakfast and lunch only) and bar on the beach, and the stay (if booked thru the hotel directly) includes breakfast. We had lunch there a few days. The beer was very cold and the tacos were great. There is also a small pool in the center area, but is shaded most of the day and pretty cold. The AC works great in the room and the TV has cable, with lots of English channels. There is a safe in the closet, but one of those old key-in-removable-lock safes. You have to either leave $100 or credit card imprint as a deposit for the safe key. You can also sign out beach towels at the front desk. If you bring chargers to charge cameras or video cameras or cell phones, there are only 3 outlets available in the room. Bring your own blow dryer if you use one. They do not have any. Also, bring your own shampoos or you can buy some at the stores in the area. All they provide is little soaps in the bathroom. Like any beach hotel, what I enjoyed about this hotel was that I could hear the ocean waves on the sand at night, and it was nice and quiet. We picked this hotel because it had good reviews over the years. I would probably not use this hotel again, but I would not tell you not to stay there. If you like the small boutique hotels with no frills, then you may like this one.

When we 1st arrived, I wasn't so sure. Arriving tired, after a long day of travel, the taxi dropped us off 1 block away, since you arent allowed to drive all the way to the beach. As we were trying to haul our stuff down to the hotel, we were accosted by the very \"wasted\" owner of a shop on that street, who insisted on helping us to the hotel( of course, in hopes that we would buy something from him later). The beach was smaller & the ocean much more rough looking than I had hoped for. The room was BASIC. Walls could use a fresh coat of paint. Not that we planned to watch much TV, but it was VERY little. The beds are HARD. (Also keep in mind that there is only 1 in each room, so if you have children or are paying for an extra adult in your room what you will get is a cot type of roll away.) The best aspect of that 1st night was that the airconditioner worked very well. THE NEXT DAY , HOWEVER, OUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE HOTEL MIMI, BEGAN TO UNFOLD! You open your door to look over the small but lovely pool in the courtyard, onto the mesmerizing waters of the Carribean. IF you booked, online, directly with the hotel, you go to the office, get your tickets for your free breakfast (2 per room), and step outside under the palm roofed palapa for your choice of yummy breakfasts, cooked & served by the 5 guys who make up the kitchen & bar staff, who do their best to see to your every need. As you return to your room you notice how clean the small pool is & the tile courtyard floor around it with it's lovely scattering of plants and see the care the housekeeping staff has taken in cleaning your room. Return to the beautiful beach, get your beach chair (2 free with each room) from the aforementioned wait staff and begin to let all the tension release from body & soul. Food & drink on the beach at the hotel are good and there is quite a selection, at reasonable prices (Realize that especially this part of Mexico is not the \"deal\" it used to be. Prices are comparable to what you pay in the USA) As my family's stay continued, our respect & affection for the entire staff grew each day as their excellent sense of service continued and their sense of humor, and hearts of gold shone through. These people work hard and we hope any of you that stay will remember to tip. I know Europeans are not used to tipping as service is often inclusive in Europe, but please remember, that is not the case here. Wages are low in Mexico & tips make a big difference in peoples lives. We left $2 - $3 each day for the maids & tipped 15% for our drinks & meals(including the free breakfasts). Also, if you want a nice taxi driver, just ask Neddie(sp?). His wife drives the car they own and it is very convenient to have him arrange a ride if you need it. Do be careful when you book & try to have communication with Mr Garcia, the manager , who keeps the whole ship afloat, to firm things up. It is Mexico & a Mexican run hotel, which I love....But if your spanish is not great there can be some communication breakdown. Both I and one of the other groups that stayed there also had some trouble getting e-mail responses a few times....but just keep trying. Oh yeah! LOCATION! This hotel is close to the Ferry which is a lovely area to hang out in even if you are not going ON the ferry. (nice kids playground) Close to Avenida Quinta which, is people watching fun, galore. And central to about everything! As for Playa del Carmen itself....the main strip Avenida Quinta is fun in so many ways, but way too commercial for my personal tastes. Though I know everyone is just trying to make a living, the hard sell solicitation from the shops is a turn off. We just learned to joke & make light of it as we ignored the constant sales pitches. But we gave our business to the less agressive, or more out of the way shop keepers that have a more difficult time getting business. Playa is an entire city with more to it than just the Beach & the main strip. The entire 18 days we were there we did not have 1 truly satisfying meal on Avenida Quinta. The restaurants look nice and they have some charming door people to \"get you in\". Once inside, the service is slow, the prices are expensive, and the food is only \"OK\". Our advice is to keep walking away from Av Quinta towards Avenida 10th on through 30th. There is a nice, unassuming little restaurant about 2 - 4 blocks straight up Calle 2, on the right, just past a chinese restaurant which is on the corner. All 11 of us (4 kids, between 2 & 8 yrs) ate there 4 times. No one got sick & we all enjoyed the food at prices half that on Quinta. The family & workers are sweet & so appreciative your business. I wish I had gotten the exact address. Straight up Calle 8 to Avenida 30 and across the street to the left a bit is the 2 story, open air, El Fogon. Tons of locals eating there. And again, the price difference. The night before, on Quinta, we had abysmally slow service and average food for 3 adults & 3 kids for $104 USA. At El Fogon we fed 9 for $42 USA. AND if you have a hard time getting around, as I did with a broken foot, but want to see things at \"ground level\" I recommend the nicest bicycle taxista in the world, Elmer. He speaks very little English, but is getting better and is a very intuitive communicator. For his services, call 044- 984-1445963, and tell him Carolina & Deano sent you. happy trails!

This is a beach front property where all room have a partial view of the ocean. It\u2019s great to wake up and walk only a few step to sit back in a long chair and enjoy the beach. The pool is more of a decoration as it is very small and narrowed. A man offers a massage service on a table next to the beach most morning. The first morning I had breakfast at the hotel bar/restaurant right on the beach for 6.50$. I had a fresh orange juice, 3 toasts with jam, beans with an omelette (a bit uncooked) and a black tea that tasted bad but overall this meal was a good value. I still don\u2019t understand why I did not get the breakfast included when I paid the list price that said it was. Is it because I have booked through worldlinks.com? The Hotel is very well located a few steps from all the action of Playa Del Carmen and fifth Avenue but it\u2019s not too close to the clubbing area so when you come back at night it is quite enough to easily fall asleep. But don\u2019t expect sound proof rooms. You can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and slamming their room door that don\u2019t close easily. One evening there was a live band playing outdoor nearby and I could not do my usual siesta. It was also very close from a diving company on 4th street and a beach activity rental place called \u201cWahoo\u201d that is directly on the beach. This last place charged me 20$ to rent a Kayak for 2 hours and would not let me rent it for 1 hour at 10$. I did not appreciate that. I had a very small TV install very high up close to the ceiling in the room and it was hard on the neck after 30 min of TV watching but it was better than not having any. I had a phone and a safe as well as a small fridge that was very convenient to keep water and fruits fresh and cold. I also used the kitchenette but it was not working too well. The pot and pan left for use are old and I also could not get boiling water and the stove was not powerful enough. I asked for a hairdryer at the front desk because they don\u2019t offer one in the room. The rooms are clean enough. It is not a modern or recent construction and it doesn\u2019t offer have any luxuries but it was satisfying at 100$ a night (high season). The walls and the ceiling are stucco and the floor artisanal a bit uneven ceramic. If you arrive at night some of the bright white neon lighting is not flattering for the room. The queen size bed in room 101 was more comfortable than the king in room 103 that was very hard.

We continued outside and immediately found our transportation that I had arranged with Brant\u2019s Entertainment Plus. We were on the road in minutes. Our driver dropped us and our luggage off on 10th Ave at calle 2. He pointed to the beach and said our hotel was that way and left us there on the sidewalk. We grabbed our bags and headed that direction. Once we arrived at the beach (we knew we had to walk on the beach to get in to our hotel) we asked one of the beach servers where to go. He pointed to the left. We had another block\u2019s worth of walking on the sand, carrying our luggage. Finally we arrived at the Mimi del Mar after about an hour drive and a 3 block walk from where our driver dropped us off. I do have to say, I was a bit disappointed because I had read where others using Brant had their luggage carried to the hotel and over the sand to the entrance. Dropping us off at calle 4 would have been easier, with only a few feet of sand before you get to the hotel. However, I guess they are not allowed to drive down those streets. Some can, but maybe permits are required, we aren\u2019t sure. Reception area is a tiny little room at the front of the hotel (no main lobby area to speak of). Check in was quick. I had asked if the girl behind the desk was Rene, as I had emailed back and forth with her making my reservations. She barely spoke any English and said yes, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure if she knew what I was asking. She didn\u2019t seem to be a manager, but I could be wrong. I told her that I had emailed her quite a few times asking about any possible upgrades, and her answer was simply \u201coh, no\u201d. I didn\u2019t care at that moment, as long as I had a room. She figured out our balance due. The site said they preferred cash or traveler\u2019s checks. I started to sign my checks and then thought I had better make sure she had change. Well, no, of course not! Honestly, I am SO SICK of hearing that down in MX. Why does a hotel that prefers cash, not have any on hand? Sorry, I had to vent. Luckily I had not signed the second traveler\u2019s check. We had enough cash along to pay for the remainder, with her even getting a little tip out of it due to the denominations we had and the change she did not. She gave us our room key and I then asked about a safety box. Sure, but she would need another $100 deposit for that. I was fresh out of cash, and wasn\u2019t going to sign over a traveler\u2019s check for it. We decided to skip it. She then pointed behind her and said your room is that way. No one to take us to our room, we were on our own once again! We did find our room eventually, and it\u2019s nice. Definately old and worn a bit, but with character, and very clean. It had a small kitchen area with a sink, two stove top burners, a coffee maker, blender, and a nice size frig. We had to flip a breaker in the closet to get the frig to work. The bathroom is tiny and tight, but functional. The shower was actually great. Best water pressure, and always hot water immediately. No waiting for it. The bed was hard, hard, and hard. I never slept so good in my life!!!! I don\u2019t think a hard bed is a bad thing at all. Air conditioning worked very well. It wasn\u2019t on when we walked in to our room, but started cooling very quickly. We were on the 1st floor and we had a small balcony facing out to the pool and beach. Not much of the beach to see from it, but it was nice. We aren\u2019t balcony people, and being on the 1st floor I don\u2019t know that we would have sat there anyways. People would have been walking by your literally inches away. We had no towels the first day, just a nice swan towel art. I used those towels instead. Same thing the next day. No towels in the bathroom, but a new towel art. That is when I realized that the towel art actually were our towels. Normally, towel art is in addition to the towels you get in the bathroom. Minor, but something to note if you think like me. No amenities in the room accept for those small bars of soap. Bring your own everything. Not even shampoo. No problem, I had emailed ahead of time to confirm that. We were doing a carry on only, so I didn\u2019t want to have to bring any more than I needed to, but this wasn\u2019t a problem since I knew this ahead of time. We had no check in orientation, so to say, but thanks to Trip Advisor I knew that you can get beach towels (no charge) in the reception area. They do make you sign in and out for them, but it\u2019s not a problem whatsoever. They also have a beach grill with good food, good drinks, and reasonable prices. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. In fact, we liked the looks of it better than some in Cancun. No ledge, just a nice flat surface leading up to the water. The water was a nice blue color, but just not quite as clear as in Cancun. It was also safe to swim while we were there. The beach grill for the hotel is Palapas del Mar. We sat out one day and our server (I never got his name) came out right away to point out chairs for us. He brought us our drinks, along with chips and salsa. Around lunch time we moved up to a table to get out of the sun and get some food. We ordered the nachos (basic \u2013 chips, beans, and cheese) and they were very good. Drinks and food are quite reasonable at the hotel. He never even charged us for our two sodas we had with lunch. The thing I liked about him was that he wasn\u2019t overbearing or annoying. He was never in your face, but always there as soon as you looked for him or waved at him. It was pleasant. The pool is very small, but nice and refreshing and clean. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is directly on the beach in between calle 2 and 4. One block to famous 5th Ave and you can go from there. I\u2019m sorry to say that we were only here for 3 nights. Not nearly enough time to really get the feel for the hotel and it\u2019s staff. However, I hope this gives you some information you can use. And I hope I didn\u2019t come off too negative at the beginning.

It is only a short walk from the ferry to Cozumel The beach - the beach in front of the hotel was beautiful, little to no rocks, the water was great, but did get a little dirty from a rainstorm, nothing anyone can do about that though. There were always chairs available and it wasn't too crowded. The hotel The hotel was relatively small, well taken care of, clean.

Huevos Mexicanos(scramby eggs with pico de gallo, etc)(you could also order omellettes, pancakes, fruit, and other things) Fresh squeezed OJ(amazing), toast, and cafe, free every morning(of course we still tipped the waiter, Nadi who is a great guy by the way) The Staff - the hotel staff was very pleasant, easy going, and obliged our every request quickly and with pleasure. They were always willing to give us directions, suggestions, and were able to joke around a little. The room - the room was very nice.. in fact, we booked a standard, but upon arrival we were upgraded to a superior and stayed in it all 7 nights! The room had a patio with a decent ocean view, nothing spectacular, but nonetheless you can see the ocean fine. The bed was very large, and very firm, which was fine for us. The air conditioner and fan worked great. One night we had a fair amount of little ants near the bed, but we wiped them away and were never really bothered by them. We think it was because we spilled some juice on the bed. The room had a refrigerator with a mini freezer, both worked well, 2 small stove burners, some kitchen ware, a kitchen sink. The bathroom only had a shower, sink, toilet, but that's all we needed and it worked great, good pressure and temperature. The room was cleaned well, daily, and the maid created a new towel animal for us every day. If you are expecting really high end, chincy, all-inclusive type thing, don't go here.

I\u2019ll try to add to it. We were there March 3 \u2013 10. This really is a nice, quaint hotel right on the beach. Not \u201cposh\u201d but very comfortable; just what we wanted! We stayed in ocean-front room 208 with a huge balcony. There is a wall on one side to offer shade or a wind breaker (and hides the vacant condo!). Other rooms besides the second ocean-front are recessed and seem nice as well. Ours was just above the very small office where staff is always pleasant and eager to please. They even have a small \u201clibrary\u201d if you forgot your book, & request you trade one in that you brought. The room was spacious & clean, had comfortable beds, a large shower, good water pressure, and there were even candles in the alcove next to the statue of Mary which you can move around to set the mood! The closet is adequate, but a small dresser would be a nice addition. Our bar/restaurant servers, Nedi (\u201cAlpha\u201d) and \u201cPedro\u201d are eager to please and are really very nice. When it\u2019s not busy, they do encourage beach combers to take a chair and order drinks & food, so it can get fairly crowded, but we always had a chair. As others said, if you\u2019re going to be away for a while, just tell Nedi and he\u2019ll save your chairs to ensure you have them when you return. Hang on to your beach towel, though, laundry doesn\u2019t come back till 9 am or later, so change it out then. Save room for some nachos or ceviche while you relax on the beach; quite delicious. (I\u2019m sure other items are, too.) We ate breakfast there only once and it was good, but we actually walked to Walmart our first day to get juice, coffee, fruit & yogurts, then pastries during the week and have our breakfast on our balcony. You will be just steps away from a few small mercados where you can get anything you need, including beer, wine and liquor if you like. (Common sense dictates keeping ALL food items in the fridge; we had some teensy ants appear if we weren\u2019t careful.) After late afternoon, it is a very quiet place. Very relaxing. Just walk one block to Avenida de Cinco if you want some activity, great dining, music, shopping. Take a right on 5th and walk away from the ferry pier to avoid aggressive sales and a lot of commotion. This area continues to expand and you can go for countless blocks and find restaurants and shops to the north. The Mimi is on the best stretch of the beach running from the operating pier (south) to the one that was built to the north but will never be used (they are really eco-minded in Playa). I believe the hurricane shifted some things around, and to the north the smelly seaweed and other factors made us happy when we walked back to \u201cour\u201d end of this stretch of beach. Swimming was great, and we did not have any rocks to contend with during our stay. The small pool is good for a quick cool-off dip as an alternate to the ocean, and a lot of guests did use it during our stay, until we did get some clouds and rain at the end of the week. We mostly swam in the ocean, though. The rinse-off shower and bathroom near the pool are convenient during your time at the beach. All in all, I would say we\u2019d return to the Mimi; it is the best pick in the area in our opinion! A few favorites: Ula Gula & Media Luna restaurants for dinner; Blue Parrot on the beach for breakfast or lunch, and The Fah lounge in the lobby of Fiesta Siesta for interesting music in the evening. Try to catch the evening show at Xcaret; it has changed into an extravaganza! The dinner is a good choice to add to your ticket.

We have previously only stayed at All-inclusive resorts with a 3\u00bd star rating or better and I must admit that I was a little concerned about having booked 5 weeks at a 2 star hotel. But I don\u2019t have a bad thing to say about it! We were a group of 11 for a period of 9 days and I don\u2019t think a complaint was made by anyone. We all stayed in Standard rooms, 3 on the ground floor and 3 on the 2nd floor. Some of these rooms are larger than others. We were very happy to have a larger one on the ground floor, room 103, since we were staying awhile, but really, all we did was shower and sleep in the room so it really wasn\u2019t an issue. The rooms are basic, but have everything you need. We like staying places that look and feel like Mexico, not fancy hotels! The lighting is a little dim, but I have found that to be an issue everywhere we have stayed in Mexico or the Dominican. I found the beds and pillows to be some of the most comfortable we have had on a holiday and I slept like a baby every night. Our room had a king size bed, but the smaller rooms had either queens or doubles-not sure what they were. The air conditioner worked well. The water pressure in the shower was great. We never ran out of hot water and the power never went out once during our stay. That is a first on our holidays! The language barrier was a little greater here than at an all-inclusive. The majority of staff had minimal English, but they certainly are eager to learn, which helped us to add to our Spanish vocabulary as well. Staying as long as we did gave us a greater opportunity to get to know the staff and they were all wonderful and eager to please. The housekeeping staff were friendly and efficient. The maintenance man worked from the minute he arrived until the minute he left, keeping everything in tip-top shape (I wanted to bring him home, he was such a great handy-man), reception staff was friendly and ever so helpful, management was eager to please, and the beach/bar/kitchen staff were absolutely fabulous. We enjoyed our daily chats with Nedi and our impromptu Spanish/English/French lessons with Pedro! Not one rude or unfriendly person to be found here. Like anywhere, you treat them with respect and you get treated with respect in return! The kitchen was added to the hotel about a year ago, so breakfast is served right there under the palapa or in your room on a rainy day, and it was always delicious! We sure do miss that fresh squeezed orange juice and our Mexicana scrambled eggs! We\u2019d put our towels on our chairs in the morning and then go for breakfast. Sometimes when we went back to our chairs our towels would be all spread out on them waiting for us. Nice little touches! Bar service was excellent and the drinks were delicious and big! The food they prepare in their little kitchen is amazing and you can eat at a table under the palapa, or right at your beach chair. From breakfast dishes to nachos, salsa, guacamole, to the most delicious fish you ever tasted! It\u2019s true, they do close up the kitchen a little early, otherwise we would have eaten supper there more often. But from their point of view, there really aren\u2019t too many people who hang around on the beach after 3:30 or 4:00. The pool is small, more for show than for use, I think, but who needs a pool when you are only a few feet away from the ocean! The pool was great for a quick refresher though and we did use it a few times! There is an outdoor shower for rinsing off and a bathroom right beside so you didn\u2019t have to make the trip back to your room while at the beach. The beach is rocky in front of the hotel, but from pictures I have seen and from what Nedi told us, it hasn\u2019t always been like that. The hurricane played havoc with the beaches there and it will take years to rebuild them. We only had to walk down the beach a bit either way to find good swimming spots though. The location of the hotel is great, second building on the beach south from Calle 4, so if you are dropped off in the right place, it is a very short walk to the hotel with your luggage\u2026no big deal. Just make sure they take you down 4th right to the beach, and then walk to the right on the beach. If the staff sees you coming they will rush to get your luggage and carry it to your room for you and when you leave, they are right there to carry your suitcases back to the street for you. The hotel is close enough to 5th Avenue to be handy and far enough away to be quiet. We normally were on our balcony until 11 or 12:00 at night and it was so quiet, and we were never disturbed during the night! In addition, it is close to the bus station, the Cozumel ferry docks, tour pick-up spots, taxis, and close enough for a pleasant walk to the Collectivo pick-up site, and Wal-Mart (best place to buy beer, etc). All in all, we found it a great place to stay and a hard place to leave! Should we decide to go back for another extended stay, we won\u2019t hesitate to book there again.

Some of the choices were a ham and cheese omelet, scrambled eggs, Mexican scrambled eggs, hot cakes, or just toast (continental). Breakfast came with orange juice and coffee or tea. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. When our shuttle to bring us back to the airport did not show up on time, the girl at the front was extremely helpful and made every effort possible to contact them to find out what was going on. The water in front of the hotel is OK but there are some rocks. Snorkeling in front of the hotel wasn't great but the day that we were snorkeling probably wouldn't have been any good anywhere. The location of this hotel is excellent, especially if you plan on doing tours or going to Cozumel. It is close to the ferry, bus station, collectivo pickup (12 person van sort of like a taxi that runs up and down the main highway that a lot of people use to get to different tour locations. It's really cheap to use). It is on the beach between calle 2 and 4 (closer to 4) and very close to 5th avenue (which is where most of the shopping is). Calle 4 is also where a lot of the scuba shops drop off and pick up so if you want to scuba dive, it's close. The dive shop we used was probably 200 feet away on 4th between 5th and the beach. Next time we go to Playa Del Carmen, we will stay here again for sure.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turin", "Title": "\u201cScabies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "itching", "ReviewID": "UR6174804", "Content": "During the first night I spent in the bed in my room at Mimi del Mar, my feet became suddenly covered with awful, terribly itching little red bubbles.

If you go to the link: [----] and click on Mimi del Mar you will see that rates for the rooms are WITH breakfast. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that breakfast (for which we payed already) was not included. We tried to discuss with the girl at the reception, who understands no English, so everything in Spanish. OK. She told us that we booked with a certain \"World Link\" agency, which doesn't offer rates with breakfast. For sure that's not what we did, we just booked on the web site I wrote in this blog, not with agencies. Anyway, for 3 days we had to fight to get a voucher for breakfast and the answer was always \"No, you have to speak to the manager for this\". \"OK, where ist the manager?\" \"He is not here today, he comes tomorrow\". 3 days like this. Third day the \"manager\" finally showed up and, with rude manners and without removing his sunglasses, so that we couldn't see his eyes, he said we were stupid, because we even didnt know what we booked. When HE goes abroad and wants a reservation, first HE checks what he is going to pay for!!! I told him that he even doesn't know what is written on the web site of HIS hotel. He became so unpleasant that he made me think of a dangerous person you don't want to meet in a dark corner. Furthermore, some comments: BEACH. Forget to see what is advertised on the web: the beach does not exist, it is maybe 3-4 meters completely packed with sun umbrellas and so. You don't manage to see the see from your chair. The staff packs away umbrellas and stuff around 3 in the afternoon, whereas all othe beach bars are open until it gets dark. POOL: pool...or BATH TUB??? They could put some decorative fish inside. Tho persons lying can cover the length of the pool. BEACH BAR/RESTAURANT: one poor guy working, 5 others giving orders and making volgar x-ray-scanning to every female guest. FAIRNESS: hotel manager, bar manager and his scanning-assistants speak very badly about the guests in spanish to each other, convinced that they don't understand them, which is mainly the case. When I was discussing about breakfast, and I did it on purpose in English, the hotel manager said to the girl at the reception \"wait, I get rid of these two [----] idiots and then we will see if they still will have guts to ask for breakfast\".

They were very accommodating and the new room on the second floor was great. If you are looking for a resort atmosphere this isn't for you. It's rustic, but clean, with a basic kitchenette and small balcony. Its what we wanted and it was great for us. Couldn't ask for a better location as far as 5th avenue.

Once we rented a house in playacar, twice we've stayed in small hotels downtown. The other one we've stayed at is hotel lunata. Mimi del Mar was more or less what we expected... a simple, small hotel, right on the beach, between 4th and 2nd streets. (maybe 10 yards south of 4th.) It has a small pool that is nice looking, but don't expect to do any swimming.... hoping in to cool off is about all to expect. There is also an outdoor shower to rinse off when you come off the beach. The hotel/room was perfectly clean, safe, etc. We did have trouble with the hot water, but otherwise it was good. The balcony areas are somewhat small on most of the rooms, so if you do (as we did) go with another couple, it's a bit of a challenge to get 4 people on them. Also, i think all the rooms had an \"ocean view\", but many were pretty limited/obstructed. The i believe the 2 rooms that are really on the beach (2nd floor) i believe would be REALLY nice... looked big, really big outdoor area. Also, the TV only had like 2 channels in english... i don't remember if that's normal or not... The staff was ok, but really just there to check you in, clean your room, etc. Actually the person who checked us in didn't offer us a lock for our safe or remotes for the tv and air conditioner... When we stopped back in later the person offered them to us... An unexpected bonus was the small \"restaraunt\" in the hotel. I don't know if it's actually part of the hotel or a separate entity. Its mostly there to serve people on the beach drinks and simple food, but if you stopped by they would bring stuff over to your room. The same waiter was there every day, and was very friendy... The food was actually decent... As a comparison, hotel lunata had a much more helpful staff, was probably a bit nicer, and had simple coffee/pastries for breakfast. But, of course, not on the beach. ;)", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cBad start to a good vacation\u201d", "Author": "Travelgoddess7", "ReviewID": "UR4445510", "Content": "Upon my arrival at Cancun at 7:00am, I found out my luggage was lost. By the time I filled out the paperwork, all shuttles to Playa were gone and I had to take a taxi for $60.00. The bus station is in downtown Cancun and I would have to take a cab to the bus station to get the bus, and by this time I was delirious. The cab driver couldn't find the hotel - it is literally on the beach with no road access. I had to wait 5 hours for my hotel room. The front desk man, Efram, was very nice. He kept calling Mexicana for me to deliver my luggage which showed up the next evening, a day and a half later. I should have checked the accomodations of my room before paying the balance of the bill. My room was dark and shabby, overlooked a dirty construction site and had a broken window shade through which the construction workers could look. I was very uncomfortable and asked for coverage for the window which turned out to be a large beach towel. It looked terrible. The air conditioners were very loud. The kitchenette looked ok, but I didn't use it. Rooms were nicely cleaned everyday, around 4pm. Fantastic location, nice beach, nice people. Playa itself was a blast, although it rained almost every day and was rather chilly, both the air and the water. If I stay there again, I would definitely stay in one of the beachfront rooms which seemed much brighter. (I had a standard room. Not much for $90.00 per night) The hotel facade is very cute and passersby were taking pictures of it. You should definitely check out the room first before paying for it.
