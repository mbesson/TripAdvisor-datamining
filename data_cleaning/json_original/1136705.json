New Year there was great fun although we both were suffering from jet lag and our partners were betting on whether we would actually be awake to see in 2012!! You cannot say anything bad about the hotel, reception of staff was excellent, room was fantastic, the bar areas were lovely. It was so very expensive to eat and drink there though. We therefore did not have breakfast there as we didn't think that it would be value for money, we did drink in the bar but not too many times. We have stayed in some brilliant hotels around the world but never with this chain so it was a first for us all. We did have a problem with our \"do not disturb\" light on the door which meant that our room wasn't seerviced by the time we came back in the evening, but after we informed them of this, our room was cleaned straightaway and hotel manager said that they would check the fault. We also had a problem with the lighting system in that we couldn't switch on the side lights in the bathroom at night without switching on the whole room and there was nothing in the hotel services book to tell you how to operate them etc. We mentioned this on our critique when we got home and had an email back straightaway saying that they would attend to this aspect and thanked us for bringing it to their attention. I would most definitely recommend the hotel, but beware of the price of everything from the spa ($350 for a massage) to the bar and also the taxes that get added to your bill, nearly $90 on each days stay which meant that our room rates were nearly $700 and $600 respectively. The problem is that when you book a hotel in the States you always know that there will be additional taxes but not how much. We should also mention that it is in a great location on Boylston and within in easy walking distance of Fanueil Hall and Cheers etc. Overall we did not think that we had value for money despite how nice it was and how nice the staff were but if you are looking for somewhere special then I don't think you could find a nice place.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "BT1005", "ReviewID": "UR122653384", "Content": "I stay here about once a month.

Unfortunately for us, this time we were not able to get a room there booked and had to try something new. Mandarin Oriental is ranked #1 among Boston's hotels on TA, the location is perfect, the name of the hotel speaks for itself. However, our stay was a major disappointment. First, good things. Both restaurants there are very nice, the food and ambiance are great. I highly recommend them, since you don't have to stay at the hotel to try their food. Again, the location is super convenient, adjusted to the Prudential Center and withing walking distance to almost everything. But this is pretty much it. Now ugly stuff. It looks like they simply do not treat all their clients equally. First time I experienced that when I had my luxury mani/pedi at their spa. My therapist (her name was Brandie) was totally inattentive and kind of ignored me during the entire procedure. Well, I don't like super chatty therapists alright. However, why wouldn't she at least give a try to be nice and courteous with her first-time client? I paid $200 for my visit for God's sake, so I'm fully entitled to get the right attitude! The funniest thing is that they had another client at the salon at the same time. The lady was apparently their old client and a generous tipper, so both her therapist and Brandie were super friendly with her, talking to her only and laughing. I felt almost invisible and it was pretty much humiliating. Last thing I must say about my spa experience, it was definitely NOT my best mani/pedi. What I finally got for my fingers and toes, haven't cost $200 at all. Another odd thing about this hotel: they do not provide you with a key from minibar! When we called a concierge, he promised to get us one right up, however, we never got it. Fortunately we didn't really want to use minibar but still, it was a very weird thing. Overall, it seems that the staff there is not properly trained. They pretend they would do anything for you but in fact, you don't get what you paid for. For example, I dined in my room once. I was asked when they should have picked up the trail and dirty plates. I told them I was leaving around 9 pm. They said, ok, we'll clean everything up after you leave. However, when I was back to my room (10:30 pm) the trail was still in there. I called housekeeping and they assured me they would send someone upstairs right away. I left my room again and was back around 2 am. The trail was still there! Now I had to call them again and they finally cleaned everything up. But the ugliest thing happened after the check-out. Our flight back was at 8 pm, so we decided to leave our luggage at the hotel and pick it up on our way to the airport. We had 4 pieces of luggage. When we came back, it turned out they LOST two of our suitcases! We had a taxi waiting (which is not free, by the way) and a plane to catch. However, they couldn't find our luggage for a half an hour at least. A bellboy who was supposed to handle this, was extremely rude and unprofessional!!! Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name, so I can't complain to his supervisors. The front desk staff kept apologizing while their co-workers were looking for my luggage but they sounded irritated and didn't even make an eye contact with me. Finally they found our suitcases but it cost us a lot of stress. I thought they would at least offer to pay for my taxi (a half an hour of waiting!) but they didn't. It occurs to me they behaved the way they did because I look very young and am not pushy enough but too polite. Therefore I wasn't taken seriously. I supposed they would act differently should my husband be present there at that time. I find it totally unacceptable and unprofessional.

Suite was spacious with a flat screen tv in the living room as well as the bedroom. Technology for the lighting and drapery systems is great. Bed was unfortunately lumpy and too soft - ended up with a backache every morning. It appeared to be an old mattress - how this is possible in a 3 year old hotel I don't know - but the mattress corners were flattened when I pulled the sheets off to see what kind of mattress it was. And gross - there were old dried bloodstains on the mattress pad. Ugh. That's unacceptable in a hotel of this caliber. Hopefully they will replace the matress and the mattress pad with new ones immediately. Very generous array of amenities in the bathrooms. Room service food was very good for breakfast and lunch, and delivered promptly. We were on the 8th floor with a nice view. A/C unfortunately smells very stale - perhaps they did not spend the NECESSARY money to invest in having a top-of-the-line hospital grade/allergy system and filters for every floor, which is the only downside of this convenient centrally located hotel. They need to do something about this! They had an organic lavendar scent at night given at turndown - and even that did not help. Nor should it be necessary. The rooms should smell clean and fresh because the air is 100% oxygen, clean and fresh and completely recycled 8 times an hour. A hotel room smelling strongly for three days/nights like the recycled inside of a stuffy airplane is unpleasant. On the good side, they are also adjacent to a fabulous, enormous indoor upscale mall.

Our first experience was somewhat \"mixed\" so we were courious about this second stay but in the end never regreted the decision. We were fortunate to stay 7 nights during early May and really enjoyed our stay from the arrival until the departure. Since we are frequent visitors to Boston as well as New England we had stayed in almost all 4 and 5* hotels in Boston and I have to say that the Mandarin Oriental Boston is probably Boston\u00c2\u00b4s best hotel. The location on Boylston Street close to the Prudential Center and Mall as well as Newbury Street is absolute perfect. Especially during rainy or snowy weather. You will be able to exit the Hotel directly to the Mall without getting wet. During sunny weather all the nice shops and restaurants are only a stone throw away. Our favorite seafood-restaurant Atlantic Fish is right above the street from the Mandarin Oriental Boston so after dinner you literay just have to fall in your bed. Service at the MOBOS was at its best. We were always smiled at and greeted by name and everybody was super friendly and welcoming. We had booked the lowest room category or Lifestyle rooms on the 4th floor, but personally we liked this room much better the the Deluxe room category we previous had stayed in. Lifestyle rooms have a hardwood floor as well as a day bed below the window. Absolute fantastic rooms in terms of size, cleanliness and and equipment. Twice daily housekeeping made our room always look and feel like brand new. in regards of sleep quality I have to admit that I had the best sleep for weeks during this stay. Beds with Frette linen are like heaven and the sound proof windows guarantee almost no noise from busy Bolyston street. Really amazing are the Concierges Correy and David who were extremley helpfull with almost all reasonable and unreasonable requests.

Upon arriving, the doorman, John was chatting it up with a cabbie and didn't respond to my arrival until I was pulling my luggage our of the trunk. Maybe it was because I was driving a Nissan Murano rental versus a Mercedes 450. On check in I was offered evening tea delivered to the room, which I accepted. It never arrived. Had to call in-room dining. After gratuity was paid for bags, doorman handed cart off to bell staff to deliver to the room, requiring gratuity to be paid again. Felt like a conscious double dip on the tip. At about 10:45 pm I ordered a Turkey club with Avocado as described in the in-room dining menu. Sandwich arrived with no Avocado, and enough mayonnaise to take up the same space. Light switches in the room were wired to some sort of master making it very challenging to turn off all lights or to turn them on. Seemed a constant battle between wall switches and fixture switches to receive lighting levels desired. Should be dimmers for bedside lamps, but they are either on or off with no adjustment for brightness. The alarm clock was some little lightweight plastic gadget that would fall on it's side with the lightest touch. I could not determine how to change from 24-hour time to 12-hour time, so it remained 12 hours off the correct time for the duration of my stay. I used my cell phone for an alarm. The towels were about Sheraton quality. Nothing soft, rich and luxurious feeling like you'd find at St. Regis or Ritz. No coffee options in room whatsoever. I understand the upsell potential for F&B but sometimes you just want a cup w/o a 15 minute wait. Particularly important for early morning flights before the Starbucks is open. U stayed on the 4th floor, the Spa level with public access. This level requires no special access key for elevator, but my Ving-type room key would not seem to work in the hallway door between the elevator and the guest room. Usually after three careful insertion attempts the lock would finally open. Frustrating, inconvenient, particularly with shopping bags in tow. In the room there were not enough trash cans. One tiny one in the bathroom was all I could find. I did find the in-room dining hostess, Tracy, wonderful, upbeat and friendly. She should go work for the Ritz Carlton.

That evening when I took a shower I noticed the shower pressure was very weak. I asked if someone could take a look at the shower. Engineering came up right away. They recommended that we change our room since it will take a while to fix. We stopped by the front desk to check about moving our room and they wanted to put us in a smaller room on a lower floor. So we decided to stay in our original room since engineering made a temporary fix. Two days later the handle to our shower fell off in the shower while housekeeping was cleaning the room. Instead of having it fixed they simply left the handle on the bathroom counter. We had also gone out and purchased sparking water bottles for each of our bedsides. Housekeeping would take both bottles and put them up on the bar each day rather than leaving them on each side of the bed. So we would not know which bottle was who's.

The pretentious help told us that he liked a firm mattress himself, thanks for sharing! Then he said that they couldn't change all the beds and basically couldn't have cared less.

OMG... this is some bed! THE most comfy bed I have EVER been in. It is like a cloud. I must have told everyone about those beds, all week! I was lucky to have lunch in the restaurant, Asana. I ate light but started with the tomato/watermelon soup with crab and avocado puree. I'll admit I was a bit worried but it was really delicious... and a brave menu item! For dessert I was convinced to try the Egg White Island (I think that's the name) and it was truly different. A box made of soft, jiggly meringue filled with a tangy fresh banana shake.

Congratulations were offered at check in as I noted it was our honeymoon when making the reservation. I wish I had asked for an upgrade at checkin, but I forgot. We stayed at 3 hotels in Boston during our honeymoon and this was the only one we weren't offered an upgrade at. Hotel Marlowe and Nine Zero (both Kimptons) win in this regard. We were assigned room 508, a standard King room, were escorted to the elevator, and left to find the room ourselves. I was not bothered by the fact that we were not shown to the room. Initial impressions of the room were very good, but the more we were there, the less impressed we were...more on that in a minute. Within 5 minutes, our bags arrived and the bellhop showed us some features of the room. Another 3 minutes, another knock on the door. They brought up our complimentary beverages which were offered at checkin and some chocolate covered strawberries. How nice of them! We cleared out a space in the mini fridge and put them away for later. Now for the room itself: THE GOOD- Nice King sized bed with Frette linens, a sectional couch, large (~46\") Phillips HDTV (that actually had HD channels) above a large dresser, a separate desk area with stationary, notepad, scissors, paper clips, etc. The bathroom was phenomenal with a separate standup shower with rain shower head and handheld head, a separate toilet room, and a nice soaking tub with bath salts. Top notch hardware for the faucets and dimmer lights finished it off. THE SHORTCOMINGS- Upon closer inspection, there were several details that were lacking in these rooms, including: 1) the lack of doorstops for the doors. All it takes is one careless guests to open the bathroom door to fast and you've got a 4 inch hole in the drywall. The left closet door smashed into the door frame of the bedroom when it was 70% open, and judging by the marks and dents in the frame, I was not the first guest to discover this. 2) According to the website, each guest room has a walk-in closet. Now come on...no way ours could be considered such. Maybe if you removed all the hangers and ducked below the shelves someone could technically fit in there, but let's call an apple an apple. 3) To the left of the dresser in plain view against the wall were remnants of peanuts. We looked behind the dresser and were disgusted to find other trash and food bits behind there. 4) For only being 8 months old, the dresser furniture was somewhat misshapen. Both doors to the dresser were warped. The left one was difficult to close without some force because of clearance issues, and the right one when closed and touching at the bottom produced a half inch gap near the top. Strange for brand new furniture. 5) Dust had collected and gone uncleaned on the bathroom light fixture lamps. 6) Maybe it was operator error, but the lights in our room had three master switches, one near the door, and one on each side of the bed. Obviously this is so you don't have to go around turning off every lamp before bed...just crawl in and flip the switch. However, without the master switch on, the bathroom lights won't fire on either, thus you are left with a strange predicament should you have to go potty in the middle of the night...either fumble around the bathroom in the dark or blanket the whole room in 60 watt light. Luckily, this situation did not present itself during our one night stay. These issues may or may not be confined to room 508, but in any case this is not what one would expect from a luxury hotel. The next day we woke up early to get some breakfast at Asana (the MO's restaurant) which was included in the room rate. The included continental breakfast consisted of 4 pastries and cost $21. With tip it would have cost us over $50 if not included...Totally not worth it. At 10 o'clock my wife was scheduled for her two hour spa experience, which she enjoyed immensely. This was also included in the room package price. With the massage and breakfast costs added separately, the room basically costs us $10 for the night. In the spa, there are things called experience showers where you can select between four different experiences (rainforest thunderstorm, arctic blast, and two others) and the nozzles/heads output the water based on each setting. There are also lighting and sound effects. Interesting concept which I did not try out myself...opted for the demonstration only. About a month before checkin, I emailed the concierge regarding our upcoming stay. I inquired about using the house car to get from the Mandarin to the Nine Zero Hotel upon checkout. One thing I found out is that they are not very quick in responding to emails, at least the guy I was dealing with. You could usually count on a reply in three business days. He informed me that they normally don't reserve the car and it is on a first come basis, but they could make exception for the occasion. Fast forward to our actual stay when I went to double check that we had the car reserved. Imagine my surprise when the concierge tersely told me it was not reserved, nor do they reserve the car. I informed him that I had been in email contact with another concierge agent and was told otherwise. Anyways, it all worked out as the car was free for that time, but they really need to get on the same page. Once we were there, we used the concierge several times for various recommendations, and they were all a pleasure to deal with, so it seems like an isolated incident. Overall, in our situation and for the package price of $372 that we paid, it was a fantastic value when the massage with gratuity would have been over $300 anyways, but if I were just staying there on the rack-rate for room only, no way could I justify that when we stayed at the Nine Zero for $200 less. Service was great and friendly (save the one concierge), and the bellmen greeted us by name as we came and went, but all the other shortcomings would not justify the going rates here. If the massage and breakfast were not included, I would probably rate this review as a 3 star experience based on value alone. This was our first stay at a true 5-star hotel, and after this, I'm not rushing to come back.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cMO at its best!\u201d", "Author": "travluxery", "ReviewID": "UR27367373", "Content": "Perfect experience!

Great bathroom, great shower (how rare is that in a city hotel?). The staff was very polite and gracious. I was there for a meeting, the facilities were fine, comfortable, made for a nice meeting. The hotel bar and restaurant were good. The location was easy walking distance from Back Bay Amtrak station. I made dinner reservations at a local restaurant and got a free ride in a Mercedes sedan without asking for it. Highly recommended, I will certainly go back if given the opportunity.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookline, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMandarin is a Five Star Family Getaway\u201d", "Author": "BrooklineMama", "ReviewID": "UR22330689", "Content": "My husband and I checked into the Mandarin with our 4-month old infant for two nights during Thanksgiving weekend to be close to family staying nearby. We live in the area, so we are very familiar with Boston and all of the high-end accommodations here. Overall, I was very impressed. First of all, the hotel is really beautiful. Design-wise, it is not too distinctive - it feels like a luxury hotel - but they have all the amenities you'd expect and the finishes are top of the line. The room was elegant, but not exactly spacious. The bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom was gorgeous. We really appreciated that there were no pay-per-view movies - instead the hotel will bring you a Blu-ray DVD player and a list of DVDs to choose from - for free. Their selection was very current and diverse enough. The service was remarkable. Everyone was friendly, phone calls were answered promptly, and special requests were honored quickly. When we asked for our DVD player, an engineer was at our door within 5 minutes. While he was connecting the cables, the phone in our room rang - the operator was apologizing that it had taken the engineer so long to get to us. We had to laugh! The same attentiveness and speed applied to room service. The orders were filled quickly and arrived within 5 minutes of the promised time. Again, all special requests were handled perfectly. Most impressive was the hotel's attitude towards children. When we checked in, we found that our room had been completely childproofed ahead of our arrival. All outlets were covered and every sharp corner was padded with foam. The crib we had requested was waiting for us, with a box of baby amenities tucked inside, including diapers, wipes, soap, rubber duckies and a teddy bear. It was pretty amazing. I am so happy for families planning to travel to Boston that there is a new option in town. I love The Four Seasons hotel dearly - and they are similarly kid-friendly over there- but this is in a slightly different neighborhood, and the indoor connection to the shopping mecca contained within the Prudential Center and Copley Place makes this a perfect home base for exploring Boston during the colder months.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMore Hype than Substance\u201d", "Author": "Slotguy", "ReviewID": "UR21437402", "Content": "Having stayed at the Mandarin Oriental New York last year, I was interested enough in the new Boston property to book an overnight stay, even though we live in Greater Boston. Perhaps if I hadn't followed all the written articles about it, I would have had fewer expectations. Many things were nice - the greeting by valet and staff person in the lobby, the quickness of the guest elevators, and the overall quietness of the hotel. My disappointments are subjective, of course. The \"less than great\" experiences include: - Arriving to valet curbside, right on Boylston Street amid a multitude of pedestrians. For a property of this caliber, I think they missed a golden opportunity to begin the \"Mandarin Experience\" by not having a covered porte cochere, which would remove arriving patrons from the constant hustle of Boyston Street. Curbside valet? At these prices? - The room decor was nice but easily duplicated elsewhere in Boston and in many other large American cities. Routine, high-end finish materials, but clearly not distinctive. I could have been in at least 2 other Boston hotels, given the similarity of the rooms. Because the guest room views are of Boylston Street, I thought the interior design would be \"wow\", in order to make up for the so-so view of Boylston Street businesses. I don't think the Four Seasons has anything to worry about. All things being equal, (and the Mandarin and Four Seasons room rates are right on par with each other), the Four Seasons has it over the Mandarin by virtue of the Public Garden views & infinitely more elegant shops adjacent to it. Do I really want to spend $750.00-plus per night to look out at giant bridal shop display windows and a glowing Apple Store directly across from me?", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201c5 Star All The Way\u201d", "Author": "suzyjacuzzi", "ReviewID": "UR21047568", "Content": "First review! The Mandarin just opened up a few weeks ago and my husband and I were fortunate enough to spend 1 memorable Saturday night here to celebrate my birthday. This hotel is phenomenal in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone for a special occasion or romantic getaway! This is definitely the place to stay in Boston for pure indulgence and 5 star service. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous with unique artwork, subtle color hues, and beautiful orchids and plantings. The staff was friendly and efficient without being stuffy or uptight ~ this hotel group prides itself on customer service and it shows. The hotel is in a great location w/ tons of shops, restaurants and tourist attractions close by. The hotel has a brand new Mercedes Benz for guest transportation around the city. Our King room was extremely spacious and tastefully decorated. The room was much larger than a standard hotel room and was outfitted w/ a huge flat screen tv, wetbar, desk, couch and plenty of storage space. The bathroom was enormous with unique lighting, a separate water closet, spectacular rain shower and a very large soaking tub. The bathroom amenities spanned all the way from a nail kit to a loofah ~ the custom shampoo, body wash, conditioner, etc. was better than any hotel I have ever stayed at. Our room had a view overlooking Boylston Street and, to our surprise, was extremely quiet. The bed was amazingly comfortable with \"gourmet\" sheets and pillows. Turn down service included bottled water, soft music and slippers next to the bed. Staying here was definitely a treat and I envy the people who actually own the residences affiliated with the hotel! The M bar was good for a few (expensive drinks) ~ we did not eat at the restaurant but it was quite busy on a Saturday night. The health club was perfect for a quick workout and was complete w/ state of the art equipment and stretching machines. We were able to peek into the spa which is scheduled to open at the end of October - I'm sure a day at the spa is just as much as a hotel room! It looked incredible. This hotel is a nice addition to Boston! Book it - You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mandarin Oriental, Boston", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d1136705-Reviews-Mandarin_Oriental_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$445 - $695*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">776 Boylston St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02199</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1136705", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/38/83381504c2c9e97ade90cb3fd084a04d6large.jpg"}}
