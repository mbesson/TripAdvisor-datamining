The trip was a real bargain, it cost us about \u20ac180 for 3 days stay including flight tickets from Prague. The hotel is very conveniently located on Piazza Bologna with metro being only few steps from the hotel door. It gets three stops to get to Termini central hub, twenty minutes to reach Fontana di Trevi, half an hour to get to Vatican. Under the hotel there is a supermarket, what can be quite handy. San Giusto deserves its three stars, the only setback was the squeaking bed, it took a good concentration and carefully precise moves when turning on the bed not to wake the whole Rome in the middle of the night. Not even mentioning any other activities. The room we have occupied was small but neat and clean. It was extremely quiet, the only noise we heard during the three nights were our neighbours coming to their room through a corridor which was only once and no big deal. Even now, writing this review after the last night in the hotel, it's Monday morning and I can't hear a single sound. The breakfast is good, you get salami, mortadella, cheese, vegetables, fruits, two kinds of fruit juices, eggs, yoghurt and a few sweets to choose from. But it was rather cold in the breakfast room, so we had to wear sweaters for the breakfast. We were told by the receptionist that the check-out time is 09:30 which is quite soon for a hotel but I am not sure if this is their standard time of check-out or it was just set by the guy on the spot. Otherwise the staff was responsive, friendly and helpful.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Araraquara, SP", "Title": "\u201cI recomend\u201d", "Author": "Mariliava", "ReviewID": "UR122827584", "Content": "The hotel is very cosy, very big.

You have to turn a street and then find the hotel, but it it very near, only a bit dificult to find when you expect it to be facing the piazza. Despite all these the stay in this hotel was very agreable. Hot water, nice towels. The bed is a bit unconfortable, but nothing that will compromise your sleep.

We obviously complained, they offered us another room, but this was poor and looked very well used and mucky. So we said we would stay in the room if they fixed everything. We arrived Sunday by Wednesday still nothing fixed. We had a shrug and sarcastic comment from the male receptionist, who couldn't care less. Eventually we spoke to the female manager who fixed the shower herself, and the rest was done next day. Apart from the air conditioning. Two other couples moved out-because their rooms were aweful! Some further bad points- The Hotel is over a supermarket, they start work at 6am so lots of noise. Market trader sets up around 7am outside the entrance. Two beggers next to Hotel entrance every day. The walls in the corridors are all scuffed and need painting. Breakfast OK but boring. Coffee aweful unless you pay extra for freshly made. The owners need to sort out the problems and attitude.

Some things can be inconvenient to cope with. The lift does not begin on the ground floor - after lugging heavy suitcases up and down metro stairs, it was hard to do it yet again inside the hotel. The air con is operated by flipping a 'trip' switch on a wall panel. Not easy to work out! Metro Line B and bus number 62 take you right into Piazza Bologna (however, #62 does not call at Termini). We struggled to find the hotel, so here are some tips. The hotel is not actually on the Piazza, so don't look for it there! It is also not visibly signposted from the piazza as the San Giusto sign faces down the road away from the piazza. The best help I can give with directions is to say that the hotel is close to the gelateria, which is on the piazza. Go down the road off the piazza where you see the green sign indicating a supermarket as the hotel is right alongside that. If you see a sign for Hotel Laura, then you are one street too far along - go down the street parallel to that.

It is just steps from Metro line A, which runs directly to Termini station, the Colosseo and Circus Maximus. There is also a full-service supermarket (with a fantastic bakery and deli) just outside the hotel entrance, which was great for picking up snacks and bottled water. Now the bad stuff. The room was TINY and very difficult to move around in, and while it had an ensuite bathroom with shower, it took over 5 minutes for the shower water to warm up. The room did have a private air-conditioner, which worked well. The cable tv is all Italian tv stations, with the exception of CNN in English. There was a good-sized fridge in the room, with plenty of room for non-mini-bar items. The room was not very clean -- it had a musty smell and every day, the maid left the windows open to air out the room. We had problems at the very beginning with the Hotel San Giusto, which were sort-of fixed, but it was very frustrating. When I booked the room, I made sure to reserve a double-bed room. And my reservation stated on its face that it was a double bed room reservation. When I called to confirm, the hotel clerk said that it was a single twin bed room! After much arguing with the clerk, I thought it was resolved. Until I got there, and they told me that it was a 2 twin bed room, not the double bed room I had booked. Also, despite the fact that reservation states that check-in is at 1:00pm, they will not let you check-in until 2:30pm, which was a huge hassle. Every day there were guests in the lobby waiting to be able to check-in. The breakfast provided is plentiful, but average. They have bread, cold-cuts, cheese, sweet rolls, juice and coffee (often cold). Tables were often not re-set after earlier diners had eaten breakfast. While the location was convenient, I would not stay there again.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA very good budget hotel in a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "tony_orrell", "ReviewID": "UR114133850", "Content": "As frequent visitors to Rome, my wife and I have just returned from another trip having stayed at the San Giusto for the 3rd time. Our last stay was over 5 years ago and I must admit that having read some of the bad reviews on this site, I was concerned that the hotel had changed during that period. I need not have worried. We were also accompanied by our friends and when we arrived we were given two very comfortable rooms on the 4th floor. The rooms were clean and were cleaned daily. They had Air-Conditioning units and we kept our room at a very comfortable 21C throughout our 7-day stay whilst the Roman temperature soared to 32C by the end of the week. The double glazed French windows and the outside shutters kept the noise levels from the street to a minimum and therefore sleeping was not a problem. Some of the staff at the hotel can be a little curt and this may come across as being rude to some guests, however I personally think that this may just be a \"city phenomena\" which I have also experienced in Paris and in my own hometown, London. Having said that, there is a charming gentleman receptionist called Fabio who is was extremely helpful and very friendly to us. The San Giusto also provides a wonderful breakfast each day (from 7am to 10 am) in a clean and airy breakfast room. The lovely Signora who lays out the breakfast and makes tea and coffee for the guests, constantly replenishes any items that may have run out (even towards the end of service) She is another member of the team who is always polite and helpful to her guests. The breakfast buffet consists of cold meats; cheese; bread; yoghurt; eggs; cereal; fruit juice; fruit cocktail and the most wonderful cakes (cornetti). My only complaint about the hotel is that there is no lift until you reach the 1st floor. We were offered the services of a bell boy but we managed to carry our cases to the 1st floor as the stairs are not steep. The corridors were always very hot on our floor but there were windows that could be open if needed. When I return to Rome again I will have no hesitation in booking a stay at the San Giusto again. Piazza Bologna is a heavily populated area, as is Rome in general but it is a nicer than the area around Termini where there are many other hotels. P. Bologna has quite a few restaurants, pizzerias and cafes nearby, so there are never a shortage of places to eat. The metro is very handy for getting into the centre and there are many bus routes which pass through the area. (However both the metro and buses get very busy so personal security must be a priority at all times)", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malverne, New York", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel, nice and clean!\u201d", "Author": "ImraanK", "ReviewID": "UR112454296", "Content": "I stayed here for several nights while on a tour of Italy.

We made it to our room, which was clean but old and very dark. The bathroom was clean with a large window, I think it was the brighest room in the hotel, I didn't pay money to give the locals a peep show! The shower itself was super smallI and in order to get hot water you had to let it run 5-10 minutes. The drainage in the shower was not good, we needed to keep an eye on the water to ensure it would go over the divider. At times while showering we would have to shut off the water and let the water drain out, to put the shower on again. As far as the bed, it sunk into the middle and the A/C, we had no idea how to control it and how in the world could I forget about the Madonna over our bed. The following morning we woke up to enjoy the continental breakfast offered. I'll give them credit, it wasn't bad, they had cold cuts, cereal, fruits, etc..except that they seemed to serve the same thing day in and day out, ever heard of variation! How about eggs, pankcakes, waffles, etc.....Oh, and how could I forget the aroma of cigarettes, delightful early in the morning. Don't plan to sleep in and expect privacy in the hotel either. You can hear everything that goes on in the hallway and other rooms and if you haven't given your key to the front desk by a certain time in the morning the reception calls you constantly to find out when you'll be turning your key in to have the room cleaned. And if you are planning on staying in a bit later, expect an attendant to come knocking on your door needing to check the refrigerator for usage, who cares if your in bed in your PJ's! After a few days at the hotel, my husband and I realized that the cleaning crew were not changing our sheets, they were just making the bed. We tested our hypothesis by marking the pillowcase only to find the same case on the pillow everyday of our stay (We stayed 2 weeks). Our towels were also just re-hunged and re-folded. Unexpected Charges: You want them to hold your passport in the reception area, expect to pay. You need them to call a taxi, expect to pay. It seemed as if you needed any help from any one of the empoyees, expect to pay. As far as the location of the hotel, the metro was around the corner, a grocery store downstairs, there was a bank around the corner, a pharmacy was nereby, there were approximately 2 bars walking distance (one which stayed open late) and 2 great little restaurants nearby.

The exterior of the hotel looked shabby, but I didn't let that put me off ... and first impressions of our room were pretty good too. However, it soon became apparent that the window in the room had been opened prior to our arrival due to the fact that the room reeked of damp. The reason for this soon became clear when I took a shower - the cubicle doors didn't shut properly, so water flooded the bathroom floor and seeped into the carpet. I tried to open the wardrobe and the door fell off its hinges, and I then tried to open the dresser draw which collapsed! I have to say, we found it quite comical, it was a bit like Fawlty Towers. The last straw came when our electricity failed twice while we were getting ready to go out - we nearly missed our tour as a consequence. It's not all bad though - the room appeared clean and the bed was comfortable. The maids cleaned the room every day and changed any towels that we left on the floor. We also found the breakfast to be very good (continental - bread, cold meats, eggs, cereal, fruit etc). The mini bar drinks were priced quite cheaply. The location of the hotel is fine - just 10 mins on the tube to the Colosseum. Yes, the area it's in does have a lot of graffiti, but so does most of Rome. We had a fabulous time in Rome and didn't let the hotel ruin it for us. I would highly recommend the company Discover Rome Tours which has English speaking tour guides - their tours were informative but light hearted. All in all, I wouldn't recommend that you book a room in this hotel.

The metro is just around the corner, but you have to take it to get to the sites of rome, whcih means its hard to return to the hotel for a little break and then go out again. we were forced to take a $20 taxi home each night becasue the italian restaurants are open only very late for dinner (usually our dinner ended around 10 to 11 pm) and the metro closes early (although no one really could tell us when it closed). but at least the taxi's were easy to flag down and good for our lazy bones at the end of full walking days in cold december. most of the concierges were surly and less than helpful, but I blame mr. bush not the concierges. in fact we found the italians to have a general dislike for americans... not as friendly as I remember it on my last visit 7 years ago. one bit of general advice: the train from termini station back to the airport may be 1/2 hour on extraordinary days but it took us 2 hours from hotel door to airport door... which meant the check-in counter was closed by the time we got to the airport (we still had 1 whole hour till the scheduled take-off) and the italian agents were completely unwilling to provide any alternative options. no kidding, they told us we were 4 minutes late and we should know better, as they all walked off chatting with each other... I think maybe they were late for their own lunch. we ending up flying out to london, staying for a couple days till we could find a cheap flight back to NYC. all in all, i won't return to italy for awhile, no matter how spectacular the architecture is. but that said, Hotel San Giusto is clean and comfortable overall, and worth it if you get in in a package (discount) price.", "Date": "December 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for.......\u201d", "Author": "Pauline_H", "ReviewID": "UR4030177", "Content": "The hotel was OK - but I can't get more excited about it than that.

Having paid \u00a3160 for 3 nights in a twin room we weren't expecting too much and boy were we right !! We arrived at the San Giusto hotel at 1.00pm exhausted having been travelling since 5.00am and were very anxious to get checked into our room. We were greeted with a luke warm reception (not even a hello, welkommen or a bonjour) only to discover that we had been allocated a double room, as opposed to the twin room we had booked and paid for, well in advance. After going back to the reception and explaining this, we were begrudgingly given a twin room on the 3rd floor. We had to carry our own cases up two flights of stairs to the first floor where the lift was located (a bizarre set up if ever I saw one) and went up to the room. Inside, it did indeed have twin beds but these were seperated off by a filthy wall partition accompanied by damp peeling wallpaper and almost threadbare carpets. The room was very dark and there was also an unbearable smell lurking everywhere in the hotel. We lugged our cases back to the reception and explained that the room was totally unacceptable. We were then allocated another room on the 2nd floor (up we went again with our cases) to find that we had been given another double room. We trudged back to the reception for the third time and after looking at 4 different rooms in total, we decided to stick with the last one as it seemed to be the best kept out of the lot and even that wasn't great but we hoped to be spending as little time in the room/hotel as possible. The bathroom was small but clean, as was the bed linen. The air conditioning was a very dated unit on the wall which did eventually work but was programmed not to go below 20 degrees. The wallpaper was peeling and the carpet looked as though it had been fitted by a partially sighted donkey ! Deciding to leave the room within the first half an hour, we went and explored the area around the hotel. What an absolute --------, nothing but rubbish strewn streets and buildings and shops full of grafitti. There were a few small cafe's dotted about and a supermarket round the side of the hotel which actually seemed ok. Bologna metro station was about 50 metres away which was handy - but it was definitely a badly cared for area. During our 3 day stay we visited lots of the main sights (apart from St Peters and the Sistene chapel which was not open on Sundays) and endured one poor meal after the other. We tried eating in lots of different areas but found nothing that actually tasted traditional/authentic or even nice, for that matter. I expected to be sampling delicious breads, cheeses and olives etc but found nothing of the sort. The closest thing we got to this was a basket of dry stale bread with one of the meals. I even tried the italian antipasti which was a plate containing a cheese slice, 2 dried up slices of salami and only 2 olives on that weren't even pitted ! We found the ice creams to be ok but again, nothing like I expected considering we were in Italy. Feeling very disapponted with the hotel, the food and even the italians (who appeared impatient and often rude) we prepared for our departure home. The night before we left, we asked the attendant on reception at San Giusto if he would be kind enough to book us a taxi to Ciampino airport early the following morning. He agreed and said that as we needed to be at the airport for 8.00am (and that the journey would take no longer than 25 minutes) a pick up of 7.30am would be sufficient and that we could have breakfast in the restaurant room at 7.00am before the taxi arrived. We were happy enough with this and actually felt quite pleased that at least one member of the hotel had succeeded in being helpful - HOW WRONG WE WERE !!! We were up and out of our room at 7.00am on the dot and arrived in reception to hand our keys in and attempt the breakfast that we had missed the previous 2 days. It was a different attendant on reception and when we explained that we were going for breakfast like they suggested, the attendant told us that breakfast was not available until 7.30am on Sundays (which completely contradicted the other attendant from the night before). Feeling frustrated after debating with the attendant what we had been previously told, we had no choice but to sit and wait the remaining 30 minutes until 7.30am for the taxi (without breakfast). Of course, 30 minutes came and went and no taxi arrived and when it reached 7.40am we asked the attendant to call the taxi firm and check on it's whereabouts. The attendant did this and discovered that no such taxi had even been booked by the previous attendant. Confused, we asked what was going on and the attendant assured us that he had now booked one and that it would arrive within 15 minutes. At this point we decided to quickly go up to the breakfast room just for a drink and a roll. We went in for the first time to find the set up of the room to be quite inviting and saw that a lady was filling up the juice containers, but again, no acknowledgement or greeting. We looked along the food table where there was a choice of only 2 pastries (both sweet), a plate of salami, ham and a plate of cheese slices next to a basket of unhealthy looking boiled eggs. Giving the small selection of food a miss, we picked up a glass for some juice to discover that they were absolutely filthy. We went through 6 different glasses until we found one that looked like it had actually been washed, quickly had some juice and hurried back to the reception. With the taxi still on its way (by now it's 7.55am) and leaving our cases in reception, we decided to walk to the end of the road to the cash machines. We were back within 5 minutes and the reception attendant said he had cancelled our taxi. Absolutely furious, we asked why and he replied \"how am I supposed to know where you were going, if you are not here when the taxi arrives then we have to pay 50 euros\" I then said \"you can see our suitcases are here, we only went to the bank for a few minutes\" and he just ignorantly shrugged his shoulders. We were absolutey furious, but I decided that after staying in a complete dump, experiencing so many problems and being treated terribly, I knew standing there shouting and arguing would get us nowhere, so we had to grit our teeth and silently admit defeat. We snatched our cases and stomped out of the hotel mumbling obscenities along the way. We hurried towards the metro station in fear of missing our flight. However, despite the problems we had and the overall disappointment with the food and hotel, we were actually still glad we visited Rome. The sights were enjoyabe and the weather was gloriously hot. But as for staying in this pathetic apology for a 3 star hotel - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "saint louis", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't do it again!\u201d", "Author": "aschilson", "ReviewID": "UR3699179", "Content": "My sister and I used hotwire and got a reservation for this hotel June 10-13 and June 24.

The metro closes before midnight, so take late night taxi costs into consideration. Someone else recommended the restaurant Il Tunel (walkable) which was wonderful. Our first stay we had a hard time finding the hotel as it's not exactly in the piazza, but the locals were helpful. It's a real neighborhood with people selling things on the street and the ever present Rome graffiti. The reception lobby is nice enough, but another client was having issues with the reception when we arrived. There is no elevator at this level, but a charming bellboy brought our bags up. He took us to a room with one big bed. I'd requested 2 small beds and they switched us immediately. While settling in, the electricity went out in our room. The bellboy fixed it. It went out again. He fixed it again. He was friendly and we were all laughing, probably from jetlag, but this could be really annoying. After that, our stay was fine. Not luxurious by any means, hard bed, plain room... but nice breakfast and service. A solid bargain. Our second stay, we had a room reservation and 2 girlfriends had another room reservation. All confirmed and prepaid to hotwire. Well, on arrival we were told that they only had one room and me and my sister would be transferred to a hotel near termini, right where we'd just come from. My sister heard something about a water problem in part of the building, but I think they oversold the rooms. I STRONGLY emphasized to the manager that the four of us must be together on our last night in Italy since we'd flown from all over for this reunion. Eventually he talked the other hotel into taking all of us and they paid a taxi to take us there (realise we lost 2 or 3 valuable hours in Rome). At Hotel Fiamma the desk man from Belgium and his assistant that day were kind and tried their best to accomodate us, but my sister and I were given a room with one SMALL bed slightly bigger than a twin bed and our girlfriends were given a room without functioning air conditioning. We stayed out most of the night and left for the US very early the next day, but our friends ended up switching hotel rooms three times and said everyone, but the Belgian desk man, was terrible to them. If I had to do it over again, I'd avoid Hotwire because once you pay, not only can you not get your money back easily, you lose control and don't have bargaining power with your hotel.

Location: 3 stops away from Termini and only a few more away from Colleseo. (Colleseum). The hotel is just outside the BOLOGNA station, at Piazza Bologna. I agree with others, it can be a bit confusing, but look for the Banca Incantessa- it's down that street on your left side. There's quite a few flags hanging above the door. The hotel is NOT facing the Piazza, so take your time to walk around and look down each street if you happen to find yourself disoriented upon leaving the subway station. One reviewer wrote that there's a \"small\" grocery store next door- it's actually like a supermarket- like our Safeways, IGA, Loebs, Piggy Wiggly's or an A &P. Just down across the street is an \"American\" (that's what it's called) pastry and espresso shop. The desserts in there are amazing!

Safety deposit boxes All rooms cleaned daily In-room refridgerators Television- while mainly Italian channels, there was CNN and MTV Hot showers with good water pressure!

You can securely leave your bags at the hotel if you arrive early and can't check in, or if you have to check out, but aren't ready to take your bags with you. Tours with Green Line can be arranged for you at the hotel. Downside- there is an elevator, but only once you've walked up two flights of stairs. Not a problem for most, but if you have mobility issues, this may present a problem. May be a downfall for some- piazza is quiet, so if you're looking for a party or a rowdy bar, this area isn't for you. We had a great time here- we were in Rome...how can it not be great?

The Rooms in general are small but to be honest they are absolutley fine if your not planning to spend a lot of time in them, which we didn't!! They are also carpeted throughout, which is nice in winter. The single room had a comfortable bed and it was clean with a small bathroom including shower, sink, toilet.

As you go out of the main doors of the hotel turn right and walk about 1min and you will come to the tube station - like the ones in London - Buy your ticket from the machines - 16 euros gives you unlimed use for the week or just buy a daily ticket. You can be at the collesseum in 10 mins. If you arrive in the eve like we did accross the road from the Hotel is shop/cafe. It sells chocolate mainly but you can buy a good coffee, cakes and panini's - you can sit in and eat and the staff are friendly. On the whole its a good European hotel. If your looking for luxury don't stay there but it's a great location!! To be honest it's cost peanuts to stay there and it's perfect as a base camp. Plenty of breakfast if you like croissants. We would all stay there again..even my mother who is fussy!", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood location, below average rooms\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2945819", "Content": "The best thing about the hotel is that it is easily reachable. The metro station is around the corner which itself is only 3 stops from the main station. I give quite a lot of importance on the location because i do not want to walk 30 minutes to the hotel after all-day exhaustion. The rooms are below average for a 3-star. The worst thing was that our room was not very warm. Niether the heater nor the air-conditioner was working well. The water in the bathroom took a lot of time to warm up and the taps made strange musical sounds!! The size of the room was also a downer. Among the positive aspects, the room was equipped with a small fridge and hair dryer. The breakfast was quite fine. We found the staff to be quite friendly, unlike many other reviewers on this site. Next time if I go to Rome, I will book another hotel but at a similar location. However if anyone has already booked this one, I would recommend him to carry on.", "Date": "December 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, berkshire", "Title": "\u201cAvoid\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2879395", "Content": "3 Star? Your having a laugh. We were greeted upon arrival by the rudest person I have ever met who gave us no details on Breakfast, Check out times, fire exits, where the room was. He just shoved a key at us. So when we found the room it hadn't been cleaned at all. I stayed with the luggage in the room whilst my partner went back down to sort it out. Whilst I was waiting, I had a look around the room. The wallpaper was going mouldy, the bathroom was shabby, and bed was horrible. The second room we were given was no better. Our stay in Rome was brilliant, but nearly ruined by this place. We tried to be as friendly as possible but the staff in there were so rude, by the last day we were fed up and just started ignoring them.

The Hotel is basic, clean and perfect for doing Rome on a budget. The staff are exceptionally friendly, even putting up with my terrible Italian!!

(Weekly unlimited ticket is only 16 euro) There is also a fantastic restaurant just around the corner, and plenty of shops in the area.

The room was of a good size, although the shower in our bathroom was in a very small unit! The majority of staff had a very good standard of english and the breakfast was a good selection.
