It was about 10-15 minute walk to Las Ramblas, and not necessarily very well communicated with a close underground/bus stop, therefore do not choose this one if you do not like walking. I thought the area was nice, and I took my partner to a few restaurants that I had researched around the area that seemed really nice. And were really nice.

Part of the reason I selected Zenit was that it seemed close to the port and we were getting on a cruise ship the next day.

It is quite a walk to take the bus which takes you to La Rambla and the nearest metro is not near by any stretch of imagination. The hotel itself is efficiently managed. The people at the front desk during the daytime are pleasant and informative, though they are often too hard pressed to attend to you promptly. The rooms are clean, well-maintained and comfortable. Where the hotel really falls down is its air-conditioning system. Zenit seems to have some rule for turning off the air-conditioning halfway through the night. But this is not so bad as when the air-conditioning fails. Our last night (24 September) was particularly miserable because the air-conditioning was non-functional from the evening itself. When we complained about this problem in our room (No.405), we were informed the air-conditioning had failed for the entire fourth floor, that the night-staffer at the front desk was not an air-conditioning mechanic, that he did not know how to get hold of one and that, therefore, there was nothing he could do for an entire floorful of distraught residents. The weather was hot and opening the windows let in street and traffic noise. The hotel made no effort to change the room or give a rebate for this extremely uncomfortable experience.

The breakfast buffet was really good, it included cereal, fruit, Spanish meats, tortilla, bacon & eggs and some really nice pastries. The waiting staff where really nice and friendly, spoke excellent English and even attempted to help us with our Spanish which is a work in progress. The room was nicely decorated, very quiet and had excellent climate control. My only criticism would be that it was a little on the small side and I suspect that it was probably a room that was meant as a double for single use. It didn't matter that much though because we were hardly ever there. A previous guest reviewed that it was to far from the centre but we found the public transport that served the area to be really good even on Xmas and Boxing Day. Getting to the hotel from town, you can catch the number 14 bus from Catalunya square, just outside the El Corte Ingles. The bus stop is right outside the hotel. To go into the centre you can walk over two blocks to Calle de Calvet and catch the 14, this bus even goes down Las Ramblas, to Barceloneta and to the Cituadella Park. Alternatively there are two buses that travel town Calle de Muntaner. You can also walk up Santalo and catch the FGC to Catalunya Square.
