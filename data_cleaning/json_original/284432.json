BUT,we were really disappointed. The hotel looks cool,art gallery posters line the walls,clean rooms,lovely breakfast room,like a big sitting room at home! We were given one of the nicer rooms,as I has requested it. Our first night,after crashing into bed exhausted from walking all day in beautiful Rome,was terrible! There was a club right under the room,blaring loud,tacky music ,along with an MC...we complained, & complained,the police stopped the music twice & we finally slept after 2am! The following day we changed rooms to a TINY room on the other side of the hotel,but again were alarmed at the noise coming from the street,tram,traffic...so we didn't sleep well at all! I think it's a beautiful hotel,I enjoyed the art work & the general feel,BUT,if you want a quiet,calm,peaceful room,then this NOT for you!", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kensington, MD", "Title": "\u201cWonderful small hotel\u201d", "Author": "castone", "ReviewID": "UR31097045", "Content": "Don't be put off by the not-so-welcoming entrance to this hotel.

The public \"living room\" is large and comfortable, with a long table that's beautifully set every morning for the sumptuous continental breakfast. The rooms are good sized and charming, very comfortable. Throughout the hotel is a display of artwork that ranges from etchings to oil paintings to exhibit posters to funky sculptures.

Our group was made up of three families with young chiildren. While the hotel is definitely not built for children the staff at the Locanda have been excellent on both occasions we have stayed there. Helpful with storing bags and very good with restaurant recommendations. The breakfasts and cakes are fantastic. The place has a very homey feel, although on the first visit my heart fell at the entrance. However on the hotel floor the place is beautiful. My one quibble was more to do with the area . Over the past couple of years it has become quite run down and teh little park at the front is no longer as nice as it was. Still, the location is fantastic. One of my favorite hotels.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cRefreshing Surprise\u201d", "Author": "Iamuzak", "ReviewID": "UR5719514", "Content": "My wife and I were nerveous about this hotel. Our hotel in Florence booked it for us so we didn't know what to expect. We drove around in circles and couldn't seem to find the hotel. It had a tiny sign as it was in a residential building on the second floor. We were travelling with another couple and between the 4 of us we had a lot of luggage. There was no bellman, no valet and there is also no where in front of the hotel to park to unload. We had to block the small amount of traffic for a few minutes while we unpacked the car. All that said here's the surprise: -beyond the second floor door is a beautifully decorated, luxury hotel -excellent, refined, just-enough-help staff -fantastic breakfast buffet (fruit filled croisants & pastries) -large rooms (compared to the other rooms we stayed in Europe) -excellent water pressure and hot water -close to the Trastevere, Palantine Hill and the Coliseum -actual air conditioning (not a fan) -I should mention some people like 'a view'. I saw 2 rooms, niether had one. Overall we were very impressed with the attention to detail the hotel has, like small towels for your feet for the cold tile floor when you get out of bed, coffees and teas in the room, etc. We enjoyed our stay very much and the hospitality made us feel like it was our home away from home.

The staff was very helpful and informative. The breakfast served was a delight, especially the hand-squeezed blood orange juice. I found nothing wron in this hotel and would certainly go back again, as had many of the guests staying there. True, there is no fancy sign or doorman, but it is a wonderful surprise to go up the stairs and walk into a grand little oasis.
