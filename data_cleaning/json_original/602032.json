When you stepped into the bath dirty water squirted out. Upon complaining I was told the hotel was full and i would have to live with it!!!! The next day after a few raised voices I was moved and guess what?? the second appartment was in a worse state in that the main bathroom had lots of cracks covered with silicone in a poor way. I refused the appartment and was shown another unit and this too had bath tubs cracked in both bathrooms. I took the least bad one out of the three and the 5 of us would take turns in 1 bathroom to shower. We then fell victim to the European airspace closure due to the ash cloud. The hotel charged us double to extend our stay. This I reluctantly accepted as I had 3 yound children with us. The Air con then started leaking water badly through light fittings etc in the main bathroom. The reception staff seemed to think it a joke. After bitter complaining they sent a maintenance guy up (who I later saw cleaning roms!!) he advised me I had nothing to worry about and it was perfectly safe to have water dripping through light fittings after I informed him that I was an Engineer and this was definatly not safe he shrugged his shoulders and left. I gave up complaining at 03:00 am and decided to check out a few hours later and would rather have my family sleep at the airport rather than risk safety in an unsafe hotel.

'Families' across the road then Spinneys(my favourite!) and Choitrams just a 10/15 min away. I used the gym everyday and it had all the basics,two treadmills, a crosstrainer, two bikes, and basic weightlifting equipment. It was often empty but I was there in the summer so maybe that's why. Swimming pool was a bit on the small side, not for serious swimmers and it can get quite full, if you go during the day but I was thankful not to see it filled with concrete as some other reviews suggested! All the plug sockets are English but for some strange reason the hotel staff plug european plugs into English sockets, like the iron for example and there was a bit of a spark when you unplugged it. The only real issues I had with the place was my phone, it was faulty and would ring in the middle of the night for no reason, even after staff had fixed it several times also the cleaners didn't clean the rooms very well. But the location is good, and don't worry about taxi drivers not finding it, they don't seem to know most places! Plus all you need to do is pick up a hotel card and pay attention when you arrive. The hotel organises airport pick-up which is 75dhs, a taxi would cost you maybe 30 max. Internet costs 15dhs an hour or 300 for the month. The hotel itself is good, location,etc.. and the rooms are huge but the extras, e.g breakfast, internet, airport pick-up are expensive and best avoided. Oh here's a tip, the laundry guy comes at 9am every morning to ask if you need laundry done, if you want a lie-in, stick the do not disturb sign outside the door the night before to avoid being woken up!", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Midwest Hotel Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d602032-Reviews-Grand_Midwest_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai.html", "Price": "$57 - $172*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Behind Burjuman Shopping Mall, Bank Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">125616</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "602032", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/65/9d/659d33d9a34ad51e2d1d5f84dfd6cd1b6large.jpg"}}
