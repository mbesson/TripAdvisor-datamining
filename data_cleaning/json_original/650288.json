In my opinion, the BESTs of this hotel are location and service. It is located across the street a fine Plaza for shopping, eating, Starbucks, pharmacy, etc, AND only 1 block from a nice area of Paseo Reforma. Very safe and convinient location. During our stay, we needed extra towels and hairdryers, which were provided righ way from the hotel staff. We also ordered wine for room service and were perfectly serviced. We didn't want to wait the check-in time, so we left our lugage with the front office with no extra charge. Other words: service was excellent Continental breakfast was ok. I always expect a lot from breakfasts, this one was simply ok, nothing special. But they offer a menu with eggs and other typical foods if anyone wants. The room was small, with 2 matrimonial beds. Matrimonial doesn't mean queen or king sized, it's a smaller sized bed, not very comfortable for 2 people to sleep. We atayed at the 12th floor, and it was quiet and dark at night, and it had new appliances. Bathroom with few amenities available, but everything running perfectly. I'll definetly stay there again if I'm running a lower cost trip. If you want a more fine-tunned place, there's a Holiday Inn in that very same Shopping Plaza.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caracas, Venezuela", "Title": "\u201cGreat for 1 night stay\u201d", "Author": "EliteLevel", "ReviewID": "UR104897239", "Content": "If you are looking for a very short term Hotel at a great location where almost everything you may need is located at a walking distance then you might pick this hotel.

I found the hotel to be just fine, the room was pleasant, quiet, and with comfortable bed, good bathroom, and nice shower. Everything was spotlessly clean. The wireless internet worked fine, and the included breakfast was good - better than the Holiday Inn Express Reforma where I stayed a couple of weeks previously. The restaurant was open all day, but I did not eat any other meals there, since the area is full of good eating and drinking options. At more or less half the price of the HI Express, I consider this to be a much better deal, right around the corner. I used the City Express for a business event, and rented a meeting room for 2 days; the reservation was efficiently handled, and the room was ready and laid out as per my request. Overall, I was very happy with this hotel and would stay again without any doubt.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "M\u00e9xico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "YoungDiver", "ReviewID": "UR62006120", "Content": "If you go have to work around the area, this a great place to stay.
