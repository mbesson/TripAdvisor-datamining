What this means is tiny poky old dirty rooms smack bang on top of the square - not that gentle view that I was hoping for. And certainly not that lovely space and cleanliness I was expecting. There are stains on the sofa (if you'd call it that?) and the blinds. The airconditioning is noisy and doesn't work properly. I generally forgive these little things for the sake of a perfect location - but there is just too much compromise here. The staff were very rude, one of them didn't (refused to) speak English - again, never normally an issue particularly as I am a visitor in the country, but icing on the cake type of situation. My request to change rooms were met with glazed eyes and a swift \"no sorry nothing\". And for the price? Waooo, to be sure, this was not a cheap room at over 155EUR a night. Granted, I wasn't expecting 5 star luxury, or even close as I'd stayed there before, but I could've done without the stains, the rudeness, the noise and the pokiness. Again, please note, I was not expecting luxury here. I knew this was basic accomodation. But basic does not need to equal to being ripped off, dirty or uncomfortable. Sorry, this was gross!

The 'annex' is less than a one star hotel and will give you nightmares forever. The 'apartments' are strange. I tried to like them, but ultimately couldn't.

For instance, I live in New York and am baffled that people want to stay anywhere near Times Square...but it seems most tourists stay near there.

Before writing this review, I went back and re-read the other reviews, wondering if there was something I missed. I just didn't find this to be the fabulous little place so many other reviewers did. Maybe it was just bad luck on our part. The room itself is perfectly adequate in size, with 2 typical characteristics that we came to expect in Italy: small bathroom and terrible bed. It was similar in size to our hotel room in Florence. The difference that caused me to rate this 2 levels lower, however, was two-fold: 1) Our window faced the square behind the hotel. To say that this square is noisy in the evening is an understatement. Our first night there was Sat. night. Even with the windows shut tight, we were kept awake by the diners outside. We were finally able to fall asleep despite the noise, but were jarred awake by \"closing time\" some time after midnight. Sun night was not quite as bad, but it still kept us awake. If you're a light sleeper or need quiet to fall asleep, this isn't the place for you. 2) I don't think I'm a particularly picky person when it comes to bathrooms, as long as it's clean. What I can't abide is mildew. The cracks in the shower surround were covered in mildew, and there was mildew on spots on the surround wall itself. The tile in the shower had 2 holes where a rack had probably been located previously; the holes hadn't been caulked, and I kept thinking about the volume of mold that was likely behind those tiles. To cap it all off, the drain was seriously clogged, to the point where I was standing in water up to my ankles and had to turn off the shower every so often so as to not risk flooding the bathroom (even when taking quick showers). The bathroom alone really turned me off the place. I realize we should have brought the issues to their attention, but we were only there for 2 nights, and after 2 weeks of travel I wasn't up to trying to communicate \"mildew\" and \"backed up drain\" across languages. In retrospect, I really wish we'd booked someplace a bit more expensive but also a bit quieter.

The Tiny Guide. First of all, let me say that when you go, trade your incisors for a chance to stay in Trastevere. Trastevere sits just across the river (walking distance!) to many of the historic sites in town and at the Vatican, but it is not so close that you can smell the other tourists Pantene and Old Spice. We selected, after lots of research, the \"budget\" Hotel Trastevere. For \u20ac150 per night (Feb rates), we rented an apartment that technically sleeps 5, but would have been much better sleeping two. The whole affair is a three-story room, with two loft sleeping areas stacked on the main living space (and third sleeping area) In one corner is a modest kitchenette. The bathroom is up one flight of stairs. It sits RIGHT next to the second floor sleeping area. This was a bit of a problem, as the men I was traveling with (one in his 60s and one very spry in his 70s) had to get up during the night to go potty. The floor squeaked, the door banged. Not so good. OK. Enough whining: The tall windows featured a view of Piazza San Cosimato. In the piazza every morning but Sunday, you'll find a small, bustling open air market full of seasonal, regional produce, kitchen knick-knacks and flowers. From my noisy second floor twin bed, I had an amazing view of it in the morning. Hard to beat. A fridge! We had a fridge! Though last year, My friend and I took to storing our cheese out on the windowsill (we traveled in winter then as well) having a fridge was very handy for storing our delicious snacks. That said, an icebox is not essential. Snacks in Rome pretty much beat snacks everywhere else - pizza, oranges, pizza, prosciutto, pizza, cheese. You can't find this stuff at all hours, though, so fridge good. If we were a party of two, and no one had to a) sleep by the bathroom or b) make coffee while I was still sleeping, I would have noting negative to say. BEWARE PRISSY PEOPLE: The apartment is a little shabby, it's not the Ritz. I personally couldn't give a crap about ugly coverlets or tape on the showerhead. It's clean and the staff is very very helpful Trastevere is an amazing place to be, and so fun to come home to in the evenings. Don't bother with the breakfast in house.

We took a cab from Termini but the cabbie had trouble finding the hotel as the Trastevere area is a maze of little roads. So there we were dumped in the middle of one of the many cobbled streets. Thank god for my guidebook and map - the geek that I am! The hotel itself was as you would expect from a 2 star hotel - the entrance was simple and ancient - it would not have looked out of place 5 thousand years ago along with the Forum and the Colloseum. We were shown to our rooms and I have to say, I was very disappointed. The rooms looked much nicer on the website, and having stayed at a friend's apartment once in Italy I was looking forward to the traditional tiled or parquet floors and dark wood interiors of Italy. Instead it reminded me of the accommodation I stayed in once on a school trip to France when I was 12. The rooms were very basic - the bathroom was reasonably modern, but there were hardly any hangers in the \"wardrobe\" and we only had one TV channel the entire holiday. Yes, I know we're not there to watch telly but who doesn't like a bit of CNN or BBC World in the background when they're getting ready?! That aside, I can sleep anywhere so it wasn't an issue for me... unfortunately it was a different story for my boyfriend who was kept awake by the sound of revellers outside. Now we like to go out ourselves, but the sound of someone throwing up the contents of a good night out right outside your window doesn't quite have the same calming effect as lavendar. The next morning we were faced with breakfast - both my boyfriend and I are big fans of the \"hotel breakfast\". We love a big free buffet of hot and cold food that you stuff yourselves with and steal a couple of apples and pastries for the rest of the day (you didn't read it here). I had expected something very basic thanks to trip advisor, but my boyfriend had the shock of his life when faced with croissants and er, dry biscuits? Yes, this was our breakfast. Not even fruit, or yoghurt - the bog standard continental offer. Disappointed and unfufilled, we weakly embarked on our first full day in Rome.... OK, so far I have been complaining so here are some pros. The staff were very friendly but my boyfriend makes friends everywhere he goes so this isn't the best guage. The location of the hotel is in Trastevere, an area known for its restaurants which is why we chose to stay here. We like the idea of going out for a meal and drinks afterwards without the worry of getting a cab home. We met a couple whilst dining one night who were booked to stay in another hotel that was billed as being close to St. Peter's but was actually about 8 miles from anything central, including Trastevere. They had to cab it to and back every night. The price wasn't bad either - 95 euros per night for the room but you kinda get what you pay for i.e. basic accommodation. On our second day, we needed to get up early to visit the Vatican City. As we were slow in getting up, I remarked that we really only had 10 minutes to eat breakfast to which my boyfriend replied \" there isn't 10 minutes worth of breakfast to eat there\" and remained grumpy again for the rest of the day (men and their stomachs!). On our last day our lovely \"Roman Holiday\" was slightly marred by an incident. My boyfriend accidentally left his watch behind in the room when we were checking out - he thinks he left it on the bed. He only realised this when we were spending our last few hours exploring. When we went back to pick up our luggage in the afternoon, we asked if anyone had seen anything whilst cleaning up our room but the reception guy said nothing had been handed in. He was even kind enough to go upstairs and have a look around the room - new people had checked in so we weren't allowed to have a look. My boyfriend is convinced the cleaners took the watch, but there is no proof and I think it could have been anyone who had access during those 6 hours... Nonetheless, the hotel experience overall was fine and didn't affect our enjoyment of Rome. I would reccommend this hotel to budget travellers, and maybe groups of friends.

The rooms would not be considered luxurious by American standards, but they are comfortable, very clean and have everything you would need. Our room looked out onto the Piazza di Cosimato. Hotel staff spoke excellent English and were very pleasant and helpful with suggestions. The neighborhood is totally charming, filled with small shops and places to eat and explore. It was just a few minutes' walk to the Viale de Trastevere and a bus or tram could take you across the river. The Forum area was an easy walk across the river as well. We walked around a great deal fairly late at night and always felt totally safe. If you're looking for a good hotel at a very reasonable price, don't be afraid to try this one.

According to the email I received from Amandus Ludovisi of Hotel Trastevere, our room had a view of the interior courtyard. Look at my accompanying pictures if you want to see the REAL courtyard. There was also a motorcycle repair facility which seemed to be housed on the ground floor of this place. I opened one of the doors and you are immediately in the greasy repair shop complete with pinup calendars of nude women. The hotel had a \"smell\" about it, too. It was not disgusting, but it was NOT a clean smell by any means. I guess you get what you pay for in Rome. I knew that Hotel San Francesco in Trestavere was a bit more expensive and that's part of the reason I chose Hotel Trastevere. We did not stay for breakfast so I cannot comment on that. Also, Trastevere is not exactly a convenient place to stay, and it doesn't look much different than the other gritty parts of Rome. There is still grafitti everywhere and the Tiber River is just a muddy old polluted river. I can't imagine taking a dinner cruise down the Tiber...of all places. I guess the main point is that Hotel Trastevere is a decent 1 night stand sort of place. If you're going to spend any length of time at all I would vote for Hotel San Francesco. Actually if you are going to spend 3 or more days just rent an apartment in the Campo dei Fiori area like we did for our 1st 4 nights. Campo dei Fiori is MUCH more convenient to see sights than Trastevere.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3504426", "Content": "My son found me this hotel near where he was living in Trastevere.

The surrounding area can be noisy at night, but it's livliness and plentiful places to eat is part of what makes this part of Rome so desirable. It has an atmosphere not unlike Greenwich Village, NYC. I recommend buying snacks such as cheese and salami at the nearby Antica Caciara at Via S. Francesco a Ripa 140, run by Roberto and his wife. They will vacuum pack cheese to take home too. They speak no English, but pointing works. Dinner in the Jewish Ghetto at Da Giggetto is always a treat. It's a lovely walk to get there.
