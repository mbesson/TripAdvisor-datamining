I had been on a school trip to italy & france about 4 months prior to my stay at Salus, so I was fully aware that we wouldn't exactly be staying in 4 star property. However, hotel Salus was terrible! Not a single light in my room worked and closing the door was an incredible chore! everything looked dingy, I don't think I even laid on the bed. My sister (also on the trip) had a working light in her room at least, so my room mate and I doubled up in her room. Other then the added benefit of a light, it too was awful, missing pieces of the flooring, cigarette burns in the bedding and drapery etc. There was also absolutely no air conditioning, contrary to what other reviews say & the water ran from faucets at more of a dripping pace. I don't care how inexpensive the place was, it was terrible. I have never in my life been so glad to leave Rome... for the sole reason that it meant we were checking out of the hotel Salus!", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cIf you care about your health and safety do not go there!! it should be closed!\u201d", "Author": "Maria N", "ReviewID": "UR120507367", "Content": "I just can say that I was woke up by a drop of water falling on my face...it was raining during the night and the water was falling down the walls..it was all wet inside...there was a big puddle under the bed...Our floor was partialy closed and seemd that it was about to collapse...the roof..there was just something what used to be a roof in the past I think....the room was dirty...dust everywhere and a mould in the bathroom...I was afraid of touching anything..my friend got a seroius skin ilness after our stay there..I was not able to talk to the boss and neither to see the security and sanitary permisions .JUST NEVER GO THERE!!", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cDon`t go there!\u201d", "Author": "FrancyBudapest", "ReviewID": "UR71321342", "Content": "Luckily enough I had to stay only one night in this horrible hotel.

It all started from the front door of the hotel. The glass of the door was broken and left just like that. The person at the front desk told me that their printer didn't work and that she could also not accept credit card payment because the machine did not work. The didn't find our reservation because it was misplaced. The room that was assigned to us was incredible! My daughter bursted in tears when she saw where we were supposed to stay for 5 nights! Where should I start? 1) Lights did not work 2) The floor was broken. Entire pieces of wooden floor got off. 3) The window curtain was dirty and torn off. 4) No shower curtain 5) No place in the bathroom where to put towels 6) The walls were all dirty, broken 7) The bed cover had weird stains and holes 8) The electric system was inadequate. Wires were hanging there without any protection (Do not take your children to this hotel!!) 9) The was a large hole in the bathroom door. Somebody had probably kicked it. 10) There was no way to lock the bathroom door. 11) The window was broken and the stair in front of it was broken. 12) It started raining at some point and we heard a weird noise from the hallway. I took a look in the corridor and saw big plastic baskets on the floor full of water. There was rain coming in from the ceiling and the baskets were full of water. The water was flooding on the floor. 12) There was no remote control for the TV. The TV did not have a good picture. Could not enjoy TV programs at all. 13) The telephone line did not work 14) On the first day we got 4 towels, the next days only 3 15) We had to use our own toalett paper because they gave only two rolls during the whole week 16) The breakfast was ridiculous. Bad coffee, instant juice for my daughter, prefabricated buns that tasted like plastic. We only had once breakfast there and that was enough! 17) The walls of the breakfast room were covered by mould. 18) There was no restaurant in the hotel even if the web pages advertised one with fancy pictures. 19) The hotel was rated a 3 star hotel. I could not give it even one star. 20) The price for a double in this House of Horrors was 85 euros!!! The list could go on and on but I'll stop here. In a few words: Do not book yourself there!", "Date": "November 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201csalus di [--]\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4081708", "Content": "in september our school went on a study tour of italy, and our last stop was Rome. The day we moved from venice to rome was awful. we'd had terrible luck and couldnt get into the hotel we had originally booked, so our only option was to stay at the salus. we walked in the door and were given our room keys by a concierge who was hradly dressed appropriately and walked over to the elevator to get our massive suitcases up to our room. we waited at the elevator for 5 minutes waiting for it come back down, it was only just big enough to fit 2 people and after we got in and it wouldn t work the hotel manager came and started yelling at us for trying to use it. to get up to our room we had to go up 2 flights of stairs down and down a couple. we got into our room and my friends and i were afraid to touch anything. some girls found spiders in their beds, and others had raw sewrage coming out of the bottom of the shower when they flushed the toilet. the bathroom was dusguisting the shower curtain, once white, was completely covered in mould and you got an electric shock every time you turned on the shower. some of the girls were even lucky enough to get their own \"Death Pit\". The breakfas was awful and i highly recomend not dinking the coffee. luckily we only had to stay there 2 day before alternate accomadation was arranged, but we were all rejoycing the last time we walked out that door.", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cReview\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4081704", "Content": "this was the worst hotel we came across. the rooms were dirty, small, and had no lights. there was mould growing on the roof, there was only 1 light in the room and it didnt work, the bed had 3 legs and there were bugs in the sheets. the bathroom floor was level with the rest of the room (leaving the whole room flooded). the door did not lock, windows were broken and security shutters were not secure (to say the least)... the phone and tv didnt work and a 'continental' breakfast was bread.
