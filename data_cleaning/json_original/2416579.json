The place is really nice and is close to the airport and the subway. Greeted us very well and very quickly taken to a room. The room is quite big and clean, the bed soft and comfortable. One minus - no clock in the room (and not just in the room, anywhere in the hotel we did not see clock). Room cleaned very well (cleaned a very nice and attentive boy), have always been very clean, and felt that the hotel is new. In principle, we all were happy, the only thing that did not like it - it's very cold swimming pool (we could not swim in it) and a small area around it. Staff at the hotel very nice and polite. Very close to us reacted Maria (also helped us a lot that she was a Russian-speaking). We liked one bill boy (unfortunately we do not remember his name, his face was like the Chinese or Japanese), he was very attentive and smiling, when we were in the loby room, he brought us the juice, if we had a suitcase, he immediately carried it, when we check out, he ran and caught a taxi, reminded us about documents. Why not be said about the other boy (to mine, he was a Hindu), when he was asked something he did not understand and was not at all attentive. Very enjoyable surprise that we had free internet, we are a big help in business. Also, we had a free transfer to the beach, but the car which we were served with very poor air conditioning, and when we returned at 12 o'clock, it was very hot. Otherwise, we are all satisfied. If we have once again come to Dubai, perhaps again dwell in your hotel", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu dhabi", "Title": "\u201cMaria\u201d", "Author": "AbudhabiNabil", "ReviewID": "UR125533312", "Content": "Maria has been very helpful in assissting me and my family in our stay in Landmark Grand Hotel in Dubai.

Our room was really clean, spacious and well furnished so was the bathroom and everything. The lobby is not very big, but it has a warm and friendly atmosphere which gives you a feel of welcoming. The staff were all really polite and helpful and did their best to satisfy us. We really thank each and every one of them. Landmark grand hotel has a big restaurant which is as modern as the other sections of the hotel and they served us with a variety of the delicious food both for breakfast and for lunch & to be honest, they were really good looking & tasteful. There was just a minor point about the water warming system. There was a key on the wall that we should push for water to be warmed up before taking a shower and we did the job. But the problem was that it got cold again after about ten minutes while we were still taking the shower. Hope it will be solved soon, so I can call it a 5star hotel. :-) We did enjoy our stay in this hotel and will definitely come back again.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "Shima2012", "ReviewID": "UR125166348", "Content": "i stayed in Landmark Grand hotel with my friends for 4 days, the place is really nice, the rooms are neat and everything was arranged. the breakfast was very good. the location is great. we really enjoyed our stay. but unfortunately there was no pick up for Emirates airline", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman", "Title": "\u201cnew hotel.... good or bad?\u201d", "Author": "streetswalker", "ReviewID": "UR125128499", "Content": "stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon for 4 nights, you MUST take into consideration that this is a new hotel before booking.

We visited Dubai during the January shopping festival, the shopping was great but unfortunately it was very noisy at night, the windows did not keep out the noise from the fair ground. The food at the hotel was very good. There was a good selection to choose from and well presented. I used the hotel gym during my stay. The gym was well equipped and air conditioned and not at all busy which made a welcome change from my gym back at home. I would have liked to have used the hotel's pool a little more during our stay but unfortunately the pool and pool area were very small and very crowded. The staff helpfully pointed out we could use their other Landmark hotel pool area a short walk away. Overall I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay for a short city break.
