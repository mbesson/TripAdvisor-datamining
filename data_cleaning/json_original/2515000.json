First the Pros Great Customer Service Coupon for free pastry or small coffee with room price Free water Comfy beds Nice/Well stocked rooms Very close to campus The Cons First the room rates are based on occupancy and the 2nd night I stayed cost $40 more making the room probably one of the most expensive in champaign at $159 per night. The reason for this hike was obvious when a bus load of young girls occupied our entire floor. One major pitfall of the hotel is the rooms are paperthin. You can hear everything that happens in the hall. I could hear someone use a hair dryer all the way down the hall. The girls arrived at midnight waking us up and screaming and running down the halls until after 2am. With no intervention from hotel personnel. Also because I was paying $159 for that night, I cannot believe that school group paid $159 per room and made me feel I was paying a premium so they could get a discount. But that's my opinion and not necessarily true. A few annoying other things - the maid came by to try and clean our room before 830am and retried again at 9am. We left the room at 915 and when we returned at 230pm the room had not been serviced. Although I give them credit when we asked the front desk it was promptly cleaned. All the staff at the I-hotel were very nice and friendly. Last a personal pet peeve is that the door to the bathroom will not close completely. It is blocked by a border on the baseboards and so leaves about an inch gap between the door and wall. This makes it somewhat awkward especially if you're not staying with family/ same gender. Overall very nice hotel but maybe overpriced for room quality.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cThis can't be a Champaign hotel\u201d", "Author": "TheLoveys", "ReviewID": "UR127053469", "Content": "I had a choice of staying overnight in Champaign-Urbana or Bloomington, and because I wanted to spend the next day walking around my old stomping grounds as a U of I student, I decided to stay in C-U. As someone who stent 8 years living in C-U in the 80's, my hotel expectations were low. When I saw the tripadvisor ratings and a nice rate (it was the Saturday before the end of the spring break), I decided to give it a try with a reservation on the morning of my stay. To me, it was just an address to put into the GPS as my final destination, so I had no idea it would be south of Assembly Hall, very convenient for my next days walk around campus. Upon late arrival, the desk knew it was me (a pre-paid room on a slow night), and the desk help filled me in on all of my breakfast options (either free continental or 50% off at the adjoining restaurant), free water bottles, and the extensive list of fitness options. As I went to my room, I was SO impressed by this boutique hotel. A cool hotel, in my old town of Champaign? I almost wept, my little town is growing up! The hotel is modern and the rooms well designed. It felt a bit like the Hotel@MIT that I visited about a decade ago. Besides a wonderful sleep and a great bed, loved the shower products and the comfy robe. The design of the shower in the bathroom seemed unique, in that I don't remember often being able to see myself shower in the bathroom mirror, but it didn't bother me (I have bad uncorrected vision). The room closet has a safe, and I noticed a tote bag. Upon looking at the note, I discovered it was a complementary gift of the hotel. I logged off of the free wi-fi after getting the info for pizza places Garcia's (try a slice of Gutbuster) and Papa Del's (bought a couple frozen pizzas for the ride to Indy), I headed my car in the free parking, and there were Sunday News-Gazettes, Chicago Tribunes, and NY Times in the lobby. It was a great stay, and I checked out to see the campus that was so important in my development. Also, on the way home to Indy, I visited a little gem of a winery to the east, called Sleepy Creek.

The evening room service showed up and asked me to show him the dirty piece. After pulling both the duvet and duvet cover off of the bed, he replaced it with a duvet cover only. I asked him about returning the duvet, too. He didn't seem to understand that part. He also didn't know how to put a duvet cover on a duvet. I did it for him. He left and we went to bed.
