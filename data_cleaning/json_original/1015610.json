I've checked-in in behalf of my family and we were told to stay at another hotel (Fragrance - Classic) because the aircon needed a repair! We asked if we can be assisted for the transfer and the guy at the receptionist informed a lady employee (wearing only tight leggings and shirt) to help us.

It took about 20 minutes from Changi Airport to Balestier Road by taxi. You would find the hotel easily, because it's located in the main street. We had 2 rooms in the first floor. It's very small, and the bathroom also had limited space. You can only sleep and take a shower inside the room. What I like about this hotel is the cleanliness of the room and the friendly staff. When you leave the room on the morning, it was dirty and messy, but when you come back at night, it become clean like the first time you check-in. We had enough sleep quality, because the area is rather quite. The staff was very helpful. It's our first time to go to Singapore, so we asked many things about the street, food, or places to visit. They explained patiently with smile. Near the hotel is 7-11, Balestier Plaza, and also Balestier food market, where you can buy cheap food with good taste (about 3-5 SGD). It opens 24 hours, so don't forget to eat there when you stay in this hotel. There is no MRT station around the area, but the bus station is outside the hotel.

Super-small rooms. Claustrophobic. The world's worst-designed bathroom. In their goal to pack the most into the smallest place, they forgo normal bathroom planning and just crammed it all in. At least the toilets flush and you don't have to squat. The room has 1 bed and 2 nightstands but only 1 1/2 drawers. The cupboard you think might come in handy? It's the electrical panel for the room. Wet towel? Well, you've got three hooks on the wall. Anything else to hang up? Too bad. And the floor mat in front of the bathroom? Not sure when it was last cleaned, but I'm sure my feet got dirty stepping out of the shower. We had to ask to keep our old towels the next day so we had a clean place to wipe our feet before entering the room. Shower is directly next to toilet bowl -- cannot shower without toilet getting wet. No smoking in the hotel and with no window that opens, no way to cheat (So you have to wait for the world's slowest elevator to step outside.) Instead of bar soap, you get a liquid soap dispenser on the wall for your hair & body. Sheets were torn and not clean--had hairs on them. Pillow cases and sheets had some sort of industrial stain that will probably never come out. Bathroom had mildew along most caulk. The entry way is so cramped you cannot open the bathroom and the door to the room at the same time. No room for luggage. Pillows compress too much and if the hotel is full, no extra pillows available. Hotel not near anything worth seeing. It's close to a bus stop, but if you're taking the MRT to most destinations, the wait for the bus and the trip back and forth becomes tiresome. There are 24-hour food stalls 50 feet from the lobby, so that's very handy for eating anytime. If your world-compatible adapter doesn't fit in the outlet, ask for an outlet adapter. It's a $5 SGD refundable deposit. If you have USA-style plugs, you can plug in the top and bottom so you have 2 plugs for 1 adapter. There are tons of Fragrance Hotels. When reading reviews and booking, be sure which Fragrance it is. Hopefully your stay is short (in this hotel) and you only have overnight bags or backpacks because there is no room for anything else. This is by far the leanest accommodations in which I've ever stayed. If you like this area, look for the Value Hotel on Ballestier--it has better reviews.

I arrived to be told that they only had a reservation for my first night. I had written before hand to extend the reservation to 3 nights but they insisted there was no extended reservation and told me I'd have to leave the next day. They said - there were no rooms anywhere in the hotel. The next day in the morning - as I arrived late the night before- and was quite upset about this- I went to the internet cafe- to print out the extended reservation confirmation email and had I not done that I would have been on the hunt for a new hotel after flying 23 hours the next morning after I arrived. They were insistent that there was no such booking but as soon as I gave them the paper - all of a sudden they had a room! Thankfully, I kept the email! The room was sparse and the you hear exactly what is going on in the rooms next to you! I dont even want to describe - what I overheard even with a pillow over my head and ear plugs. I cant comment too highly on this hotel or the location but will say- Singapore is expensive and to be in the better areas/better hotels you will pay! So if you dont mind the confusing bus to get to the downtown core of Singapore- or the less than nice rooms or a possible mix up, then it might be alright for you. The hawker stall next door is cheap and good- and you may need to hit the internet cafe accross the street- as in my case - for the extension letter that I needed to prove in writing that I had booked even though- they confirmed my first nights stay. Less than friendly staff at the hotel, but does that really matter when you are traveling and staying in budget accommodation? You will need to decide.
