We were prepared for the worst as we walked into to the room but it wasn't too bad it wasn't spick and span but there was nothing really dirty. The bathroom was nice and clean. As for the breakfast... well it wasn't great but that was ok as we just ate some place else. If you are looking for somewhere cheap to stay for a few days and are not fussed about luxury stay here.

I can easily say it was the worst place I have ever been. The owner is the old guy from Afghanistan (I know many people from Afghanistan and I have nothing against them - they are usually kind and honest people) and he is a greedy, unkind, con man. He always books more rooms than he has available (in case someone won't come) and then when everyone is coming and there is no more rooms for arrivals, he just says something about electricity or leak problem in your room, and he will send you to another hotel (sometimes the hotel he will send you to is 20 minutes walk from Apollo Hotel, but the owner of Apollo Hotel won't provide you any cab). And believe me - it's not true when they tell you their card reader doesn't work - it works but everything that goes through card reader the owner has to put as his income and when you pay by cash it's never registered anywhere (try it and ask for the receipt when you pay by cash - they will just give some piece of paper with the handwritten price on it). For continental breakfast he buys the cheapest milk, juices (and mixes it with water of course), cornflakes, croissants, etc. And be careful with telephone calls from your room - if they can they will charge you hell lot more than they should.

I found this hotel and was told that the cost would be \u00c2\u00a3100. The other room that I had booked with the hotel across the road was only \u00c2\u00a365 so I was aware that what he was charging me was a rip off. However, I had an exam in London and needed to find a hotel quickly so I didn't really have enough time to shop around. Their card reader wasn't working so I went and withdrew the money form the nearby cash machine and came back. The sleezy guy at the desk then said it would now cost me \u00c2\u00a3120 because he'd just had a word with his manager. I wasn't happy but like I say, needed somewhere to stay. I handed over the money and was given a key. The guy on the desk was sleezy, unprofessionial and spoke English pretty poorly considering I suspect he probably had been living in England long enough. The hotel was really badly decorated and my room was on the fourth floor. As soon as I walked through the door, I just wanted to cry. The locks didn't work, bed linen was absolutely disguting, really dirty windows and the whole suite absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. Whilst I was up there, the telephone in the room rang and the guy at the desk now said that I needed to pay \u00c2\u00a3150 because his manager changed his mind. He said he would come and give me an invoice. By this point, I'd decided that it was just getting ridiculous and there was no way I was going to pay \u00c2\u00a3150 for one of the most disgusting rooms I've ever seen. I rang my mum to tell her what she was happening and she told me to leave. Whilst I was on the phone, the guy knocked on my door and gave me the invoice. I told him that I was just on the phone to my mum and didn't have the money on me so would have to go to the cash machine anyway. I told him that I'd go and get the money as soons as I'd finished speaking with my mum. He nodded his head and accepted this. However, after about 5 minutes, I got this weird feeling that he was still there so I opened the door and he'd been waiting outside my bedroom. I told him once again that there was no point in waiting because I'd have to go out and leave the hotel to get the money anyway so he might as well wait in reception. Once again, I carried on talking and found him outside my bedroom. As a young woman by herself, I didn't exactly relish the prospect of being on the fourth floor of a 70's style badly decorated sleezy hotel anyway but having a sleezy man wait outside my bedroom was just icing on the cake. I firmly told him to leave again and this time he listened. When I went downstairs and demanded my money back, he then said that I only had to pay \u00c2\u00a3120 which pretty much confirmed that he was ripping me off. Whilst waiting for him to give my \u00c2\u00a3120 back, I saw the way he dealt with an oldish Dutch couple and was disgusted at how rude, unprofessional and generally unhelpful he was with them. He was not patient with the obvious language barriers and was very unhelpful at explaining the underground system.

Every sightseeing place is a short distance from Apollo Hotel. Bayswater & Queensway are short walk from the hotel as is Hyde Park.\" The location is excellent as the above implies but the first seven words I'd have to disagree with.... The majority of the reviews you will have read are correct. The main benefit of staying here is the location and maybe if you got it at a dirt cheap rate. Whilst the towels and white linen were clean the top bedsheet was particularly manky, enough to make us not use it. The bathroom looked clean enough and was glad to see that the floors were laminate and not carpet as, judging by the carpet in the hallway, I wouldn't want to be walking barefoot! The mattresses were incredibly run down and springy and the general appearance of the walls and furniture was shabby. I think another review wrote that if they gave the place a lick of paint, changed the dirty curtains, got new beds and improved the breakfast (dubious quality in a dubious basement room where no-one smiles!), it would be more than adequate. I guess the fact it's full regularly means the owners don't see the point which is a pity as it could be a place worth staying.

Same thing goes for people walking up and down the stairs. When I stayed there, there were two groups of kids in the hotel. They were running up and down the stairs, congregating in the hallways etc. Groups of kids would gather in one room with the door open until all hours. The hotel staff was unable to control the noise and did not seem that concerned. I was told to address my concerns directly to the group leader. I was also told that I was just one person and they were 50 so that their needs took precedence over mine (meaning, the noise level was acceptable). One of the staff called my room after midnight to ask me if I had complained to the kids. He apparently thought this was an acceptable thing to do.

So, if you are not concerned about sleeping or are there on a week when in it quiet, it would be fine. However, if not, I would find another hotel. As well, the breakfast was terrible - buns and cereal. Nothing resembling meat, fruit/veg or dairy involved.

We had a two minute hop to get to the door from the train station where we were welcomed by a very nice man at reception who checked us in and took our bags (we had arrived very early and check in was at two) so we could walk around and soak in the surroundings of Bayswater. We paid only 400 Euro for our whole stay of 5 nights so we were delighted. We were at Hyde Park and beside two different underground lines and also on a 24 hour bus route (so no need for taxis). T This is not a 5 star hotel and it certainly does not have 5 star prices. For that location in the centre of London I really thought it was a mistake and we were going to be surprised by a larger bill at the end. The room was perfect for resting your head, not palatial surroundings but very clean and plenty of hot water (from one of the best showers I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been in) and towels and room cleaned every day. If you go here thinking you are going to get a 5 star treatment at 2 star prices in Bayswater/Hyde Park area you really need to think twice before you even go to London let alone this hotel. But if you want basic facilities and just looking for somewhere to rest your head this hotel is perfect.

So let's get started...the hotel is located in the Bayswater area of London. The location is great! The Apollo is beside 2 tube stations (Bayswater and Queensway) so it is very convenient. Leicester Square is less than 10 minutes away on the tube! The hotel itself is fairly unassuming from the outside. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who showed us to our room, which was in the basement. OK, the rooms are very basic. Ours was also ensuite. The decor is indeed a bit dated, but not dirty like some other reviewers found. The bathroom in our room was also basic, but functional. Towels were provided. I thought to myself...my God how fussy people are! Breakfast is also included. Very basic..cereal, bread, croissants, selection of jams etc., but we availed of it and it kept us going until lunch. So all in all we very happy with what we got for the price we paid. If you are looking for a romantic weekend or a weekend surprise for your Mum or Dad, then this is not the hotel for you.

On returning, we found our room to be small but adequate, with a double bed, wall-mounted TV, hot-water pot (with tea/coffee/creamer), desk, open closet (with 11 hangers, more than we usually find in most hotels!). The carpet was clearly new (the pile was so high, the inner door would rub against it!), there was fresh paint, and new tiles in the bathroom. There was only the tiniest of mildew above the shower knobs, some rust on the shower curtain rod (which was set too high, so the curtain was at the top of the tub, rather than setting inside), some dust behind the desk and radiator, and the furniture was a bit beat up, the elevator shaft was on the other side of the bathroom wall (we just kept the bathroom door closed at night), but these are minor concerns that did not detract from the rest. Sheets were clean, an extra coverlet was provided when asked for. As there are no wash cloths or hand towels, we asked for two extra bath towels and a bath mat towel, which were provided fresh each day from then on. Soap only in one pump bottle, which had to be brought over to the tub from the sink, no little bottles of shampoo and stuff, which is what we assumed for a budget hotel. Left a $10 deposit for a hair drier, returned upon our leaving. We preferred that they keep the keys when you go out; one less thing to worry about. A small hotel is nice because the clerk even knew which room key to hand us without us reminding him of our number! The room safe is large, and, though it does say it's 2 pounds per day, we were never asked or charged. We never needed the room's phone, and there were more than enough AC outlets. We never needed the radiator to be on, and opening the window provided fresh air without it getting too cold. Most guests seemed German or Dutch, and there were some student groups who were noisy and some of whom didn't follow the elevator maximum limit, which led to it being out of operation for part of one day; fortunately we only had to climb four flights once. Breakfast was OK, though mostly carbs, but that's continental breakfasts for you. We picked up some bananas locally to top our cereal. As a base, we couldn't have wanted better; buses on the corner (though road work made going to central London a bother; after one attempt, we stuck to the underground, which is rapid and goes everywhere), and a metro station two blocks west ,and many restaurants and convenience stores on that street.

I was staying in Apollo Hotel for 5 nights with my girlfriend. What we wanted was a cheap accomodation, since we are both university students (i.e. no much money), but still wanted to visit London. Well, I can say that it proved to be the best bargain we could make, in the low-budget hotels class. The room was painted green, the TV set was on the wall and not on a table, as I saw in one of the pictures here, the bathroom was nice, with a new equipment (at least, not that old as I saw in a photo here), with no fungus, or whatever another visitor saw. The only thing there, was that the faucet was full of dried salts from the water and the grid for the soap was bent due to rust. But these are minor details. In the overall, it was a nice room. There were one or two small holes on the bedsheet (teared points, actually), but they were all-white and clean. The cleaning ladies change the towels every day, lay the bed, sweep the carpet, clean the bathroom and the glass cups and the room smells fresh and clean when you enter it. The safe-deposit box is a little trap and you should pay attention to it: behind the door, the notice says that it is free of charge, but on the safe box there is a sticker with the instructions, along with the pricing \"2 pounds per day\". When we checked out, the receptionist asked us if we had used the safe box. Hopefully, we didn't. And we didn't pay anything more. Nor did we had any problems, concerning how much we payed the travel agent, etc., as a visitor reviews here. We were not even asked. The breakfast was really-really nice. Corn-flakes, fresh milk, orange juice, butter croissants, sometimes small round bread, butter and jam. And, once being served (actually, self-served) and having a seat, they ask you if you want coffee or tea. Really delicious, the breakfast. The \"moody receptionists\" that many here describe, did not seem moody to us at all. They were sometimes neutral (OK, what do you expect from them to do, when you give them your key, when going out?), never offensive or grumpy and caused no problem and no incovenience to us. Actually, one of them proved to be a humorist. Perfect located, between bayswater station (district/circle lines) and queensway station (centre line), the hotel location proved to be very functional, since we had access to three underground lines, all close to us. Also, there is nearby a bus stop nearby, which we used at night, when the Ungerground was closed, picking up bus N148 and went to Victoria railway station, taking afterwards the Gatwick express to Gatwick airport, to leave. The neighbourhood has also supermarkets, fast food restaurants, italian restaurants, oriental cuisine, greek cuisine, souvenir shops, etc. However, I said I consider myself just lucky. I don't believe, after all these bad reviews, that all the hotel's rooms are that nice. I just fell into an off-peak period.

The sheets looked gray & the room was dusty & a little musty. So I went back up to reception & told the chap that there was no way I was staying in that room & I wanted to talk to the manager/owner, of which he replied that he was, so I told him that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swing a cat in it, let alone get our luggage in there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he wanted to know what I meant, so I told him that room was too small & it was not what I had paid for, he told me that there where no more rooms available, so I asked him to find me another hotel, miraculously another key for another room was presented, to which we went off to inspect. Room number four was on the ground floor, it had two double beds & two single beds & I could close the window. The lino on the floor looked new, where as the other rooms had carpet which was a bit worse for wear, but the lino looked like it had been a DIY lay, very rough. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t game enough to drink out of the cups & glasses provided. The chest of drawers had knobs broken off, but the phone did work. The wardrobe had part of the back missing & it looked like whoever swept in there swept the rubbish from the floor under the chest of drawers, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone had swept from under the beds since the lino was laid. The bed boards above the beds had graffiti carved into them. All I could think of was that it was for only two nights. We had trouble trying to find the light switch for the light & fan for the bathroom, the chap from reception finally got off him bum to show us where the switch was, it was floor level behind a chair. The show curtain in the bathroom hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hung correctly, so we showered with the curtain open for the first bathing session of which there was some water on the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had four large towels in the room, but no foot mat for the bathroom, hence we used a towel each, one as a foot mat & one to mop up, we were replaced with two very small towels, more the size of hand towels, the towel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go around me length wise & I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a size 10 to 12, so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that I was a large person. Hence to say after getting our room sorted, it was too late to do the Jack the Ripper tour, & the tour that I wanted to do is only on a Sunday & Wednesday evenings, we arrived on the Sunday & flew home on the Tuesday evening, hence no Jack the Ripper tour - there were two things I really wanted to do in London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Jack the Ripper tour & Baker Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Baker Street I did, but no Ripper tour, so that has left a very sour taste & put on a damper on the only time we have ever been to London. This hotel is in a wonderful position, but it needs a lot of repairs & maintenance & the attitude problem of the chap we struck on reception needs to be addressed, there was a night receptionist chap who was quite pleasant, & another lass who was accommodating, but the first chap we struck, who also told me he was the manager/owner has absolutely no idea of what is expected by his guests, even Basil Fawlty could run rings around him. We stayed in a hostel in Edinburgh, it was wonderful & again it left the Apollo at Bayswater for dead. We wouldn't want anyone else to go through what we went through, time is precious especially when it is limited like ours was & to be mucked around like we were & to have your time wasted unnecessarily due to poor management is just not acceptable, and you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wish it upon anyone.

The pictures on here of disgusting bathrooms do not at all reflect the room we stayed in as ours was clean, and had a decent sized bathtub. When we arrived we were exhausted as it was the day after our wedding and we flew for about 10 hours total, however it was early and our room was not ready because check-in is not until 2pm. So we waited, wandered around the area and grabbed a bite to eat. When we returned to our hotel around 11:30 we were informed that our room was nearly ready and they were working on it specifically because we seemed worn out and someone was always at the desk for assistance at any time of day or night, excellent service. This was the type of service we experienced throughout our stay. Breakfast was basic as expected, croissants, cereal, coffee, and juice was about all they had. This was enough to get your day sstarted though. The area we were in, Bayswater, seems to be a little pricey compared to others so you may want to venture off, however EVERYTHING on London is insanely expensive. There was a nice mall, Whiteleys, just aroud the corner and plenty of shops and such all along. Overall I would suggest this hotel and would stay there again if price was a concern. We had a great experience and enjoyed our honeymoon at the Apollo. P.S. If you come into Gatwick I advise taking the Gatwick Express to the Victoria Station and then taking a cab to the hotel or the underground to the Queensway Station and then walking around the corner. A cab cost about 12 pounds and the subway cost about 10.20 pound for a day pass in Zone 1 and 2. Most things in the area with the exception of a pub around the corner close around 9pm. So if you get in late and are hungry, Red Planet Pizza delivers for free until 1am and was AMAZING. Ask at the desk and they will provide you the phone number.

Unfortunately, I didn't discover the Trip Advisor reviews until a week or so before our departure and when I read the awful reviews, I tried to get our stay changed, but to no avail (it was Easter weekend and everything was booked). So we went there expecting it to be pretty bad and just figured it would be part of our \"European experience\". We arrived at the hotel after a 10 hour flight from San Francisco at 8 a.m. - we were exhausted and were hoping that we could just get an early check in. The fellow at the front desk, once he got off the phone, smirked and said that there was no way we could get in before check in time at 2 p.m. He also informed us that, instead of 2 rooms that we had ordered, they only had one for us and they could put extra cots in the room so all four of us could stay together (we were travelling with our two teenage daughters). He took our baggage which he stuffed behind the reception counter and, when we asked where we might get some breakfast, gave us very vague directions to a place a block and half away. We wandered, bleary eyed, around London for a couple of hours, trying to get ahold of Virgin Vacations to find out what happened about our rooms, and then walked from hotel to hotel trying to find another room (no luck). We ended up back at the hotel where another man told us that he would be able to put us in two rooms for the night, but the next nights we would have to stay in one room. About a half hour later, he suddenly told us that he would be booking us in another hotel (the Queens Park down the street) for the remainder of our trip. No explanation, but it was clear that the Apollo had screwed up. It was a total blessing for us! When we finally got into the rooms, at first, I thought, this isn't too bad. The rooms were crammed with 4 beds (they apparently had a big student group coming the next day), but we were so tired that we were easily able to be comfortable and fall asleep. But we soon noticed the stained walls, scratchy sheets, tea kettle that didn't reach the one plug in the room (to heat water, I had to put the kettle on the floor). You had to step over piles of laundry in the hall ways. And then we found fleas! The bathroom was so small - the sink was the tiniest thing I'd ever seen - you could barely get your hands under the faucet to wash them. And the shower - o my goodness! It was a tiny square of tile surrounded by a vinyl shower curtain that sticks to your body if you turn around. Not all of the bathrooms are like that - our daughters had a full bathtub. The breakfast in the basement was so bad it was funny - and everyone there seemed in a bad mood. We were thrilled to be getting out of there and into a nicer place. I echo other reviewers who wondered how this place keeps its license. I also wonder why it would be included as part of Virgin Vacations package - that can't be good for their reputation!", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cThis must be the worst in London\u201d", "Author": "ShelleyJoWendy", "ReviewID": "UR7189388", "Content": "This hotel caters to groups of students and they treat them like dirt.

The layout is a bit bizarre, and I had to walk up 5 flights of steps to walk back down 2 flights to arrive at my room. Annoying, yes, but fortunately there was a bell hop who brought my bags up for me. The location was agreeable, I thought, for my purposes ... just across the way from the beautiful Hyde park and walking distance to Kensington Palace (and The Orangery, which is divine for afternoon tea). It was further away from the big attractions in London, though I didn't mind the bus / underground rides them ... again, really not that bad.

We were moved to this hotel after the hotel we booked supposedly had a water leak. Have I read that somewhere before?? This seems to be a common thing from reading reviews on tripadvisor. We had to wait before being able to check in since they had to replace the toilet. Yet more inconvenience after having been moved once already. I can put up with a budget hotel (in fact I expected this to be budget), I can put up with dated hotels, old fixtures and fittings and even somewhere that needs a lick of paint...but....there is NO excuse for poor cleanliness. Unfortunately the room was mucky. The curtains looked as though they had been dragged up and down a chimney. The walls were scuffed and covered in mucky marks - not just a bit - but a lot, in fact just about every bit of the wall! Parts of the wall appeared to have some sort of liquid (don't know what??) splashed on them. The beading around the poorly fitted laminate flooring had lifted and was filthy - loads of old fluff underneath it. The bed was uncomfortable and very lumpy. The sheets appeared to be clean but the blankets seemed quite old and had a fusty smell. The bedside cabinet had some dodgy looking mains wiring in it - i'm not a qualified electrician so I couldn't say wether or not it was safe - but it's not what you expect next to your bed. The door into the room was a flimsy internal door and had a massive gap underneath it. Now I'm a big, strong northerner (well over 6ft and about 18 stone) - the sort that can look after himself, but sometimes even I feel a bit uneasy - sleeping in this hotel was one of those times. After handing the room key into the reception when we went out, we returned to the hotel late at night to find our room keys left on the reception counter since there was no-one on the desk. The main front door was left unlocked so anyone could have walked in, picked them up and let themselves into our room! London was incredibly busy this particular weekend and everywhere else was completely booked up. Had there been anywhere else to stay I would definately have left the Apollo but with arrangements made and no time left after all the messing around we were forced to sleep in this, well, one can only describe it as a hostel. I'm a fair bloke so what can I say that's good about this place?? Well, the bathroom did seem to be clean and the continental breakfast was reasonablly good. The location for central London was good. As an ex sales rep I've stayed in a few hotels and I have to say this has been the worst I've ever stayed in. My advice is to stick to a travel lodge - even if it means travelling a little bit further to get into the city - at least you know what you're gonna get for your money - don't book the Apollo!!!", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "Ragan_Dragon", "ReviewID": "UR6457268", "Content": "London is a VERY expensive city so every dollar you can save, you SHOULD!!!

Apollo staff do leave much to be desired as do the breakfast but my fiance and I were absolutely delighted not only on the location but also the amount of money we saved staying here so that we could spend our money on more important things.
