Only around 20-30 rooms we saw two and they were both lovely. We didn't need to give our name when we arrived because we were expected! Lovely staff but the big thing is this is two stories and feels like a courtyard with small swimming pools that are surrounded by white washed walls and classy loungers. Lovely gardens. We didn't dine in the evening but lunch was lovely both days and continental breakfast. The sign outside the hotel is hardly there at all, which speaks volumes, understated which is somehting Dubai does not really do. A real focus on art for art lovers, a couple of painters were there when we stayed and there is an art gallery too. Loved it! Not licenced, we bought wine for the room in the airport. Friends who live in Dubai couldn't believe it existed.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston", "Title": "\u201cOnly boutique hotel in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "IrvineUnitedKingdom", "ReviewID": "UR48541561", "Content": "Classy and individual (French/Morrocan style) hotel located in a very pleasant and peaceful residential area of Jumeirah away from of the hustle and bustle of the main hotel chains.

We\u2019ve been to Dubai a few times but we\u2019ve hit the \"kids who are 12 count as adults\" problem which means we can't stay as a family in one room. This makes the likes of JBH very expensive (i.e. two rooms or a junior suite). At La Maison we had a HUGE two bedroom suite in one of four villas. The main bedroom had a large king size bed and the second room had two double beds. Bathroom was also huge and there was lots of wardrobe space (although not enough draw space) and a fridge/mini bar. The whole hotel is beautifully furnished and there was lots of artwork on display and for sale. All this for roughly the same as you would pay for a double room at one of the big hotels. The hotel is in Jumeirah 1, very close to the Mercato Mall and within easy reach of many shops and eateries. We hired a car (for the first time in Dubai). Parking near the hotel was never a problem. I believe taxis can sometimes struggle to find such a small location, especially as the numbering of roads in Dubai is something of a mysterious and random art, but being so close to Mercato gives a good landmark to aim for! The hotel provides a basic but adequate breakfast for an additional charge (60Dhs for adults and 30Dhs for children, but you pay extra if you have 'posh coffee' like a cappuccino). We can highly recommend Carpe Diem cafe in the Old Town Mall (next door to Mercato) as an alternative for breakfast. We ate dinner on the hotel terrace one evening; food was very good and the setting was perfect for a relaxed family dinner with friends on a warm October evening (service was a little on the slow slide but that is a minor gripe). There are two small pools with 7 or 8 very comfortable sunbeds around each, shaded by umbrellas and plants. By about 3 o'clock the sun had disappeared behind the buildings (this was in October). We never had a problem finding somewhere to relax (no towels at dawn needed here) and the kids were happy splashing about in what seemed like our own private pool most of the time. The staff were all friendly and unobtrusive and were responsive to the few requests we made (extra towels and things like that). The proprietors were equally charming and welcoming. Emails and queries prior to our arrival were always answered promptly. There are a couple of \u2018little things\u2019 to be aware of. First of all, the hotel does not take credit cards so you need to arrange payment ahead of time or pay cash. There was a minor inconvenience to arrange international money transfer, but it was worth it. Secondly, the hotel is right next door to a mosque which came as a bit of a nasty surprise on our first morning a 5am! But after a couple of days the kids were sleeping through it and somehow it added to the charm of the whole experience. Finally the hotel does not have an alcohol licence, so bring along the duty free and keep it in your room for that pre-dinner drinkie. If you want a quieter side to the Dubai experience and you don\u2019t need the \u2018full resort\u2019 facilities then La Maison D\u2019Hotes is a hidden gem of peace and tranquillity and good value for money. We loved it and can highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northumberland", "Title": "\u201cAway from the madding crowds....\u201d", "Author": "teens2006", "ReviewID": "UR21504874", "Content": "Several villas combined to make this a little gem in Jumeirah1. It's in a residential district, so you can walk to - Mercato Mall with a Spinneys supermarket; Fudo restaurant next to Mercato; and the beach. Breakfast or dinner under the awning outside is a pleasure, there has been a lot of thought and care put into detail, both with the food and the interior design, and the little touches evident everywhere, inside and out. 2 lovely pools, you can choose shade or sun to suit. We had 2 rooms (one double, one with two single beds for teenagers to share), both differently designed, with individual features. Access to internet is availabe at no extra cost. Yes, it is a drag to have to transfer money, or work out the exact amount of cash you need at the end of your stay.

They laughed! But we found this place, and it worked well - not ideal, but it worked well. First, the location's good - my geography's not good, but we rarely got stuck in traffic and could always get a taxi, and I understand that's not typical for Dubai. Second, it's a beautiful property (I suspect it's 4 villas put together) and the rooms are large and although simple are tastefully decorated. Third, the food is off-the-scale super, as you'd expect from the (all-girl) French management. Four, it's within strolling distance of a very pleasant public beach. Five, the internet works, and it's on LAN not wi-fi so it's reliable and fairly fast. Finally, it's much less expensive than the gin-palaces around Dubai. The negatives? They don't [--] well take credit cards, so you have to wire money ahead, or pay with wads of cash. Unbelievable in the 21st century! There's no tea/coffee facilities in the room, which I consider almost a basic human right for a hotel-dweller. And you need to pick your room carefully - the first one we were offered had a view of a brick wall (I complained, and the staff, with a little moaning, found us another with a tree between the window and the brick wall), and some don't have internet connections. The staff were generally friendly and helpful, but could be a bit dopey - food service in the restaurant ranged from fast to painfully slow, and the check-in staff were clueless about how on earth to get money into the hotel's account. So it's not perfect, but pretty good, and unlike most of this armpit of a wannabe city, it has character, charm, and a human touch.
