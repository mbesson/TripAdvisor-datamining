The weather was perfect which always helps. The first decision at the airport was waterbus or water taxi, we chose the waterbus which was cheaper and slower. On reflection we should have entered Venice on a water taxi, as we could have gone down the Grand Canal and returned on the waterbus. The Hotel is right opposite the waterbus stop so no lugging on suitcases. The hotel fronts the canal at the start of the Grand Canal and is only 5 minute leisurely walk from St Marks Square. We were welcomed by attentive staff and shown to our standard room, the deal did not include a canal view, although you could see it if you hung out the window! We selected the half board option which was one way to control the cost of eating out but in hindsight it was a bit unnecessary. Our room was very well appointed with a lovely bathroom, comfortable bed and a safe. Hotel breakfast was excellent and one day we swopped dinner for lunch and sat outside overlooking the water, superb. The hotel is a great place to explore from (and easy o find if lost!). Only downside was that the hotel did not have its own bar so any nightcap had to be taken in one of the hundreds of bars close by.

I booked this hotel for my honeymoon, and did so last minute. As a travel agent, I have sent many people here, so when my tour package got canceled at the last minute, I booked here. The price was amazing, $150 per night with breakfast for a run of house room, and right before we arrived, the flooding cleared, and we were psyched to see our that this hotel was in the best position! When we arrived, the lobby was lovely. The man at the front desk was a little put offish, but we were excited to finally be in our last honeymoon stay in Venice, so no big. The problem was when we got to our room. The room was surprisingly spacious but sparsely appointed, and the bathroom seemed renovated. I went to the window to open the curtains, only to find scaffolding and four workmen, one of whom waved to me. They workman then proceeded to hammer, bang, and generally work. Did I mention this was the last stay on our honeymoon where we were going to relax in room before going home? There was NO WAY. I called the front desk, and the surly man there explained to me that they would only be doing this for the next hour. I told him I didn't care, I want to move. 45 minutes later, a nicer guy came to help us move to the next place. The front desk man was there the next three days, giving us looks every time we walked by. The one time we wanted to ask a question about where to eat, he picked up the phone and stayed on it for over 10 minutes, until we finally walked away. The line about the construction only being the next hour was a total lie, and continued through the rest of our stay, starting at about 8am. So why still such a high review? First, we were in the super low season, and I would have been surprised if there was more than 15 rooms filled, and the construction was pretty minor. Plus, the price that I paid was super low, and the room type was \"run of house\" which means you could get anything. And they did move us. The breakfast was HANDS DOWN the best part of our stay. It was incredible, with everything you could possibly want, and their restaurant was VERY impressive. I also had positive experiences with all other staffers EXCEPT the front desk guy, so I am not going to let one stinker say it was horrible. The bed was ok, not super comfortable, and my sleep quality was impacted by the morning noise and the just ok bed quality. Had it been no noise or construction, I would have been satisfied.

Yes, but I would specify at check in that I wanted a quiet room.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOverlooking the Riva degli schiavoni in Venice !\u201d", "Author": "giorgiadettoni", "ReviewID": "UR123669768", "Content": "Great hotel with an impeccable location, once you arrive via vaporetto you are at your hotel!!

Would recommend this method to get to hotel, dont bother booking a more expensive prebookable \"Meet and Greet\" type taxi is just isnt worth it. Helpful Hints - there was a hairdryer in the room at the hotel so dont bother to take one, buy a \"pass\" for your water bus rides otherwise one journey is 6.50 euros for a single journey regardless of length, expensive if only going a couple of stops.

Ideally a hotel should be located with transportation of luggage in mind, be comfortable as well as have a general location in proximity to places of interest. The Hotel Savoia & Jolanda meets these criteria. We selected it after reading previous reviews on Tripadvisor. In terms of comfort, rooms are relatively small compared to Australian hotels but were comfortable and had the key basic requirements. It had a restaurant on the ground floor that extended onto the esplanade which was ideal for eating & people watching as well as taking in movements of gondolas, ferries and ships on the water. It also offered 20% discount on meal costs to its hotel guests. This made their prices virtually the same as those in many of the narrow lanes where the heat in summer could be oppressive and the only views were of people in the lane at the time.

Originally we had booked to stay at the sister hotel Villa Igea however when we went to check in (check in for the Igea is in the Savoia Jolanda) we were upgraded to the Savoia which was a very pleasant surprise. You cannot beat the location of this hotel, it's directly opposite the Zacharria water bus stop and just a 30 second walk from St Marks Square and Basillica-you couldnt be more central if you tried! The service was excellent, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful-nothing was too much trouble, the porter was really cheerful and showed us to our room with our bags Breakfast was buffet style with a wide range of choices including hot eggs and bacon along with the usual continental stuff, it's served in the restaurant downstairs which also has a terrace looking out onto the Riga degli Shiavoni and beyond into the lagoon-really beautiful The room we had was nicely decorated and comfortable-absolutely no complaints, we didnt have a view but then we didnt come to Venice to spend time in our hotel all the time so it didnt really matter, the bathroom I have to say was a little tired-could have done with a bit of a sprucing up given that it's 4 star For us we really enjoyed staying at this hotel however if you're looking for a 4* then I would bear in mind this is probably a bit more of a 3.5*. The only reasons being little things like the fact there is no room service, and no free wifi access, there was also no information book in the room providing details of local attractions and maybe a map or something, plus as I say the bathroom was in need of a little attention-only small details but it's these things that would probably make the hotel more of a 4 star. As we were upgraded from a 3* anyway it wasnt a problem for us. I have read some previous reviews regarding bad smells in the hotel, there were a couple of occasions we got a slight whiff of drains however bear in mind you are in VENICE! A city built entirely on water where everybody's bath and sink water drains out into the canals-everywhere you go in Venice you sometimes get a bit of a damp/drain smell and the hotter the weather the worse it becomes, it goes with the territory and I wouldnt say this is a reflection on the hotel at all. Guests at the hotel get a discount on food (not drinks) at the hotel the restaurant 'Principessa' we had lunch here one day and although it was perfectly acceptable you are paying a huge premium for the location, if you want a cheaper coffee then go to Cafe Aurrora on the piazza where you get a discount if you show your hotel card The Savoia and Jolanda is on the main waterfront in Venice right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city, the central location is a huge strong point so if you're wanting somewhere very quiet and peaceful to come to at the end of the day then this is not the place for you We loved it though and would certainly come back again, we will be recommending it to our friends :)", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel on our Italian vacation\u201d", "Author": "pjfarr1", "ReviewID": "UR100843253", "Content": "We stayed for four nights at the end of our tour of Italy.

The menu presented is the 'Tourist' menu at a cost of 15 Euros.

The hotel fronts on to the promenade and overlooks the lagoon. The staff are helpful & friendly and breakfast is recommended. We booked a superior city view for four nights through their website & then e-mailed for our specific requirements (twin + bathtub \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we were given). This was the week of the ash in April so, over the weekend we e-mailed to see if we could postpone for one week; no reply to three e-mails so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that the back office isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staffed at weekends. However, a phone call on the Sunday reached the very helpful concierge who said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we arrived we found that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been upgraded to a lagoon-view room although the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even mention the upgrade (most hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the rare occasion it happens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make a song & dance about it). The room was delightful and large by Venice standards & we are SO glad we had the lagoon view; we spent hours just sitting by the windows & watching life go by. (We were on the first floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e. the one above ground floor! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the photo shows the view from our room.) We suspect that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccity view rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 look out onto the narrow alleys which are the pathways & will be dark so, if you can afford the extra (&, being Venice, rooms are expensive), opt for lagoon view. High season starts around 26th April; air conditioning is not switched on until 1st May (we gather this is standard for Venice). Staff were very helpful & pleasant. Breakfast was a good continental one + eggs. Dinner was disappointing & expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although, as our guidebook says, eating in Venice is very expensive & it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to eat well. There are a couple of caf\u00c3\u00a9 bars a few streets back where we had a substantial sandwich & a beer each for lunch for c.22Euros (expensive by our standards but not bad for Venice) sitting outside watching the world go by. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be intimidated into buying bottled water; the tap water is excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just take a bottle & fill it each day. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Buy the Venice Connected card (15% discount for web purchases at least 7 days ahead but note that there are no refunds). We booked water bus airport transfers (go online to get detailed directions for the 500 yard walk from airport to water bus stop), museum passes (discount for over- 60s) + a three day waterbus pass which was excellent value; validate your pass at the Welcome Venice counter at the airport but make sure you specify which days you need the waterbus pass to be valid for). We had a couple of waterbus rides up the grand canal & back (recommended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try to get one of the few seats outside if the weather is good) & visited the outlying islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a full day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip. For one of the best views of Venice, take the water bus across to the small island directly opposite the hotel & go up the bell tower of Basilica San Giorgio Maggiore (cost 3Euros) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c better than the view from the bell tower in St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square (cost 8 Euros).", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "RemyS", "ReviewID": "UR65814202", "Content": "I booked it 2 days before going to a week-end in Venice, when most hotels were full.

Room was large - very large by European standards - with a lovely sitting room, bedroom separated from sitting by sliding doors, a good sized bathroom with whirlpool tub and steam shower (nice touch, however it's very small; not a problem for us, but an even rather moderately sized individual will have great difficulty even getting in let alone maneuvering to wash) two lovely balconies with doors that open to allow the breeze to enter...all overlooking the lagoon with fabulous views to the left, right ,and center! Room was very clean and agree with other reviewers that housekeeping kept it so during our stay. Did have one slight infrastructure issue (shower leaked horribly), but once we notified the staff, the problem was resolved during our absence with NO fuss whatsoever. Note to the wise - if your room is looking out towards the lagoon, you'll want to make sure you close the electric shutters (controls on bedside tables - very nice arrangement) at bedtime if you value your sleep; it's bright and noisy from about 8.00a on! Staff were outstanding - very professional, knowledgeable, and efficient in addition to being very friendly. The one restaurant recommendation we requested was excellent and their organization of our water taxis were perfect. We were addressed by every staff member by name from memory at each interaction, a courtesy I quite like and which has become rather rare. Buffet breakfast was fully adequate continental style, and the inclusion in our rate was another value add feature. Did not dine there (have this crazy love for the really overpriced but divine Harry's so as always dined there one night, another at a place we love over by the Rialto Bridge). Did have coffee out on the patio during the afternoons and it was very pleasant people watching. Also had restaurant send up some espresso to our room late one eveningt; despite the fact that the restaurant was in the process of closing, the tray arrived on the arm of a very courteous individual very promptly. Location is as central as possible, with most of the water buses leaving from the 2 stops directly in front of the hotel; additionally, there are water taxis and gondolas in the same location. You are steps from St. Mark's Square & the Dodge's palace, with short walks or water journeys to all other attractions. Only downside is, well, you ARE in tourist central, and it can get noisy and crowded during the middle of the day, particularly when the cruise ships arrive! Nevermind, just spend your day out and away from the square and by 5.00p the day trippers are gone and it becomes pleasant again...if you want a bit of a change of pace, take a water bus/taxi to the Lido, rent a bicycle and spend a lovely day away from the tourist crowds along the beach. Alternatively, go out to the cimetrio; away from the crowds so a lovely place to while away a quiet and beautiful afternoon...

The standard of the room was comfortable and excellent. Room service attended twice a day to replace towels etc as necessary. It fully deserves its 4 stars. The included breakfast was a good selection of the usual continental choices plus eggs. Orange juice was freshly squeezed, and coffee was on the good side of average. The staff were friendly and attentive and cannot be faulted.

Total was under \u00c2\u00a3500 for the pair of us. We arrived at the hotel at around 9pm, the waterfront was empty! The water bus stop was literally right in front of our hotel (10 secs walk to the reception). The staff on the desk was more than helpful and anticipated our late arrival, gave us plenty of information on tours available, time of breakfast (7-10am) and had a porter to carry our luggage to our room. On the way up to our room on the second floor, we got into a tiny lift! It was a tight squeeze with us and the porter in it. I thought to myself - if this was a glimpse of things to come, our room must be midget size too. When he opened the door to our room and proceeded to show us around, we were so surprised! We really didn't understand why people were complaining! I'll list the things which I'd like to address: - We booked a standard room and it was big for European standards. Exposed rustic wooden beams, convenience of a nice LCD TV with 4 English channnels, lovely soft carpet, huge bathroom, lots of space for luggage & all the shopping you're going to buy. - Some people complained that the hotel can do with an update. Yes, there was some discolouration here and there. The bathroom could benefit from an extractor fan to reduce condensation. But overall, the hotel and our room exudes 'old world' luxury which I loved. - The bathroom could use a bath, instead of just having a shower cubicle... but this is Venice. - We were provided with 2 fluffy white bathrobes & 6 towels and an evening turn down service daily. -Their toiletry set extended to include cotton buds, make up pads and nail file. The latter was a godsend as chipped a nail carrying our bags! - The breakfast! OMG! I was speechless at the quality! To be fair, the choice was your standard European hotel selection. But the quality was amazing. I've never tasted better scrambled eggs! The waiters were all handsomely dressed in smart white suits and served us with such politeness (a novelty in Italy we've discovered), we really enjoyed breakfast. And the view of the waterfront and people strolling by was worth staying for another pot of tea. - The hotel runs free Murano glass workshop tours daily. We were lucky enough to be the only people on the tour that morning and had a water taxi all to ourselves. The captain of the taxi was chatty and informative, we had a right laugh over the failingsof Italian & UK politics. Absolutely no pressure to buy glassware after the show was over and we were given two water bus passes to take us wherever we wanted to go afterwards - so not restricted to going back to the hotel. One thing I'd like to mention is that when we checked in, we were told that we'd get 20% of our food bill at the restaurant. One evening we ate 'in' choosing their fixed price menu and when the bill came, they did not deduct the discount as it apparently only applied to their regular menu. So with 2 soft drinks (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 per glass), cover charge (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 each) and service charge, our \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 fixed price menu turned into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac53 bill. We were sad to leave the hotel. The staff was incredible (none of them were milling around waiting for tips as we've found elsewhere), the location was perfect being a couple of bridges (5 mins walk) to San Marco square and the atmosphere was luxuriously intimate (unlike Hotel Danieli which seemed more of a high end business hotel when we went in for dinner).

Our evening meals were part of our package, this was useful as it kept the cost down whilst we were there but the choice was very limited and was the same choice on both nights. However when we asked we were given the choice of something else, this might depend on the waiter. Our room overlooked a side passage but this wasn't a problem as we didn't spend much time in it as there was so much to see and do, also the lighting in the room was not very bright but this made it very cosy. The hotels and bars nearby are expensive and you pay a lot more to eat and drink in St Marks Square, however there are plenty of places down the little streets where you can get cheap, decent snacks. It is worthwhile having a drink at the hotel and sitting outside watching the world go by. A trip to Murano to see the glass blowing is worthwhile. We went on a free trip by water taxi (yes it was really free!) - just be ready for the hard sell when you get there but I would definately recommend it for the ride on the water taxi which can be expensive.

This hotel is pretty easy to find since it's on a main street near St. Mark's Square. The vaporettos are right in front. The only problem is that in the mornings and at night is very noisy because the souvenir vendors roll their kiosks in and out through the streets and the side street of this hotel being one of them. The hotel room was really nice but it was small and it only had a shower, no bathtub. But I think hotel rooms in Venice are really small. Venice was also the most expensive place we stayed at in Italy having been to Rome and Florence. Venice was the only place that didn't have breakfast included with the room. However, it included a trip to the Murano Glass Factory but the catch was that to get back we were to use public transportation. So they got us to the factory to buy things and we had to find our way back possibly carrying glass stuff back? Needless to say we skipped the glass factory which we weren't interested in anyway. Not sure if this another Venice quality but at the hotel we felt like we were being nickel and dimed because when we checked in, we had a person show us to the room plus a porter to bring up our luggage so of course we had to tip both.

The hotel was nice, slightly dark becuase of its decorations but nice none the less. The bathroom was a good size. The staff we found was very helpfull, they had two different people come to our room with us to show us how to work things, etc. and the front desk people were helpful in terms of restaurant suggestions, maps/activities, and making arrangements. One of the nicest concierges I have seen in a while and they knew very good English. The breakfast has many options (when it comes to European-style breakfasts), however I thought slightly over prices (25 Euro), so one day we actually went around the corner to a delicious bakery and got home-made goodies. The location was amazing, you couldnt have asked for a better location if you are looking to stay near St. Marco. Its about a 3 minute walk away, yet you are far enough off the beaten path that you are not dealing with a lot of tourists, etc. Right outside the hotel is a gorgous few of the Grand Canal, and lots of street vendors, shopping, gondola rides, and taxis. One of the water buses has a stop right near the hotel, making it very convienent. The only problem we really encountered with the hotel was that they were slightly pushy to go to their Murano Glass Factory which was off the island, a quick ride by the water taxis or the water buses. They must have had some sort of agreement with that factory becuase they gave you a free ride over there, to 'show you how the glass is made and get to see some of the pieces'. The ride over there was gorgous and the little island was very nice, however, after seeing the quick presentation on how the glass was made, they then bring you into an art studio that has very expensive pieces of work (all gorgeous, but still...), and you feel very obligated to buy one. After you leave the huge sales room is there a small gallery with little things you can buy (which we did not know this, so we purchased a more expensive item).

Only on my last day, after several complaints, did they add a hand-out with instructions to properly disconnect after using less than the time you paid for. This would have saved me a lot of money. The restaurant staff were amazing! A few nights I dined on my own and they were incredibly gracious. They sent my desert fruit and wine up to my room to enjoy later. I was on a photography course with 15 others and on 2 nights we had group dinners at the hotel restaurant. These were both amazing in terms of the food (hot and delicious) and service - top notch. I'm not saying stay here for dinner instead of venturing out and exploring, but if you're beat and want to chill close to your room, you won't be disappointed. Also, the breakfast buffet is small by some standards but more than adequate to get you going. Lots of fruit, breads and cereals in addition to the usual eggs and bacon and the coffee is just fantastic. I'm not sure how to evalutate the price of this hotel. Firstly I don't know exactly how much we paid since it was included in my overall trip. Secondly I think there is a real value to the location. From the front steps of this hotel you can walk to the Piazza San Marco within minutes, the vaporetto stop is steps away, and the people watching from the hotels own cafe is second to none. Yes, a coffee will cost you $7.00 US but the atmosphere and service are outstanding. As a seasoned traveller I would say that this hotel is best for people who want a convenient location both to arrive and depart but also to explore Venice. My pesonal opinion is that this hotel takes some liberties with respect to front desk service because of the location. The restaurant staff make up for it in a big way.

The hotel Savoia and Jolanda was a total disappointment in all three categories. In fact, there appear to be relatively few rooms wih a view of anything but the wall of the adjoining building a few feet away. The rooms were small and the pictures are misleading online. Our first room was so small that there was less than two feet to walk in front of the bed or to the sides of the bed. There was no dresser in the room, just a writing desk which had the bar/refrigerator and food for sale in the limited space available. Since space was so tight the chair to the desk was positioned in the corner of the room. There were a few small drawers in a closet which was covered by a drape, but certainly insufficient space for two travellers. When we obected to the room, the hotel management had a bus boy parade us around to several equally unacceptable rooms, so with a promise to move us to a 'better' room after their busy weekend, we decided to stay in the first tiny room as that was were our luggage was taken. Two days later, the story didn't get any better. In fact, it got much worse. But by this time we had made up our minds that this hotel was so poorly run and they had no intention to do right by us that we just gave up. But we did resolve to tell Hotels-- and to list our experience for the benefit of others. We also took pictures because we thought no one would believe the poor condition of a supposed four star hotel. To that end, our second room was indeed larger so I did not have to draw my legs in to let my wife pass to the bathroom. It wasn't spacious, but it was acceptable space, however it too had the same wall view with dark windows and no direct sunlight for the remainer of our six day stay. But the worst experience was in the bathroom, which was filthy with mildew in most of the corners and constant flow of water out of the tub. Whenever we used it, there was a large puddle that covered much of the bathroom floor. In addition, it leaked on the outside of the room and the maids must have noticed the wallpaper was crumbling so they kept a service cart parked in front of the wall outside our room to hide the soiling. The air conditioning worked poorly and each evening we would return home to find the air cut back by the maintenance staff, so we would spend the first few hours coaxing whatever air we could get out of the A/C unit which was sparing at best. We attempted to escape to the lobby to read the dailiy papers only to find that they didn't come every day which seemed to fit the expectations one would have in staying there. We will note on the positive side that the food and service in the restaurant and for the complimentary breakfast was good. A final note about the courtyard view, we suspect that there are really very few true courtyard views. We note in their write-up a few rooms have a water view and the alternative was a courtyard view. Be prepared, if you stick your head outside of the window and look in both directions you may catch a glimpse. We will not entertain staying in this hotel again.

Arriving on a late flight (which I had already advised the Hotel), I had a problem at the airport. My visit coincided with the feast of Redentore and the canal around San Marco was closed. This meant getting off at Arsenale and what I was advised would be a 15 minute schlepp. Happily, it's more like 10 minutes at a gentle pace (all that was possible at 12.45am on a Riva as crowded as Oxford Street on a Saturday afternoon, with everyone out watching the fireworks). Finally reaching the hotel I received a warm welcome to my (very bad) Italian. When asking for a smoking room my request was received with surprise - \"oh you can smoke in your room\" - and on asking Alberto if he required a credit card guarantee - \"oh no, you pay us when you leave\". A bit different from Britain! The room was a small inside single, no view, but deliciously airconditioned. The bed was rather amazing, comprising as it did a typical Venetian couch made up as a bed, with lovely matching bolster and pillows. There was thoughtful provision of extra pillow and blanket beneath the wardrobe, which also contained a minibar suitable for keeping your own drinks for. There was also a selection of snacks. I was lucky enough to have a bath as well as a shower, and there was the usual excellent Italian linen towels as well as the more usual fluffy variety. The one aspect in which I was disappointed in the hotel was breakfast. Yes, there is egg and bacon available, but it didn't look great and I was also surprised to see cake at breakfast (and on the third day the sinister thought suggested itself that they might be left overs from desert at dinner the previous night.) The toaster for bread is also rubbish, and only water and tomato juice are available, no fruit juice. Dinner in the restaurant is good though, and there's 25% discount for guests at the hotel, probably a good job given the price, but the terrace has a beautiful view of San Giggiore and towards Santa Maria della Salute.

At ordinary rate, it would have been too expensive for me. The room was one of the most luxurious I had stayed of Venetian style and my travel partner and I were both satisfied. Thus, we repeated the same in 2004. The funny thing was in 2004, the rate was even lower at 420.00 though we got a slightly smaller room.

You cannot fault the location of the hotel either, it is so central and right opposite the water taxi/bus stops. The main problem with this hotel is that the restaurant floods at high water, which led to the weird experience of eating breakfast with our feet in four inches of very cold, smelly water, and all the waiters in welly boots! Our number one top tip for visitors to Venice in the winter is to check the moon tables and the weather. The city floods more than 200 times per year and you WILL need rubber boots. The 'emergency boots' sold on the quayside for around 10E only last for a matter of an hour or so before they leak.
