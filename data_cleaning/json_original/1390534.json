But the best thing is its location. Most first-timers in Istanbul head to the over-touristed old city to stay. Titanic Port is a short-ish taxi ride from the main airport, but it's not an out-of-town, out-of-way airport hotel. It's located in a wonderful, buzzing, middle-class Turkish neighborhood. Nearby there are some old Ottoman mansions, Armenian churches, shopping streets, cafes, seafood restaurants, malls, and a marina. All of this within walking distance. If the weather is good, the streets will be buzzing with young people. Great way to explore Turkish way of life. And the obvious old city sights are still a taxi ride away. If you prefer to be among Istanbulites instead, take a taxi to the nearby Yesilyurt and have a great day on the promenade or the beach.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood but lacking personality\u201d", "Author": "FoxM64", "ReviewID": "UR127686748", "Content": "Western kind of hotel, with all comforts and perks.

Taxi will cost about TRY 25 each way while the metro only costs TRY 4 each way (Ok, it does involve a bit of a schlep to walk to the Metro station but this is no biggie).

As most of my trips bring me into my destinations early morning I get a good chance to gauge a hotel service simply by seeing how ready they are...to receive me... should be something any traveller should look forward to, right ? After a very tiring 5 hour flight, and having to put up with the usual \"let us sleep\" extremely irritated attitude of the night crew of the airline that brought me into Istanbul, I was picked up by my hosts and whisked off to this hotel. The first thing that strikes you when you pull up to this hotel is that it looks like a really practical place to stay. Unfortunately that's sort of all you can say about it. OK, so it's 6:45 am, I've just been flying for 5 hours, taken a good part of 2 hours to get out of the airport, with another 35 minute drive down Istanbul's refreshingly fast causeways, skimming through heavy trucks and signs of morning rush hour traffic starting to form, and we get to this hotel... Guess what ? My room's not ready... I'm always cautiously optimistic whenever I come to Turkey. It's a great place to visit, Turks are quite friendly, but their service industry is playing catch up really slowly... That's irritating. After pleading with the receptionists (who don't smile by the way...) they huffingly sat me down, and by 7:40, I was up to my room... With their senior receptionist reminding me in a friendly way to remember this favor (!) they did me by breezing me up to the room with lightning speed.... The rooms are OK, reminiscent of the old Sheraton designs, quite adequate in terms of facilities but they have no bathtubs in this hotel it seems, one thing that strikes you if you get a room close to the elevator is what a difference it makes in terms of noise... Try it and you'll see, you can hear the elevators coming up and down there. It was quite cold when I arrived but when I got into my room the heater (which you can't control) was so stuffy I had to open a window to stop my head from exploding... That helped a bit although it let in some of the traffic noise, the fact that I was on a high floor did help. In sharp contrast to the lobby size, this hotel is BIG. Entering it does not show but it has so many twists and turns you can easily get lost simply by going up the wrong staircase. What got to me the most about my stay at this hotel was the fact that the staff was downright unfriendly. I wouldn't say they were rude but they definitely lacked the warm smile you can find in some other places. This is reflected everywhere, restaurant staff, bar staff, reception, the security looks like they would jump you for asking for a second helping of marmalade... Their breakfast is quite good, I recommend trying anything turkish they have set out on the table as it's quite authentic and well worth the taste... So I missed my flight out and had to extend my stay for one night, would they give me the rate my hosts had ? nope... Call them and get them to send us a fax (even emails wouldn't do) their senior receptionist (someone I'm going to call...aunty...) commanded...OK, did that, fine, it was extended, well and good for me. Late checkout at this hotel ? Sure, all of an extra half an hour for you... One if you beg really really hard... At the end of the second day here, I just packed my bags, got into a tour bus and spent the rest of the day seeing Istanbul. This hotel just wasn't worth any more effort.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money & good airport stopover\u201d", "Author": "ManchesterEmmy", "ReviewID": "UR123205641", "Content": "We stayed one night.

This was key because the downside was that the furnace was on and my gal and I, well, we needed the AC. That's why the sleep quality is only 4 and not 5. Can you beat free WiFi? The only food we had was Turkish coffee in the cafe and it comes with llocum (Turkish delight but you can also call a hot chick llocum or your sweetheart llocum, etc.), and breakfast in bed which was fantastic. The room service was excellent and when we called for anything else, it came in less than 5 minutes. The gym is fantastic. Plenty of cardio, free weights, and machines. I didn't go to the pool because of an ear infection nor did I try the spa because I wasn't allowed :( This is a perfect hotel if you plan on doing Istanbul on the cheap. Even though both my girl and I make very good money, we don't like to spend a lot unless we have to. First, you can easily take the train there from the airport, but the taxi is very convenient - next time I will go via train when I'm alone. Second, if you want good Turkish food, it's all around within walking distance and very cheap. We never paid more than 30 Lira for a meal with drinks and salad. Every Turkish restaurant is a sit down restaurant and not fast food like in the US. They grill things fresh, the veggies are fresh, the bread is fresh, so even when you go to the mall food court, it is a GREAT meal. There are 2 malls right next to the Titanic that have scores of great Turkish restaurants, and across the street is a huge shopping area of town that has a lot of good restaurants. Third, Migros, this is a grocery store in the basement of both malls. You can save on the 8 Lira per bottle of water at the hotel by buying the 1 Lira or less at Migros. We also bought a kilo of Baklava which lasted the 4 days we were there, and it was heavenly. Everynight with tea - you can pick a variety there at Migros. Last, the train - if you've ever taken taxis in Istanbul, the traffice sucks and the cost is high and the drivers never speak any English or don't understand very well the Turkish that you've learned. The train is the way to go as it costs 1.5 Lira to board, so getting to all the sites at Sirkeci is a breeze. From the hotel, walk to the end of the 2nd mall, take a left, and go until you see the train tracks (maybe 3 or 4 blocks total). Go up to the booth and ask for however many tokens you want (1 token = 1 ride like the subway or el). Take the train heading east and stay on until the last stop at the Sirkeci station, and you are within walking distance of all the sites. If you eat at a restaurant there versus at Bakarkoy, you will see the difference that tourists pay on food - 3 times as much! Oh, I guess I should mention the shopping because my girl is a shopping pro, and she was in heaven here between the 2 malls and all the Turkish shops across the street. She bought me a Pierre Cardin blazer for $100. If you foreget anything, you can get it in this mall.

I also used the spa, after I met a lady from Turkey who just had a baby and was using the spa told me it is one of the bast spas in Istanbul, I got the package with the best turkeish bath polish and exfoliation (was not sure if I wanted someone to bath me, glad I tried it and loved it), then a coffe wrap thatt smelled great, and finally a massage ( I had better massages but it was not bad I guess I expected more or maybe did not choose the right one as they have many types) A beautiful steam room with a dome with some lights that change from green to blue very nice and relaxin, a real big sauna with nice aroma and the right temperature the turkish bath room with nice tiles, and two areas, one more private...the massage room very nice ecotared with a beautiful aroma too and an electric area for real confy warm towels and very nice european spa products .

I tried to book a room through its website which had some special rates and the booking page constantly failed to work, so ended booking by email but at a cost of 20 euro more.

We informed the hotel that we would be checking in early, but the rooms were not ready when we arrived. We had to spend some time in the mall and then in the reception area. The rooms are quite spacious and it looks like the photos they have posted in the internet. The staff were not that great and they did not go out of their way to help.
