Still, Hotel de Buci was a shock and major let down. Although well situation in central Saint Germain des Pres near numerous cafes, restaurants, metro stations, and tourist sites, the bedroom that my spouse and I received was so tiny that all four of our suitcases had to be sent down to storage. It was TINY, TINY, TINY. In such a room, virtually the only thing one could do was to stay in the bed. Also, the room lack a good desk or table and was so dark that it would have been impossible to do any serious reading there. As we were aware that French hotels almost never offer face cloths in the bathroom, we came prepared with our own. Still it was a major effort not to get the maid to remove them from the bathroom whenever she made up the room. Hotel de Buci, even by Paris stardards, is very overpriced. Although French and English newspapers and access to a single computer in the downstairs sitting area were available at no extra cost and it remains a mystery to me how it could have ever been rated with four stars. Since even the tiny safes in the rooms are not bolted down, if anyone ever got into a room, they could walk out with a bedroom safe.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cSuch a delight!\u201d", "Author": "Jenks333", "ReviewID": "UR125107160", "Content": "15 of us traveling together stayed at the de Buci for 8 days in early February 2012.

When we first arrived at the hotel, the concierge and lobby impressed us. The common areas are very beautiful. We stayed in a suite, which was very small. I'm glad we got the suite, as I can't imagine how small the normal rooms were. The hotel has the concierge change over throughout the day/night, but they didn't seem to pass on messages to each other if they were meant to do something for us. On the first day of our stay, we asked the concierge to book us tickets to the Moulin rouge and Disneyland tickets. We came back that evening, and neither had been booked, they called Moulin rouge straight away and said it was sold out. So we asked the concierge to book the tickets for either one of the following two nights, and that we wanted Disneyland tickets for the next day. The concierge said we would have to come back in the morning and do it al then. So the next morning we asked a different concierge for the same thing, he said he wasn't sure if he could do the Disneyland tickets, and to come back in 15 mins. So we did, and he had them, so paid the 12 euro commission for organising the tickets. We again said that we wanted Moulin rouge tickets for that evening or the next. When we arrived at Disneyland and tried to hand over our voucher, the ticket officer pointed out that the voucher the concierge gave us was clearly out of date (which it was, in big bold print). We had to pay the full fare, without any discounts. Disneyland wanted to know where we got the tickets from, as they were unhappy that hotels were selling expired tickets - we were unhappy too. Upon arriving back at the hotel, we told the same concierge what happened and that we had to pay full fare, we weren't happy. He just gave us our 12 euro back and apologised. For this, from a four star hotel, I expected more than a simple apology, he could have made it up to us in some other way. We asked about the Moulin rouge tickets and if he had organised the tickets. He hadn\u2019t organised them. Are you serious? We were asking for these tickets for three days by now. He called and found out that that evening was booked out, and our next evening had a private party, so we couldn't attend. We felt that if the concierge had booked them when we asked, we wouldn't have missed out on seeing the show during our time in Paris \u2013 we were there for almost a week! We should have booked them ourselves. Our final, most stressful experience was the last day upon check out. The previous night we organised an airport shuttle through, you guessed it, the concierge. The concierge confirmed 8am for the shuttle. The next morning, as we're getting ready, we receive a phone call from the concierge at 7.30am saying that the shuttle will be here at 7.45. That's okay, we thought, 15 minutes to go, we\u2019d be able to pack quickly. 5 minutes later (7.35 am), the concierge called back and said that the shuttle is here now, and if we don't come down straight away they would have to cancel it. What?? We asked for another 5-10 minutes, but they wouldn't budge. We asked them to call us a different shuttle, as we couldn't come down right away - they said no, not with this amount of short notice. I told them they confirmed 8am to us, that it wasn't our problem if they got their times mixed up, we shouldn't be penalised for their mistake. Their response was \"you didn't speak to me last night when you confirmed\"...no accountability, they were just passing the blame. We threw absolutely everything in one go into our bags and ran out the door. At the airport, we had to open up our bags and re-pack so things wouldn't spill etc. A miserable and stressful experience. Housekeeping needs to be reviewed - small things, but everyday, something was wrong/out of ordinary i.e. when we first checked in, we had bath water in the bottom quarter of the bath...that evening, we had two chocolates plopped next to our change by the door, the next day, a set of pillow cases was left by the television, and all our towels were replaced but one went missing. On the following day, another towel went missing. The housekeeping inconsistencies didn\u2019t bother us too much, it was the other experiences at the hotel de buci that made our stay disappointing. Good points - Blockout blinds were great. Concierge could speak English well, good location. A friend who is going to Paris in a few weeks asked me about the hotel and whether she should stay there - I said No.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWell presented little hotel with friendly staff in congenial location but sadly with major temperature \u00a0and air flow flaw\u201d", "Author": "PamelaBruce", "ReviewID": "UR123444516", "Content": "There were many pluses to his little hotel.

We were a family group with rooms across 2 floors so we frequently used the stairs between the rooms and most times we found a vacuum cleaner with a very long hose draped over the stairs (also the fire exit!) We pointed this out so I hope this has now been rectified. Shower doors were useless in both rooms (ours had part of the door missing) and the bathrooms were usually soaking wet, which explained why they supply 4 bath mats per room. Its a bit hit and miss what you get in the rooms, one of our rooms had an iron, ipod dock and got biscuits, needless to say ours didn't have any of this and we had the ipod!

My past visits were arranged by production companies, so I had little choice over where I stayed. Each earlier visit to Paris had me staying in a tiny hotel room with ancient amenities. I came to realize that tiny hotel rooms are the standard in Paris. Hotel de Buci is no exception. The difference here is that they utilize every inch of space well, and the amenities are clean and modern. The main reason to stay here is the location- right in the heart of chic Germain St. Dupres. Hotel de Buci is set on a busy street lined with real Parisian restaurants (not the ones designed for tourists). Yet despite being on a busy street, the noise doesn't reach your bedroom. The weekend of my visit, we learned there was a metro strike. All the public bicycles were reserved by locals to commute to and from work. No problem -- our hotel was a comfortable walk away from Notre Dame, The Louvre, and the Eiffel Tour. By the time we got the major attractions out of the way, the strike let up and we were able to use the metro to see other areas of Paris. Another reason to stay at Hotel de Buci: the lovely host Charlotte! Upon your arrival, she will do her best to make you feel welcome. If you have a particular destination you'd like to see, Charlotte will point it out on a map and look up the hours for you. One suggestion: Breakfast is pricey, and not included in the rate.

Best of all though is the fab location on a side street just off the Boulevard St Germain. Loads of atmospherica bars and restaurant, shops and eateries surround and the whole atmosphere is one of what you expect Paris to be like - wonderful.

Maybe it was our room or that we prefer modern as opposed to traditional French decor, but the experience wasn't four star--except for the robe and slippers. For example, the bed was incredibly uncomfortable with the mattress sagging so much in the middle that my husband ended up sleeping on the floor. We twice asked for another set of towels--only one was provided in the bathroom--and never received it (another request was answered right away). On the plus side, the room was clean and quiet with wi-fi and CNN and most staff appeared helpful.

The foyer is compact but smart and comfortable and the check in was welcoming. Our room was a deluxe double overlooking the street and by Paris standards, was average size. It was smartly decorated in traditional French style. The bathroom was fine although the hand held shower kept slipping down the wall making for some frustrating showers. The air conditioning system was not efficient and the room was never really cool enough - even though the weather wasn't hot. The moods of the staff varied. Whilst the female day staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful, the male night staff definitely let the side down.

In the heart of St Germain it is two spits from the coolest people watching bar (Bar du Marche) in Paris (and therefore surely the World) plus countless other restaurants and bars, 3 mins from the Seine and 10 from the Louvre. Now to the negatives, unfortunately... The reviews commenting on the rude staff (at least the night-time staff) are oh so true. To cut a very long story short, the smallest request (to turn a double into a twin, as we had booked and as the day staff (who were very professional) had promised would be done was met with eye rolling, huffs and puffs, truculence, downright arguing and (no kidding) a quilt being thrown across the (very small) room in rage (after I came in and found the 'twin' beds were 2cms apart and shared a quilt and dared to say \"oh, could we please have separate quilts since we won't be sharing a bed at all\"). After this I complained to the night-time manager who simply made excuses for the staff member concerned and attributed blame to us. His attitude wasn't altogether surprising since when, the next morning, when we asked him to book us a cab, we got similar eye-rolling and huffs. Of lesser impact on our break but things to bear in mind: (a) yes the rooms are very small (although you should accept that you'll find that throughout Europe) and looked out on a courtyard and the air-conditioner; (b) for a period in the evening the room stank of smoke - maybe from the next room or maybe from the dour (cleaning?) woman who skulked around the lobby smoking constantly) and (c) the bathroom door didn't lock or close properly.

Wow. This hotel was fantastic in a superb location. A bit pricey but then so are all hotels in Paris. Paid 215 Euros for a double room [it was for one person]. The location of this hotel on the Rue de Buci in the heart of Saint Germain cannot be beaten. The hotel is quiet yet you step out the front door of the hotel and you are in the middle of all the action. There are cafes galore and fabulous restaurants within walking distance. I requested a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard and it was extremely quiet - no noise at all and I slept like a baby. My only gripe is the hotel rules [never verbally pointed out but located in written material in the hotel room - you can always say you never saw it!] which state that you are \"not allowed outside food in the room\". I thought this demand was outrageous and just ignored it and had cornflakes in my room every day for breakfast rather than pay 22 Euros for the hotel breakfast. My attitude is if I am paying 215 Euros a night I will eat whatever I please in my room! In my opinion this little \"rule\" of the hotel's should be removed from the hotel rule book. On the other hand quite often I would walk into the hotel with grocery bags and staff saw it and said nothing so maybe it's one of those rules that's meant to be broken? Staff at this hotel are incredibly helpful and wonderful. There is a big Champion supermarket 10 metres from the hotel and a superb fruit stall selling top quality fruit right across the street.

I will do many paintings from views snapped from this room. Also the sound proofing blocked out the street and there was never noise from ajoining rooms. The location was amazing. Close to Cafes, shops Poulin Bakery (a MUST) and sidewalk cafes were open late so you never feel rushed. Metro a very easy few minutes walk away. The down side? Only the price.
