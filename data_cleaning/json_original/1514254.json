It is in a great location for access to the stadium, convention center, museums, White River Park / Zoo and within a reasonable walk of most other downtown sites. This hotel has been open for just a few months and still has all the cleanliness of a new hotel. However, I get a clear sense that once the new hotel gleam wears off, there will be some problems: - Breakfast was underwhelming in terms of selection, service and crowd control. Among other items, the hotel provides microwaveable breakfast sandwiches and do-it-yourself waffles. However, with only one microwave, two waffle makers and no real sense of a line or queue, breakfast was sort of a free-for-all mess. - There were some design quirks with our room, a king suite. In the bathroom, you couldn't reach the towel rack from the shower. The in-room AC was pretty loud and the room lighting didn't really reach all corners. - I also found that the value of this hotel was lacking for the price. In Marriott terms, you pay Courtyard-level prices for Fairfield amenities. - Finally, the underground parking garage worked out fine for this trip. However, I would be greatly concerned about future visits, as the garage looks it services not only the Fairfield but also the attached Courtyard, Springhill Suites and JW Marriott. The JW isn't open yet but will have 900+ rooms. Some of the garage is not yet open, but unless there are vast levels that have yet to be unveiled, there is no way that garage will handle the demands from all four hotels.
