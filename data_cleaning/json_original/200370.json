Really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Excellent Location its literally round the corner from check point Charlie, hellium ballon ride and part of berlin wall. Staff are very friendly at reception, went to restaurant for dinner one night, had a lovely dinner and again staff were friendly. Hotel is very clean and its a warm comfortable environment. Enjoyed the fact that the room had a heater and also a fan. The mini bar was great and a selection of several drinks Great Value for Money Only little problem i had, i was away with my boyfriend for my birthday and i wanted a double room and we were given a twin room and was advised there was no double rooms left which was a dissapointment when i wrote this on request months ago when booking this hotel.

This location is within 15-20 min. walking distance from several major tourist sites (Brandenburger Tor, Reichstag, Potsdamer Platz, just to name a few). It is well connected with the rest of the city, mainly through the U bahn network (Stadtmitte station is approx. 20 m from the hotel). On top of that, Friedrich Str. is a shopping mecca, with Galeries Lafayette and other stores, carrying all of the major fashion labels. Second important thing which I want to mention about this hotel is that, in my opinion, it provides excellent value for money relationship. We booked a double bedroom with breakfast included, and were really satisfied with this hotel. The room was huge, and I mean really huge (almost 50 square meters; I am guessing that this probably was an apartment building in the east Berlin later converted into a Hotel). The room was well furnished, a bit old-fashioned, but very nice and clean. Brakfast was a \"standard\", swedish-table kind, hotel breakfast, with selection of foods for everyone (vegetarians and not). The staff was very polite and helpful, fluid in English and French. Hotel lobby has free wireless internet access, which works flawlessly. The hotel rooms also have free wifi, but we, unfortunately, could'n make it work?! I would definitely, highly, recommend this hotel for the Berlin visit!", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cDoes not deserve 4 points rating\u201d", "Author": "stetir", "ReviewID": "UR110664341", "Content": "Bad experience overall.

I was waken up several times in the middle of the night. The room is somehow old, the bathroom had dirty spots (nothing big, to be fair) and some long-expired cookies were in the room fridge. The WORST thing was an itchy substance present in all linens. My skin was slightly itching evey day as soon as I walked in. My colleague had the same experience.

Booked an apartment to get a balcony and a bathtub, both wanted comforts that I don\u00b4t have at home. On arrival the apartment looked more like a closed down hospital. The rooms were huge, but insanely ugly decorated. Tasteless furniture, a so called kitchen with nothing,but a sink and a minibar. The bathtub could never be used expect for very very late at night or early early morning as there was no hot water. Reception\u00b4s response to the lack of hot water was that we should just let it run for a few minutes and it would be ok. After 30 minutes of letting the water run we finally gave up. No Wifi connection in the apartment building (not like it would have been much of an effort to set up a network there as well), the TV did not work even though we asked the reception on numerous occasions to look into it. The only response we got was the question: Is it plugged in, did you turn it on, etc. Promises were made that someone would look into it, but nothing more happened. The breakfast, which is not included in the price (costs 6,50 Euro extra) is not worth the price. You get a basic breakfast of boiled eggs, something that resembled scrambled eggs and on a couple of occasions cold coffee. Various hams and some cheese, cereal and fruit as well. The staff however was very nice and the pastry was freshly baked each morning. The location is very central though, a very short walk from Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburger tor and the museums. The location is also very close to the U-Bahn. The staff was very helpful with locating things on the map, giving tips and advice.

Oh yes, the breakfast was very good including sausages and eggs as well as cold items and fruit. The hotel is very plain but just perfect for sightseeing.

The building was older, but perfectly clean and well kept. The apartment had IKEA-type furnishings. There were 2 bathrooms, one with just a toilet and sink, the other with a toilet, sink and bathtub with a hand-held shower, which we found a bit awkward. There was a large living room and a balcony. There was also a mini-bar fridge stocked with beer, water, wine, etc. that were reasonably priced, and the fridge was also large enough to hold items we purchased elsewhere. The included breakfast buffet was very good. The restaurant staff were always pleasant and smiling, as were the front desk staff. We found their English to be somewhat limited, but adequate (this is Germany after all!). We also appreciated the free internet in the stairway off the main lobby, and the fact that we could buy transit passes at the front desk and just charge it to our bill. The location was excellent, just steps from the Stadtmitte U-bahn station and within close walking distance of lots of restaurants and shopping. It was also within reasonable walking distance of many sites, including Museuminsel and Potsdamer Platz.
