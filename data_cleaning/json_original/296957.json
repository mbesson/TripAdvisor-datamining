I went up to the front desk, explained we were unhappy with our current hotel and could they offer something better? Of course they answered! We were shown both a regular room and junior suite and offered a discount. We reserved the suite and checked in the next day. Let me say the suites are beautiful - very modern, spacious, and comfortable and decorated with antiquities. That's right - this modern hotel was started by an archaeologist and is decorated with various forms of primitive art. There is even a small museum on the lower floor! Unique and cool! I had never stayed in this combination before. Other things to love - computers right off the lobby offering free internet access, a great location only steps from the Retiro, Prado museum, and Gran Via.

It was so loud that it just seemed surreal. The bar closed at 3 in the morning but unbelievably the noise kept going after that. Eventually I decided to investigate and got dressed and went up to the bar which was on the roof terrace. I was met by shocked faces of some men clearing up as i tried to explain to them that we were trying to sleep underneath in the floor below. They looked suitably embarassed and i then returned to my room where we then managed to get some sleep. I later found out Sherlock Holmes style that there was a storage cupboard for the bar, directly above our room which must have been where the strange scraping and moving of furniture noises were coming from!

This time we were there for 5 nights so booked a duplex suite to get a bit more space. On arrival the hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. We chatted about the hotel and Madrid. We were also given vouchers for some champagne in the hotel. Check in was very quick and simple. First impression of the room was that it was very dark. The downstairs bedroom was ok, but the window overlooked the building next door and the darkness made it feel small. Also downstairs was the bathroom and a walk in cupboard. The bathroom was a good size and was very clean. The cupboard was very big and there was plenty room to keep all our luggage. The upstairs living room was a good size and was a comfortable, bright space to sit. There were televisions in the upstairs and downstairs rooms but there were only a couple of English language channels and the picture quality was really bad. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but when we were there we didn't really have the option of watching tv. Some of the booking websites state that the rooms have DVD and CD players, but our room didn't. The room is looking a bit worn in places, but overall it was a good room. There is a charge for wifi in this hotel which is surprising as most hotels offer it free. There are 2 computers beside reception for guests to use, but one of them seemed to be in constant use when we were there and the other didn't work very well, there were keyboard problems that the reception staff couldn't really help with. We didn't eat at the hotel. We went to the rooftop bar for our free champagne on the day we arrived, it was still open due to the extended good weather. It was a lovely place to sit and have a quiet drink, I would recommend that for the bar. We didn't use the pool. The glass bar on the ground floor was very busy on our first night. We decided to go there on our second night after we'd been out. It was quiet, there were only a few other people in the bar when we got there and one person when we left, it lacked atmosphere. The hotel location is excellent, you can easily walk around the city from here.

There was no room at the Fenix for my extra days so I decided on the Urban Hotel. It's a tough comparison as the Fenix is very, very nice. One of the attractions of this hotel for me was the rooftop bar and pool. I had planned to spend a bit of time relaxing by the pool when I wasn't sight-seeing. As it turns out, the pool doesn't get that much sun and it's really quite small. It's probably best to think of it as more of a cosmetic feature for the bar at night. The rooftop is an excellent place to end an evening in Madrid in the summer. My room was as hip and modern in design as the rest of the hotel. In some cases form takes priority over function which irks me a bit but maybe I'm just getting old. For example they use designer phones which don't have any of the extensions marked on them so you have to hunt for the little book to tell you what button to push for room service. That being said, if you are the type to go to New York and stay at a W rather than the Waldorf, this place is likely for you. The location is ideal, with the Prado just 5 minutes walk in one direction and a beautiful plaza about 10 minutes in the other direction. One complaint I had was the construction going on in the building directly next door and immediately outside my window. Between jet lag and late nights I was sleeping in a fair bit and the noise was significant. If you plan to stay here in or around October 2011 I would request a room on the other side of the building.

Hotel is perfectly located if you like to wander on foot during your vacations. Furthest tourist sight was probably the Royal Palace and that was only a 15-20 min walk. It's rated as a 5-star hotel and I'd say it's realistically a 4 to 4.5 star hotel by North American standards. It had a good design, very unique, but in terms of the ultra luxury that one would expect from a 5-star it just missed the mark by a hair. Bed and pillows were a bit on the hard side. Room was kind of small but I've grown to expect that of european hotels. Also, in this day and age of smartphones, iPads, laptops, etc. I dont think any hotel should be able to call itself 5-star without offering free wi-fi in the rooms. You lose half a star in my books just for that. We had a room on the 4th floor in the back of the hotel facing the side street and it was very quiet. With the super dark blackout curtains it was a deadly combination for sleeping in, which isn't necessarily a bad thing on vacation. If you have an early flight or train to catch make sure you keep the blinds open a crack. Great rooftop bar for a drink before you head out for dinner. They have a pool up there but it's more of a floating pool than swimming pool given it's size. We were debating between Urban and the ME by Melia around the corner and were happy with our choice. The ME is in a very lively square and you'd never get any sleep. Unless that's what you're looking for.

That involved me trawling hundreds of reviews for the \"perfect hotel\". Predictably, there is no such thing. Even the best hotels in Madrid get some angry 1 star reviews: people complaining about small beds, noise, rude staff, expensive breakfast. You name it, I read it. The same applies to Hotel Urban. However I decided the Hotel scored very well considering the hundreds of reviews submitted for it. The stats proved me more than right. The hotel is beautiful to look at, from the outside and inside. A gorgeous meeting of stone, glass and steel facades, other hotels in Madrid look cheap or stuffy in comparison. The rooms are beautifully designed and I cannot fathom some of the complaints I read about bathroom and room being too small. Our room was huge and our bathroom had two sinks, a glass panel shower and a separate bath tub. The bed was so comfortable we intend to write to the hotel to find out where they buy their mattreses. I fell asleep in seconds, something I never do at home. The rooftop bar and pool is a stunner; and a quick drink or two was a lovely way to spend the evening before heading out on the town. The roof bar gets visitors in its own right and we often popped our heads in at 2 am to find the roof packed with people who were a little too shi-shi for their own good. But then, a glamorous hotel is bound to attracts a dolled-up crowd. Soak it up and enjoy the glitz. Our room was on the floor directly under the roof bar, yet the noise we heard when it was busiest, was still minimal and would only affect the lightest of sleepers. If you pick a lower floor (i..e. anything below fifth floor) you can avoid the risk alogether, but I had no problem at all. In terms of location, the hotel is close to St Ana Square, the Prado, and walking distance to lots of tapas bars close by, and if you can walk for 20 mins you can go to some of the trendier night spots like Chueca and La Latina. This also means you could get the room without breakfast, which seemed a little pricey. We found lots of alternatives close by.

There were a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning, but we'd stay there again and would recommend it to other travelers. On the plus side, we got a package deal that included the Madrid cultural card (which permits access to many museums during a 24-hour period (of course, it's very hard to really get its full value unless you are extremely committed to doing so). The package also included breakfast, which was fantastic selection and service and normally would cost 20+ euros per person/per day. The room was nice. Not terribly spacious, but well designed, with a desk and small couch for relaxing. We really like the overall aesthetic. The front desk staff couldn't be nicer... Upon check in, they gave us a hand-written voucher good for two glasses of Champagne at one of their two bars, and also gave us a lot of recommendations/local information. As for the cons, they were minor, but should be mentioned. The hotel charges for WiFi but gives connected Internet away for free (in theory). The staff was really helpful and provided the proper cords so we could access the free Internet but the service didn't work in the room or in the lobby. regardless of how many cords we tried. However, they have a free business center with two Macs and so checking email was quite easy even without having access in the room. They also provided a one-time 24-hour internet password so we could access WiFi at no cost (after we told them the room connection wasn't working). I also have to mention that though the bathroom is very aesthetically pleasing and the toiletries were really high quality, both the tub and the sink had slowish drains. We ended up unscrewing the drain cap in the tub and it worked well after that, but the sink was very sluggish. We ended not wanting to work out, but partially that was because the \"gym\" was miniscule -- I think it was just a bench with weights, elliptical and bike, or very similar. The room was super small, but did have a TV and water, as I recall. The only other problem we ran into was when we went to the rooftop bar to redeem our Champagne voucher. The bartender working at the time spoke almost no English and didn't seem familiar with the voucher, so we ended up paying for those two drinks.

I tend to prefer modern hotels, with interesting design, though very often they turn up to be very unpractical and too cold. However, this cannot be said about Hotel Urban. Iwas actually quite pleasantly surprised by hotel's deisgn. It really is a beautiful hotel, which does feel warm and very pleasant to be in. I honestly loved and enjiyed the whole design concept. However, the main problem I found is that this design and hotel is either poorly maintained or in serious need of refreshing. Parquet floor was scratched, so were the walls, bathroom ceiling panels were misaligned and a bit rusty. The wall behind curtains seems never to have been painted at all. Although, these are serious misgivings it was not as bad as it might sound. But certainly had a serious imapct on the overall impression. Overall my room was certainly too small for a 5 star hotel (I was staying in a standard room). I found it to be quite OK, however it is definitely not up to a standard one associates with hotels of this category. It was a bit dark, which was not an issue for me, but the soundproofing was far from ideal. One could easily hear the noise coming from the street (Madrid is quite a noisy town, very late into the night). Staff was very cold and unwelcoming. Overall service is far below standards of 5 star hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cVery modern hotel at great location\u201d", "Author": "Globesailor", "ReviewID": "UR102863739", "Content": "If you like an extra modern hotel which gathers younger crowds, this is the place to be.

The Glass Bar at the entrance of the hotel is very popular with clients and visitors alike. I didn't have breakfast or dinner there, so I cannot rate the restaurant.

We navigated our way to the check in desk and stood there for at least a minute before someone greeted us and asked us for our credit card. I gave my card to the the person at the desk who dissapeared into a small room behind the desk. A few minutes later he appeared and stated one of our rooms was ready. We were ok with that as we had arrived early and check in was later in the day. The rooms, both the suite and the double room were nicely decorated. The bathrooms were also very nice. The beds were comfortable. There are 2 issues that i had with the rooms: 1. There are no alarm clocks or any other clocks that display the time in the rooms and 2. The rooms are very noisey. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor and we could hear the traffic outside. Traffic on the street outside the hotel is very heavy at all hours of the day and night. As a result of these two issues i would give this hotel 4 stars instead of 5. The Glass bar is very chic and a great place to just hang out. The restaraunt is also very nice and service is great. The hotel's location is very central to all the sites. You can walk alomost anywhere. The Parado is a 5 min walk.

On arriving back at the hotel later on, the duplex room still wasn't ready so we were offered to view a standard room instead. We had a look at both the options & decided that the duplex was really no better than the standard room - it's just a room that's split into an upstairs area - those stairs could be tricky after a few drinks! Or a pain unpacking your bags. We took the standard room at a reduced rate to the duplex & were perfectly happy with it. The only gripe we had was that the wardrobe was a nightmare for anyone trying to unpack/get to the other side of the bed as it is a sliding concertina type wardrobe that opens out into the room blocking the way to the far side of the bed and window & is pretty horrendous to move the door about. You just end up crawling across the bed! We had welcome drinks for us in the upstairs trendy rooftop bar with the swimming pool. It was a faboulous view up there & the pink champagne was very welcome! The service in the hotel is spot on with the reception staff being very helpful in giving us excellent restaurant recommendations. The waiter staff in the Glass Bar are also very efficient.

I didn't find outside noise a problem at all, the windows are double glazed and if closed you can't hear any noise from the street. Air conditioning worked very well.

However I did feel other guests should know that if they book a duplex suite it will be on the 'road' side and they will not get any sleep from the constant wail of police cars all night and motorbikes roaring by. I have absolutely no idea why the police cars need to put their sirens on in the middle of the night when there is virtually no traffic apart from a desire to wake the living dead. The hotel manager should be writing a formal letter to the relevant authorities to have this matter dealt with. It is just not necessary to have this level of noise paid for by the overstretched, over taxed Spanish population to have these buffoons racing around playing cops and robbers. We asked about the levels of crime because of the persistent wailings and aparently Madrid has very low levels of crime in the city so maybe they are just practising every night with the dim hope they can do it for real one day. The hotel is very stylish, and very suitable for city breaks and shopping trips. However I would really recommend you book and confirm a room away from the road otherwise you will need horse tranquilisers for a night's sleep. The pool is very small with just a few cramped sunbeds and chairs - with lots of people posing around the pool naval gazing. It is without a doubt a highlight though, as nowhere else in Madrid has one and after a hot day a splash in the pool is very welcome. The staff were very good in the pool bar and very helpful too. I thought the staff were actually quite warm and welcoming in general. We did feel that they were interested in our experience to some extent. I did find the room service breakfast waitress let the service down (hence the drop of a star) as she would stalk into our suite in the morning without a smile or a greeting and would literally dump our tray on the table, and would walk out again. We are used to five star hotels and service and expected a linen table cloth to be laid out and the breakfast to be served properly and with good manners as a bare minimum. In better hotels this would include papers and a pleasant experience. Having said this, I can not leave this note without referencing that the hotel room had style and was very spacious and clean. Clearly lots of thought has been given to the layout and the small details. The hotel is very seductive almost in its atmosphere and you will enjoy the thoughtful design.

Throughout the hotel are sculptures and artefacts which add to the sense of luxury. Rooms are very clean and well appointed. we had both a standrad double and a Junior Suite and I would certainly recommend the later for its larger size which is particularly noticeable in the bathroom which had a bath and separate shower. Housekeeping was first class and staff were very pleasant, friendly and attentive to detail. If you were looking for improvements an ipod dock would not be unreasonable in a hotel of this standard. We also missed tea and coffee making facilities whichare available in so many hotels. The rooftop pool is small but this is not surprising considering its location.

The room had an energy control slot that required a room key card. So the AC would turn off and the room get hot when we went out. We left a card in it and the cleaning staff removed it every single day!!!! I'm all for green initiatives, but if you are a 5 star hotel you really should at least have robust AC that can cool a room down if you are going to use such a system. Or a fan. And honestly why bother when the WHOLE hotel uses 100-200 watt halogen bulbs throughout? Hello.....ever heard of fluorescent lights? The bedside lights were little heaters in their own right. 3. The restaurant downstairs was closed for August. I know that family owned places do this in Spain, but I expected (a lot) better from a 5 star hotel. The restaurant on the roof was open but was restricted to a tasting menu that cost 90 euros (and was vastly inferior to the 70 euro tasting menus from the michelin starred Comer\u00e7 24 and Cinc Sentis restaurants in Barcelona). 4.

I shouldn't have worried. The check-in at the Urban could not have been better; efficient, polite and mercifully quick. Our room was a duplex suite (it had been on offer!).

The reception staff all speak fluent English (although I always make an effort to try and communicate in the native language where possible) and the check in process efficient. There if free internet access with two computers and a printer adjacent to the reception area for guests to use. The hotel's main restaurant \"Europa Deco\" is to the left of the main entrance (as you enter the front door of the hotel). Try the \"Red Tuna Fish Taster\" to start, if you like Sushi. Try the Beef for a main if you are a red meat lover. Delicious. We booked a standard room which was perfectly adequate for the two of us. It was clean, modern, well equipped and featured a superb rainforest shower in the bathroom leaving you refreshed and ready to hit the town. On the negative side, don't expect to get too much sleep as the rooms are far from soundproof and the noise created by the flow of traffic and people passing the outside the hotel is more or less constant at all hours of the day and night. However, you don't go to Madrid for peace and quiet! If you want the peaceful life, Madrid is not for you. Take a Madrid Vision sightseeing tour bus (Day Pass is 16 Euros per adult) from stop 12 for the Historical tour or stop 1 for the Modern Tour (see the interactive maps on the Madrid Vision website for details - www.madridvision.es/en/index.php). The Historical tour takes in the Royal Palace. On the modern tour you can get off at stop 7 and take a tour of Real Madrid Football Club's \"Estadio Santiago Bernabeu\" for 15 Euros per adult. The tour includes the museum and trophy room. You can sit in the seats in the President's Box then walk down the steps and sit on the heated leathers seats on the player's bench pitchside before going down the tunnel into the dressing room (only the visitor's/away team dressing room is open to the public at present). If it's a particularly hot and sunny day, visit the boating lake at the Parc De Retiro and hire a rowing boat for 4 Euros and 40 cents per boat (not per person). Each boat can sit up to 4 adults. Great value. For tapas and flamenco in the evening visit Casa Patas (www.casapatas.com). Advanced booking is recommended, however we just turned up at 11pm, ate some Tapas and booked our flamenco tickets (30 Euros per adult - but well worth it) which were delivered to our table. The flamenco show began at midnight (in the auditorium/back room at the rear of the restaurant) and lasted approximately two hours including a short interval. It was fantastic! You ill not be disappointed. Casa Patas a friendly, welcoming establishment and you can order drinks to your table at any time during the show.

While it is not what I would typically call a \"family hotel,\" they were incredibly accommodating, especially after Hotels.com messed up and booked 4 of us into 1 room. (Hotel Urban only allows 3 people to a room unless the 4th is in a crib.) The front desk staff was phenomenal and first moved us from the duplex room that we had booked (very cool concept), into a beautiful junior suite, and then borrowed a roll-away bed from another hotel to accommodate the 4th person in our group. So over the course of the 4-5 days we stayed at the hotel, we got a good view of a few different room types and service, and thought it was all outstanding. I love modern design, so I was very interested in this hotel, but the real reason I chose it was because it is one of only 3 hotels in central Madrid (near the Puerta del Sol, Museo del Prado, etc.) that has a pool. We were warned repeatedly about how hot Madrid would be in July (and had experienced intense heat in Seville and Grenada), so with the kids in tow I thought the pool was important. We ended up having great temperate weather while we were there -- it was in the mid 70s to 80 during our stay, so we didn't need the pool that much, which was good because it is very tiny! (Think two king size beds stacked end to end.) The hotel also attracts a very young male alternative lifestyle crowd, which was totally fine, but we got a more up-close look at that culture by the small pool. Now to the design -- I love modern but admittedly have been getting sick of the Ian Schrager \"dark hotel\" model. As a woman who travels alone for work a lot, I actually hated walking up to my room after 10pm at night in some of his hotels b/c I don't feel safe, as hip as they are. Hotel Urban gets around the muted light by putting a center glass-enclosed atrium with natural light in the middle of the hotel. Throughout the hotel there is actual art work ranging from Pacific Islander large-scale wood carvings, to a small Egyptian art museum in the basement. The rooms themselves are efficiently designed. We were first in a duplex standard hotel room -- a first for me. It has a bath, walk in closet and queen size bed with TV on entry level, and then a small staircase to a loft living room with TV and bar area upstairs. It was quite chic and gave a feeling of spaciousness, although the room was a bit hot (b/c the ceiling over the bed was slanted with skylights and automated shades.) The junior suite was a little more logical in design -- and L shaped space with the living area by the entryway, a huge glass enclosed bath suite (with automated privacy shades), and the bed area on the other side of the L. The only issue was that there is no window to the outside (the windows also looked into the atrium). Overall, we were very impressed with the design, definitely with the service after the web-partner messed up our reservation, the value, and the great central location.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nicosia, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cThe Staff is like a family...Bravo!!!\u201d", "Author": "TravellerCY", "ReviewID": "UR19709673", "Content": "I believe this is one of the best Hotels somebody should expect of finding on his way , while traveling.

Though this incident wasn't as such the direct fault of the hotel - but merely some prior visitors who must have been disgusting! This resulted in a disgusting bathtub, that wasn't cleaned despite the room was serviced by turn-down service, and we had serious doubts if this place was anywhere near 5 stars! The following 10 days we stayed in a suite - that provided us with much better bathroom experience and not as cramped surroundings, hence more comfortable living style. During this time we got a fair impression of the hotel. First of all what springs to mind is the lack of the minor but important details - such as a music system and optional down-pillows - which we normally expect from a 5 star hotel, that takes the pride of calling itself Grand Luxe. When staying for a longer period these are details that matters. First of all we want to acknowledge the staff that has really proven to live up to the 5 stars this hotel prides itself with. The doormen are always friendly and ready to assist from the moment they spot you (as regular guests). The casually clothed bell-boys/service staff are alert and on the toes at ALL times, providing the best of service one would expect from this category of hotels. Most front desk staff are very attentive, helpfull and proficient in English, however it is sad that some of the staff simply lacks English language skills, that one expects from an international 5 star hotel. This wouldn't matter if the staff were paired so that one would always be capable of understanding English on a basic level, unfortunately this wasn't always what we experienced. Simple requests such as asking for turn-down service were ignored / not followed up on. The very friendly and serviceminded front-desk manager and general manager will be looking into this though - and we do expect they will be changing some procedures in this matter! Besides from the small details, that really defines an exceptional five star hotel, this hotel is a smart and very comfortable right in the middle of Madrid, and we have no problem staying at again. General I would classify the hotel as five stars - but no where near Grand Luxe!

I would suggest trying to purchase them directly from the Plaza de Toro at Ventas or an official ticket outlet before asking the hotel to buy them for you.

Also had drinks in the rooftop terrace which is great for night time views of the city. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant on this occasion. However, on the second night of our stay we had dinner at a restaurant called Mumbai Masala (indian fusion cuisine) and it was genuinely the best indian food I have ever sampled.

I had a marvellous experience from the doorman, reception staff, hotel room, etc. For instance when the (one & only!) visitors computer was unavailable, reception staff let me use their own- at no cost. Location is great- just down the street is the Thyssen art collection. It's also located away from any busy streets or plazas, so relatively quiet. The room & bath room were very well fitted out with good quality furnishing & bed linen. Bit of a shame about the cheap TV- but then I wasn't really in Madrid to sit & watch TV. Just a couple of points to note. As it's a five star hotel the room rate is high, the drinks & food are also very high. So what! Just go outside to a nearby plaza & have a drink watching the world go by for at least 50% less. Secondly be aware that the rooftop pool/sitting area/bar becomes a \"nightclub\" after 10pm. So when I returned to my room at 12 midnight I was met by a long queue for the (only!!) two lifts in the building waiting to go up to the roof! This clearly needs effective management but is a minor gripe. Just ensure you don't get a high level room if you want a good night's sleep. I was on the third floor at the front & didn't hear a thing. Finally be aware that, in addition to the substantial external glazing system to the front of the building, there is an electronically operated blackout blind.

I booked this hotel for its location and the outside swimming pool - something not on offer with any other hotel I could find in Madrid with a 5* rating. First impressions were a little bit of a let-down, but the staff at reception were nice enough. One huge bonus was that the hotel had purchased some excellent seats for the next days bullfight for a measily 16 Euros per person. I'd tried booking seats direct via various Spanish websites and they were charging 79 Euros per person for the same seats, so 5* to the Urban. I can't honestly say we were terribly impressed with our suite - at 500 Euros a night I would have expected something much larger. In fact it wasn't what most people would call a suite at all. Next, up to the roof to see the pool. What a huge let-down. I'm sorry, but this ain't no swimming pool - it's a childrens plunge pool with people sat right on the edge of it - 4 people each side and it's crowded. Personally I don't want to be in such close proximity to people gawping at me as I take a dip. Note the word DIP - you can't swim in it and the water only comes up to the waist at both ends of the pool. In the evening we ate in the Europa restaurant - some very interesting food though I think the chef may be trying a little too hard to be arty farty with the presentation and layering of flavours. We found some of the waiters a little surly and possibly should have a smidgen more of a grasp of the English language, or perhaps I'm wrong?!

I wasn\u2019t aware of the massive tourism to Spain but it actually gets more tourists than the United States! It\u2019s #2 in the world with about 60 million tourists per year! I booked the Urban Hotel ahead of time as I read great reviews of it and I heard it was modern and upscale. I booked a Junior Suite which was pricey at 350\u20ac (u$s 472) per night. Very pricey but the room was very nice. I don\u2019t have any complaints at all. It was a holiday and I like to pamper myself on holidays. The cheapest room they had was 250 \u20ac (u$s 338) per night for a normal room. They have 96 rooms in this modern hotel. My room was very nice with a plasma TV, very nice marble bathroom and high ceilings. The area was very nice and convenient and near the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Metro station. My room was very quiet. The service was good as well. I read a negative review after my trip on Trip Advisor but I didn\u2019t have any complaints at all. I ordered room service very very late one night after coming back from a night out and they were prompt but the choice of menu isn\u2019t that complete with mostly sandwiches late at night. I didn\u2019t hit the bar but it was always lively late at night. If I had to do it over again I\u2019d probably just book a normal room. I met up with someone that I met that was staying here and I saw her room and it was fine. Personally I would have preferred the apartment that I booked. I found it an amazing value for the room but if you are a hotel person than definitely this would be a consideration. Anyway, I had no problems at all and the service was good at the Urban Hotel. I\u2019d recommend the normal room at 250\u20ac vs. the bigger room as you probably won\u2019t be in your room much. I was out and about all day.

Everything was high end - flat screen TV, cool lighting, etc. Bed was comfy. Climate control was perfect. 4) Service: front desk crew was always helpful, spoke very good English and were all professional. I did not make use of the concierge services, but upon arrival it was immediately offered to me. The doormen always wore a smile, and were pleasant. The only venue without friendly service was the Glass Bar - - had a lot of fun there, but the bartenders/staff were rude and indifferent.

From the minute you enter the front door, you are greeted by at least 2 people with smiling faces. The hotel's decor can be described as modern minimalist with a dash of zen. Although the rooms are small by American standards, the furnishings, the color schemes, the art pieces, the LCD tv plus the floor to ceiling windows with automatic drapes make you feel like you're at a mini suite at the Palms in Vegas. The vibe of the whole hotel is young, chic and hip. The club music that's filtered through speakers around the entire hotel is a nice touch that makes one feel energized in the morning. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is good although the small selection can get old.

Location is excellent, equidistant to the Prado and the main shopping area at Sol metro. (If you arrive by Metro, Sevilla is the nearest station - walk down one of the side streets to Jeronimo where the hotel is.) There were a few gripes. Housekeeping walked into our room one morning despite the 'do not disturb' sign. On Sunday they delivered exactly the same issue of the same newspaper as on Saturday, since that paper did not have a Sunday edition!! The 'free' morning coffee tray came with an unexpected Euro 3 room service charge. And our suite had no daylight, since it overlooked the internal atrium.
